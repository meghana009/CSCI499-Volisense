nevada exceeded plan as the cortez hills open pit ramps down veladero posted encouraging improvements and pueblo viejo progressed its expansion project and benefited from operational efficiencies led by kibali the african operations made a good start to the year and the copper operations delivered significant improvements key growth projects were on track and greenfields and brownfields exploration were augmenting reserves and identifying new opportunities we have gone a long way towards integrating the organizations streamlining the processes and ensuring that all the sites have the geological operational and technical capability to meet their business objectives bristow said we re also well advanced in establishing our new joint venture with newmont which has been named nevada gold mines the organizational structures are being finalized and we re working together with newmont to realize the synergies and cost reduction opportunities offered by the joint venture which is scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter bristow said the assets that did not pass barrick s strategic filters had been identified and once optimized would be brought to account in a way that would recognize the importance to the remaining stakeholders with the objective of being well advanced by mid 2020 management was also dealing with some legacy challenges including the long stand off between acacia and the tanzanian government given our solid operational performance for the first quarter barrick is on track to deliver against its plans for the year considering the shortage of good assets and the industry s underinvestment in its own future we believe we are well positioned as the industry s value leader barrick stands apart from the rest of the industry on four counts the quality of our assets our significant potential for portfolio optimization the very real synergies that we expect to be delivered by nevada gold mines and our superior exploration and pipeline of development efforts bristow said this quarter has seen a great start for our first year as the new and improved barrick and i am confident that we are well on the way to achieving our strategic objective of becoming the world s most valued gold mining business it is our commitment to get there by finding developing owning and operating the best assets in our industry with the best

international access code 3107 q1 delivers a new barrick made fit for purpose since barrick and randgold were formally united on the first working day of this year new management has moved swiftly to engineer a business capable of achieving its creators vision of being the world s most valued gold company the process started well before the deal was consummated with teams from both sides sitting down together to define new barrick s goals and plot the best routes to achieving them they emerged from these meetings with a clear strategy and action plans as well as a shared vision of a business with a leaner management structure and a more agile flexible management style getting the right people in the right places was our first priority says president and chief executive officer mark bristow we started with a new executive leadership team of people with the right skills and attitude at the corporate level supported by a slimmed down technical financial commercial communication and administration team they now exercise full oversight of all the operations this process was duplicated in each of barrick s three geographical regions where senior executive teams have been installed in line with a new policy of moving people skills and decision making out of the corporate office and into the operations to make sure everyone is focused on the new expected outcomes and their responsibilities we have held strategy reviews and team effectiveness exercises throughout the organization bristow says we ve also made sure that each site has the geological operational and technical abilities to meet our business objectives and have introduced the randgold system of parallel workstreams that are integrated horizontally for optimal efficiency at the same time we are upgrading and integrating the digital and information systems throughout the organization to provide managers with real time data for planning and decision making the corporate structure has been streamlined with the toronto office now occupying a single floor with approximately 70 people the process of refining and rationalizing the structure of the business is continuing at the site offices it s important to note that this is not a cost cutting exercise it s been designed to ensure that the best people are in the right places bristow says with barrick now looking and acting like the modern gold business we envisaged the merger is delivering all that we expected from it with our house in order we can now start looking at the abundance of opportunities that are within our grasp nevada is the base of barrick s business and its wealth of possibilities will be expanded by the creation of the joint venture there with newmont goldcorp but barrick is also looking at other prospects to the north and into canada bristow said africa is a high risk high reward destination which holds two of barrick s tier one9 gold mines kibali and loulo gounkoto and the promise of more to come but those assets which do not fit the portfolio profile are likely to be divested the most exciting growth opportunities are in latin america where the expansion of pueblo viejo is expected to maintain the mine s tier one status for years to come there is also the potential to work on adding life and lifting efficiencies at veladero as well as rebuilding our exploration capabilities across chile argentina and peru as we address some of the significant legacy challenges we face and then there is porgera in papua new guinea where we are in the process of renewing the mining license and which offers tier one potential the new barrick is off to a strong start but there is a long road ahead of us and much still to be done to achieve our goal of becoming the most valued gold company by having the best people employing the best skills systems and structures to extract sustainable returns for our owners and partners from the best assets bristow says strong new sustainability drive sustainability a core component of the management philosophy of both barrick and randgold has been given an even higher priority by the merged business one of the first appointments post merger was that of grant beringer in the new position of group sustainability executive at the same time an environmental social and health and safety oversight committee chaired by the president and ceo was established to monitor review and update sustainability policies and practices throughout the organization the energetic new sustainability team has embarked on an extensive stakeholder engagement exercise designed to understand the issues and devise mutually acceptable solutions site level leadership has been involved in this process and sustainability is now a key reporting line on barrick s weekly executive committee call as well as a dedicated agenda item at the monthly management and quarterly board meetings at the heart of barrick s sustainability vision is a commitment to contribute to the social and economic development of our host countries and communities last year the combined organization generated more than 8 2 billion in economic value across 16 countries through payments to governments employees and suppliers and through community investments beringer says while the two companies achieved much we acknowledge that barrick still faces significant legacy issues relating to community and tailings disposal issues at porgera litigation and environmental challenges relating to pascua lama and a checkered environmental past at veladero but we are exploring all options to manage and mitigate these risks adds president and chief executive officer mark bristow we are pledged to deliver long term benefits to our host countries and communities through open and ongoing stakeholder engagement and a commitment to genuine partnership geology mining s bedrock geology is the starting point of all mining ventures argues barrick mineral resource management and evaluation executive rod quick and it also plays an integral part at every stage of a project s life from discovery through evaluation and development to mine design and operation while barrick was focused on driving down debt its business model was focused on free cash flow with the debt situation now stabilized that model is now driven by the optimal exploitation of the orebodies this shift in strategy has been signaled by the appointment of mineral resource managers at all the mines it all starts with an understanding of the mineralization controls of each orebody and using this information in the geological modelling to project the grade geometry and geotechnical characteristics of the orebody after all this is our revenue base and it is essential that we know it well he says using this knowledge the geologists can work with their mining and metallurgical colleagues to develop a mining plan that will extract the ore with minimum dilution and process it with the smallest possible recovery loss mining is a consumptive industry and replacing depleted ounces requires a deep understanding of the orebodies and the ability to replace the gold we mine through brownfield extensions and new discoveries the new approach includes reconciliation programs between the orebody models and what we actually extract as well as operational and financial forecasts there are also grade control programs which allow geologists and mining engineers to model the geology geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics ahead of the mining areas this allows us to optimally design the ore extraction and develop reliable metallurgical models to optimize ore processing geology is not a discrete discipline it needs to be integrated into a multi skilled team making a contribution throughout the life of a mine for that operation to be sustainably profitable says quick exploration successes boost inventory barrick s exploration programs have two goals to replace the gold it depletes by mining and to discover its next tier one9 mine in nevada the combination of the fourmile discovery which is expected to eventually be consolidated with the goldrush project is shaping up as the portfolio s next mega mine since the high grade maiden resource was reported widely spaced drilling beyond the deposit footprint has intersected high grades in multiple directions signaling significant growth potential drilling resumed in january and funding may be increased to continue scoping extensions in the meantime exploration and project teams are working together to maximize the value from a consolidated and optimized fourmile goldrush fourmile and goldrush are classic carlin style orebodies of the kind that has made this region one of the world s most prospective another is turquoise ridge adjacent to the twin creeks mine and included in the nevada joint venture which we anticipate is also on the way to becoming a tier one9 asset we feel strongly that nevada still holds enormous potential for more major discoveries says rob krcmarov executive vice president exploration and growth over in africa the extensions to the recently discovered 11000 lode at kibali and the increasing continuity and confirmation of the down plunge extensions to the geology and mineralization at gorumbwa is not only supporting kibali s high production profile but is also expected to extend the life of the mine like nevada the democratic republic of congo is mineral rich but largely unexplored and it too has a great potential for new mines in addition to the gold prolific west african birimian and its counterpart the guyana shield in latin america along with our presence and growing exploration focus along the andean trend in chile argentina and peru barrick and randgold have a history of building shareholder value through discovery and development of world class gold mines the combination under barrick brings two industry leading exploration teams together and given our presence in some of the best gold belts in the world we are uniquely positioned to continue that legacy says president and chief executive officer mark bristow kibali makes strong start to 2019 kibali ranked among the world s top 10 gold mines has made a strong start to 2019 after setting a new production record last year says barrick president and chief executive officer mark bristow barrick operates kibali which is a joint venture with anglogold ashanti and the congolese parastatal sokimo speaking at a briefing for local media and stakeholders bristow said kibali was continuing to break records en route to its 2019 guidance of 750 000 ounces the latest being the 285 000 tonnes of ore hoisted through the shaft in march throughput and recovery remained at or above nameplate levels and kibali continued to add new technology to its autonomous mining operation a field in which it is already an industry leader with kibali producing at this rate we are intensifying our focus on reserve and resource replacement drilling is targeting the extensions of the kcd and gorumbwa complex of orebodies along the 30km gold bearing kz structure and the western extensions of the kibali graben this has confirmed that there is a substantial potential for replenishing the reserve and resource base bristow said kibali is one of five tier one9 gold mines in the barrick stable and it is an outstanding example of barrick s commitment to partnerships this is demonstrated by the constructive relationship between its three shareholders as well as by its continuing investment in the local economy during the past quarter the mine spent 38 million with congolese contractors and the recently initiated durba road upgrade project is being undertaken by 100 congolese owned and operated contractors which kibali developed bristow noted that at their meeting in washington dc earlier this month the congolese president his excellency felix tshisekedi and barrick executive chairman john thornton had confirmed their joint commitment to a partnership designed to develop the country s gold mining industry follow up meetings held in country between president felix tshisekedi bristow and their respective executive teams focused on partnership initiatives and strategies to support the continued growth of the mining industry for the benefit of investors the congolese nation and other stakeholders the drc government is one of our most important partners and we look forward to working with them to create an economic climate capable of attracting large and long term investments such as the one we made in kibali this requires a mining code which equitably balances the interests of the state and the capital providers and allows both to participate fairly in the value creation that the mining industry offers we are and will continue to engage with the government and administration on the issues around the code introduced last year he said appendix 1 2019 operating and capital

nevada exceeded plan as the cortez hills open pit ramps down veladero posted encouraging improvements and pueblo viejo progressed its expansion project and benefited from operational efficiencies led by kibali the african operations made a good start to the year and the copper operations delivered significant improvements key growth projects were on track and greenfields and brownfields exploration were augmenting reserves and identifying new opportunities we have gone a long way towards integrating the organizations streamlining the processes and ensuring that all the sites have the geological operational and technical capability to meet their business objectives bristow said we re also well advanced in establishing our new joint venture with newmont which has been named nevada gold mines the organizational structures are being finalized and we re working together with newmont to realize the synergies and cost reduction opportunities offered by the joint venture which is scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter bristow said the assets that did not pass barrick s strategic filters had been identified and once optimized would be brought to account in a way that would recognize the importance to the remaining stakeholders with the objective of being well advanced by mid 2020 management was also dealing with some legacy challenges including the long stand off between acacia and the tanzanian government given our solid operational performance for the first quarter barrick is on track to deliver against its plans for the year considering the shortage of good assets and the industry s underinvestment in its own future we believe we are well positioned as the industry s value leader barrick stands apart from the rest of the industry on four counts the quality of our assets our significant potential for portfolio optimization the very real synergies that we expect to be delivered by nevada gold mines and our superior exploration and pipeline of development efforts bristow said this quarter has seen a great start for our first year as the new and improved barrick and i am confident that we are well on the way to achieving our strategic objective of becoming the world s most valued gold mining business it is our commitment to get there by finding developing owning and operating the best assets in our industry with the best

international access code 3107 q1 delivers a new barrick made fit for purpose since barrick and randgold were formally united on the first working day of this year new management has moved swiftly to engineer a business capable of achieving its creators vision of being the world s most valued gold company the process started well before the deal was consummated with teams from both sides sitting down together to define new barrick s goals and plot the best routes to achieving them they emerged from these meetings with a clear strategy and action plans as well as a shared vision of a business with a leaner management structure and a more agile flexible management style getting the right people in the right places was our first priority says president and chief executive officer mark bristow we started with a new executive leadership team of people with the right skills and attitude at the corporate level supported by a slimmed down technical financial commercial communication and administration team they now exercise full oversight of all the operations this process was duplicated in each of barrick s three geographical regions where senior executive teams have been installed in line with a new policy of moving people skills and decision making out of the corporate office and into the operations to make sure everyone is focused on the new expected outcomes and their responsibilities we have held strategy reviews and team effectiveness exercises throughout the organization bristow says we ve also made sure that each site has the geological operational and technical abilities to meet our business objectives and have introduced the randgold system of parallel workstreams that are integrated horizontally for optimal efficiency at the same time we are upgrading and integrating the digital and information systems throughout the organization to provide managers with real time data for planning and decision making the corporate structure has been streamlined with the toronto office now occupying a single floor with approximately 70 people the process of refining and rationalizing the structure of the business is continuing at the site offices it s important to note that this is not a cost cutting exercise it s been designed to ensure that the best people are in the right places bristow says with barrick now looking and acting like the modern gold business we envisaged the merger is delivering all that we expected from it with our house in order we can now start looking at the abundance of opportunities that are within our grasp nevada is the base of barrick s business and its wealth of possibilities will be expanded by the creation of the joint venture there with newmont goldcorp but barrick is also looking at other prospects to the north and into canada bristow said africa is a high risk high reward destination which holds two of barrick s tier one9 gold mines kibali and loulo gounkoto and the promise of more to come but those assets which do not fit the portfolio profile are likely to be divested the most exciting growth opportunities are in latin america where the expansion of pueblo viejo is expected to maintain the mine s tier one status for years to come there is also the potential to work on adding life and lifting efficiencies at veladero as well as rebuilding our exploration capabilities across chile argentina and peru as we address some of the significant legacy challenges we face and then there is porgera in papua new guinea where we are in the process of renewing the mining license and which offers tier one potential the new barrick is off to a strong start but there is a long road ahead of us and much still to be done to achieve our goal of becoming the most valued gold company by having the best people employing the best skills systems and structures to extract sustainable returns for our owners and partners from the best assets bristow says strong new sustainability drive sustainability a core component of the management philosophy of both barrick and randgold has been given an even higher priority by the merged business one of the first appointments post merger was that of grant beringer in the new position of group sustainability executive at the same time an environmental social and health and safety oversight committee chaired by the president and ceo was established to monitor review and update sustainability policies and practices throughout the organization the energetic new sustainability team has embarked on an extensive stakeholder engagement exercise designed to understand the issues and devise mutually acceptable solutions site level leadership has been involved in this process and sustainability is now a key reporting line on barrick s weekly executive committee call as well as a dedicated agenda item at the monthly management and quarterly board meetings at the heart of barrick s sustainability vision is a commitment to contribute to the social and economic development of our host countries and communities last year the combined organization generated more than 8 2 billion in economic value across 16 countries through payments to governments employees and suppliers and through community investments beringer says while the two companies achieved much we acknowledge that barrick still faces significant legacy issues relating to community and tailings disposal issues at porgera litigation and environmental challenges relating to pascua lama and a checkered environmental past at veladero but we are exploring all options to manage and mitigate these risks adds president and chief executive officer mark bristow we are pledged to deliver long term benefits to our host countries and communities through open and ongoing stakeholder engagement and a commitment to genuine partnership geology mining s bedrock geology is the starting point of all mining ventures argues barrick mineral resource management and evaluation executive rod quick and it also plays an integral part at every stage of a project s life from discovery through evaluation and development to mine design and operation while barrick was focused on driving down debt its business model was focused on free cash flow with the debt situation now stabilized that model is now driven by the optimal exploitation of the orebodies this shift in strategy has been signaled by the appointment of mineral resource managers at all the mines it all starts with an understanding of the mineralization controls of each orebody and using this information in the geological modelling to project the grade geometry and geotechnical characteristics of the orebody after all this is our revenue base and it is essential that we know it well he says using this knowledge the geologists can work with their mining and metallurgical colleagues to develop a mining plan that will extract the ore with minimum dilution and process it with the smallest possible recovery loss mining is a consumptive industry and replacing depleted ounces requires a deep understanding of the orebodies and the ability to replace the gold we mine through brownfield extensions and new discoveries the new approach includes reconciliation programs between the orebody models and what we actually extract as well as operational and financial forecasts there are also grade control programs which allow geologists and mining engineers to model the geology geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics ahead of the mining areas this allows us to optimally design the ore extraction and develop reliable metallurgical models to optimize ore processing geology is not a discrete discipline it needs to be integrated into a multi skilled team making a contribution throughout the life of a mine for that operation to be sustainably profitable says quick exploration successes boost inventory barrick s exploration programs have two goals to replace the gold it depletes by mining and to discover its next tier one9 mine in nevada the combination of the fourmile discovery which is expected to eventually be consolidated with the goldrush project is shaping up as the portfolio s next mega mine since the high grade maiden resource was reported widely spaced drilling beyond the deposit footprint has intersected high grades in multiple directions signaling significant growth potential drilling resumed in january and funding may be increased to continue scoping extensions in the meantime exploration and project teams are working together to maximize the value from a consolidated and optimized fourmile goldrush fourmile and goldrush are classic carlin style orebodies of the kind that has made this region one of the world s most prospective another is turquoise ridge adjacent to the twin creeks mine and included in the nevada joint venture which we anticipate is also on the way to becoming a tier one9 asset we feel strongly that nevada still holds enormous potential for more major discoveries says rob krcmarov executive vice president exploration and growth over in africa the extensions to the recently discovered 11000 lode at kibali and the increasing continuity and confirmation of the down plunge extensions to the geology and mineralization at gorumbwa is not only supporting kibali s high production profile but is also expected to extend the life of the mine like nevada the democratic republic of congo is mineral rich but largely unexplored and it too has a great potential for new mines in addition to the gold prolific west african birimian and its counterpart the guyana shield in latin america along with our presence and growing exploration focus along the andean trend in chile argentina and peru barrick and randgold have a history of building shareholder value through discovery and development of world class gold mines the combination under barrick brings two industry leading exploration teams together and given our presence in some of the best gold belts in the world we are uniquely positioned to continue that legacy says president and chief executive officer mark bristow kibali makes strong start to 2019 kibali ranked among the world s top 10 gold mines has made a strong start to 2019 after setting a new production record last year says barrick president and chief executive officer mark bristow barrick operates kibali which is a joint venture with anglogold ashanti and the congolese parastatal sokimo speaking at a briefing for local media and stakeholders bristow said kibali was continuing to break records en route to its 2019 guidance of 750 000 ounces the latest being the 285 000 tonnes of ore hoisted through the shaft in march throughput and recovery remained at or above nameplate levels and kibali continued to add new technology to its autonomous mining operation a field in which it is already an industry leader with kibali producing at this rate we are intensifying our focus on reserve and resource replacement drilling is targeting the extensions of the kcd and gorumbwa complex of orebodies along the 30km gold bearing kz structure and the western extensions of the kibali graben this has confirmed that there is a substantial potential for replenishing the reserve and resource base bristow said kibali is one of five tier one9 gold mines in the barrick stable and it is an outstanding example of barrick s commitment to partnerships this is demonstrated by the constructive relationship between its three shareholders as well as by its continuing investment in the local economy during the past quarter the mine spent 38 million with congolese contractors and the recently initiated durba road upgrade project is being undertaken by 100 congolese owned and operated contractors which kibali developed bristow noted that at their meeting in washington dc earlier this month the congolese president his excellency felix tshisekedi and barrick executive chairman john thornton had confirmed their joint commitment to a partnership designed to develop the country s gold mining industry follow up meetings held in country between president felix tshisekedi bristow and their respective executive teams focused on partnership initiatives and strategies to support the continued growth of the mining industry for the benefit of investors the congolese nation and other stakeholders the drc government is one of our most important partners and we look forward to working with them to create an economic climate capable of attracting large and long term investments such as the one we made in kibali this requires a mining code which equitably balances the interests of the state and the capital providers and allows both to participate fairly in the value creation that the mining industry offers we are and will continue to engage with the government and administration on the issues around the code introduced last year he said appendix 1 2019 operating and capital

when talk turns to cities or states that lie at the heart of regional or global trade certain names and places spring inexorably to mind in the late 20th century germany japan and the united states dominated global trade before that it was the turn of the commercially oriented british empire receding further into antiquity the names of athens and aden calicut and colombo siraf and singapore spring to mind then of course there is china the sovereign giant that dominated global trade until the 18th century and looks ready to do so again yet such lists tend to overlook a region and more specifically a country that for more than 16 centuries lay at the crossroads of commerce between 130 bce when china s han dynasty formally opened trade routes to the west and 1453 ad when the ottoman empire closed them the silk road was the greatest trading network the world had ever seen paper spices gunpowder and naturally silk flowed west from china and the littoral states of the pacific while new technologies like glass making invented in the islamic world spread east the old silk road wasn t a point to point affair it ruptured and reconnected multiple times along its route interconnecting with key rivers the indus in modern day pakistan and the tigris and euphrates which empty into the persian gulf but at the heart of the silk road stood a handful of trading hubs rich oasis cities like bukhara samarkand fergana and andijan all located in modern day uzbekistan a country with a troubled and turbulent past that if all goes to plan it hopes to transform into a bright and brilliant future hermit state to understand how far uzbekistan had fallen off the trade map it is important to understand its recent history after the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 it declared independence but unlike some regional sovereigns notably the more external facing kazakhstan it shrank into itself choosing to fear rather than embrace the outside world under islam karimov a tyrant president who ruled with an iron fist it became central asia s hermit state regularly ranked low by democracy watchdog freedom house alongside north korea on issues such as political freedoms and civil rights most foreign investors wisely gave it a wide berth and uzbekistan slowly and systematically fell behind its regional peers according to data from unctad foreign direct investment as a share of gross fixed capital was 6 8 in the three full years before the global financial crisis of 2008 a time when the price of everything from coal to copper to oil and gas resources found in abundant supply beneath uzbekistan s rich soil were going through the roof compare that with kazakhstan where fdi as a share of gross fixed capital during the same pre crisis period came in at 26 9 yet for a long time that was as good as it got for political leaders in tashkent inward investment fell steadily through the post crisis era hitting a nadir in 2017 when uzbekistan attracted just 96m in foreign capital the same year just shy of 40bn worth of total fdi flowed into the five nation states that make up central asia in the quarter century to the end of 2016 according to world bank data kazakhstan attracted 52bn in total fdi against just 9 6bn for uzbekistan a new dawn perceptions began to change in 2016 in september of that year karimov died and was replaced by long standing prime minister shavkat mirziyoyev the new president quickly got to work pushing through reforms that included easing visa requirements and making the uzbek som fully convertible azim akhmedkhadjaev chair of the state committee for investments said it promised to usher in a new epoch of intense development in the wake of the presidential elections of december 2018 mirziyoyev worked hard to burnish uzbekistan s badly tarnished image meeting corporates and investors and leading policymakers in delhi and beijing tokyo and washington he applied to restart talks to join the world trade organisation stalled for a decade and embarked on lucrative investment trips to russia india china and the united arab emirates seven special economic zones were created offering favourable tax breaks to investors the ebrd re opened its office in tashkent after a decade s absence from the country since september 2017 the european multilateral has signed and started 23 onshore projects financing hotels power stations and wastewater facilities and extending credit to local lenders including ipak yuli bank ipoteka bank and davr bank mirziyoyev is peering east and west in his quest for everything from working capital to institutional and geopolitical support this makes good sense to the east stands china whose belt road initiative bri also known as the new silk road aims in the long term to convey billions of dollars of goods a year priced china hopes in its currency the renminbi overland by road and rail between east asia and europe for uzbekistan s president the initiative could not have arrived at a better time china s desire for the bulk of its trade to bypass the us controlled strait of malacca works to uzbekistan s favour the new eurasian land bridge and the china central asia west asia economic corridor two of the bri s chief trade routes pass through uzbekistan the former officially terminates at the dutch seaport of rotterdam while the latter comes to a full stop on the shores of the mediterranean for both routes to operate at full capacity china knows there cannot be any missing links that explains its drive to channel capital into a host of key infrastructure projects across the country a new and fully electrified 5bn rail line linking western china with tashkent is already underway the first phase of which is funded by a 400m loan from the export import bank of china chexim the two countries are working on a host of other projects ranging from water management to logistics to astronomy in june mirziyoyev is slated to attend the next shanghai cooperation organisation summit which brings together the leaders of china russia and the central asian states and is set to take place in tashkent for the first time some nation states fearing the consequences of rising levels of national debt are reluctant to accept funding from chexim and china s other big development lender china development bank but so far at least uzbekistan a country long on ambition and short on high quality infrastructure and investment partners is not one of them looking west then there is the vast single market at the western end of the belt road in february uzbekistan and the european union held the first round of talks on an enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement which aims to boost two way trade with the eu later this year mirziyoyev is scheduled to visit belgium and switzerland his administration continues to ease travel restrictions on tourists and business travellers in february 2019 uzbekistan said it would allow visa free travel to the country for visitors from 45 countries including the uk italy france germany singapore japan and austria zones of influence china history tell us is one of the most inventive of countries over the centuries it has given us everything from paper to gunpowder tea to silk and the compass to movable type printing but perhaps no invention is more relevant in the modern economic and financial world than the special economic zone sez the secret to their success lies in context china was judicious from the outset setting out a master plan but infusing it with enough institutional flexibility its more advanced cities shenzhen shanghai started the ball rolling focusing on heavy manufacturing clothes shoes plastics as these sezs moved upstream into higher margin goods and services robotics ai biotechnology old style manufacturing moved inland to second or third tier cities or increasingly overseas china was careful not to build too many sezs thus avoiding a surfeit of price competition but it promised to move heaven and earth to keep its key investors happy and usually delivered foreign corporates set down productive roots often for decades developed and developing nations recognising the model s simple elegant effectiveness sought to replicate it now uzbekistan a fast growing country rapidly opening up to the outside world has jumped on board sezs of all types and sizes are springing up across the central asian state with the aim of sucking in foreign capital and giving the country s 33m people a better and richer life in october 2018 president shavkat mirziyoyev set out plans to build seven special zones dotted around the country including an sez in sirdrayo an area located between tashkent and samarkand that will offer corporate tax breaks and free investors from the cost of paying a land tax other special zones in tashkent samarkand bukhara and the eastern fergana valley are springing up focusing on industries including logistics agribusiness light industry pharmaceutical production and tourism an e visa scheme introduced in 2018 will be extended in the second half of the year to cover nationals from 76 countries and will permit double and multiple entries a boon for regular business travellers it seems to be working according to data from the foreign affairs ministry 5 3m people visited the country in 2018 more than double the previous year s figure of 2 6m air travel once costly and rare is booming as the sector opens up uzbekistan airways the national flag carrier is adding new routes to europe and asia and expanding its roster of airbus a320s and boeing 787 dreamliners in 2017 the president inked a 250m loan from export import bank of korea to finance the construction of a new terminal at islam karimov tashkent international airport set to open in 2021 it will be able to process 3m 4m passengers a year and accommodate up to 36 aircraft plans are also under way to convert tashkent vostochny airport a military and cargo facility to the east of the capital into a business aviation hub by 2020 a project slated to cost 150m thanks to projects like these and dozens of others either planned or pending a once isolated country is slowly being stitched together global mining and energy firms from europe asia and the americas are engaging with the government with the aim of forging joint ventures with leading corporates and of exploiting vast reserves of energy metals and cotton better infrastructure again is key to its success in from the cold uzbekistan is opening up fast financially and economically with foreign portfolio investors notably funds that specialise in unlocking investable assets in frontier markets taking their first tentative onshore steps the tashkent stock market s free float is a mere 300m but it is set to grow as more firms in the private and the public sector sell shares to local and foreign institutional investors a key moment in the country s capital markets development took place in february when the republic of uzbekistan sold 1bn of eurobonds to international investors leading local corporates are set to follow suit with oil and gas group uzbekneftegas tipped to print its inaugural corporate bond by the end of 2019 and while foreign lenders are in most cases barred from buying stakes in uzbek banks those restrictions are widely expected to be removed or eased in the coming years looking ahead there are many good reasons for investors to put their money to work in the central asian state china is ploughing untold capital into infrastructure projects that will link beijing with europe via one of the youngest and fastest growing economies anywhere in the developing world in its latest world economic outlook published in april 2019 the imf tipped economic output to expand by between 5 6 every year through the mid 2020s and pointed to a host of other positive macro economic signs including narrowing deficits and easing inflation it seems that after years of self imposed isolation uzbekistan is finally to the delight of global investors corporates lenders and policymakers coming in from the cold russia wanes china rises for decades after the collapse of the soviet union russia s influence in central asia endured then as now russia saw the area as part of its near abroad or natural sphere of influence it maintained a strong military presence in the likes of uzbekistan and financed projects aimed at among other things cutting poverty and fortifying society the collective security treaty organisation csto an intergovernmental military alliance founded in 1992 may have been regional in theory but it was heavily reliant on russian minds and money in 2014 russia unveiled the eurasian economic union eeu in the hope of permanently binding the region together economically and financially russian influence remains but there is little doubt it has waned sharply in recent years across central asia in general and more specifically in uzbekistan when islam karimov a hard line dictator died in 2016 and was succeeded by current president shavkat mirziyoyev russia wasted little time reminding the new guy who was boss one of mirziyoyev s first official trips abroad was to moscow where he signed a slew of energy food and military deals worth 15bn yet mirziyoyev has been more than willing to tread his own path his predecessor withdrew from the csto in 2012 and the current president has evinced no desire to re engage militarily with russia nor does he show any wish to join the dead in the water eeu a paper tiger of a multilateral project russia s dilemma is exacerbated by the fact that there is now a more powerful and ambitious superpower operating in its own backyard regional sovereigns that once instinctively turned to russia for funding and protection now court china coveting its diplomatic strength and seemingly limitless capital reserves chinese development banks operating under the aegis of president xi jinping s flagship belt road initiative are financing and facilitating much needed infrastructure building airports highways and new rail lines in november 2018 while attending the second belt road forum in beijing mirziyoyev revived plans for a high speed railway linking the eastern uzbek city of fergana with xinjiang in western china a few months earlier he returned from his maiden overland voyage to the people s republic having inked dozens of deals worth 23bn spanning sectors from oil refining to power plants and chemicals to agriculture once the region s primary trading partner russia now ranks second or lower in many markets uzbekistan included the country posted exports of 11 5bn in 2017 according to data from the cia world factbook of which more than half mostly in the form of energy and minerals was shipped west to switzerland and east to china with russia accounting for a tenth of the total in 2017 china overtook russia to become for the first time uzbekistan s largest source of imports economic winter the long slow decline in russian influence is easy to explain russia s economy grew by an annual average of 0 4 over the half decade to the end of 2018 events such as the 2014 annexation of crimea and the subsequent rouble crisis acted as a destabilising force in a region desperate for financial economic and political stability western sanctions did not fatally undermine russia but they did remind regional nation states like uzbekistan that russia would always march to the beat of its own drum by contrast china with its constant and comfortable refrain of trade and more trade came to appear to be a far more reliable long term commercial partner china s belt road initiative is everywhere in central asia notes gunter deuber head of economics fixed income and foreign exchange research at raiffeisen bank international you see it in trade and cropping up in fdi data across the region and the stark truth is that russia has completely lost out central asian states will always seek to manage the balance of their relations with both countries but china matters far more these days and russia matters far less

of chinese negotiators arrives in washington to continue talks toward a deal and as the trump administration sets a hair trigger on a major tariff escalation set to fire at the stroke of midnight friday but an agreement that seemed close at hand as recently as last week now looks like it will be significantly tougher to forge at least in the immediate term trump administration officials blame the chinese for walking away from their commitment to enshrine structural changes in their law reuters reports that last friday chinese negotiators submitted a raft of edits to a draft agreement that reversed pledges to make legal changes on core american demands including theft of u s intellectual property and trade secrets forced technology transfers competition policy access to financial services and currency manipulation that appears to have placed considerable distance between the two sides advertisement i would look at this week as a check the box meeting one source tells me of this week s negotiations the chinese are going to show up and focus more on press statements than what s accomplished at the table and things will play out over the next couple of weeks on top of the disagreement over the legal status of chinese concessions the wall street journal s chao deng and lingling wei report the two sides remain at odds over china s subsides to domestic companies and

they would but xi has his own internal pressures he s feeling pressure at home so he s starting to back away advertisement one potentially encouraging signal from across the pacific beijing is still sending chinese vice premier liu he its top negotiator to washington this week a move in doubt after president trump s sunday tweets threatening to massively dial up tariffs to me the fact that the chinese are still coming with liu he at the head means there s some possibility they could have a marathon session on thursday break through whatever these problems are and get themselves somewhere says claire reade senior counsel at arnold porter in washington and a former assistant u s trade representative for china reade presented the bull case for the recent chinese balk floating the possibility it represented one last concession to the hawk side in china to gauge the u s reaction it seems conceivable that the chinese didn t expect the u s to respond with such vehemence sometimes

growing debt problems and perpetual monetary stimulus have created heavily distorted financial markets moving forward a loss of confidence in central bankerâ s ability to foster growth could lead to a currency crisis gold gld would stand to increase substantially in such an event as it may regain its monetary premium introduction money as a general subject is likely the most important concept one must understand when entering the discipline of economics much of its function and purpose can easily be seen within any economy dating back as far as civilization itself today there is virtually no individual who is not to some extent familiar with money and its role it would thus seem trivial to pose the question â what is money and what is its purpose â as simple as it may appear upon further inspection one will find that the question is in its nature extremely difficult as a student studying economics this question or some form of it appeared repeatedly it is taught that money is used to serve three vital roles a store of value a medium of exchange and a unit of account from a historical perspective it is taught that the progression of money generally begins with barter next adopting a commodity based form of money before eventually graduating to the pinnacle of financial innovation the fiat currency these principles taught as if fundamental fact instead of theory made intuitive sense i felt generally no desire to question them or the current systems implementation of them it thus came as a great surprise to find that some of these concepts had fundamental flaws while moneyâ s three functions can generally be agreed upon its history within society has often been greatly distorted for one there is no substantial evidence that barter ever served as a primary means of transaction hunter gatherer tribes of yesterday and even some governments today used barter for simple transactions but outside of that it had no wide spread use commodity based currency typically served as the main form of money for most but not all of recorded history this brings up a second point fiat currencies are not relatively new in fact the first fiat currency dates back to 10th century ad china it would thus seem that studying these concepts from a historical perspective would serve one well as these concepts and their practical uses have been around for quite some time while it is true that no global fiat currency system has ever been implemented such as the one today it does not mean historical study provides no benefit take for example army generals who would site and studied historyâ s greatest generals such as julius caesar napoleon bonaparte or alexander the great it would be easy for a general to claim that the vast change in warfare has left historical study irrelevant this is a fatal mistake studying history provides insights into human behaviour under different circumstances although particulars may change fundamental parallels can still be drawn that provide useful insight into human nature this is useful when analyzing todayâ s established systems be it political social or economic both in theory and in practice however it seems that this is generally not the case the current economic field is so heavily dependent upon a hand full of theories and practices that it seems to have no concern for other concepts or wider historical study fiscal and monetary policies implemented under these premises have begun to show structural faults that will likely have severe consequences if these issues are to persist as it seems they will gold could once again begin trading as a monetary asset money instead of a commodity that provides inflation hedge this would require a substantial increase in gold prices as current valuations are drastically to low if the yellow metal were to regain monetary premium economic theories of present day of the prevailing theories today the new keynesian school of thought is arguably the most prominent the theory evolved from john maynard keynes and his post war work on macroeconomics the theory has adjusted over time from keynes original work but the fundamental premises still hold the proponents of the theory claim that imperfect completion can lead to prices and wages becoming â stickyâ essentially meaning they have an inability to adjust to changes in economic circumstances in a timely manner this leads to the assumption that government intervention through fiscal and monetary policy measures can assist the economy in reaching its full output potential another prevailing school of thought and the second most prevalent in todayâ s economy is the monetarist theory made famous by milton friedman the theory differs from keynesian thinking by focusing more heavily on the monetary aspect for economic growth in favour of the fiscal approach the theory centralizes around the notion that control of the money supply can be used to promote economic stability by growing at the same rate as potential output both theories in practice have many nuances and implications that are outside of the scope of this article the main premise to draw from the brief descriptions provided is that both theories promote government intervention as the optimal path for achieving desired economic results theoretically the models come across as logical where they fall sort however is in there practical application individuals in charge of policy are not fully capable of accurately accessing economic conditions due to the natural complexity of economic markets equilibrium models which serve a purpose in the field of economics are inadequate justification for massive policy measures like those seen following the great recession economies can be more properly understood through complexity theory a field largely ignored by high level policy makers worse yet the theories greatly overlook the importance of behavioural economics from the view point of political actors it is becoming increasingly evident that politicians from all parties are willing to sacrifice long term economic stability for short term benefits alternatively it may be that these are the only politicians who can actually get elected regardless the fiscal irresponsibility continues peace time prosperity under a welfare state system can bring about ever greater demand for government financial aid this can be seen in the growing fiscal deficits and perpetual monetary stimulus the long term consequences of recent policies may prove ultimately profitable for those holding gold to understand why a brief historical recap is in order end of bretton woods and the emergence of the king dollar the early origins of our current economy can be traced back to the late 1960â s still under the bretton woods system the united states began to run into issues due to the growing debt generated under johnson nixon and ford in part to fund the increasing conflict in vietnam federal surplus or deficit source federal reserve bank of st louis foreign central banks began to stock pile us dollars and worry set in that the us did not have enough gold to fulfill its exchange rate of 35 oz set under the agreement many speculators assumed that nixon would be forced to devalue the us dollar and thus increase the relative value of gold this caused a partial run on the us gold reserves that exacerbated the problem nixon assured foreign diplomats that the us would make full on its obligation to convert us dollars to gold this calmed foreign central banks enough to allow them to continue to stock pile us dollars which began to set in place the us dollar as the global reserve currency when nixon abandoned in bretton woods agreement in 1973 it almost but not quite solidified the king dollar regime as many foreign central banks stuck holding us dollar had generally no alternative liquid enough to take its place it should be noted here that the united states decision to abandon the gold standard should be viewed as a default its failure to fulfill its obligation set under the agreement meets the technical definition of a default individuals who claim the united states treasuries are risk free would be wise to more closely examine 20th century history by definition the united states has defaulted twice on its obligations within the past century in the mid to late 1970â s inflation began increasing at an unsettling pace in part due to the fiscal and more importantly monetary policies of the recent past these policies allowed for an excessive growth of the money supply leading to increased prices consumer price index source federal reserve bank of st louis the increasing inflation began to create a crisis for the united states and many foreign countries as well the federal reserve then under chairman paul volcker began to focus more directly on combating inflation the fed implemented policies aimed at reducing the aggregate money supply including sharp spikes in the interest rate the policies were able to curb inflation but the serve nature of the tightening policies led to recessions in the early 1980s these monetary policies cemented the us dollar as the global reserve currency as it saw a strong increase in relative value this allowed even encouraged complete fiscal irresponsibility as the global demand for us dollar and with it us treasuries grew substantially the consequences of monetary and fiscal manipulation following the emergence from the bretton woods agreement and the heavy handed monetary policies of the 1980s debt levels from sovereigns to corporate entities and individuals alike has increased substantially whether it is political actors implementing greater and greater budget deficits as a means to foster short term economic growth corporations levering up their balance sheets to buy back shares or households utilizing larger and cheaper means of credit for consumption all debt levels are nearing unsustainable levels that seem to have no end in sight global debt source bloomberg the monetary policies implemented to date have assisted in this ravenous sensation with debt but these measures are running out ever growing money supply and unnaturally low levels of interest rates have the potential to create serious long term inefficiencies that will likely be to severe to fix with further use of cheap credit from the 1980s onward central banks and the federal reserve in particular have followed plays out of the same playbook cutting interest rates to combat downturns is not a new phenomenon and had been used in many decades past however the trend from the last 30 40 years has become overly stimulus and has created a positive feedback loop in which growth seems now to be dependent upon further stimulus it can be seen that these policies have had a direct hand in creating a ever more violent boom and bust cycle within a number of markets as asset bubbles inflated by these policies meet there inevitable demise s p vs fed funds rate source value walk the reaction to the dot com crash of the late 90s and earl 2000s cemented in place an ideal that policy makers are willing to prop up financial markets regardless of the necessity as the dot com crash can only be described as pure lunacy the need for monetary stimulus was completely unnecessary the economy as a whole was performing relatively well at the time and speculators who had pushed the dot com stocks to completely unjustified levels should have been left to the fate deserving of their actions the reaction of policies makers however instead of allowing markets to cleanse themselves of malinvestment began to inflate another bubble in place of the one that had just crashed the great recession of 2008 showed just how short sighted policy makers have become trapped within echo chambers reverberating the same economic theories while failing to see the wider ramifications the crash in housing prices showed how dangerous using the wealth effect as a means of promoting consumption can be for an attempt to grow asset prices through the use of the money supply and interest rates will inevitably lead to asset bubbles in addition the use of credit and derivatives had created more complex financial markets in which a failure in any number of particular instances would send shock waves throw the entire system dangers which are still very present today and have the same if not a greater potential to create economic devastation globally otc derivatives outstanding notional value source bank of international settlement many critics of policy makers claim that the 2008 recession would have been best handled by doing next to nothing allowing those who created the financial mess left to deal with its fall out this viewpoint is largely guided by emotion rather than reason as the ramifications of the housing collapse clearly required policy measures to avoid complete catastrophe the measures taken however were far too short sighted and failed to comprehend the potential for long term structural created in their wake ben bernankeâ s implementation of quantitative easing which can be more accurately described as debt monetization has the potential for devastating long term consequences those who claim the policy measures to have been a success are looking at the issue from to short of time frame inflation has the potential to reach unmanageable levels if the us dollar were begin losing its place as the global reserve currency something that is not immediately likely but could manifest over a longer period many foreign nations strongly oppose the current reserve currency system as it largely benefits the united states at the expense of others if confidence in the us dollar began to fade and nations no longer opted to renew their expiring treasuries and instead dumped them onto the market the consequences would be severe federal reserve total assets source federal reserve bank of st louis interest rates serve a vital role within any well functioning economy as the price for credit they represent one of the three main price signals the other two being the price for labour and consumer and producer goods and services manipulating interest rates can have unintended consequences throughout the economy as other connected areas become distorted by artificially priced credit looking at various levels of debt from governments to corporations and individual households it can be seen that these policies meant to foster growth are doing so at the steady deterioration of financial health throughout the economy the culmination of these growing inefficiencies has the potential to create a severe and long lasting depression that may catch many completely unprepared the likely response from policy makers in both central banks and sovereign entities is at this point almost fully predictable the further expansion of central bank balance sheets and once again near zero interest rates will likely not have the intended effects as economies cannot borrower and consume their way to prosperity the fallout from a failed attempt to reinflate this bubble economy would be devastating as central bankers could lose the principle component to their success to date investor confidence if investors begin to believe that central bankers have painted themselves into a corner and run out of options to attempt in fostering growth a currency crisis could materialize if this scenario plays out and it is quite possible gold would stand to see great advances in value as it may once again be viewed as asset with monetary value conclusion valuation gold generally serves few purposes as a commodity as it has become labelled in decades past with very limited industrial use the yellow metal through most of recorded history has served as a monetary asset a great divergence has emerged in the past decade as gold prices have fallen greatly even as money supply rapidly increased this divergence has left gold prices far too low to serve as a monetary medium and thus would need to see increases if this were to once again take hold based on the aggregate money supply from the leading global powers it can be seen that gold prices could have the potential to trade closer to prices north of 2000 oz this figured is derived by using an approximately gold backing of 20 of the global money supply as this has been the typical range used in gold standards of the past it makes logical sense to use in attempting to draw conclusions of gold prices moving forward if it were to regain its monetary premium it can also be seen however that the 20 backing is not a necessity for a gold long position to be profitable as at current levels gold only represents a 5 38 backing of the total money supply any hint of gold regaining its monetary premium would require this percentage to be higher meaning even at levels approaching 10 backing gold would provide solid returns m1 money supply usd vs gold supply gold supply metric tonnes 33 000 m1 japan 7 138 m1 u s a 3 725 m1 china 7 782 m1 european union 9 558 total m1 28 203 click to

the past as the one and only cure for the problems prevalent in todayâ s economy this article does not attempt to draw any such conclusions nor does it necessarily attempt to make bold predictions of future economic events macroeconomic forecasting is an extremely difficult process filled with many potential pitfalls the highly complex nature of financial markets makes accurate predictions highly unlikely this does not imply however that profitable trading strategies are impossible to formulate by assessing the current economic condition against historical case studies one may be able to use fundamental analysis to draw conclusions in regards to over and undervalued assets in an array of time periods given the great divergence in gold prices from the aggregate money supply and the prevailing levels of debt throughout the global economy there is a fairly probable chance that gold prices could see sustained upward price movements proving very profitable for those willing to take a contrarian stance

sweden low inflation is making the riksbank even more dovish the rapid shift to more dovish central bank policies provided new support for risk appetite early in 2019 economic data have been divided but overall the global economy has been resilient to the recession risks that have been discussed recently seb s economists are adjusting their global growth outlook for 2019 somewhat lower to 3 3 per cent from their earlier 3 5 per cent but their forecast for 2020 remains at 3 5 per cent somewhat above the long term trend unemployment in advanced economies is continuing down to its lowest level since the 1970s while inflation will remain moderate the swedish economy is slowing because of subdued international demand and falling residential construction but thanks to expansionary fiscal policy and a weak krona growth will still remain close to its trend rate during 2019 and 2020 low inflation will force the riksbank to postpone its next rate hike again until july 2020 and after that the repo rate will stay at zero the krona will depreciate to just below 11 per euro at the end of this year no recession as central bank policies and china provide support although downside risks predominate in this phase of the economic cycle our faith in a resilient global economy is supported by several factors manufacturing activity is showing signs of stabilising with increased optimism in emerging market em countries partly due to expansionary economic policies in china the em sphere will thus remain an important global economic growth engine with stable growth of between 4 1 2 and 5 per cent in europe domestic economies have been generally resilient to weaknesses in manufacturing and strong labour markets have helped to sustain private consumption because exports to asia have become increasingly important the recovery in china and other em economies will also help drive exports in the next couple of years euro zone growth will bottom out around mid year 2019 and improve from an average of 1 1 per cent this year to 1 4 per cent in 2020 the challenges to the us economy look a bit different and are more connected to supply side restrictions in the labour market and fading fiscal policy support together with slightly weaker growth signs that productivity is improving faster are easing risks of overheating and making the federal reserve s balancing act easier the economy will gradually decelerate from 2 3 per cent this year to 1 7 per cent in 2020 but the united states will avoid a recession despite political uncertainty for example connected to us chinese trade talks or brexit financial market volatility is continuing to trend downward instead worries about interest rates and the economic cycle were factors behind temporary periods of financial market turbulence during 2018 central bank policies thus appear to be more important than general political events in the current environment inflation is again surprising on the downside and tendencies towards faster wage and salary hikes have faded somewhat making it easier for monetary policy makers to support growth despite increasingly tight labour markets seb s assessment is that the fed will leave its key interest rate at the current 2 25 2 50 per cent key rate risks are on the downside however as for the european central bank we predict no key rate hikes at all during our forecast period in light of this we expect long term us treasuries to show a slight falling trend from today s yields while it is hard to foresee german government bond yields rising especially much from today s yields of around zero moderate stress means a softer market and economic landing the next global recession will probably have its epicentre in the us the historical pattern is that recessions once they arrive are triggered by acute financial market crises but the financial stress level in the us does not seem especially high at present because of moderate debt there is low probability of a painful balance sheet recession like the real estate crisis of the 1990s and the lehman brothers crisis it is more natural to make comparisons with the dot com it crash of 2001 which led to a rather mild recession right now financial markets are sending ambiguous signals about growth share prices in the us and elsewhere have reached new all time highs meanwhile the fixed income market is pricing in fed interest rate cuts and the yield curve has flattened in a way that has historically signalled a risk of recession seb s view is that the signalling value of the yield curve has diminished but that downside risks predominate stock market valuations have begun to look more stretched and the journey ahead is likely to be volatile yet the growth picture still suggests that equities can provide positive returns in the coming year this issue of nordic outlook also includes four theme articles that discuss such topics as the challenges facing central banks in a japanified interest rate landscape the effects of climate change on forecasts and economic policy the impact of the european parliament elections on the european union s decision making process and the long term valuation of the swedish krona norges bank against the current baltics getting less competitive norway is in a different position than other western economies growth in the mainland economy excluding oil gas and shipping will accelerate to 2 6 per cent this year followed by 2 2 per cent in 2020 driven by higher capital spending in the oil and gas sector meanwhile residential construction is no longer a negative growth force tighter resource utilisation is causing underlying inflation to rise norges bank is going against the prevailing central bank current by hiking its key interest rate three more times to 1 75 per cent by the end of 2020 the other nordic countries have been affected in varying degrees by the international slowdown last year s slump in denmark exaggerated the underlying trend however danish growth will climb from 1 4 per cent in 2018 to 2 0 per cent this year followed by 1 5 per cent in 2020 rising employment and pay hike will drive private consumption while good competitiveness will help sustain exports the deceleration in the finnish economy will be offset by continued decent domestic demand and somewhat better global demand gdp growth will slow from last year s 2 3 per cent to 1 8 per cent in 2019 and reach 1 9 per cent in 2020 last year the baltic economies showed some of the highest growth figures in the euro zone thanks to resilient domestic economies but a deceleration is unavoidable as export growth weakens meanwhile substantially higher pay increases than in other countries will harm baltic competitiveness with productivity unable to keep up economic growth will cool from between 3 5 per cent lithuania and nearly 5 per cent latvia in 2018 to 3 3 5 per cent this year then to about 2 5 per cent estonia and lithuania and just over 3 per cent latvia in 2020 sweden will grow at more leisurely pace repo rate will stop at zero swedish manufacturing has been resilient to the downturn in germany early in 2019 based on strong preliminary first quarter data we are sticking to our gdp growth forecast of 1 6 per cent for this year but various signs suggest that we are entering a period of more leisurely growth we have adjusted our gdp growth forecast for 2020 a couple of tenths of a point lower to 1 7 per cent which is still stronger than in many other parts of europe looking ahead manufacturing activity will slow we have lowered our export forecast residential construction will shift from providing positive gdp contributions of more than half a percentage point yearly during 2014 2017 to a negative contribution of almost the same magnitude in 2019 this trend has confirmed expectations of a clear deceleration but no collapse in the housing market in 2020 we expect a slight rebound in construction consumption was surprisingly weak during the second half of 2018 despite the strong labour market and rising incomes in the next couple of years households will enjoy support from expansionary fiscal policy including tax cuts but they will remain cautious the household savings ratio will remain at close to record levels job growth will continue at a healthy pace although the rate of increase will slow rising labour force participation which is approaching the record levels of the late 1980s has nevertheless contributed to an unexpected increase in the jobless rate our forecast is that the upturn in labour supply will fade and that unemployment will stabilise at close to current levels higher inflation expectations and slightly faster pay increases in germany suggest that the next swedish national wage round which will be completed in the spring of 2020 will lead to higher contractual pay hikes than last time around total pay increases of more than 3 per cent yearly including wage drift will not however be enough to ensure stable inflation at around the riksbank s 2 per cent target once the effects of earlier krona weakness and energy price increases fade from the 12 month figures this will make it hard for the riksbank to hike its key interest rate at all in an environment where leading central banks are softening their plans seb s forecast is that there will be only one rate hike in 2020 and that it will be postponed until july once the wage round is over the riksbank s negative key rate will thus remain a depreciating factor for the krona until the second half of next year the eur sek exchange rate will be 10 90 at the end of 2019 followed by a gradual krona appreciation to 10 20 per euro by the end of 2020 because of the dovish riksbank a proposal to increase liquidity reserves that will boost demand for safe swedish assets and a low supply of government bonds swedish government bond yields will remain low swedish 10 year yields will be at 0 80

menafn newsin asia colombo may 8 newsin asia in a frank talk at the pathfinder foundation here on tuesday robert blake who was us ambassador to sri lanka and assistant secretary of state for south and central asia listed some key mistakes made by the present and past us administrations which landed the world s pre eminent power in trouble blake was speaking in his current capacity as senior director india and south asia mclarty associates a firm of strategic consultants according to blake the first mistake the us made was president clinton s decision to back china s entry into the world trade organization wto based on incorrect assumptions the second was the obama administration s decision to stop all us sri lanka military training programs after eelam war iv on the grounds that the sri lankan armed forces had allegedly committed human rights violations in the last phase of the war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte the third was president trump s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership tpp china s admission to wto blake recalled that president clinton supported china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy clinton like most americans believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese traveled and studied abroad china would become more of a market economy and become more democratic but today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and state owned enterprises soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas blake charged the veteran american diplomat acknowledged that most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be asked to make a choice between the united states and china they want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative bri blake noted china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarized the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and 29 international organizations having signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceeded us 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries has surpassed us 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed us 113 billion in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined blake pointed out however the bri has created some undesirable trends and blake listed the following among debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hanbantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity blake recommended labour issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labour on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labour of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work the former envoy pointed out lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labor and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns blake referred to a recent world research institute wri analysis of bri lending from 2014 to 2017 and said that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges blake then asked what are recipient countries to do and his answer was as follows first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wall street journal recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a us 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the project and slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbour pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladesh and sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri program is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a us 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs indonesian ministers have criticized the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information china is rethinking blake pointed out that these criticisms have made china re think and respond to them in a speech on april 26 to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way china should have zero tolerance for corruption and ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparancy xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 blake said there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received the former envoy said china itself and un environment program have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented blake added trump s response to china s challenge blake said that the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognizing that it is not enough to simply criticize bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new u s international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totalling us 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over us 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions now of course the idfc s us 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but it does provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signaled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives blake said these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of u s foreign direct investment in the region is nearly us 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment meeting china s security challenge blake noted that the trump administration has maintained us security commitment to the region one of secretary of defense jams mattis first acts was to rename the us pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing us understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognize india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained america s high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing the longstanding commitment of the us to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years blake said mistake to have quit trans pacific partnership blake pointed out that trump had made a mistake by quitting the trans pacific partnership tpp the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not belabor this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was assistant secretary of south and central asia under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year blake recalled wrong to have withdrawn military training ambassador blake regretted that after the sri lanka ltte war ended in may 2009 the us had stopped its military aid and training programs in the island on the plea that there had been human rights violations by the lankan military in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us he said blake referred to the stoppage of military training to the pakistani army and said that this resulted in the us losing contact with a whole generation of pakistani military officers the result was that this generation grew up on a diet of anti american sentiment hampering inter operability which is key to military military cooperation the former envoy said us lanka cooperation restored blake noted that the us and lankan militaries are now training together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the u s transferred a u s coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings lessons from easter bombings tuning to the april 21 easter sunday bombings in sri lanka blake said the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last ten years job one of course must be to pursue with vigor the investigation into who was responsible what links they had to outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency rregulations what us experience can teach blake said that sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reacted by expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentions at guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve inter agency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by deputy national security advisor john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group gotabaya rajapaksa praised in this context blake recalled how when gotabaya rajapaksa was lankan defense secretary during the last eelam war he set up a committee of experts to advice him an called for a strong and unified national leadership to take decisions and implement them continued threat from islamic state sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root blake warned although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favor on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions new questions according to blake the new questions are will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions need for early warning system blake said that with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumors the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumors and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia he added the lankan government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds blake said and added every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka need for non partisan united leadership calling for a truly national and united leadership blake said in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper

who was us ambassador to sri lanka and assistant secretary of state for south and central asia listed some key mistakes made by the present and past us administrations which landed the world s pre eminent power in trouble blake was speaking in his current capacity as senior director india and south asia mclarty associates a firm of strategic consultants according to blake the first mistake the us made was president clinton s decision to back china s entry into the world trade organization wto based on incorrect assumptions the second was the obama administration s decision to stop all us sri lanka military training programs after eelam war iv on the grounds that the sri lankan armed forces had allegedly committed human rights violations in the last phase of the war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte the third was president trump s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership tpp china s admission to wto blake recalled that president clinton supported china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy clinton like most americans believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese traveled and studied abroad china would become more of a market economy and become more democratic but today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and state owned enterprises soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas blake charged the veteran american diplomat acknowledged that most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be asked to make a choice between the united states and china they want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative bri blake noted china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarized the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and29 international organizationshaving signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceededus 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries hassurpassed us 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed us 113 billion in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined blake pointed out however the bri has created some undesirable trends and blake listed the following among debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hanbantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity blake recommended labour issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labour on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labour of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work the former envoy pointed out lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labor and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns blake referred to a recent world research institute wri analysis of bri lending from 2014 to 2017 and said that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges blake then asked what are recipient countries to do and his answer was as follows first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wall street journal recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a us 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the projectand slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbour pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladeshand sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri program is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a us 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs indonesian ministers have criticized the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information china is rethinking blake pointed out that these criticisms have made china re think and respond to them in a speech on april 26 to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way china should have zero tolerance for corruption and ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparancy xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 blake said there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received the former envoy said china itself and un environment program have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented blake added trump s response to china s challenge blake said that the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognizing that it is not enough to simply criticize bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new u s international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totalling us 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over us 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions washington dc january 23 afp out u s president donald trump shows the executive order withdrawing the us from the trans pacific partnership tpp after signing it in 2017 now of course the idfc s us 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but it does provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signaled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives blake said these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of u s foreign direct investment in the region is nearly us 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment meeting china s security challenge blake noted that the trump administration has maintained us security commitment to the region one of secretary of defense jams mattis first acts was to rename the us pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing us understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognize india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained america s high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing the longstanding commitment of the us to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years blake said mistake to have quit trans pacific partnership blake pointed out that trump had made a mistake by quitting the trans pacific partnership tpp the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not belabor this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was assistant secretary of south and central asia under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year blake recalled wrong to have withdrawn military training ambassador blake regretted that after the sri lanka ltte war ended in may 2009 the us had stopped its military aid and training programs in the island on the plea that there had been human rights violations by the lankan military in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us he said blake referred to the stoppage of military training to the pakistani army and said that this resulted in the us losing contact with a whole generation of pakistani military officers the result was that this generation grew up on a diet of anti american sentiment hampering inter operability which is key to military military cooperation the former envoy said us lanka cooperation restored blake noted that the us and lankan militaries are now training together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the u s transferred a u s coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings lessons from easter bombings tuning to the april 21 easter sunday bombings in sri lanka blake said the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last ten years job one of course must be to pursue with vigor the investigation into who was responsible what links they had to outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency rregulations what us experience can teach blake said that sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reacted by expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentions at guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve inter agency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by deputy national security advisor john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group gotabaya rajapaksa praised in this context blake recalled how when gotabaya rajapaksa was lankan defense secretary during the last eelam war he set up a committee of experts to advice him an called for a strong and unified national leadership to take decisions and implement them continued threat from islamic state sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root blake warned although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favor on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions us trained sri lankan airborne special forces new questions according to blake the new questions are will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions need for early warning system blake said that with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumors the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumors and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia he added the lankan government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds blake said and added every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka need for non partisan united leadership calling for a truly national and united leadership blake said in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper
sweden low inflation is making the riksbank even more dovish the rapid shift to more dovish central bank policies provided new support for risk appetite early in 2019 economic data have been divided but overall the global economy has been resilient to the recession risks that have been discussed recently seb s economists are adjusting their global growth outlook for 2019 somewhat lower to 3 3 per cent from their earlier 3 5 per cent but their forecast for 2020 remains at 3 5 per cent somewhat above the long term trend unemployment in advanced economies is continuing down to its lowest level since the 1970s while inflation will remain moderate the swedish economy is slowing because of subdued international demand and falling residential construction but thanks to expansionary fiscal policy and a weak krona growth will still remain close to its trend rate during 2019 and 2020 low inflation will force the riksbank to postpone its next rate hike again until july 2020 and after that the repo rate will stay at zero the krona will depreciate to just below 11 per euro at the end of this year no recession as central bank policies and china provide support although downside risks predominate in this phase of the economic cycle our faith in a resilient global economy is supported by several factors manufacturing activity is showing signs of stabilising with increased optimism in emerging market em countries partly due to expansionary economic policies in china the em sphere will thus remain an important global economic growth engine with stable growth of between 4 1 2 and 5 per cent in europe domestic economies have been generally resilient to weaknesses in manufacturing and strong labour markets have helped to sustain private consumption because exports to asia have become increasingly important the recovery in china and other em economies will also help drive exports in the next couple of years euro zone growth will bottom out around mid year 2019 and improve from an average of 1 1 per cent this year to 1 4 per cent in 2020 the challenges to the us economy look a bit different and are more connected to supply side restrictions in the labour market and fading fiscal policy support together with slightly weaker growth signs that productivity is improving faster are easing risks of overheating and making the federal reserve s balancing act easier the economy will gradually decelerate from 2 3 per cent this year to 1 7 per cent in 2020 but the united states will avoid a recession despite political uncertainty for example connected to us chinese trade talks or brexit financial market volatility is continuing to trend downward instead worries about interest rates and the economic cycle were factors behind temporary periods of financial market turbulence during 2018 central bank policies thus appear to be more important than general political events in the current environment inflation is again surprising on the downside and tendencies towards faster wage and salary hikes have faded somewhat making it easier for monetary policy makers to support growth despite increasingly tight labour markets seb s assessment is that the fed will leave its key interest rate at the current 2 25 2 50 per cent key rate risks are on the downside however as for the european central bank we predict no key rate hikes at all during our forecast period in light of this we expect long term us treasuries to show a slight falling trend from today s yields while it is hard to foresee german government bond yields rising especially much from today s yields of around zero moderate stress means a softer market and economic landing the next global recession will probably have its epicentre in the us the historical pattern is that recessions once they arrive are triggered by acute financial market crises but the financial stress level in the us does not seem especially high at present because of moderate debt there is low probability of a painful balance sheet recession like the real estate crisis of the 1990s and the lehman brothers crisis it is more natural to make comparisons with the dot com it crash of 2001 which led to a rather mild recession right now financial markets are sending ambiguous signals about growth share prices in the us and elsewhere have reached new all time highs meanwhile the fixed income market is pricing in fed interest rate cuts and the yield curve has flattened in a way that has historically signalled a risk of recession seb s view is that the signalling value of the yield curve has diminished but that downside risks predominate stock market valuations have begun to look more stretched and the journey ahead is likely to be volatile yet the growth picture still suggests that equities can provide positive returns in the coming year this issue of nordic outlook also includes four theme articles that discuss such topics as the challenges facing central banks in a japanified interest rate landscape the effects of climate change on forecasts and economic policy the impact of the european parliament elections on the european union s decision making process and the long term valuation of the swedish krona norges bank against the current baltics getting less competitive norway is in a different position than other western economies growth in the mainland economy excluding oil gas and shipping will accelerate to 2 6 per cent this year followed by 2 2 per cent in 2020 driven by higher capital spending in the oil and gas sector meanwhile residential construction is no longer a negative growth force tighter resource utilisation is causing underlying inflation to rise norges bank is going against the prevailing central bank current by hiking its key interest rate three more times to 1 75 per cent by the end of 2020 the other nordic countries have been affected in varying degrees by the international slowdown last year s slump in denmark exaggerated the underlying trend however danish growth will climb from 1 4 per cent in 2018 to 2 0 per cent this year followed by 1 5 per cent in 2020 rising employment and pay hike will drive private consumption while good competitiveness will help sustain exports the deceleration in the finnish economy will be offset by continued decent domestic demand and somewhat better global demand gdp growth will slow from last year s 2 3 per cent to 1 8 per cent in 2019 and reach 1 9 per cent in 2020 last year the baltic economies showed some of the highest growth figures in the euro zone thanks to resilient domestic economies but a deceleration is unavoidable as export growth weakens meanwhile substantially higher pay increases than in other countries will harm baltic competitiveness with productivity unable to keep up economic growth will cool from between 3 5 per cent lithuania and nearly 5 per cent latvia in 2018 to 3 3 5 per cent this year then to about 2 5 per cent estonia and lithuania and just over 3 per cent latvia in 2020 sweden will grow at more leisurely pace repo rate will stop at zero swedish manufacturing has been resilient to the downturn in germany early in 2019 based on strong preliminary first quarter data we are sticking to our gdp growth forecast of 1 6 per cent for this year but various signs suggest that we are entering a period of more leisurely growth we have adjusted our gdp growth forecast for 2020 a couple of tenths of a point lower to 1 7 per cent which is still stronger than in many other parts of europe looking ahead manufacturing activity will slow we have lowered our export forecast residential construction will shift from providing positive gdp contributions of more than half a percentage point yearly during 2014 2017 to a negative contribution of almost the same magnitude in 2019 this trend has confirmed expectations of a clear deceleration but no collapse in the housing market in 2020 we expect a slight rebound in construction consumption was surprisingly weak during the second half of 2018 despite the strong labour market and rising incomes in the next couple of years households will enjoy support from expansionary fiscal policy including tax cuts but they will remain cautious the household savings ratio will remain at close to record levels job growth will continue at a healthy pace although the rate of increase will slow rising labour force participation which is approaching the record levels of the late 1980s has nevertheless contributed to an unexpected increase in the jobless rate our forecast is that the upturn in labour supply will fade and that unemployment will stabilise at close to current levels higher inflation expectations and slightly faster pay increases in germany suggest that the next swedish national wage round which will be completed in the spring of 2020 will lead to higher contractual pay hikes than last time around total pay increases of more than 3 per cent yearly including wage drift will not however be enough to ensure stable inflation at around the riksbank s 2 per cent target once the effects of earlier krona weakness and energy price increases fade from the 12 month figures this will make it hard for the riksbank to hike its key interest rate at all in an environment where leading central banks are softening their plans seb s forecast is that there will be only one rate hike in 2020 and that it will be postponed until july once the wage round is over the riksbank s negative key rate will thus remain a depreciating factor for the krona until the second half of next year the eur sek exchange rate will be 10 90 at the end of 2019 followed by a gradual krona appreciation to 10 20 per euro by the end of 2020 because of the dovish riksbank a proposal to increase liquidity reserves that will boost demand for safe swedish assets and a low supply of government bonds swedish government bond yields will remain low swedish 10 year yields will be at 0 80 per cent by the end of 2020 key figures international swedish economy figures in brackets are from the january 2019 issue of nordic outlook international economy gdp year on year changes 2017 2018

to a liability of 1 183 million as at december 31 2018 the increase in net fair value was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the u s dollar on foreign exchange contracts as well as the impact of downward shifts in yield curves 4 asset default provision we make provisions for possible future credit events in the determination of our insurance contract liabilities the amount of the provision for asset default included in insurance contract liabilities is based on possible reductions in future investment yields that vary by factors such as type of asset asset credit quality rating duration and country of origin to the extent that an asset is written off or disposed of any amounts that were set aside in our insurance contract liabilities for possible future asset defaults in respect of that asset are released our asset default provision reflects the provision relating to future credit events for fixed income assets currently held by the company that support our insurance contract liabilities our asset default provision as at march 31 2019 was 2 537 million compared to 2 389 million as at december 31 2018 the increase of 148 million was primarily due to yield curve movement and changes in credit ratings h risk management the company has established a risk management framework to assist in identifying measuring managing monitoring and reporting risks the risk management framework covers all risks and these have been grouped into six major categories credit market insurance business and strategic operational and liquidity risks through our enterprise risk management processes we oversee the various risk factors identified in the risk management framework and provide reports to senior management and to the board committees at least quarterly our enterprise risk management processes and risk factors are described in our annual md a and aif when referring to segregated funds in this section it is inclusive of segregated fund guarantees variable annuities and investment products and includes run off reinsurance in our corporate business segment 1 market risk sensitivities our net income 1 is affected by the determination of policyholder obligations under our annuity and insurance contracts these amounts are determined using internal valuation models and are recorded in our consolidated financial statements primarily as insurance contract liabilities the determination of these obligations requires management to make assumptions about the future level of equity market performance interest rates credit and swap spreads and other factors over the life of our products differences between our actual experience and our best estimate assumptions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements refer to additional cautionary language and key assumptions related to sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates the market value of our investments in fixed income and equity securities fluctuates based on movements in interest rates and equity markets the market value of fixed income assets designated as afs that are held primarily in our surplus segment increases with declining interest rates and decreases with rising interest rates the market value of equities designated as afs and held primarily in our surplus segment increases decreases with rising declining equity markets changes in the market value of afs assets flow through other comprehensive income oci and are only recognized in net income when realized upon sale or when considered impaired the amount of realized gains losses recorded in net income in any period is equal to the unrealized gains losses or oci position at the start of the period plus the change in market value during the current period up to the point of sale for those securities that were sold during the period the sale or impairment of afs assets held in surplus can therefore have the effect of modifying our net income sensitivity we realized 23 million pre tax in net gains on the sale of afs assets during the first quarter of 2019 36 million pre tax in the first quarter of 2018 the net unrealized gains or oci position on afs fixed income and equity assets were 122 million and 73 million respectively after tax as at march 31 2019 98 million and 43 million

equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets since in actual practice equity related exposures generally differ from broad market indices due to the impact of active management basis risk and other factors realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above sensitivities include the impact of re balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2 intervals for 10 changes in equity markets and at 5 intervals for 25 changes in equity markets 2 the market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 and include new business added and product changes implemented prior to such dates 3 net income and oci sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest 50 million the sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates which we account for on an equity basis 4 the licat sensitivities illustrate the impact on sun life assurance as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 licat ratios are rounded to the nearest 0 5 interest rate sensitivities the following table sets out the estimated immediate impact on or sensitivity of our net income and oci and sun life assurance s licat ratio to certain instantaneous changes in interest rates as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 sun life assurance s licat ratio decreases with rising interest rates and increases with declining interest rates which is opposite to our net income sensitivity increases to interest rates will reduce the value of our

variations in realized yields based on factors such as different terms to maturity and geographies may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those illustrated above sensitivities include the impact of re balancing interest rate hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 10 basis point intervals for 50 basis point changes in interest rates 2 the market risk sensitivities include the estimated mitigation impact of our hedging programs in effect as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 and include new business added and product changes implemented prior to such dates 3 net income and oci sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest 50 million the sensitivities exclude the market impacts on the income from our joint ventures and associates which we account for on an equity basis 4 the majority of interest rate sensitivity after hedging is attributed to individual insurance products we also have interest rate sensitivity after hedging from our fixed annuity and segregated funds products 5 the licat sensitivities illustrate the impact on sun life assurance as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 licat ratios are rounded to the nearest 0 5 interest rate sensitivities do not include any impact from changes to the asb promulgated urr in 2014 the asb made changes to the canadian actuarial standards of practice with respect to economic reinvestment assumptions used in the valuation of insurance contract liabilities the changes relate to assumed future interest rates credit spreads and the use of non fixed income assets supporting fixed obligations when the asb promulgated these changes the intention was to review these assumptions every five years or sooner if circumstances warrant the last update to the urr was a 10 basis point reduction in 2017 given the continuing low interest rates the asb has issued an exposure draft on assumptions that includes a reduction in the urr of 15 basis points the final standard is expected to be released in the third quarter and will be effective this year based on current assumptions as at march 31 2019 our estimated sensitivity to a 15 basis point decrease in the urr would have been a decrease in reported net income of approximately 100 million after tax the actual impact could differ from the company s estimate the statements concerning expected urr changes are forward looking 2 credit spread and swap spread sensitivities we have estimated the immediate impact or sensitivity of our net income attributable to certain instantaneous changes in credit and swap spreads the credit spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in credit spreads on our asset and liability valuations including non sovereign fixed income assets provincial governments corporate bonds and other fixed income assets the swap spread sensitivities reflect the impact of changes in swap spreads on swap based derivative positions and liability valuations millions unless otherwise noted credit spread sensitivities 1 swap spread sensitivities net income sensitivity 2 50 basis point decrease 50 basis point increase 20 basis point decrease 20 basis point increase march 31 2019 100 75 25

been rounded to the nearest 25 million the credit and swap spread sensitivities assume a parallel shift in the indicated spreads across the entire term structure variations in realized spread changes based on different terms to maturity geographies asset classes and derivative types underlying interest rate movements and ratings may result in realized sensitivities being significantly different from those provided above the credit spread sensitivity estimates exclude any credit spread impact that may arise in connection with asset positions held in segregated funds spread sensitivities are provided for the consolidated entity and may not be proportional across all reporting segments refer to additional cautionary language and key assumptions related to sensitivities in this section for important additional information regarding these estimates 3 general account insurance and annuity products most of our expected sensitivity to changes in interest rates and about two thirds of our expected sensitivity to changes in equity markets are derived from our general account insurance and annuity products we have implemented market risk management strategies to mitigate a portion of the market risk related to our general account insurance and annuity products individual insurance products include universal life and other long term life and health insurance products major sources of market risk exposure for individual insurance products include the reinvestment risk related to future premiums on regular premium policies asset reinvestment risk on both regular premium and single premium policies and the guaranteed cost of insurance interest rate risk for individual insurance products is typically managed on a duration basis within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment policy or guidelines targets and limits are established so that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite exposures are monitored frequently and assets are re balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within policy limits using a combination of assets and derivative instruments a portion of the longer term cash flows are backed with equities and real estate for participating insurance products and other insurance products with adjustability features the investment strategy objective is to provide a total rate of return given a constant risk profile over the long term fixed annuity products generally provide the policyholder with a guaranteed investment return or crediting rate interest rate risk for these products is typically managed on a duration basis within tolerance ranges set out in the applicable investment guidelines targets and limits are established such that the level of residual exposure is commensurate with our risk appetite exposures are monitored frequently and are re balanced as necessary to maintain compliance within prescribed tolerances using a combination of fixed income assets and derivative instruments certain insurance and annuity products contain minimum interest rate guarantees market risk management strategies are implemented to limit potential financial loss due to reductions in asset earned rates relative to contract guarantees these typically involve the use of hedging strategies utilizing interest rate derivatives such as interest rate floors swaps and swaptions certain insurance and annuity products contain features which allow the policyholders to surrender their policy at book value market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss due to changes in interest rate levels and policyholder behaviour these typically involve the use of hedging strategies such as dynamic option replication and the purchase of interest rate swaptions certain products have guaranteed minimum annuitization rates market risk management strategies are implemented to limit the potential financial loss and typically involve the use of fixed income assets interest rate swaps and swaptions 4 segregated fund guarantees approximately one third of our equity market sensitivity and a small amount of interest rate risk sensitivity as at march 31 2019 are derived from segregated fund products these products provide benefit guarantees which are linked to underlying fund performance and may be triggered upon death maturity withdrawal or annuitization the cost of providing these guarantees is uncertain and depends upon a number of factors including general capital market conditions our hedging strategies policyholder behaviour and mortality experience each of which may result in negative impacts on net income and capital the following table provides information with respect to the guarantees provided for our segregated fund products as at march 31 2019 millions fund value amount at risk 1 value of guarantees 2 insurance contract liabilities 3 slf canada 11 834 438 10 684 558 slf asia 2 765 291 2 920 110 run off reinsurance 4 2 274 243 1 170 243

of the guarantees exceeds the fund value the amount at risk is not currently payable as the guarantees are only payable upon death maturity withdrawal or annuitization if fund values remain below guaranteed values 2 for guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits the value of guarantees is calculated as the present value of the maximum future withdrawals assuming market conditions remain unchanged from current levels for all other benefits the value of guarantees is determined assuming 100 of the claims are made at the valuation date 3 the insurance contract liabilities represent management s provision for future costs associated with these guarantees and include a provision for adverse deviation in accordance with canadian actuarial standards of practice 4 the run off reinsurance business includes risks assumed through reinsurance of variable annuity products issued by various north american insurance companies between 1997 and 2001 this line of business is part of a closed block of reinsurance which is included in the corporate segment the movement of the items in the table above from december 31 2018 to march 31 2019 primarily resulted from the following factors i the total fund values increased due to an increase in equity markets which was partially offset by net redemptions from products closed to new business ii the total amount at risk decreased due to an increase in equity markets and net redemptions from products closed to new business iii the total value of guarantees decreased due to net redemptions from products closed to new business and the weakening of the u s dollar against the canadian dollar and iv the total insurance contract liabilities decreased due to an increase in equity markets and net redemptions from products closed to new business which was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates 5 segregated fund hedging our hedging programs use derivative instruments to mitigate the interest and equity related exposure of our segregated fund contracts as at march 31 2019 over 90 of our segregated fund contracts as measured by associated fund values were included in a hedging program while a large percentage of contracts are included in the hedging program not all of our market risk exposure related to these contracts is hedged for those segregated fund contracts included in the hedging program we generally hedge the value of expected future net claims costs and associated margins the following table illustrates the impact of our hedging program related to our sensitivity to a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates and a 10 and 25 decrease in equity markets for segregated fund contracts as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 impact of segregated fund hedging march 31 2019 millions changes in interest rates 1

markets as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 assumes that actual equity exposures consistently and precisely track the broader equity markets since in actual practice equity related exposures generally differ from broad market indices due to the impact of active management basis risk and other factors realized sensitivities may differ significantly from those illustrated above sensitivities include the impact of re balancing equity hedges for dynamic hedging programs at 2 intervals for 10 changes in equity markets and at 5 intervals for 25 changes in equity markets 3 net income sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest 50 million 4 since the fair value of benefits being hedged will generally differ from the financial statement value due to different valuation methods and the inclusion of valuation margins in respect of financial statement values this will result in residual volatility to interest rate and equity market shocks in net income and capital the general availability and cost of these hedging instruments may be adversely impacted by a number of factors including volatile and declining equity and interest rate market conditions 6 real estate risk real estate risk is the potential for financial loss arising from fluctuations in the value of or future cash flows from our investments in real estate we are exposed to real estate risk and may experience financial losses resulting from the direct ownership of real estate investments or indirectly through fixed income investments secured by real estate property leasehold interests ground rents and purchase and leaseback transactions real estate price risk may arise from external market conditions inadequate property analysis inadequate insurance coverage inappropriate real estate appraisals or from environmental risk exposures we hold direct real estate investments that support general account liabilities and surplus and fluctuations in value will impact our profitability and financial position a material and sustained increase in interest rates may lead to deterioration in real estate values an instantaneous 10 decrease in the value of our direct real estate investments as at march 31 2019 would decrease net income 1 by approximately 275 million 275 million decrease as at december 31 2018 conversely an instantaneous 10 increase in the value of our direct real estate investments as at march 31 2019 would increase net income by approximately 275 million 275 million increase as at december 31 2018 __________ 1 net income sensitivities have been rounded to the nearest 25 million 7 additional cautionary language and key assumptions related to sensitivities our market risk sensitivities are measures of our estimated change in net income and oci for changes in interest rates and equity market price levels described above based on interest rates equity market prices and business mix in place as at the respective calculation dates these sensitivities are calculated independently for each risk factor generally assuming that all other risk variables stay constant the sensitivities do not take into account indirect effects such as potential impacts on goodwill impairment or valuation allowances on deferred tax assets the sensitivities are provided for the consolidated entity and may not be proportional across all reporting segments actual results can differ materially from these estimates for a variety of reasons including differences in the pattern or distribution of the market shocks the interaction between these risk factors model error or changes in other assumptions such as business mix effective tax rates policyholder behaviour currency exchange rates and other market variables relative to those underlying the calculation of these sensitivities the extent to which actual results may differ from the indicative ranges will generally increase with larger capital market movements our sensitivities as at december 31 2018 have been included for comparative purposes only we have also provided measures of our net income sensitivity to instantaneous changes in credit spreads swap spreads real estate price levels and capital sensitivities to changes in interest rates and equity price levels the real estate sensitivities are non ifrs financial measures for additional information see section m non ifrs financial measures in this document the cautionary language which appears in this section is also applicable to the credit spread swap spread real estate and licat ratio sensitivities in particular these sensitivities are based on interest rates credit and swap spreads equity market and real estate price levels as at the respective calculation dates and assume that all other risk variables remain constant changes in interest rates credit and swap spreads equity market and real estate prices in excess of the ranges illustrated may result in other than proportionate impacts as these market risk sensitivities reflect an instantaneous impact on net income and oci they do not include impacts over time such as the effect on fee income in our asset management businesses the sensitivities reflect the composition of our assets and liabilities as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively changes in these positions due to new sales or maturities asset purchases sales or other management actions could result in material changes to these reported sensitivities in particular these sensitivities reflect the expected impact of hedging activities based on the hedge programs in place as at the march 31 and december 31 calculation dates the actual impact of hedging activity can differ materially from that assumed in the determination of these indicative sensitivities due to ongoing hedge re balancing activities changes in the scale or scope of hedging activities changes in the cost or general availability of hedging instruments basis risk i e the risk that hedges do not exactly replicate the underlying portfolio experience model risk and other operational risks in the ongoing management of the hedge programs or the potential failure of hedge counterparties to perform in accordance with expectations the sensitivities are based on methods and assumptions in effect as at march 31 2019 and december 31 2018 as applicable changes in the regulatory environment accounting or actuarial valuation methods models or assumptions including changes to the asb promulgated urr after those dates could result in material changes to these reported sensitivities changes in interest rates and equity market prices in excess of the ranges illustrated may result in other than proportionate impacts our hedging programs may themselves expose us to other risks including basis risk i e the risk that hedges do not exactly replicate the underlying portfolio experience volatility risk derivative counterparty credit risk and increased levels of liquidity risk model risk and other operational risks these factors may adversely impact the net effectiveness costs and financial viability of maintaining these hedging programs and therefore adversely impact our profitability and financial position while our hedging programs are intended to mitigate these effects e g hedge counterparty credit risk is managed by maintaining broad diversification dealing primarily with highly rated counterparties and transacting through over the counter contracts cleared through central clearing houses exchange traded contracts or bilateral over the counter contracts negotiated directly between counterparties that include credit support annexes residual risk potential reported earnings and capital volatility remain for the reasons outlined above our sensitivities should only be viewed as directional estimates of the underlying sensitivities of each factor under these specialized assumptions and should not be viewed as predictors of our future net income oci and capital given the nature of these calculations we cannot provide assurance that actual impact will be consistent with the estimates provided information related to market risk sensitivities and guarantees related to segregated fund products should be read in conjunction with the information contained in section m accounting and control matters 1 critical accounting policies and estimates in our 2018 annual md

was 11 4 billion up 5 4 billion compared to the first quarter of 2018 the increase was mainly attributable to increases in the fair value of fvtpl assets largely due to lower interest rate yields partially offset by lower net premium revenue the impact of foreign exchange increased revenue by 213 million adjusted revenue of 7 2 billion in the first quarter of 2019 decreased 0 5 billion compared to the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to lower net premium revenue in slf canada and lower fee income from slf asset management 2 changes in the statements of financial position and in shareholders equity total general fund assets were 172 3 billion as at march 31 2019 compared to 168 8 billion as at december 31 2018 primarily a result of a 4 2 billion increase from

relative to exchange rates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 insurance contract liabilities excluding other policy liabilities and assets of 118 6 billion as at march 31 2019 increased by 3 7 billion compared to december 31 2018 mainly due to changes in balances on in force policies which include fair value changes on fvtpl assets supporting insurance contract liabilities and balances arising from new policies partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange shareholders equity including preferred share capital was 23 8 billion as at march 31 2019 compared to 23 7 billion as at

the 1 week implied volatility reading on the dxy us dollar index expected price action has risen from a low of 4 79 percent last thursday to 5 86 percent today the recent jump in currency market

volatility has dropped from multi year highs after a dovish rbnz cut its policy interest rate although uncertainty over the outcome of ongoing trade talks between the us and china has caused nzdusd implied volatility to tick higher on balance this is likely due to new zealand s high level of dependence on economic activity out of china the risk posed by elevated trade deal tension has consequently weighed on expected price action in the kiwi likewise the size of price swings in the japanese yen has also risen as of late spot usdjpy has recorded a string of moves lower amid the

markets are still anticipating heightened price action that being said the outcome of trade talks this week will likely dictate where cny heads from here and cause usdcnh to either whipsaw lower or

except gold and palladium ounces produced and sold per ounce amounts and per share amounts 1 highlights the increase in attributable gold production was primarily due to the commencement of the san dimas gold stream effective may 10 2018 and the stillwater precious metals stream effective july 1 2018 as well as higher production at sudbury gold stream effective and the precious metals stream effective as well as higher production at the decrease in attributable silver production was primarily due to the termination of the san dimas silver stream effective may 10 2018 and all deliveries from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines ceasing effective march 31 2018 in accordance with the pascua lama precious metals purchase agreement pascua lama pmpa silver stream effective and all deliveries from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines ceasing effective in accordance with the pascua lama precious metals purchase agreement pascua lama pmpa the increase in gold sales was due to the higher production levels coupled with positive changes in the balance of payable gold produced but not yet delivered to wheaton the decrease in silver sales volume was due to the lower production levels coupled with negative changes in the balance of payable silver produced but not yet delivered to wheaton declared quarterly dividend of 0 09 per common share in accordance with wheaton s setting of a minimum quarterly dividend of 0 09 per common share for the duration of 2019 subject to the discretion of the board of directors per common share in accordance with wheaton s

financing activities in parallel in 2019 with the intent of achieving first production by the end of 2022 wheaton s core assets delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2019 with gold sales exceeding 115 000 ounces the most gold we have ever sold in a single quarter said randy smallwood president and chief executive officer of wheaton precious metals in addition we also saw one of our key growth projects move forward with hudbay announcing the conclusion of the permitting process at rosemont and their intent to begin early development work later this year hudbay indicated first production could commence as early as 2022 and we look forward to rosemont contributing to our future growth profile financial review revenues revenue was 225 million in the first quarter of 2019 on sales volume of 115 000 ounces of gold 4 3 million ounces of silver and 5 200 ounces of palladium this represents a 13 increase from the 199 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to i a 64 increase in the number of gold ounces sold and ii the introduction of palladium sales effective q3 2018 partially offset by iii a 32 decrease in the number of silver ounces sold iv a 7 decrease in the average realized silver price 15 64 in q1 2019 compared with 16 73 in q1 2018 and v a 2 decrease in the average realized gold price 1 308 in q1 2019 compared with 1 330 in

and 4 49 per silver ounce during the comparable period of 2018 this resulted in a cash operating margin¹ of 891 per gold ounce sold 11 00 per silver ounce sold and 1 189 per palladium ounce sold a reduction of 4 and 10 for gold and silver respectively as compared with q1 2018 the decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 2 decrease in the average realized gold price and a 7 decrease in the average realized silver price in q1 2019 compared with q1 2018 earnings and operating cash flows adjusted net earnings¹ and cash flow from operations in the first quarter of 2019 were

the first quarter of 2018 operational highlights for the quarter ended march 31 2019 are as follows salobo in the first quarter of 2019 salobo produced 60 800 ounces of attributable gold in line with the first quarter of 2018 as lower throughput and grades were offset by higher recoveries sales of 84 160 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2019 were higher than production as a result of a significant draw down of produced but not yet delivered ounces peñasquito in the first quarter of 2019 peñasquito produced 1 6 million ounces of attributable silver an increase of approximately 10 relative to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher grades partially offset by lower throughput and recovery as higher than expected ore hardness impacted mill performance in the quarter following the start of commercial production on december 31 2018 the pyrite leach project was operated successfully through the quarter in april 2019 newmont mining corporation and goldcorp inc merged to form newmont goldcorp corporation newmont goldcorp newmont goldcorp has highlighted their expected future improvements are focused on increasing mill throughput and improving plant reliability at peñasquito subsequent to the quarter on april 29 2019 newmont goldcorp announced that it intended to temporarily suspend operations at the peñasquito mine pending resolution of an illegal blockade antamina in the first quarter of 2019 antamina produced 1 2 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 10 relative to the first quarter of 2018 as expected due to mine sequencing in the open pit and lower mill throughput as a result of the timing of maintenance san dimas in the first quarter of 2019 san dimas produced 10 300 ounces of attributable gold according to first majestic silver corp s first majestic first quarter of 2019 production report the san dimas mill processed a total of 163 264 tonnes with average silver and gold grades of 287 g t and 4 18 g t respectively according to first majestic silver and gold grades improved 10 and 8 respectively compared to the prior quarter due to higher grades in the victoria and jessica areas along with improvements in mine dilution controls sudbury in the first quarter of 2019 vale s sudbury mines produced 10 000 ounces of attributable gold an increase of approximately 186 relative to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher throughput as a reminder production in the first quarter of 2018 was impacted due to the coleman mine being shutdown down for unscheduled maintenance from november 2017 to april 2018 constancia in the first quarter of 2019 constancia produced 0 6 million ounces of attributable silver and 4 800 ounces of attributable gold a decrease of approximately 2 for silver production and an increase of approximately 46 for gold production relative to the first quarter of 2018 as per wheaton s precious metals purchase agreement with hudbay relating to constancia the constancia pmpa should hudbay fail to achieve a minimum level of throughput at the pampacancha satellite deposit during 2018 2019 and 2020 wheaton will be entitled to an increased portion of gold from hudbay as per hudbay s md a for the first quarter of 2019 mining of the pampacancha deposit is not expected to begin until 2020 assuming ore production does not begin until 2020 the company will be entitled to receive an additional 8 020 ounces of gold in 2019 and 2020 relative to the constancia pmpa with the deliveries to be made in quarterly installments of which 2 005 ounces were received during the first quarter of 2019 and reported as production stillwater in the first quarter of 2019 the stillwater mines produced 3 100 ounces of attributable gold and 4 700 ounces of attributable palladium while production was slightly lower than expected due to several factors sibanye stillwater has indicated that additional resources have been deployed with the focus on recovering the lower production over the remainder of the year other gold in the first quarter of 2019 total other gold attributable production was 4 400 ounces a decrease of approximately 47 relative to the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was due primarily to lower production at the minto mine which was placed on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower production from the 777 mine other silver in the first quarter of 2019 total other silver attributable production was 2 3 million ounces a decrease of approximately 8 relative to the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of attributable production from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines as these streaming interests expired on march 31 2018 in accordance with the pmpa with barrick gold corp barrick partially offset by the start up of attributable production at the aljustrel mine in the second quarter of 2018 development update rosemont in march 2019 hudbay announced the conclusion of the permitting process for rosemont with its receipt of the section 404 water permit from the u s army corps of engineers and the mpo from the u s forest service on march

of rosemont by the end of the year which should enable first production by the end of 2022 the early works program includes construction of a water pipeline and power transmission line to site advancing critical path engineering and geotechnical work archaeological site work and spending on permit related mitigation activities hudbay further reports that it intends to evaluate a variety of financing options including the addition of a new committed joint venture partner for the development of rosemont as a reminder wheaton has a precious metals purchase agreement with hudbay on rosemont which in consideration for total upfront payments of 230 million entitles the company to 100 of payable silver and gold produced from rosemont at a cash price of 450 per ounce of gold and 3 90 per

51 500 payable gold ounces 3 5 million payable silver ounces and 4 800 payable palladium ounces representing a decrease of 25 600 payable gold ounces an increase of 0 4 million payable silver ounces and a decrease of 500 payable palladium ounces during the three month period ended march 31 2019 payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased primarily as a result of a decrease related to the salobo gold interest partially offset by an increase related to the sudbury gold interest payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased slightly primarily as a result of increases related to the yauliyacu and peñasquito silver interests partially offset by a decrease related to the constancia silver interest payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the wheaton group of companies are expected to average approximately two months of annualized production for silver and two to three months for both gold and palladium but may vary from quarter to quarter

indicated first production could commence as early as 2022 and we look forward to rosemont contributing to our future growth profile financial review revenues revenue was 225 million in the first quarter of 2019 on sales volume of 115 000 ounces of gold 4 3 million ounces of silver and 5 200 ounces of palladium this represents a 13 increase from the 199 million of revenue generated in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to i a 64 increase in the number of gold ounces sold and ii the introduction of palladium sales effective q3 2018 partially offset by iii a 32 decrease in the number of silver ounces sold iv a 7 decrease in the average realized silver price 15 64 in q1 2019 compared with 16 73 in q1 2018 and v a 2 decrease in the average realized gold price 1 308 in q1 2019

palladium ounce sold a reduction of 4 and 10 for gold and silver respectively as compared with q1 2018 the decrease in the cash operating margin was primarily due to a 2 decrease in the average

as compared with the first quarter of 2018 operational highlights for the quarter ended march 31 2019 are as follows salobo in the first quarter of 2019 salobo produced 60 800 ounces of attributable gold in line with the first quarter of 2018 as lower throughput and grades were offset by higher recoveries sales of 84 160 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2019 were higher than production as a result of a significant draw down of produced but not yet delivered ounces peñasquito in the first quarter of 2019 peñasquito produced 1 6 million ounces of attributable silver an increase of approximately 10 relative to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher grades partially offset by lower throughput and recovery as higher than expected ore hardness impacted mill performance in the quarter following the start of commercial production on december 31 2018 the pyrite leach project was operated successfully through the quarter in april 2019 newmont mining corporation and goldcorp inc merged to form newmont goldcorp corporation newmont goldcorp newmont goldcorp has highlighted their expected future improvements are focused on increasing mill throughput and improving plant reliability at peñasquito subsequent to the quarter on april 29 2019 newmont goldcorp announced that it intended to temporarily suspend operations at the peñasquito mine pending resolution of an illegal blockade antamina in the first quarter of 2019 antamina produced 1 2 million ounces of attributable silver a decrease of approximately 10 relative to the first quarter of 2018 as expected due to mine sequencing in the open pit and lower mill throughput as a result of the timing of maintenance san dimas in the first quarter of 2019 san dimas produced 10 300 ounces of attributable gold according to first majestic silver corp s first majestic first quarter of 2019 production report the san dimas mill processed a total of 163 264 tonnes with average silver and gold grades of 287 g t and 4 18 g t respectively according to first majestic silver and gold grades improved 10 and 8 respectively compared to the prior quarter due to higher grades in the victoria and jessica areas along with improvements in mine dilution controls sudbury in the first quarter of 2019 vale s sudbury mines produced 10 000 ounces of attributable gold an increase of approximately 186 relative to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher throughput as a reminder production in the first quarter of 2018 was impacted due to the coleman mine being shutdown down for unscheduled maintenance from november 2017 to april 2018 constancia in the first quarter of 2019 constancia produced 0 6 million ounces of attributable silver and 4 800 ounces of attributable gold a decrease of approximately 2 for silver production and an increase of approximately 46 for gold production relative to the first quarter of 2018 as per wheaton s precious metals purchase agreement with hudbay relating to constancia the constancia pmpa should hudbay fail to achieve a minimum level of throughput at the pampacancha satellite deposit during 2018 2019 and 2020 wheaton will be entitled to an increased portion of gold from hudbay as per hudbay s md a for the first quarter of 2019 mining of the pampacancha deposit is not expected to begin until 2020 assuming ore production does not begin until 2020 the company will be entitled to receive an additional 8 020 ounces of gold in 2019 and 2020 relative to the constancia pmpa with the deliveries to be made in quarterly installments of which 2 005 ounces were received during the first quarter of 2019 and reported as production stillwater in the first quarter of 2019 the stillwater mines produced 3 100 ounces of attributable gold and 4 700 ounces of attributable palladium while production was slightly lower than expected due to several factors sibanye stillwater has indicated that additional resources have been deployed with the focus on recovering the lower production over the remainder of the year other gold in the first quarter of 2019 total other gold attributable production was 4 400 ounces a decrease of approximately 47 relative to the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was due primarily to lower production at the minto mine which was placed on care and maintenance in the fourth quarter of 2018 and lower production from the 777 mine other silver in the first quarter of 2019 total other silver attributable production was 2 3 million ounces a decrease of approximately 8 relative to the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of attributable production from the lagunas norte veladero and pierina mines as these streaming interests expired on march 31 2018 in accordance with the pmpa with barrick gold corp barrick partially offset by the start up of attributable production at the aljustrel mine in the second quarter of 2018 development update rosemont in march 2019 hudbay announced the conclusion of the permitting process for rosemont with its receipt of the section 404 water permit from the u s army corps of engineers and the mpo from the u s forest service on march

and a decrease of 500 payable palladium ounces during the three month period ended march 31 2019 payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased primarily as a result of a decrease related to the salobo gold interest partially offset by an increase related to the sudbury gold interest payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered increased slightly primarily as a result of increases related to the yauliyacu and peñasquito silver interests partially offset by a decrease related to the constancia silver interest payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the wheaton group of companies are expected to average approximately two months of annualized production for silver and two to three months for both gold and palladium but may vary from quarter to quarter

earnings per diluted share of 13 85 to 14 45 which reflects solid growth across the company s operating segments a continuation of disciplined efficient capital deployment investments in the business increased costs for opioids litigation and modest improvement in the u k business the fiscal 2020 outlook is based on the following key assumptions and expectations and is also subject to risk factors such as those described below mckesson to deliver low to mid single digit percent revenue growth and flat to low single digit percent adjusted income from operations decline in fiscal 2020 u s pharmaceutical and specialty solutions to deliver low to mid single digit percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2020 european pharmaceutical solutions to deliver low to mid single digit percent revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2020 medical surgical solutions to deliver high single digit percent revenue growth and high single to low double digit percent adjusted operating profit growth in fiscal 2020 other to deliver approximately flat to low single digit percent revenue decline and adjusted operating profit is expected to decline low to mid single digit percent in fiscal 2020 which assumes the company s continued 70 equity interest in change healthcare through march 31 2020 adjusted corporate expenses to be between approximately 725 million and 775 million primarily driven by an anticipated increase in opioid related litigation costs and investments in technology related infrastructure and growth oriented data and analytics capabilities interest expense to be between 245 million and 265 million the guidance range assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 18 19 which may vary from quarter to quarter foreign currency exchange rate movements to have a net neutral impact to adjusted earnings per diluted share year over year free cash flow to be 2 8 billion to 3 0 billion which is net of expected payments

settlements restructuring and asset impairment charges and other adjustments which are difficult to predict and estimate these items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors many of which are beyond the company s control and as such any associated estimate and its impact on gaap performance could vary materially fx adjusted mckesson also presents its financial results on an fx

all workers need to share in their company s success steven pearlstein any defense of the extravagant compensation for corporate executives inevitably boils down to two points first it s fair because it s tied directly to increased profits and second because it provides necessary incentive for these highly talented people to share their excellence and make the often tough decisions necessary to keep their companies competitive what s curious however is how infrequently the same logic is used when talking about the pay of frontline employees who actually produce the goods and services sold by their companies in the age of maximized shareholder value the corporate view widely embraced if rarely given voice in public is that a paycheck at prevailing market wages is all the incentive workers need and all the compensation they deserve no surprise then that after decades of soaring profits and stagnant wages american business faces declining employee engagement loyalty and productivity growth and declining workforce participation what s needed is a new business norm that says all workers should share in the success of their companies with government playing a supporting role nudging things in the right direction the securities and exchange commission could require public companies in their annual report to calculate how much of their profits are shared with top executives and with frontline workers and the tax code should reinforce this norm by denying favorable tax treatment to executive compensation and shareholder buybacks unless such a company wide profit sharing mechanism is in place partnerships small businesses and limited liability corporations that refuse to share profits could be required to forfeit the accounting privilege of passing through their profits to their owners without first paying the corporate tax socialism you say hardly giving workers a return on their investment of hard work talent and loyalty along with their willingness to risk their economic security on an enterprise sounds to me like the very essence of capitalism granted it is not the ruthless selfish capitalism preached by today s market fundamentalists rather it is the fair cooperative capitalism envisioned by adam smith who understood that our own wealth and happiness depends on the wealth and happiness of others steven pearlstein is a business and economics columnist for the washington post and the robinson professor of public affairs at george mason university his book can american capitalism survives was recently published by st martin s press reject the myth that rising inequality is inevitable heidi shierholz view image in fullscreen the modern world does not automatically lead to greater inequality photograph alamy it s by now a familiar story anemic wage growth for most workers and rising inequality have plagued the us labor market since the 1970s funneling an ever greater share of economic growth to the country s most affluent people what is the most important foundational action we can take to begin to halt and reverse these trends it is to stop believing those who claim falsely that these trends are the natural outgrowth of a modern economy an entire industry of economists and other commentators make it their mission to explain that rising inequality is the result of natural forces eg robots that increase demand and wages for workers with certain types of skills leaving others behind this story unsurprisingly has major appeal among those who have benefited from rising inequality and do not want to see these trends interrupted these folks are happy to tout the non disruptive solution their story implies workers who don t want to be left behind should get more education and training the problem with this tale it s a work of fiction the hard evidence clearly shows that our increasingly unequal economy is not the inevitable outcome of a modern world inexorably driven by forces like automation and relatedly while accelerating the pace at which the us workforce acquires more education and training would help some individuals it will not put a dent in the issue of rising inequality only after rejecting the notion that rising inequality is natural and inescapable can we focus on reversing the forces that have been suppressing wages for most workers and thus boosting inequality namely the deliberate policy choices either by omission or commission that have shifted power from workers to their employers these include policymakers opting not to increase the minimum wage allowing its purchasing power to decline over time turning the manageable challenge of globalization into a deep economic wound for working people via trade agreements that have consistently placed corporate profits over workers rights failing to protect the fundamental right of workers to associate and bargain collectively in the face of ferocious employer assaults on these rights the list goes on the truth is we have the economy we choose and in recent decades we have chosen policies that hamstring the bargaining power of working people channeling economic growth away from workers and toward the wealthy rejecting the myth that rising inequality is a foregone conclusion in a modern economy is the first step towards getting to the real work of addressing the policy driven power imbalances that have resulted in an economy that works for the few and leaves the rest behind heidi shierholz is director of policy at the economic policy institute and served as chief economist at the us department of labor give jobless americans a lift with a new commuter credit james p ziliak view image in fullscreen the second largest expenditure in the budget of a typical us consumer is transportation photograph peter foley epa for most people a job is a necessary protection against poverty and employment rates of men especially among those with less than four years of college have been declining for 50 years the rates for women have also been falling since 2000 the detachment of millions of americans from paid work has hit rural americans particularly hard we need policies that bring jobs to people but we also need to bring people to jobs one way to do this is to subsidize the cost of getting to work specifically i propose a refundable commuter s credit in a new report from the aspen institute s economic strategy group life without a car is nearly impossible in rural areas where access to public transportation is all but nonexistent things are not much better in many urban areas outside our major metropolitan centers the second largest expenditure in the budget of a typical us consumer is transportation this burden is greatest in rural areas a commuter s credit would be a transportation subsidy to workers in their first 12 months of employment in a new job it would be provided through local government employment centers and be available to people who a are at least 18 years of age b are unemployed or out of the labor force and c have secured employment offering at least 30 hours per week at the federal minimum wage or higher to reduce incentives for short term job flipping the credit would be limited to no more than 12 months in any 24 month period for cost containment the number of subsidized miles could be capped at 20 per day and 5 000 per year for non metro residents and 10 miles per day and 2 500 per year for metro residents this amount would place the credit on par with the average earned income tax credit for families with qualifying children it would also result in a much larger credit for childless workers providing a much needed lift to the incentive to work with this credit we can help americans get work by helping them get to work james ziliak is gatton endowed chair in microeconomics director of the center for poverty research executive director of the kentucky federal statistical research data center top up workers wages big time lane kenworthy view image in fullscreen inequality could be addressed through the tax system photograph alamy stock photo incomes of american households in the middle and at the bottom of the ladder have grown too slowly for 40 years the chief culprit stagnant wages the nature of modern capitalism us corporate culture and labor union weakness make this likely to continue what is to be done raising the minimum wage is good policy but it benefits mainly those at the very bottom some see employee election of corporate board members as a way to compensate for weak unions but it doesn t appear to have helped germany avoid a similar wage problem to help a broader swath of workers we should significantly expand and strengthen the earned income tax credit eitc right now the eitc provides an average of 2 300 to households with at least one employed adult and modest earnings with some changes the eitc could do a lot more to top up wages that are rising slowly if at all first we should pay the eitc to individuals rather than households among other benefits this will enhance work incentive for second earners second the eitc should include workers higher up the distribution the current eitc starts to taper off once earnings reach a certain level and disappears altogether at household earnings of 55 000 we should give every person who earns at least 10 000 the same amount say 3 500 and raise the earnings cutoff so that about 80 of employed americans qualify this will be especially helpful for workers without children who currently get only 500 extending the reach and generosity of the credit will also ensure the program s political constituency is rock solid third the eitc should be increased more each year right now it is indexed to inflation let s instead tie it to gdp per capita so it can help incomes rise as the economy grows an eitc of 3 500 going to the bottom 80 of employed americans would cost about 2 of gdp or around 400bn that is expensive but we can afford to do it given the likelihood that wage stagnation is the new normal we can scarcely afford not to lane kenworthy is yankelovich endowed chair professor of sociology at the university of california san diego a payroll payout for low wage workers oren cass view image in fullscreen subsidising wages is a solution that can be applied immediately while we tackle the long term task of reversing decades of misguided policies photograph mark lennihan ap in 1975 the median income for a man with a high school degree supported a family of four at more than twice the poverty line by 2016 a comparable family cleared the poverty threshold by less than 40 just one quarter of young men aged 25 34 had annual earnings below 30 000 in 1975 by 2016 that figure reached 41 a complex range of social and economic factors have driven wages down and workers out restoring the labor market to health not only reversing the trends but also making up for lost time will be the work of a generation but in the short run policymakers can begin to make progress in the most direct way possible by putting more money in low wage paychecks the new wage subsidy would work like a reverse payroll tax just as every paycheck has a line called fica that makes deductions in proportion to the worker s earnings another line called work credit could add money when the worker s wage is low this would operate by setting a target wage of say 15 per hour and then paying a subsidy that closes half the gap between the market wage and the target a paycheck for 40 hours worked at 9 per hour would come with a work credit of 3 per hour or an extra 120 the subsidy would diminish as a worker s hourly wage approached 15 and work compensated above the target wage would be unsubsidized such a subsidy would have two major positive effects first it would increase the quantity of work performed by lower wage workers someone who chooses not to work for 9 per hour might accept a job at 12 while an employer who could not employ someone profitably at 12 per hour might gladly do so at 9 both sides benefit from the subsidy workers come off the sidelines and employers build business models more likely to use them second it would increase the price the worker receives for his labor and thus his take home pay low income households could more easily make ends meet via government support that comes tied to work unlike traditional safety net benefits that ignore work or discourage it america s long term goal must be a labor market that offers family supporting jobs to people of all backgrounds and aptitudes but the hole dug by decades of misguided policies with regard to regulations education trade immigration labor and fiscal policy will not be climbed out of quickly a wage subsidy that encourages reconnection to the labor market and boosts wages at the low end is one policy that can happen right now oren cass is a senior fellow at the manhattan institute and the author of the once and future worker a vision for the renewal of work in america capitalism is not broken robert doar view image in fullscreen a middle class suburban neighborhood in atlanta the middle class is shrinking but so is the lower class photograph alamy stock photo capitalism is not broken it does not always work perfectly of course but the free market combined with our strong safety net has drastically reduced poverty and improved quality of life for the vast majority of americans a free and healthy economy ensures that wealth is being generated and allocated to those who contribute to its creation that s why our current economic health has led to increases in production and why wage growth for workers in the bottom half of the pay scale is outpacing those in the top half with unemployment low and labor force participation ticking up more people are going to enjoy the fruits of a dynamic capitalist economy here s a big idea something to keep in mind as you hear about inequality and mobility the middle class is shrinking which might make it look like capitalism is failing workers but the lower class is shrinking too meanwhile the upper class is bigger than it has ever been about 28 of households now make more than 100 000 per year more than double the rate of 40 years ago more than half of americans will be part of the top 10 of earners at some point in their lifetimes contrary to much contemporary rhetoric workers in the us are getting richer not poorer as competition in the free market allows them to purchase a greater variety of goods for less money than ever before to be sure life is about more than money many analysts from right and left worry about the tendency of market capitalism to decimate institutions and drain small communities of their vitality they have a point the pursuit of economic mobility often entails leaving people places and ways of life behind we should be mindful of how we can support what the supreme court justice louis brandeis called the quality and spiritual value of local communities but a free market can provide a solution here too employers seeking the best and brightest can and should offer more to employees by way of childcare skills training and other benefits that help keep families and communities thriving and ultimately each and every individual can and must choose their own path that isn t a vice of capitalism it s a virtue a free market is the emergent order of free people freely making their own decisions trying to fix that would be badly misguided rumors of the death of mobility have been greatly exaggerated capitalism isn t broken it s our best shot at keeping the american dream of freedom and success alive give american workers a long overdue pay raise isabel sawhill view image in fullscreen average earnings have been stagnant for the past 40 years photograph alamy stock photo it has been a long time since the typical american worker got a significant increase in pay their average hourly or weekly earnings have been stagnant for the past 40 years it s time to give them a raise one way to do this is to provide a worker tax credit to everyone making less than about 40 000 a year the idea is to directly subsidize the pay of less skilled workers compensating them for the hit they have taken as trade and technology have destroyed well paid jobs and inhibited wage growth it would send a signal to these workers that they have not been forgotten that their contributions to the economy are valuable and deserve to be more adequately rewarded it would boost employment and encourage marriage it would give them what they want which is a decently paid job not welfare yes it would be expensive but the alternatives are far worse declining employment distressed communities rising mortality rates less family stability rising dependence on disability or other forms of assistance and the kind of political alienation that elected someone like president trump to be sure there are other ways to accomplish this objective raising the minimum wage encouraging the private sector to share profits with workers or subsidizing work related expenses such as childcare all have merit so does better education and training to raise productivity and earning power over the longer run but for now a worker tax credit is the most direct and visible way to send a signal to lower paid workers that their contributions are valued and respected how would it work the credit would be equal to 15 of one s earnings up to a cap of about 15 000 and then phase out gradually above that level it would be delivered directly to the worker s paycheck offsetting payroll taxes and boosting take home pay think of it as negative withholding or a simple adjustment to paychecks similar to what employers already do employers would be reimbursed by the treasury so unlike a higher minimum wage or some other proposals it would cost them nothing it would instead ask the wealthiest americans to pay the tab via higher taxes on incomes or wealth that top group has enjoyed almost all of the benefits of economic growth unless those benefits are more broadly shared our economic and social divisions will only widen so let s give workers a raise that unlike president trump s promises to this group will actually improve their lives and sustain democratic capitalism as we have known it isabel sawhill is senior fellow in economic studies and director of budgeting for the national priorities project at the brookings institution provide high quality childcare abigail wozniak view image in fullscreen working parents need access to quality childcare in spite of their time engaging with their children not instead of it photograph hero images getty images hero images in the united states access to qualitycare for children is a pressing concern for the majority of families it should be a priority for policymakers parents are employed outside the home in nearly 60 of us households with children under the age of 12 this large share stems from two facts many us families have two earners and working single parents have no non working co parents at home with women s labor force participation in most european countries approaching or exceeding that in the us childcare provision is a concern in many parts of the globe despite this rise in parents working and the need for childcare usage data shows that us parents are finding ways to spend more time not less with their children working parents need access to quality childcare in spite of their time engaging with their children not instead of it fortunately decades of research show that well designed high quality childcare programs offer social and economic returns that far exceed their costs indeed high quality childcare programs offer considerable returns for jurisdictions large or small that undertake it evaluations of early high quality but small public pre school programs found an eightfold social return to dollars invested in such programs studies of recent expansions of pre school programs to large statewide populations show that such programs are on track to generate similar returns local economic development benefits are a subset of total benefits but these alone are estimated at 2 3 per 1 invested however there are important limits to this largely successful track record government expansion of childcare has not always improved outcomes for children benefits of attending a high quality early childhood program are largest for children from under resourced homes long term impacts for children from more resourced families can be small or even negative programs that prioritize freeing parents for work outside the home may emphasize childcare availability at the expense of quality that s why successful expansions of childcare access must contain at least two key ingredients 1 they use curricula and formats demonstrated as high quality and that evaluate innovations rigorously and 2 they prioritize family and child welfare over narrower goals while considering broad measures of welfare that go beyond adult earnings our children deserve no less and actually much more abigail wozniak is the director of the

margetta morgan the rules of our economy and democracy have been captured by a vicious one two punch the first punch lowered taxes at the top especially capital gains estate and marginal income tax and cut back government regulation antitrust enforcement and protections for labor unions the second punch hit public spending on social welfare on the grounds that it is inherently inefficient free market rhetoric used racialized caricatures like welfare queens to demonize government programs as wasteful misallocations of resources to irresponsible our economy rewards those with power unchecked power does what it does best replicates and concentrates but now america s political landscape is shifting social movements and labor unions are confronting racial gender environmental and economic injustice head on we have an opportunity to make a fundamental course correction progressives can punch back with a one two counter of their own as we argue in a roosevelt institute report new rules for the 21st century first by striking at the heart of plutocracy and breaking up the extreme concentration of wealth through more robust tax policy and antitrust enforcement along with corporate governance and labor law reform second by reimagining interventions as a positive exercises in public power the role of government reaches far beyond subsides for corporations or market based interventions direct government provision particularly through public options that can compete away inferior and extractive private options is the most effective policy public power can be used to spur private sector competition and innovation and it can also be used to prevent extractive or unjust outcomes government power can be used to intentionally foster race and gender inclusion diminish the divisive premium on social identities such as whiteness that serve the economic and political interests of the top this in turn would leave us all white people included less vulnerable to the consolidation of economic power we see today
the impressive retraction in the us equity markets since the 24th of december 2018 the day that the severe sell off in us equities was finally halted has been awe inspiring especially as it was artificially generated in an attempt to support an illusion of economic prosperity within the context of the present global recessionary environment you could almost think of it as the day grinch mugged santa and stole the christmas rally and subsequent year end bonus and dividend payouts to understand the mechanics of how it was done you first need to look at the wti and jnk charts west texas international or wti is basically another name for the price of us oil brent being the price for international oil which is more along the lines of opec and the prop that supports the petro dollar jnk is the index for junk bonds they are termed junk because they are bonds which are rated at bbb b or even b meaning that these are highly risky loans given to corporations that are struggling or may even go bankrupt but still need finance most shale oil companies in the us are startups and they acquire funding on the high risk junk bond market for these companies to be profitable they need a high price fix on the wti index which in turn releases funding from the junk bond funds which then again in turn drive up the jnk index it is during this final phase that the cta commodity trading adviser algorithms which is another name for hedge fund machines pick up the jnk value figures and correspondingly buy us equities in order to ramp up the relevant stock index values the actual mechanism is very simple you place orders on the wti futures markets which you in turn never fulfil spoofing these futures then drive up the price of wti shale companies then ask for loans at the b rated fund providers bonds are bought and the jnk index goes up and you are then left to just hang back and watch as the cta machines match the corresponding rising jnk index by ramping up the s p500 this will not last very long and it will also not end well because of the simple reason that you are artificially raising the price of an oversupplied commodity oil within an impending global recession in order to indirectly manipulate the price of your target index manipulating a secondary market jnk and wti to influence a primary market s p500 dow30 the present us administration uses this primary index the us stock markets as a report card to showcase the illusionary positive effects that their policies are having on the us economy and in turn appeal to the us workers and in selling them a dream now as the equity markets are being ramped up artificially to all time highs a case is being made for future inflation and if the us federal reserve then even hints at raising interest rates in order to cool down a supposedly super charged economy the indexes will crash the reason why higher interest rates make borrowing money for buy backs more expensive for us corporations us corporations buying back their own stocks is the only thing driving their index values up rather than borrowing money to invest in new plants new machinery or skills development for the health well being and knowledge acquisition of their workers so as to increase productivity investors sensing that their stocks might not ramp up any higher then sell and hoard cash and buy us treasury bonds which in simple terms means investing in the us state rather than in us corporations and correspondingly the equity market falls this is the current desperate measure being used as we speak but it has hit a wall wti can only reach a certain figure beyond which it will be impossible to move higher firstly due to the theory of supply and demand and secondly the fact that over priced oil will adversely affect the economies of china and india currently the two major sources of cheap labour and finished materials for us and european consumers and industries wherein both countries rely on 80 of their oil needs having to be imported jnk has also hit a wall and the s p and dow are struggling to breach all time highs these deceptive manipulations to artificially inflate us stocks have now become very obvious and is setting up a scenario for a sudden and catastrophic drop in us equities that may well test and perhaps even surpass the lows of december 2018 the current formula in simpler words is this buy oil futures because it will drive junk bonds higher and the stock market will follow however none of these wti futures options contracts will ever be intentionally fulfilled they are being left to expire as un filled orders the us dollar index however is not buying this the usdx should weaken instead it is rising and this is in turn hurting the stocks and currencies of the emerging economies think turkey with regard to their currency and india with being the world s 8th largest economy as prime examples the turkish central bank is desperately burning up their us dollar reserves in an attempt to prevent the lira from drastically devaluing and the indian stock markets keep falling as the dollar gets stronger and the indian central bank or the reserve bank of india is forced to keep buying the dip to support the exchange the rbi has also initiated currency swap arrangements with the bank of japan and the central bank of the uae to borrow money on very short term lending agreements which the rbi then declares as foreign exchange reserves during reporting times and lends it on to indian corporations and banks via mutual funds to buy back their stocks this is direct rbi intervention in the stock market whose role is to regulate rather than influence and that to after the rbi has dropped interest rates twice within the past 4 months to support the incumbent in his re election bid an imminent violently destructive cta generated correction in us equities will have a detrimental effect on the indian exchanges at a time critical for the outcome of the largest election in the world which is also the most important election for european and us corporatism this century as the vast resources and labour capital of india remain the final frontier to fully and comprehensively re exploit 70 plus years after the dramatic loss of business incurred by the city of london following the events post 1945 leading on from the defeat of fascism by the combined efforts of the heroic red army and the 4 million subcontinental volunteer soldiers of the colonial imperial british 8th and 14th army whereby european corporations found themselves reluctantly needing to have to give up their hold over the jewel in the crown now is the best opportunity for them to re colonise india under a compliant bjp led government corporations find it economically efficient to conduct transactions with autocratic governments which rule with little to no transparency or accountability to their electorates a one stop shop infact elections and the will of the people are an irritating theatre that must be adhered to within the spirit of the greater good and provide an illusion that the people s aspirations are being met bread and circuses for the people hand outs instead of a hand up allow the electorate to certify the mandate of the multinational corporations choice then present that as the will of the people and initiate the process of selling the nation by the great british pound the survival of the city of london wall street and frankfurt depends exclusively on the outcome of the 2019 indian general election a result that will be swayed in the right direction at any cost towards the current incumbent the economic model of europe prior to 1939 was based on colonial expropriation where asia and africa provided the raw materials resources and labour at near zero cost which were then fabricated into final finished goods within european factories and then subsequently sold back into the pliant and captured colonial markets at a huge markup this extremely efficient economic model allowed for a dramatic improvement in the social conditions of european workers whose self determination for their own economic welfare was paid off and subsidised by the efforts of their fellow colonial workers it also marked the exact time that karl marx laid out his clear and precise scientific economic theory the advent of direct british rule in india by which i mean the territory from peshawar to dhaka and all points in between which constituted the crown s direct realm and not the territory that represents the current republic of india corresponds exactly to the time when marx presented himself to europe and it provided the roaring fuel that sustained the industrial revolution with unlimited free raw material and resources corporations are now in a crisis for their own survival and a favourable outcome in the 2019 indian republic elections engineered towards the business friendly incumbent during a stock market meltdown is the only way forward for them to be able to save themselves from a broad and deep social upheaval that underpins their global influence its show time as michael keaton famously said in the movie bettlejuice supratim barman msc queen mary university of london kolkata the republic of india i live between the two extreme edges of what was the british empire in the vast and important cities of kolkata and london with

supplement the information provided by the financial statements presented in accordance with gaap with several customer focused performance metrics and non gaap financial measures which are utilized by our management to evaluate our performance although we believe these measures are widely used in the wireless industry some may not be defined by us in precisely the same way as by other companies in the wireless industry so there may not be reliable ways to compare us to other companies adjusted ebitda represents net loss the most directly comparable gaap measure excluding amounts for income tax expense interest expense depreciation amortization and accretion equity based compensation recorded as a component of general and administrative expense gain on disposal of assets and sale leaseback transaction and all other non operating income and expenses adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda divided by service revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are common measures of operating performance in the telecommunications industry we believe adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are helpful measures because they allow us to evaluate our performance by removing from our operating results items that do not relate to our core operating performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss the most directly comparable gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not defined in the same manner

that are not calculated in accordance with gaap including ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps such measures are not recognized terms under gaap should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap and are not indicative of net income as determined under gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow adjusted diluted eps and other non gaap financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate pfg s liquidity or financial performance ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation management measures operating performance based on pfg s ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income taxes and depreciation and amortization pfg believes that the presentation of ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of pfg s performance pfg believes this measure is a useful metric to assess pfg s operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that pfg believes are not representative of pfg s core business pfg also uses this measure to evaluate the performance of its segments and for business planning purposes in addition management uses adjusted ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results such adjustments include certain unusual non cash non recurring cost reduction and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the pfg s credit agreement and indenture other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indenture relating to the adjusted ebitda contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date under pfg s credit agreement and indenture pfg s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and indenture management also uses free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures purchases of property plant and equipment pfg also believes that the presentation of free cash flow enhances an investor s understanding of pfg s ability to make strategic investments and manage debt levels management also uses adjusted diluted eps which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in pfg s calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as certain one time income tax items to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable gaap financial measure pfg believes that the presentation of ebitda adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted diluted eps is useful to investors because these metrics provide insight into underlying business trends and year over year results and are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in pfg s industry the following tables include a

a man panhandles for money and food on april 7 2015 in new york city the great depression and the factors that caused it are not as distant as most of us may believe them to be spencer platt getty images if you didn t live through the great depression that started in the late 1920s and lasted until the beginning of world war ii it s hard to imagine just how rough many ordinary americans had it at the depression s peak in 1933 the nation s gross domestic product had been cut roughly in half and nearly one in four american workers was unemployed since they didn t have money to pay their mortgages the foreclosure rate more than doubled and people who lost their homes found themselves erecting cardboard and scrap wood shacks and living in camps known as hoovervilles named after president herbert hoover whom many blamed for the depression on the edge of towns and cities in this 2007 interview published by the federal reserve bank of st louis two men who survived the depression describe how people around them often were so desperate for food that they eagerly rooted through garbage bins at markets for discarded vegetables and spoiled chicken carcasses even after franklin roosevelt s new deal program eased some of the deprivation the nation s battered economy continued to struggle right up until the war brought a massive surge in government spending and created jobs at defense plants for those who didn t go off to fight overseas as this article from the fdr library explains advertisement why did the great depression happen and could it ever happen again the depression s causes have been a longtime subject of debate by historians and economists though there seems to be a consensus that the economic disaster was the result of multiple factors some of which led to the event while others worsened or prolonged it and while the nation s economy the financial system and government regulation have changed considerably since the 1920s and 1930s experts warn that we re still not immune to some of the same risks that contributed to the catastrophe worse yet some mistakes of that era are now being repeated here s a list of five factors that helped lead to the great depression
may 8 2019 by ola lisowski this week the joint finance committee jfc is back to the state capitol to kick off the first executive session on the 2019 21 biennial budget since gov tony evers introduced his budget back in late february the budget writing committee held agency briefings and then toured the state to hear from the public now it s finally time to begin voting let s take this opportunity to refresh your memory on the contents of the budget every budget cycle the legislative fiscal bureau lfb produces a list of purely non fiscal policy items and it s up to the budget chairs whether or not they want to pull them out lfb s list contained 70 items for consideration those items will be tossed this is standard procedure the very same budget chairs sen alberta darling r river hills and rep john nygren r marinette also tossed dozens of non fiscal provisions from the last budget when gov scott walker a republican was in the east wing this time the chairs went further than lfb by doubling the list of pulled items to more than 130 provisions among those are some of the most controversial items in the entire document including acceptance of federal medicaid dollars and tax increases on manufacturers and retirees at thursday s executive session the first thing the committee will do will be to formally vote to pull those items which include more than 1 billion in tax increases expect a long debate on that before they move to other budget matters including educational communications board medical college of wisconsin historical society governor lieutenant governor program supplements ethics commission investment board employment relations commission administration division of gaming health services care and treatment services shared revenue and tax relief direct aid payments shared revenue and tax relief forestry mill rate transportation state patrol revenue department wide as the budget committee begins to make its way through the behemoth spending document let s review the issues that you the taxpayer need to know about even without some of the more controversial provisions that will be stripped from the document evers proposal would still spend billions more than current spending levels the basics evers budget proposal would increase spending by 7 6 percent or 2 7 billion over current spending levels to 38 3 billion in general purpose revenue gpr considering all funds the document would spend 84 2 billion over two years 7 billion in actual dollars more than walker s last budget using base year doubled math the funding increase is 6 87 billion the proposal would increase total all funds positions to nearly 71 991 in the second year a 701 position increase of government jobs from all funding sources gpr positions would increase to 35 670 by the second year in the biennium a position increase of 391 from current levels it also makes income taxes more progressive by targeting more income tax relief on lower tax brackets while increasing income taxes for higher earners taxes in the general fund would increase by a total of 1 64 billion over the biennium general tax cuts including a new middle class tax credit and expansion of other already existing credits total 951 4 million that means in all the net tax increase to wisconsin taxpayers would be 688 7 million over the next two years however those are just taxes at the state level this budget would increase local taxes and fees in a variety of other ways such as removal of property tax controls which will push this total much higher the most curious omission in evers budget is an apparent lack of reference to walker s signature 2011 reform act 10 which was repeatedly slammed by evers on the campaign trail and in years past nowhere does the budget seek to roll back taxpayer protections created by the law including increased contribution levels for public sector employee benefits or annual union recertification votes tax increases tax cuts evers budget proposal introduces myriad tax hikes to at least partly pay for massive spending increases first on the docket is a tax increase introduced by his office several weeks ago a partial rollback of the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit mac that change would limit the job credit for manufacturers to the first 300 000 of qualified income the move would raise 516 7 million in tax revenue over the biennium by raising taxes on those manufacturers according to one recent analysis by the tax foundation nearly 70 percent of wisconsin manufacturing firms pay the individual income tax rate instead of the corporate tax rate since those companies are organized as pass through businesses all of their business income is taxed as individual income in other words a manufacturer who earns 300 000 or more may appear to be part of wisconsin s upper echelon of earners but all of that business owner s equipment and inventory is included in the figure as darling said on the senate floor you know a farmer is dealing with a budget that might be 1 3 5 or 6 million dollars they re not taking that money home those are just the expenses they have to deal with if a retiree cashes in a stock they ve held for years those earnings would have been taxed at the highest rate available under an evers budget proposal that move pulled out by jfc would have punished taxpayers who are successful or preparing for retirement to the tune of 505 1 million more in taxes another change would increase the long term capital gains tax under current law long term capital investment gains are taxed at a 5 355 percent rate the budget proposal removes part of an existing exclusion so that those gains are taxed at the top individual income tax rate of 7 65 percent for certain earners individuals earning less than 100 000 and married joint filers earning less than 150 000 would keep paying the capital gains tax at the 5 355 percent rate while earners above them would move to 7 65 percent if a retiree cashes in a stock they ve held for years those earnings will again be taxed this time at the highest rate available that move punishes taxpayers who are successful or preparing for retirement to the tune of 505 1 million more in taxes this is where jfc s move to strip certain policy items from the budget comes in both the tax hikes on manufacturers and on certain capital gains will be pulled out of the budget the budget committee will also toss the proposed repeal of the private school tuition deduction and proposed restructuring of both the earned income tax credit and homestead tax credits tax items that remain in the budget include a proposed 10 percent tax cut on the middle class taxes on e cigarettes and vaping products and taxes on brown cigars the budget chairs will also keep the creation of first time home buyer savings accounts and a new medical care insurance deduction for self employed persons the state will also begin collecting sales taxes on online purchases and that money will go toward lowering the bottom most individual income tax rate late in his campaign evers announced plans for a 10 percent tax cut on the middle class the administration is proposing a tax credit called the family and individual reinvestment fair credit individuals earning below 80 000 and married joint filers earning below 125 000 will receive a tax credit of 10 percent of their net tax liability or 100 whichever is greater the credit phases out at 100 000 for single earners and 150 000 for married joint filers that provision remains in the budget today in addition to all the ways evers budget would raise taxes at the state level his plan proposes allowing local governments to increase property taxes in several different ways when combined into individual tax bills property owners could be in for a real shock next year many of those provisions have been pulled out by jfc first evers would have eliminated the school levy tax credit and the first dollar tax credit those credits would provide about 2 billion in property tax relief over the next two years without the change school districts would also be able to hold referendums whenever they want doing away with several important controls on property taxes at the state level both of those changes are nixed by the budget chairs next evers would adjust revenue caps for municipalities counties and tech school districts currently they can only increase their levy by their percentage of net new construction from the previous year the budget proposal would set a minimum increase of 2 percent most communities currently have less than 1 percent growth each year and the state average for 2018 was 1 62 percent as a result of this change 85 percent of wisconsin communities would see the municipal county and tech college portions of their property tax bills grow at a faster rate year after year than they do now the plan would also increase property taxes on big businesses by allowing municipalities to base property taxes on the basis of that business total income rather than the value of a given property individuals who own homes aren t charged property taxes based on their income they re charged based on the value of their home or land this shift would fundamentally change how property taxation is calculated in wisconsin both this change and the revenue cap adjustments for municipalities counties and tech school districts are tossed out by the budget committee finally local governments would be allowed to raise fees without having to lower their tax levies in exchange this means local governments could start charging residents for things like garbage pickup and recycling without having to lower property taxes in other words if you re not paying for things like garbage pickup right now chances are you will be in a surprising move this change was left in by jfc one final note on taxes apart from the minor shift on income taxes described above evers budget does not raise the general sales corporate or individual income tax rates for all the tax increases tucked into other parts of the budget the governor stayed away from a doyle style ramping up of individual income tax rates consider us pleasantly surprised on this front health care perhaps the most important item that the budget committee tossed out with non fiscal policy items was the acceptance of federal medicaid dollars expect that to be a big part of the discussion during the first executive session evers budget would have accepted the federal medicaid expansion under obamacare while significantly increasing spending on a wide range of programs the medicaid expansion has been a costly proposition for states that accepted it medicaid spending in ohio for example skyrocketed 35 percent in four years from 18 9 billion to 25 7 billion between fiscal year 2013 and 2017 and in minnesota premiums increased 50 67 percent forcing the state to implement a reinsurance program costing taxpayers at least 800 million so far the federal dollars that follow a medicaid expansion are anything but free money as advocates persistently claim premiums headed into 2017 were expected to increase by a staggering 50 67 percent as opposed to wisconsin s 16 percent hike as a result minnesota was forced to come up with 300 million to bail out 123 000 struggling minnesotans who did not qualify for federal obamacare subsidies the bloodletting of minnesota taxpayers didn t stop there the following year the minnesota legislature spent an additional 542 million to establish a reinsurance program to hold down costs despite these and many other stark cautionary tales evers proposed expanding medicaid eligibility to everyone earning between 100 138 percent of the federal poverty level in 2019 that income level is 34 638 for a family of four making 82 000 more people eligible for the program however about half of the 82 000 people who would become eligible for medicaid already have employer provided coverage the rest those who earn between 13 000 and 17 000 qualify for plans on the obamacare exchanges with premium costs as low as 18 cents a month the annual deductible for those people is just 50 that means many people who join the program would be moving backward from self sufficiency to dependence on government health care when tens of thousands of impoverished wisconsinites can get health insurance for just 18 cents per month it s a clear sign that the state doesn t need to go further or put future budgets at risk the budget asserts that expanding medicaid will save 325 million in gpr across the biennium because of the federal government s enhanced 90 percent match versus traditional medicaid a tenuous stream of dollars from a federal government already drowning in 22 trillion in debt as with traditional medicaid and its notoriously low reimbursement rates the federal government is likely to back off that enhanced match in the future and leave state taxpayers holding the very expensive bag nonetheless evers budget proposal accepts and then immediately spends the 325 million plus a lot more on increased payments to health care providers and other new spending accepting money from the federal government is a serious risk as dozens of states learned with chip dollars if wisconsin does the same with medicaid dollars we risk much more than we can gain the federal government has a history of reneging on fiscal promises for states just look at children s health insurance program chip reimbursement rates in that instance states built their budgets on promised federal dollars federal funding for chip expired in late 2017 and states were left picking up the slack by putting in more state dollars or cutting coverage when the federal government backed out of paying what it promised more than 452 000 texans were affected when the state had to begin phasing out the program accepting money from the federal government is a serious risk as dozens of states learned with chip dollars if wisconsin does the same with medicaid dollars we risk much more than we can gain the budget spends 365 million more on reimbursement payments to hospitals serving medicaid patients through five different more traditional reimbursement avenues that includes 142 million more in payments to hospitals handling a larger number of medicaid patients than most 100 million more for payments to acute care and critical access hospitals 20 million more for payments to pediatric hospitals and 1 2 million more for rural hospitals all of those changes stay in the budget the budget builds off gov walker s reinsurance program aimed at holding down premiums on the individual health insurance market in the era of obamacare s skyrocketing premiums the continuation of this walker era program is a not so subtle admission that obamacare has failed spectacularly to bend the cost curve down and that failure is costing wisconsin taxpayers dearly the budget buttresses the program with 200 million in all funds spending for the office of the commissioner of insurance in the second year of the budget while the walker administration when he rolled out the plan said it would cost taxpayers 34 million out of state coffers evers plan hikes the oci budget by more than 72 million in the second year of the budget in state spending or gpr and by more than 200 million in all funds in the budget s second year to fully fund the program that change also stayed transportation the department of transportation dot gets a 627 million boost in the governor s budget bringing the total up to 6 63 billion from last budget s 6 billion of any agency budget dot s was kept the most intact by the finance committee both the gas tax increase and indexing are left in the budget however the change to the minimum markup law was pulled out the plan calls for increasing the gas tax immediately by 8 cents bringing it up to 40 9 cents and producing an additional 264 million for the state it would go up another one cent as a result of indexing starting in april 2020 many lawmakers like indexing because it s an automatic tax it rigs transportation tax revenue to automatically increase without forcing legislators to actually cast a vote on the hike in essence it s taxation without representation wisconsin would be the fifth state in the country to tie its gas tax to the consumer price index evers also wants to increase vehicle registration fees by 10 for a total of 85 annually create a new hybrid vehicle fee of 75 per car and hike heavy truck fees by 27 percent he claims these increases will be offset by eliminating the minimum markup on fuel the minimum markup law is a depression era relic that sets a price floor on numerous products including prescription drugs and gasoline the minimum markup on products other than gas is maintained in evers proposal of any agency budget dot s was kept the most intact by the finance committee both the gas tax increase and indexing are left in the budget however the change to the minimum markup law was pulled out the budget proposal would cut funding to major highway projects by 5 5 million and to the highway mega projects category by 203 7 million most of evers attention in the state highway program goes to the state highway rehabilitation program which he increases by 225 7 million over the 2017 19 budget his main priority with road funding is on increasing road aids to local governments most local transportation aid comes in the form of general transportation aids gta and is disbursed according to the calendar year as opposed to the fiscal year which runs july to june this year the state will distribute 348 639 300 to municipal governments and 111 093 800 to county governments evers wants to boost that by 10 percent that comes out to 383 503 200 for municipalities and 122 203 200 for counties next year he also wants to increase the mileage aid to 2 628 per mile the transportation budget includes 338 million in additional bonding authority for transportation over the current budget evers budget would do away with the fed swap law which requires dot to consolidate federal funding into as few major highway projects as possible the axed reform saves money by limiting the number of projects subject to the more stringent and costly federal requirements including prevailing wage the budget committee s changes to the bill include pulling out evers change to fed swap big labor evers first budget handsomely rewards his big labor allies and is a full on assault on worker freedom jfc took massive swipes at this particular section of the budget big labor was perhaps the biggest loser in all of jfc s changes with evers proposals for right to work prevailing wage and project labor agreements all stripped out many of these provisions are part of welfare reform which we ll cover in more detail later in this piece what evers planned to do is bring back forced union dues reinstate artificial wage floors that cost taxpayers big and force the return of union exclusivity contracts before jfc s changes the budget restored the prevailing wage law for state and local public works projects evers asserts bringing back the great depression era relic ensures that workers are not underpaid relative to other workers performing similar in the area his budget plan permits the project labor agreements for public works projects that the former governor signed out of existence in 2017 plas stipulate that only union firms can bid on a project and many units of government required them shutting out non union shops the republican led reform law prohibits a government from requiring a pla as a condition to bid on a taxpayer funded project a big win for the free market and the taxpayers who benefit from increased competition democrats have argued the law is yet another attack on unions and that it limits local control the governor s budget plan also gets rid of a reform law aimed that ends the patchwork of employment laws statewide evers provision would repeal preemption of costly local government ordinances on family and medical leave wage claims employee benefits hours of work and overtime and solicitation of prospective employees salary histories the preemption reforms require such employment regulations to be governed by uniform statewide policy not created through the whims of local governments at business and taxpayer expense jfc s changes pulled out evers proposals regarding the prevailing wage right to work and plas k 12 education property tax levels are largely driven by spending in schools another issue area where this proposal would spend vastly more evers budget proposal for k 12 education largely mirrors the budget request submitted last fall by the department of public instruction dpi when he was the head of that agency the total changes would increase dpi spending by nearly 1 6 billion over the biennium more than the dpi budget request it s also more than twice the dollar amount of the last budget s increase to k 12 education that bill upped spending by more than 630 million in the biennium the highest dollar amount in history at the time the majority of k 12 dollars flow through equalization aid also known as general aid which exists to even out funding disparities in local property taxes property poor districts such as milwaukee public schools mps receive disproportionately high amounts of equalization aid forms of aid like the school levy tax credit and the first dollar credit are considered categorical aid and are distributed equally across school districts under evers plan the school finance formula would significantly change and billions more dollars would flow through equalization aid the school levy tax credit and first dollar credit would be eliminated in the first year with that funding instead moving to general aid that move alone is likely to increase property taxes since money that is now used to offset local property taxes will instead flow directly to schools the plan includes a hold harmless provision so that no district will receive less in state funding than current law limits on school district referenda implemented in recent years would be done away with school districts would no longer be limited in the number of referenda they may hold in a calendar year another measure certain to increase property taxes across the state jfc changes delete evers proposal to eliminate those property tax credits as well as his proposals on school district referenda the hold harmless provision is maintained as is the additional funding weight for economically disadvantaged students jfc changes delete evers proposal to eliminate those property tax credits as well as his proposals on school district referenda the hold harmless provision is maintained as is the additional funding weight for economically disadvantaged students other changes to k 12 funding include an increase in the revenue limit adjustment by 200 in the first year and 204 in the second year with future increases indexed to inflation the plan also increases the low revenue adjustment from 9 100 under current law to 9 700 in 2020 and 10 000 in 2021 that ll allow school districts across the state to levy millions more in local property taxes assembly republicans have pushed to increase the low revenue adjustment in recent years including during the previous budget debate the assembly republican plan in 2017 19 would have increased the low revenue adjustment by much less than evers plan and would have allowed local property taxes to increase by up to 92 7 million statewide evers plan of course goes much further than that signaling even bigger property tax increases down the road those changes as well as a more than half a billion dollar investment in special needs reimbursements are kept in the budget the budget would also spend more than 600 million on students with special needs while limiting many of those students options the majority of the hike would go toward increasing the state reimbursement level for special education costs by 606 million over the biennium the high cost special education program would be made sum sufficient and special education transition readiness grants would increase from 1 000 per pupil to 1 500 per pupil increasing spending by more than 7 million on those grants while students with special needs who attend public schools are rewarded in the proposal students in the special needs scholarship program snsp would be shut out of their educational options that program established in the 2015 17 budget allows students with special needs to attend private schools with scholarships from the state no new students could join the program after the 2019 20 school year all of the provisions that limit educational choice including the changes to snsp independent charter schools and choice enrollment are eliminated by jfc other additional regulations such as different accreditation rules and licensure requirements are also tossed evers had proposed massive rollbacks to educational choice include freezing enrollment in the popular private school choice programs in milwaukee racine and statewide total seats available would freeze after the next school year students could join the programs when others graduate or otherwise leave an estimated 38 187 students across the state participate in the three programs with nearly three quarters in milwaukee the number of independent charter schools would freeze under the proposal with a ban on authorizations of new schools by entities other than public school districts until 2023 under current law any chancellors of the uw system the city of milwaukee s common council tribal authorities any technical college district board the waukesha county executive and the uw system office of educational opportunity can authorize independent charter schools choice and charter programs have been remarkably successful in wisconsin showing strong proficiency rates despite higher levels of student poverty of the 17 mps schools receiving five stars on the most recent state report cards 10 are in the private choice program four others are charter schools and just three are traditional public schools on the other end of the scale 50 mps schools received one star in 2018 or failing to meet expectations designations ten of those schools are in the private choice program while three are charters and 37 are traditional public schools university of wisconsin system evers budget proposal for the uw system would continue the popular tuition freeze for in state undergraduate students the uw system would see a boost in funding to the tune of 175 million over the biennium almost all of evers proposed uw budget is kept by the budget committee including the tuition freeze employee raises and changes to performance based funding for uw institutions spending increases at the uw system include 10 million for fellowships and loan forgiveness for certain nursing candidates who commit to teaching in the system for three years after graduating student support services for the uw colleges would see 5 million and 20 more employees would be hired for uw extension county based representatives need based grants for wisconsin students attending the uw system tech colleges private universities or tribal colleges would be funded by 17 3 million in gpr the proposal sets up a study committee to examine creating a state run student loan refinancing authority the committee is charged with making recommendations by late 2020 for inclusion in the 2021 23 state budget jfc pulled that proposal calling it a non fiscal policy item the committee also pulled out one provision that would give undocumented students in state tuition students who are citizens of other countries but who graduated from a wisconsin high school lived in wisconsin for three continuous years before high school or have applied for a permanent resident visa would qualify for in state tuition under the original evers plan all told evers budget spends 5 9 million more than the uw system requested in last fall s agency budget request and creates 219 84 new full time positions the wisconsin technical college system would also receive a funding increase of 7 percent in each year totaling 18 million over the biennium the budget proposal eliminates the early college credit program which allows high school students to take university classes under a cost sharing agreement students can earn high school credit college credit or sometimes both instead the budget requires that the uw system implement a program to provide tuition free classes for high school students the budget gives similar treatment to a program that lets high school students take classes at tech colleges instead requiring the tech colleges to provide them for free jfc chose to leave in that provision welfare reform other than the medicaid related changes welfare reform is the issue area where the finance committee pulled out the most policy items every single evers proposal for unemployment insurance and equal rights was stripped out by jfc the budget would have rolled back some of walker s reforms to the state welfare systems able bodied adults with dependents aged six to 18 would no longer need to satisfy work requirements in order to receive foodshare drug testing for most public assistance programs is eliminated evers budget includes 5 3 million to help welfare recipients in the wisconsin works w 2 program access affordable internet those changes are now gone it s another big government initiative that looks a lot like the city of madison s failed broadband for all pilot program for low income neighborhoods evers 5 3 million seems all the more excessive given that free internet access is as close as the local library neighborhood school or any number of retailers and restaurants childless able bodied adults would still be required to satisfy job requirements in order to get foodshare that became compulsory in april 2015 a different budget provision also stripped by jfc would create a statewide broadband goal for all businesses and homes minimum wage for state employees would increase to 15 per hour in 2021 for everyone else the state minimum wage would increase to 8 25 in 2020 followed by 75 cent increases annually until 2023 once the minimum hourly wage reaches 10 50 in 2023 it would become indexed to inflation the governor s budget proposal also creates a task force to study how to get the state to a 15 per hour minimum wage those changes are also axed by jfc wisconsin would make a statutory goal for all electricity produced in the state to be completely carbon free by 2050 that s pulled right out of the green new deal which argues that the entire world should become carbon free by 2050 most state employees would see a wage increase of 2 percent in each year of the biennium totaling 82 1 million in gpr another 12 1 million would be provided for targeted increases to certain state employees wisconsin would make a statutory goal for all electricity produced in the state to be completely carbon free by 2050 that s pulled right out of the green new deal which argues that the entire world should become carbon free by 2050 as temperatures dipped below freezing in much of the state this weekend a similar move enacted today would mean death by frost thirty years changes a lot but it seems likely that wisconsin will still be a cold northern state by 2050 that particular idea was pulled by the finance committee other evers proposals would repeal the changes in law the legislature passed during december s extraordinary session including the ability of the attorney general settle cases without the approval of the legislature the legislature would no longer be able to intervene in lawsuits as a matter of right both of those changes are now stripped out all the rest as with any budget there are always a few items that go mostly unnoticed they may not be the biggest whoppers but they do leave us scratching our heads jfc pulled out all of the following items one provision would have created a government run private retirement system it would be similar to a pension that anyone in the state could join creating yet another duplicitous new government program this is one area where the wealth of private options that work for millions of people should make it clear that the state does not need to step in but big government advocates seemingly just can t help themselves evers also proposed creating a first time homebuyer savings account similar to a health savings account that would allow first time buyers to set aside money tax free several government reforms were stripped including automatic voter registration run by dot and a new model for redistricting and drawing legislative maps evers team calls that the fair maps plan claiming that the current maps give republicans a political advantage numerous energy related provisions were taken out by the budget chairs including spending money from volkswagen settlement funds on the creation of charging stations for electric vehicles that d be similar to the government paying gas station owners to build new gas pumps instead evers would have the government take over another responsibility other expensive energy initiatives include an unlimited electricity tax currently the state s public service commission requires utility companies to spend 1 2 percent of annual revenues to fund energy efficiency and renewable energy programs by law the psc can t require utilities to spend any more than that evers budget would eliminate that 1 2 percent cap opening the door for massive utilities increases jfc stripped that item out as policy one energy related provision that s still in the budget is 2 million in one time funding to the washington island electric cooperative that money would replace a cable that brings electricity to washington island providing replacement cables is a direct function of what co ops are supposed to do but in this case they might just get away with fleecing taxpayers statewide for local infrastructure improvements ultimately the jfc chairs made the budget a much much more conservative spending document the vast majority of deeply concerning items will no longer be in the budget with the greatest exception being indexing of the gas tax joint finance is also starting from the base budget meaning that any new evers provisions must be added in with a majority vote tomorrow get ready for a long re hash on the budget in its entirety before the committee dives into votes luckily you ve now got a re set on the document as a whole and that s

columbia may 08 2019 globe newswire acadian timber corp acadian or the company tsx adn today reported financial and operating results1 for the three months ended march 30 2019 the first quarter operating rates for acadian s primary sawmill and pulp and paper customers remained strong through the first quarter of the year said mark bishop chief executive officer of acadian mr bishop further noted that while our operations during the quarter were negatively impacted by unseasonably cold weather which interrupted harvesting and transportation activities log demand remains firm and we anticipate meeting our target harvest and sales volumes for the full year acadian generated adjusted ebitda1 of 8 9 million for the first quarter in line with the prior year period acadian continues to benefit from strong demand reflecting the favourable dynamics of the northeast regional log markets operations were however impacted by adverse weather conditions throughout the first quarter as a result acadian s log sales volumes decreased 7 which was offset by the benefit of an increase in the weighted average log selling price of 4 compared to the prior year period for the three month period ended march 30 2019 the board of directors has declared dividends of 0 29 per share or 4 8 million compared to 4 6 million during the same period of 2018 reflecting dividend increases announced in may 2018 and february 2019 amounting to a combined 5 increase in our quarterly dividend per share this represents a payout ratio1 of 75 which is below our long term annual target of 95 but in line

32 9 million in the prior year period acadian benefited from strong seasonal demand however operations were impacted by adverse weather conditions during the quarter resulting in a 7 decrease in log sales volumes and a 20 decrease in ancillary revenues primarily related to timber services these impacts were partially offset by a 4 increase in the weighted average log selling price as our products benefited from favourable market dynamics costs were 22 1 million during the first quarter compared to 24 0 million during the prior year period reflecting lower log sales volumes and administrative cost savings variable log harvest costs were in line with the prior year period adjusted ebitda of 8 9 million during the first quarter was in line with the prior year period the adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 29 higher than 27 in the prior year period due to improved log selling prices and lower relative operating costs partially offset by the impact of lower log sales volumes net income of 6 2 million or 0 37 per share was 4 2 million higher than the prior year period of 2 0 million or 0 12 per share the variance from the prior year period is primarily due to an unrealized

entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements section of this news release for a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in the following please see the risk factors section of our management s discussion and analysis of acadian s most recent annual report and annual information form available on our website at www acadiantimber com or filed with sedar at www sedar com acadian s key markets include softwood sawtimber hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood northeast north american softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of acadian s end use market and are the primary market for our softwood sawtimber our mixed softwood and hardwood resource combined with diversified end use markets underpin acadian s best in class long term performance well balanced regional supply demand fundamentals continue to support attractive stable log pricing across all key markets the u s economy has continued to perform well through early 2019 and forecasters expect continued steady performance supported by job growth and wage increases however first quarter new home construction activity was below expectations due to several factors including increased mortgage rates the u s federal government shutdown uncertainty regarding chinese economic outlook and possible fallout from u s trade policy decisions and importantly the impact of severe winter weather in much of north america and heavy rainfall in the u s south while the u s home building sector has had some recent headwinds factors including favourable demographics for growth in household formation low home inventories and moderating rates suggest upward momentum in housing construction should resume in the near term recent consensus forecasts anticipate average year over year growth in u s housing starts for 2019 and 2020 of about 2 and 3 respectively forecasters continue to expect the proportion of single family starts the largest lumber consuming segment of u s housing starts to improve modestly through 2019 and 2020 additionally home repair and remodeling are also projected to grow modestly over the next two years north american sawtimber consumption is therefore expected to post modest year over year growth average q1 2019 quarterly benchmark eastern spruce pine fir lumber prices increased 8 while southern yellow pine lumber prices declined 4 compared to the prior quarter while we anticipate continued volatility in lumber prices in the near term dictated by the pace of regional inventory drawdown and spring building conditions forecasters expect steady demand growth combined with capacity and log supply constraints in western canada to support a robust recovery in lumber pricing in mid 2019 albeit below the levels achieved in 2018 by extension we anticipate continued stable softwood sawtimber pricing in acadian s regional markets acadian s hardwood sawtimber and pulpwood markets remain well balanced with a continued positive outlook for the foreseeable future softwood pulpwood markets acadian s smallest product segment by volume and margin have improved modestly and the expected pulp mill restart during h2 2019 in maine is expected to be a catalyst for further recovery in demand and pricing while the biomass market in maine remains weak the new brunswick biomass market continues to be supported by steady export demand at attractive prices management team changes acadian announced today that ms mabel wong will be leaving the position of chief

columbia may 08 2019 globe newswire acadian timber corp acadian or the company tsx adn today reported financial and operating results1 for the three months ended march 30 2019 the first quarter operating rates for acadian s primary sawmill and pulp and paper customers remained strong through the first quarter of the year said mark bishop chief executive officer of acadian mr bishop further noted that while our operations during the quarter were negatively impacted by unseasonably cold weather which interrupted harvesting and transportation activities log demand remains firm and we anticipate meeting our target harvest and sales volumes for the full year acadian generated adjusted ebitda1 of 8 9 million for the first quarter in line with the prior year period acadian continues to benefit from strong demand reflecting the favourable dynamics of the northeast regional log markets operations were however impacted by adverse weather conditions throughout the first quarter as a result acadian s log sales volumes decreased 7 which was offset by the benefit of an increase in the weighted average log selling price of 4 compared to the prior year period for the three month period ended march 30 2019 the board of directors has declared dividends of 0 29 per share or 4 8 million compared to 4 6 million during the same period of 2018 reflecting dividend increases announced in may 2018 and february 2019 amounting to a combined 5 increase in our quarterly dividend per share this represents a payout ratio1 of 75 which is below our long term annual target of 95 but in line with expectations given the seasonality of our operations review of operations financial and operating highlights three months ended cad thousands except per share information march 30 2019 march 31

32 9 million in the prior year period acadian benefited from strong seasonal demand however operations were impacted by adverse weather conditions during the quarter resulting in a 7 decrease in log sales volumes and a 20 decrease in ancillary revenues primarily related to timber services these impacts were partially offset by a 4 increase in the weighted average log selling price as our products benefited from favourable market dynamics costs were 22 1 million during the first quarter compared to 24 0 million during the prior year period reflecting lower log sales volumes and administrative cost savings variable log harvest costs were in line with the prior year period adjusted ebitda of 8 9 million during the first quarter was in line with the prior year period the adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 29 higher than 27 in the prior year period due to improved log selling prices and lower relative operating costs partially offset by the impact of lower log sales volumes net income of 6 2 million or 0 37 per share was 4 2 million higher than the prior year period of 2 0 million or 0 12 per share the variance from the prior year period is primarily due to an unrealized foreign exchange revaluation gain on u s dollar denominated long term debt during the first quarter compared to an unrealized revaluation loss in the prior year period segment performance new

conditions which resulted in a 7 decrease in log sales volumes the weighted average log selling price during the quarter increased 4 compared to the prior year period reflecting strong pricing for softwood sawlogs which was was partially offset by changes in the sales mix adjusted ebitda was 5 8 million during the first quarter of 2019 compared to 5 9 million in the prior year period as the

entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements section of this news release for a description of material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements in the following please see the risk factors section of our management s discussion and analysis of acadian s most recent annual report and annual information form available on our website at www acadiantimber com or filed with sedar at www sedar com acadian s key markets include softwood sawtimber hardwood sawtimber and hardwood pulpwood northeast north american softwood dimension sawmills represent over one third of acadian s end use market and are the primary market for our softwood sawtimber our mixed softwood and hardwood resource combined with diversified end use markets underpin acadian s best in class long term performance well balanced regional supply demand fundamentals continue to support attractive stable log pricing across all key markets the u s economy has continued to perform well through early 2019 and forecasters expect continued steady performance supported by job growth and wage increases however first quarter new home construction activity was below expectations due to several factors including increased mortgage rates the u s federal government shutdown uncertainty regarding chinese economic outlook and possible fallout from u s trade policy decisions and importantly the impact of severe winter weather in much of north america and heavy rainfall in the u s south while the u s home building sector has had some recent headwinds factors including favourable demographics for growth in household formation low home inventories and moderating rates suggest upward momentum in housing construction should resume in the near term recent consensus forecasts anticipate average year over year growth in u s housing starts for 2019 and 2020 of about 2 and 3 respectively forecasters continue to expect the proportion of single family starts the largest lumber consuming segment of u s housing starts to improve modestly through 2019 and 2020 additionally home repair and remodeling are also projected to grow modestly over the next two years north american sawtimber consumption is therefore expected to post modest year over year growth average q1 2019 quarterly benchmark eastern spruce pine fir lumber prices increased 8 while southern yellow pine lumber prices declined 4 compared to the prior quarter while we anticipate continued volatility in lumber prices in the near term dictated by the pace of regional inventory drawdown and spring building conditions forecasters expect steady demand growth combined with capacity and log supply constraints in western canada to support a robust recovery in lumber pricing in mid 2019 albeit below the levels achieved in 2018 by extension we anticipate continued stable softwood sawtimber pricing in acadian s regional markets acadian s hardwood sawtimber and pulpwood markets remain well balanced with a continued positive outlook for the foreseeable future softwood pulpwood markets acadian s smallest product segment by volume and margin have improved modestly and the expected pulp mill restart during h2 2019 in maine is expected to be a catalyst for further recovery in demand and pricing while the biomass market in maine remains weak the new brunswick biomass market continues to be supported by steady export demand at attractive prices management team changes acadian announced today that ms mabel wong will be leaving the position of chief

activities compared with 9 4 million in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by changes in working capital and higher spending on remediation partly offset by higher realized bitumen prices compared with cash flow of 12 3 million used in operating activities in the same period last year cash flow from operating activities improved in the first quarter of 2019 as a result of increased bitumen production lower realized losses on commodity risk management and favorable changes in working capital partly offset by higher spending on remediation adjusted funds flow adjusted funds flow increased to 16 0 million in the first quarter compared with 2 3 million in the prior quarter due to increased oil production stronger realized pricing and lower costs adjusted funds flow increased 122 year over year compared with 7 2 million in the same period of last year the year over year increase was primarily due to higher bitumen production the impact of decreased realized losses on commodity risk management and lower cash g a compared with the same period last year these were offset by lower realized natural gas prices due to the absence of natural gas production from soep higher interest and financing charges mainly due to increased borrowings on the credit facility and an increase in adjusted operating expenses net loss the 31 6 million net loss in the first quarter was 471 4 million less than the net loss of 503 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to the absence of non cash items recognized in the prior quarter pengrowth reported a net loss of 27 2 million in the same period last year the net loss increased year over year primarily due to a 15 3 million charge related to lowering of the discount rate estimate for asset retirement obligation on assets with no remaining useful life combined with the absence of a deferred tax recovery of 7 2 million recorded in the same period last year these were partially offset by an unrealized foreign exchange gain in the current quarter compared to an unrealized foreign exchange loss in the same period last year and increased adjusted funds flow market access and commodity risk management during the first quarter of 2019 in conjunction with the extension of pengrowth s revolving credit facility the company entered into wti crude oil costless collars on 8 000 bbl d with an average floor and ceiling of us 56 75 bbl and us 59 80 bbl respectively for the second quarter of 2019 pengrowth uses physical delivery contracts to ensure access to markets protect against pipeline apportionment and limit credit risk and exposure to widening benchmark differentials between western canadian select wcs and west texas intermediate wti crude oil prices as at march 31 2019 pengrowth had apportionment protected physical contracts in place that ensure market access for 17 500 bbl d of diluted bitumen for 2019 using a combination of physical and financial contracts the average realized price on these volumes is expected to be wti minus us 18 68 bbl compared with the fourth quarter when similar contracts protected pengrowth from wide differentials alberta s production curtailment program has led to the differential narrowing as a result pengrowth realized risk management losses of 15 8 million on these contracts 10 7 million on apportionment protected fixed differential physical sales contracts and 5 1 million on swaps used to fix the differential on a 5 000 bbl d of apportionment protected physical sales contracts balance sheet and liquidity pengrowth s total debt before working capital excluding letters of credit at march 31 2019 increased 1 to 721 5 million compared with 714 6 million as at december 31 2018 partly due to 5 6 million in abandonment and reclamation work that was front loaded into the first quarter offset by an approximate 10 million advantageous swing in foreign exchange rates upcoming debt maturities on march 25 2019 pengrowth announced that it had reached arrangements for the extension of the maturity date under its secured revolving credit facility the credit facility through september 30 2019 subject to certain terms the company s 330 million credit facility all amounts in canadian dollars is provided by a broad syndicate of domestic and international banks and had a scheduled maturity of march 31 2019 the company executed an extension agreement the extension agreement to its credit facility supported by 100 of the lenders in the syndicate providing for the extension of the maturity date under the credit facility to september 30 2019 by way of an initial extension to july 29 2019 and two subsequent extensions to august 29 2019 and to september 30 2019 respectively each of which will automatically become effective unless lenders with at least two thirds of the total commitments under the credit facility provide notice to the company that such automatic extension will not apply in advance of the automatic extension dates the extension of the credit facility will provide support to pengrowth while it undertakes its previously announced process to explore and develop strategic alternatives with a view to strengthening the company s balance sheet addressing upcoming debt maturities and maximizing enterprise value as at march 31 2019 pengrowth had drawings of 191 0 million on its credit facility december 31 2018 173 5 million and 63 2 million of outstanding letters of credit december 31 2018 75 6 million in addition to the maturity of the credit facility in 2019 certain of the company s term notes in the aggregate principal amount of ca 58 6 million mature on october 18 2019 as part of the strategic review pengrowth intends to explore and advance strategic alternatives including transactions or financings that address the upcoming maturities of the october 2019 term notes it is likely that any offer to replace our existing debt will likely come at a higher interest cost pengrowth s total debt before working capital is 71 denominated in foreign currencies at march 31 2019 to manage foreign exchange risk pengrowth holds a series of swap contracts that fix the foreign exchange rate on 66 of the principal for pengrowth s u s dollar denominated term debt at march 31 2019 pengrowth held a total of us 240 million in foreign exchange swap contracts

development plan in june 2018 pengrowth released its multi year development plan to incrementally increase bitumen production at lindbergh in bite sized steps rather than in one large phase expansion at lindbergh will be achieved in incremental steps aligning capital spending with pengrowth s expected cash flow shifting the development methodology away from the previously contemplated large single phase approach development capital is expected to be focused on drilling new well pairs additional infill wells as well as adding incremental facilities to debottleneck fluid handling capacity the corporation expects to implement co injection of steam and non condensible gas ncg to further enhance production by freeing up steam for new wells while maintaining reservoir pressure which is expected to lower sors regulatory approval for the application of ncg injection at lindbergh was received in june of 2018 as previously announced pengrowth has signed a non binding letter of intent with a third party to fund the development of additional co generation capacity options at lindbergh to provide pengrowth with steam and power under a fee structure sufficient enough to support further efficient production expansions to reach approximately 35 000 bbl d of bitumen capital to be committed to lindbergh in 2020 and onwards will be dependent on the prevailing commodity prices groundbirch has a low cost structure which supports growth in production and cash flow under a stronger natural gas pricing environment 2019 capital plan until pengrowth is able to refinance its term debt and renews its credit facility capital spending will not exceed 21 million pengrowth s 2019 budget called for a capital spending plan of 45 million with 76 or 34 million of this capital allocated to lindbergh for continued production sustaining and maintenance activities which includes drilling three well pairs to utilize existing steam capacity pengrowth will continue to assess timing for commencement of the development program which is anticipated to be no sooner than the second half of 2019 the remaining 11 million of capital is related to maintenance and integrity activities to support the existing operations and for general corporate purposes including approximately 3 million to finalize the groundbirch development program quarterly presentation pengrowth has posted a

five consecutive quarters and shrank its balance sheet but in january the fed announced a pause which now looks to be extended the dot plots of federal open market committee members currently indicate no rate rises for the remainder of the year moreover the fed has signaled that quantitative tightening the process of allowing treasuries and mortgage backed securities to roll off its balance sheet will continue only through september this means merciful relief for emerging economies which have been buoyed by the resumption of capital inflows a replay of the second half of last year much less of the 2013 taper tantrum now seems unlikely in addition there is the rebound of the chinese economy other emerging markets linked to china through global supply chains and raw material exports are highly leveraged on its growth thus they had good reason to worry when chinese manufacturing activity shrank in february for the third straight month chinese exports are down car sales are down as recently as two weeks ago all was doom and gloom we now know that this pessimism was overdone manufacturing activity recovered in march reflecting measures taken by the chinese authorities policymakers are relying more on fiscal stimulus and less on liquidity creation to offset weak demand my view contrary to that of others is that this is something china can well afford government debt is still low by emerging market standards more important the differential between the interest rate and the growth rate which shapes debt dynamics is lower than virtually anywhere else in the world consequently the central government was able to raise the threshold below which no income tax is paid and to add a tax deduction for parental elder care it had room to cut taxes for small businesses it can cut the value added tax vat and spend upward of 1 5 percent of gdp on railways roads and other projects as announced in march to be sure china s corporate debt load is heavy total social financing is still expected to grow by 10 percent this year faster than nominal gdp much of this new liquidity is destined for relatively inefficient state owned enterprises already saddled with bad loans that said china remains enough of a controlled economy that the authorities can mitigate its deceleration as last month s manufacturing rebound indicates relief may also be coming on the tariff front us president donald trump may have hardened his anti china rhetoric at the behest of his trade representative robert lighthizer who sees threats as necessary to extract concessions from the chinese government on intellectual property and technology transfer there is also the danger of additional us tariffs on other products and sources such as motor vehicles manufactured in europe and mexico but trump s tariff talk is consistently worse than his bite when other countries refuse to roll over and accept his demands he has a history of accepting limited concessions and declaring victory as with the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement there is every sign now that a similar cosmetic agreement is in the offing with china at the same time trump never entirely abandons the tariff threat trade conflicts are useful background noise that diverts attention from ongoing political investigations and embarrassments they make it appear to the uninitiated and uninformed that the administration is doing something about slowing us growth as a result trump s tariff threats will continue to roil global markets and international relations but they will not culminate in a full blown tariff war and complete collapse of the multilateral system but there remains one significant and serious risk to emerging markets a us recession the inversion of the yield curve late last month suggests that investors are now taking this possibility seriously some sages at institutions like jpmorgan which make their living forecasting such events think there is a significant chance of a recession this year or next if a recession does occur it will be severe because there will be relatively little us policymakers can and will do about it us interest rates remain low giving the fed little room to cut and because the budget deficit has already blown up there will be less appetite for fiscal stimulus moreover a us recession would interact with other risks trump would look for someone to blame so the trade war could be back on in that case china would find it harder to outgrow its corporate debt problem which in turn would weaken the world s principal engine of economic expansion for this reason the recent respite for emerging market economies could be short lived given the uncertainties about us policy and chinese growth prospects it is too early

generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver or gold ounce sold net of by product credits aisc the company has adopted aisc as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the company believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated earnings and cash flow total

to generate cash flows from operations of approximately 400 million for the year per share for full year 2019 if a gold price assumption of per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately for the year strong cash position of 142 million at quarter end at quarter end on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and is proceeding with an expansion project to increase fekola s processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the company will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic

expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from to and to increase the accordion feature from to the upsized rcf is expected to close by for full year 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold 2019 first quarter operational results consolidated gold production in the first quarter of 2019 was 230 859 ounces 6 12 704 ounces above budget gold production from the company s fekola masbate otjikoto and el limon mines all exceeded their targeted production the fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines continued their very strong operational performances with both well above their budgeted production for the quarter for the first quarter of 2019 the fekola mine produced 110 349 ounces of gold well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces and the masbate mine produced 57 481 ounces of gold significantly above budget by 15 7 490 ounces compared to the prior year quarter gold production was marginally lower by 8 825 ounces consolidated cash operating costs in the quarter were 545 per ounce sold below budget by 27 per ounce 5 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly attributable to masbate s above budget gold production and significantly lower than budgeted mining costs see operations section below also contributing to the favourable budget variance were otjikoto s sales of lower cost gold ounces from its opening inventory and higher ore tonnage than budgeted from its otjikoto and wolfshag pits compared to the prior year quarter consolidated cash operating costs on a per ounce of gold sold basis were 74 per ounce higher 16 primarily due to the lower grade stockpile material processed during the first quarter of 2019 at fekola as a result of fekola s significantly higher than budgeted mill throughput as well as to lower gold sales the comparative quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 lower cost ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production consolidated aisc in the first quarter were 848 per ounce sold q1 2018 719 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 133 per ounce 14 reflecting the lower per ounce cash operating costs noted above and lower than planned capital expenditures which were 24 million lower than budget this reflects mainly timing differences as the majority of the capital underspend is expected to be incurred later in 2019 given the gold production outperformance in the first quarter of 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production for full year 2019 forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces for the first half of 2019 consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 436 000 and 456 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 499 000 and 519 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 consolidated cash costs are projected to remain low in 2019 with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold as previously released consolidated gold production for full year 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to the planned development of open pits in the first half of the year and subsequent ore production from those pits in the second half 2019 first quarter financial results consolidated gold revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was 302 million on sales of 232 076 ounces at an average price of 1 300 per ounce compared to 344 million on sales of 259 837 ounces at an average price of 1 325 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 gold sales of 232 076 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 were 6 13 564 ounces above budget compared to the prior year quarter the decrease in revenue related mainly to the timing of gold shipments as the prior year quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production cash flow provided by operating activities was 86 million 0 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 147 million 0 15 per share in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease mainly reflects lower gold revenue as the comparative quarter benefitted from the sale of its opening gold inventories for full year 2019 if a gold price assumption of 1 300 per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately 400 million for the year for the first quarter of 2019 the company generated net income of 27 million 0 02 per share compared to net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted net income see non ifrs measures for the first quarter of 2019 was 38 million 0 04 per share compared to adjusted net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 liquidity and capital resources at march 31 2019 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 142 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 103 million at december 31 2018 working capital at march 31 2019 was 206 million compared to 156 million at december 31 2018 at march 31 2019 the company had drawn 400 million under the 500 million rcf leaving an undrawn and available balance under the existing facility of 100 million in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize its rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million in addition as a reflection of b2gold s financial strength the upsized rcf is expected to include increased flexibility for permitted borrowings and equipment financings coupled with less onerous financial covenants and lower pricing the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 and will be for a term of four years to mid 2023 final closing of the facility and the availability of funds under it remains subject to completion of customary closing conditions the upsized rcf coupled with strong operating cash flows from the company s existing mine operations is expected to provide the company with continued financial flexibility to advance existing assets and pursue exploration opportunities the company s current strategy is to continue to reduce debt expand the fekola mine throughput and annual production further advance its pipeline of development and exploration projects and evaluate

production of 110 349 ounces well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces as the processing facilities continued to outperform throughout the quarter the operation continued to demonstrate sustained high processing throughput without reduced recoveries for the first quarter of 2019 mill throughput was 1 73 million tonnes exceeding budget by 25 and the prior year quarter by 31 overall mill throughput increased during the quarter from past quarters due to a combination of factors metallurgy was favourable and excellent recoveries were achieved with a grind coarser than planned approximately 12 of the feed came from weathered saprolite ore which requires little grinding low grade ore feed during the quarter coming mostly from upper elevations in the pit appears to have been softer than anticipated and overall feed size to the plant was finer than budgeted in addition fine tuning of the plant circuit by the operators also played a role in the positive plant performance given the plant s ability to process significantly higher than budgeted throughput during this period the company took the decision to add lower grade material from the stockpiles to the plant feed this resulted in higher gold production at a lower average grade and as expected in marginally higher per ounce cash operating costs for the quarter the average grade processed was 2 11 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 2 48 g t gold grades from the mine continue to reconcile closely to the block model gold recoveries in the quarter averaged 94 1 compared to budget of 94 0 and 94 8 in the first quarter of 2018 fekola s first quarter cash operating costs were 397 per ounce sold marginally above budget by 28 per ounce or 8 and higher than the prior year quarter of 270 per ounce sold by 127 per ounce or 47 the increase over budget and the comparative quarter was mainly due to the lower grade stockpile material being processed during the quarter as discussed above fekola s aisc for the first quarter were 614 per ounce sold q1 2018 474 per ounce sold slightly below budget by 31 per ounce capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 21 million mainly consisting of 7 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 5 million for pre stripping and 5 million for fadougou village relocation costs for full year 2019 the fekola mine is expected to produce between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 370 and 410 per ounce sold and aisc of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as new high grade ore production from phase 4 of the fekola pit is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2019 for the first half of 2019 the fekola mine is forecast to produce between 205 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 215 000 and 220 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study pea for the fekola mine as a result the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the pea took into account the significant increase in the fekola mineral resource announced on october 25 2018 based on the pea once this expansion is complete the fekola mine is expected to produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous life of mine lom project economic highlights from the pea include estimated optimized lom extended into 2030 including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and over 400 000 ounces per year over the lom 2019 2030 projected gold production of approximately 5 000 000 ounces over the new mine life of 12 years of mining and processing including 2019 an increase in project pre tax net present value of approximately 500 million versus the comparable amounts in the company s latest aif mineral reserve lom model filed on sedar on march 20 2019 assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 and forecast lom pre tax net present value of over 2 2 billion the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which are expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2020 with public release of the pea results b2gold has filed a material change report and will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study pea will be realized fekola exploration for 2019 exploration on the licenses in mali is budgeted to total 18 million the company continues its drilling program to convert fekola s inferred resources to indicated and plans to further drill the potential to the north of fekola which remains open the new cardinal target located west of the fekola pit and the anaconda zones masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines continued its very strong operational performance into the first quarter of 2019 producing 57 481 ounces of gold 15 7 490 ounces above budget and 8 4 334 ounces higher compared to the prior year quarter gold production was significantly above budget due to both higher than expected head grade and recovery as ore grade oxide ore tonnage and total ore tonnage mined from the main vein pit were all better than modelled masbate s gold production for the quarter resulted from processing 1 83 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 85 million tonnes and 1 79 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2018 at an average grade of 1 32 g t compared to budget of 1 20 g t and 1 17 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 73 8 compared to budget of 69 7 and 78 5 in the first quarter of 2018 oxide ore represented 31 of the processed tonnage for the quarter versus budget of 8 and 78 in the first quarter of 2018 as planned compared to the first quarter of 2018 gold grades increased while recoveries decreased as higher grade transition fresh ore was mainly mined from the main vein pit in the first quarter of 2019 whereas the prior year quarter included lower grade oxide ore mined from the colorado pit masbate s first quarter cash operating costs were 546 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 123 per ounce 18 and comparable with the prior year quarter the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was driven by the above budget gold production and masbate s mining costs which were well below budget for the quarter by 24 cost savings were mainly in the areas of drilling blasting mining locations included backfill areas which did not require blasting and blast pattern spacing was increased resulting in savings for drill meters and blast agents loading hauling mainly due to lower fuel and maintenance costs and fewer total tonnes of waste moved which was a result of fleet activity focused in main vein area resulting in a lower than budgeted strip ratio masbate s aisc for the quarter were 743 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 222 per ounce 23 mainly due to the lower than budgeted mining costs and comparable with the prior year quarter capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 8 million which mainly consisted of masbate processing plant upgrades of 4 million mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds of 1 million pre stripping costs of 1 million and tailings storage facility costs of 1 million the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 mtpa was completed in early 2019 with the expansion now fully commissioned and online masbate s annual gold production is projected to average approximately 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed in the subsequent period after open pit mining activities have ceased for full year 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce sold otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia also had a solid first quarter producing 32 712 ounces of gold q1 2018 39 499 ounces 4 1 275 ounces above budget this was attributable to above budget mining tonnage from the otjikoto pit and higher than budgeted processed grade as previously released otjikoto s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 during the first quarter of 2019 the otjikoto mine processed 0 8 million tonnes comparable to budget and the prior year quarter at an average grade of 1 29 g t compared to budget of 1 19 g t and 1 51 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 98 6 compared to budget of 98 0 and 98 7 in the first quarter of 2018 for first quarter 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 519 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 136 per ounce 21 and 30 per ounce below the first quarter of 2018 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly due to lower cost gold ounces sold from opening inventory and from higher than budgeted ore stockpile additions in the first quarter of 2019 more ore tonnes were stockpiled than budgeted as a result of higher ore tonnage than budgeted from phase 2 of the otjikoto pit and phase 2 of the wolfshag pit these positive ore tonnage reconciliations decreased the strip ratio and increased stockpiled tonnage for the first quarter of 2019 on a total cost basis otjikoto s mining processing and site general costs were approximately as budgeted for the quarter otjikoto s aisc for the quarter were 829 per ounce sold q1 2018 723 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 293 per ounce 26 mainly due to higher than budgeted sales also sustaining capital expenditures were 4 million below budget mainly relating to lower capitalized stripping which is expected to be an overall capital expenditure saving for the year capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million consisting of 4 million for pre stripping and 3 million for new mobile equipment and mobile equipment rebuilds for full year 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold primarily from the otjikoto pit at cash operating costs of between 520 and 560 per ounce and aisc of between 905 and 945 per ounce for the first half of 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 66 000 and 71 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 99 000 and 104 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 el limon gold mine nicaragua el limon mine in nicaragua produced 12 231 ounces of gold q1 2018 13 529 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 slightly above budget during the quarter ore production from the new limon central pit commenced with 49 000 tonnes mined at an average grade of 3 43 g t development of the limon central pit remains the focus of surface operations at el limon mine the santa pancha underground mine continues to operate normally and development of the veta nueva underground mine is proceeding as planned as previously released el limon s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as high grade ore production from the new limon central pit is scheduled to fully come on line at the beginning of the second half of 2019 for first quarter 2019 el limon s cash operating costs were 991 per ounce sold compared to budget of 876 per ounce sold and aisc were 1 524 per ounce sold compared to budget of 1 400 per ounce sold both above budget primarily due to lower than budgeted gold sales el limon s gold sales were 6 below budget in the quarter due to the timing of gold shipments production costs were on budget on a total basis capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million which mainly consisted of underground development costs for santa pancha and veta nueva of 4 million and limon central pre stripping costs of 3 million for full year 2019 el limon is expected to produce between 55 000 and 60 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 720 and 760 per ounce sold and aisc of between 1 005 and 1 045 per ounce sold for the first half of 2019 el limon mine is forecast to

18 086 ounces of gold q1 2018 19 367 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 14 2 899 ounces below budget gold production at la libertad was affected by lower than planned grade from the san diego pit which was partly offset by higher than planned ore tonnage and grade from the san juan pit as previously released la libertad s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as la libertad s production forecast assumes that production will start from the new jabali antenna pit in the second half of 2019 dependent upon the successful completion of resettlement activities and receipt of the jabali antenna open pit permit during the quarter the company concluded an agreement for jabali antenna with the small miners in the area and successfully conducted the public consultation that is required for issuance of a mine permit with the permitting issues related to the site largely resolved the company anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 as budgeted la libertad s cash operating costs in the quarter were 1 295 per ounce sold q1 2018 1 040 per ounce sold 249 per ounce 24 above budget and were impacted by the lower than budgeted production discussed above la libertad s aisc were 1 647 per ounce sold 145 per ounce 8 below budget as previously released la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year the lower than budgeted aisc resulted from lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures arising from timing delays in developing the jabali antenna open pit and underground mines 6 million and the construction of the tailings storage facility 4 million partially offset by higher cash operating costs as described above and lower gold ounces sold compared to budget these delayed capital costs are expected to be incurred in later in 2019 total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 were 4 million consisting primarily of tailings storage facility costs of 3 million for full year 2019 la libertad mine is expected to produce between 95 000 and 100 000 ounces of gold at cash

advertisement thanks kevin and good morning i m pleased to report that we re off to a great start in 2019 first quarter results were a bit better than expected and our first month of djo was in line with expectations fabrication technology achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of quarter sales growth all major markets grew fueled by price that is offsetting steel and other inflation air gas handling drove its third consecutive quarter of double digit order growth with all end markets moving in a positive direction we increased margins 160 basis points through productivity pricing and strong project execution the djo integration is on track with initial focus on operational improvement growth acceleration and transitioning to a cbs culture of continuous improvement moving to slide four you can see esab s continued growth trajectory in q1 margins improved as planned up 20 basis points year over year and up 180 basis points sequentially our fab tech business margins are improving on the strength of restructuring productivity and pricing actions while we have converted to adjusted ebitda to simplify reporting we still have conviction and line of sight to drive to 15 aop our mid single digit growth was driven by price as volume flattened in the quarter but we still saw a positive volume growth in our flow business part from market and part from share gain we continue to make great progress across the range of growth initiatives in both equipment and consumables and customers are excited by our lineup of new products and technologies advertisement advertisement a good example is the new automation product called versotrac the most versatile and user friendly tractor on the market the tractor allows the mechanization of certain welding processes to improve productivity and quality versotrac is unmatched in terms of portability up time and ease of use the gce acquisition is performing well and we re thoughtfully integrating our businesses in the welding market while driving growth initiatives to expand our position in specialty gases that serve attractive markets like life science research and healthcare slide five shows continued very strong growth in air gas handling orders in the first quarter our core industrial orders grew 21 on top of 24 in 2017 and 19 in 2018 we are clearly benefiting from the strategic shift in this business over the past few years orders in all other key end markets also grew consistent with the long cycle recovery momentum oil and gas was up 38 and the profitability of new orders continues to improve mining orders grew organically 29 and our mining project funnel and outlook remains in good shape our power orders grew 11 and we believe this part of the business has stabilized with improving prospects in asia advertisement advertisement air gas handling margins improved to 11 3 in the first quarter as shown in slide six this improvement resulted primarily from restructuring programs improvements in executing customer projects and strategic choices in oil and gas to focus on higher margin projects this is a very strong start and sets the path for significant expansion in margins for the full year sales in the quarter were lower than the prior year including fx pressures but higher orders of inaudible in the past three quarters have created a healthy backlog that supports our forecast for sales growth in the back half of this year slide seven summarizes results in our new med tech segment the djo acquisition was completed on february 22nd so the first quarter results only include one month of performance sales of 124 million and adjusted ebitda of 26 million in march were both in line with expectations march and q1 year over year core revenue growth were both positive led by performance in the reconstructive business djo launched six new products in the first quarter that will contribute to an improving growth trajectory later this year and in 2020 for example the djo surgical adaptable arm launched in march is the first fully sterile surgeon controlled leg and retractor holder for hip implant surgery the adaptable was recognized as one of the 10 products you need to know at the recent 2019 aaos meeting by the mdl organization like versotrac and esab this type of mechanization in implant procedures is expected to be an attractive area for differentiation that will support the business and continue to gain market share on slide eight i want to share with you our progress integrating djo and creating a healthy path for sustained performance improvement all of djos key leaders have attended cbs leadership training and we re quickly cascading foundational training throughout the business we are collaborating with the djo team to strengthen the operating discipline through monthly operating reviews that are supported by aggressive weekly and daily management advertisement advertisement our initial cbs focus areas are the completion of the transformation projects and transition to a continuous improvement culture we are working closely together to improve delivery and service in the performance rehab segment and this will support growth acceleration and lower structural costs we are also focused on procurement and value engineering to offset inflation and support margin expansion going forward in addition to these supply chain areas we ve targeted the reimbursement and product innovation processes as key opportunities for cbs to support accelerated growth on slide nine we look ahead we have made significant improvements in our air gas handling business that are now leading through with consistent growth in orders and margins and the business is expected to return to top line growth in the second half this improved business performance is creating a healthy level of interest from potential acquirers our fab tech business continues to grow in line with expectations outlined earlier this year supported by our global strength new products and pricing the integration teams at djo and colfax are working quickly and effectively to minimize disruption while accelerating business improvements everyone s excited by the opportunities ahead advertisement advertisement wrapping up we re off to a great start to what i expect will be a very successful year for colfax in 2019 i ll now hand over to chris christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer thanks matt and good morning continuing on to slide 10 company sales grew 14 in the first quarter to just over 1 billion reflecting 2 organic growth and 19 from acquisitions including 14 from djo we also faced a 6 currency translation headwind in the quarter from a stronger us dollar mostly compared with the argentine peso the euro and the russian ruble we grew gross profit by 87 million in the quarter and gross margin by nearly 5 full points 220 basis points from operating improvements and 260 basis points from acquiring the higher margin djo business higher gross profit contributed to better operating profitability despite over 6 million of year over year fx translation pressure adjusted ebitda increased 36 million and margins increased 230 basis points to 14 6 advertisement advertisement below the line interest expense was consistent with our expectations and will increase in q2 as we recognize the full quarter impact from the djo acquisition we continue to expect our full year tax rate of 22 which implies a lower rate for the remainder of the year to offset the higher q1 rate overall eps of 0 53 was slightly ahead of our expectations and represented 10 growth despite a translational fx headwind of about 0 04 a few other q1 housekeeping items to note first our air gas handling business completed the tender of all shares of its publicly traded subsidiary in south africa increasing its stake from 55 to 100 following an investment of 93 million second one of our largest uk pensions went into buyout and recorded a 44 million non cash charge this action is similar to our q4 2017 buyout of a different pension which also created a longer term de risking benefit for colfax third and lastly as expected our cash flow in the quarter included 56 million of strategic transaction costs and 16 million of djo working capital investment that we signaled to you on our previous call you should expect to see another 20 million to 25 billion working capital investment in q2 slide 11 shows the eps growth outlook for the first half of 2019 compared with 1 09 in the prior year during the first half of 2019 we expect strong operating performance from the fab tech and air gas handling businesses supported by current momentum and outlooks we continue to forecast the djo acquisition to be accretive and the other recent acquisitions such as gce are delivering expected results advertisement advertisement we anticipate fx to remain a headwind in the second quarter versus the prior year at current rates year over year pressures would ease in the second half as a reminder last year s q2 tax rate benefited from the one time implementation catch up of r d tax credits that will not recur this year our outlook for the full year on slide 12 is not changed we continue to guide 2 55 to 2 65 which represents growth of 10 or more for the year fab tech market conditions are expected to remain constructive for the rest of the year with strong price offsetting inflation and currency pressures air gas handling performance should continue to improve as we progress through 2019 supported by recent strong order growth restructuring actions and improved order quality the djo integration is progressing well and performing in line with expectations seasonal revenue patterns completion of large operating improvement projects and early cbs contributions should drive improvements throughout the balance of the year that concludes our prepared remarks operator please open up the call for questions questions and answers christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer operator instructions and our first question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets your line is open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just on welding very good price volumes a little bit lower can you just talk about as you go through the year when you start to lap some of that price action and can you just talk about where volumes might be more mixed given some of the more mixed macro news we re seeing and where you seeing maybe areas of resiliency matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure jeff first on the price question certainly in q2 we start to lap it a little bit but it s really the back half of the year where we significantly lap some of the pricing actions and so the price impact will start to fade as we go through the year and we expect in our plan to have some volume growth in the year and we still fully expect to have the volume growth needed to get to that mid single digits plan number that we put out there in terms of how different places in the world are playing out certainly the north american markets slowed down a little in the first quarter as expected and planned after a strong back half of last year but we still see that as a positive growth markets european market is in similar place its been in the last few years with some parts of the market growing and some parts of the market not growing we ve been able to consistently grow over there and think that we ve been able to take some healthy share and then in the emerging markets around the world there is some positive momentum in some parts of south america turn it over to some decent volume growth india is still in a healthy volume growth range and some recovery starting to come through in places like the middle east and asia outside of china and while china has some industrial pressure on it the infrastructure investments in china are still on a pretty healthy clip and so we ve been able to stay in a positive range there jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just to understand the first half second half guidance a little bit better is that a function of more air gas seasonality or can you help us with how you re thinking about djo for 2q and how the seasonality lines up there christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so typically in the djo business jeff you d see the lowest quarter being in q1 and the strongest in q4 with development from q1 or a step up from q1 into q2 the transition from q2 to q3 can be generally not a lot of change in the sales levels sequentially and then the step up in q4 it s typically what the business has seen and that s in line with our expectations for the year in terms of the air gas handling business we expect to see the similar patterns to what you ve seen in the past there again with lowest q1 little bit of a step up in the sales levels as you head into q2 and q3 generally trading to be up or down a bit and then of course you step up into the q4 level so typical seasonality that you would expect to see in the business jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just one housekeeping item how are we looking for tax rate for 2q and for the rest of the year christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so for the full year jeff we re still expecting the rate to come in at about 22 or so it was little higher in q1 and that implies that we ll be doing some work to offset that in q2 q3 and q4 so you expect to see the rate below the 22 level just to get it to average out to 22 for the year jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our follow on question comes from the line of nathan jones of stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel analyst good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi nathan nathan jones stifel analyst just wanted to follow up on the welding volume side of that did i hear you matt say you still expect volume growth for the year in the mid single digits matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer no our guidance for the year was mid single digits overall core revenue growth and so obviously a decent chunk of that comes from price and then the rest comes from volume and we still have an expectation we will be able to be in a positive volume growth range nathan jones stifel analyst okay so you would expect the price tailwind to fade here just as you lap comps and that should be made up by a little bit of accelerating volume matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah that s correct as i said in my comments our flow business had positive volume growth in the first quarter and so really was we had less cutting systems shipped sort of strong shipments of cutting systems last year a little less shipped in the first quarter of this year and our funnel and backlog shows that that ll correct itself in the next quarter or two here nathan jones stifel analyst got it and then you guys said you had line of sight to adjusted operating margins of 15 you ve got i worked out about 130 basis points of amortization in that so 16 3 on the way you are reporting it now can you maybe talk about the things that you have line of sight to that gets you to that kind of number when we should recognize those things and any kind of estimate you can give us on when you should get to that margin level now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes i mean as you can see we ve started the year right where we need to be versus our plan we re already in the range of what we put out there as guidance for the year and so that has us in the right range to execute through this year s plan and as we ve talked about previously we ve built some good price muscle through the last few years unfortunately it had to be exercised just to offset a lot of inflation we expect that as steel flattens and some of the other inflation flattens which is starting to happen here that we will be able to more selectively exercise that price muscle and get a little bit in that price as things flatten or even turn down and then we ve also got productivity programs ongoing and then need to have a little bit of volume growth in the next couple of years to get the rest of the way to that 15 aop and we ll take you through later in the year at our investor day we ll give an update more on an ebitda basis but we just wanted to be clear that we haven t lost the trail on the aop at 15 commitment nathan jones stifel analyst all right thanks i ll pass it on operator thank you and our next question comes from joe giordano with cowen your line is open joe giordano cowen analyst hi guys good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe giordano cowen analyst so i wanted to start on air gas obviously good quarter there in orders and on margin so just curious as we move through the year how much of that is kind of pulled in how does the funnel look on the order side what is the outlook for incremental spending there for the rest of the year and obviously the business you re trying to sell is still having good quarters holding stuff next year kind of makes sense but just curious as to how sustainable some of these metrics are for the remainder of the year should it remain under your ownership matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so first off the good strong first quarter on the back of a few other quarters of strong order growth is really driven by a healthy market environment across all of our end markets really a healthy long cycle recovery there as well as strong execution by the team and not by any kind of fire drill order pull ins i think we certainly didn t need to be above 20 to show a good strong quarter of growth we still see healthy growth in the second quarter and very clear line of sight on the mid to high single digit order growth that we signaled for the year with obviously the possibility of healthier than that based on how we ve started we have healthy funnels and april was another good month of orders there and so things are in on a good track there and on the margin front this was a good strong start really showing that the improvements that we made down the back half of last year are structural and sustainable and as the volume grows through the year in that business and we continue to see read through of the improvements we ve made we can continue to improve margins through the year in the business joe giordano cowen analyst and then chris on the full year guide keeping flat there can you talk through some of the puts and takes like how much more is fx of a headwind in there in that guidance three months ago how much was operationally kind of moved higher within the context of a flat like headline number christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer the view that we ve taken is number one the fx rates really haven t changed significantly over the last three months so so far this is playing out in line with what we had expected when we put together the guidance back in december and then reaffirmed in february and again in march from the other puts and takes as we looked at this it s really the start of the year there are some good things that are playing out it s a bit early for us to be moving the guidance around but clearly there s some good operating momentum as matt mentioned in the air gas handling business we see that continue to play out that represents upside opportunity for us but we re just at the beginning of the year and thought it was thought we d keep the guidance in place joe giordano cowen analyst okay and then maybe last from me matt i know it s early djo early stage with them but your initial impressions as you start talking to the business leaders there can you just take us through your thought process in the last month what you have been spending time on and what you ve seen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure we ve spent over the last couple of months quite a bit of time with the leadership team there doing cbs training and assimilation and starting to dig in on some of the key operational issues and working on our 100 days strategic plan where we focus on some of the key strategic focus areas together there s great talent there the leadership team has got some terrific experience there very excited about being a part of colfax and they ve embraced cbs as a way to accelerate the progress in the business and to really transition from a couple years of more big project based transformational change to more of a long term steady state continuous improvement culture so some great start there and i ve also gotten to meet a lot of the talent further in their organization the gms that run different parts of europe and some of the key marketing and technology folks in the bracing business and in the surgical and other businesses there s a lot of great talent in this business that is energized and excited about the opportunity we ve got ahead there s obviously some heavy lifting out of the gate there always is when you go through a transition like this but i think there is some very good positive energy about where we ll go together joe giordano cowen analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of julian mitchell with barclays your line is open lee sandquist barclays analyst hi good morning this is lee on for julian despite the increase in adjusted net income free cash flow became even more negative year over year i understand the strategic transaction costs and djo working capital headwinds but could you just walk us through the free cash flow outlook for the rest of the year are we still on track for the original 190 million to 210 million guide christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes we are still on track for the 190 million to 210 million as you could imagine we anticipated the payment of these transaction related costs when we did our guidance and we also planned for the working capital investment that we would make in the djo business in the first two quarters of this year so we remain very much on track lee sandquist barclays analyst okay and what was the actual djo organic sales growth rate for the first full quarter and is the 1 to 3 organic growth rate still the right assumption christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes the core growth in both march and the first quarter was a little bit positive and in the 1 to 2 range and so we still very much see that 1 to 3 core range as the right full year outlook q2 is a tougher comp they had pretty strong q2 last year and so we expect to stay in a similar range as we work through q2 but then have some acceleration in the back half of the year lee sandquist barclays analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is now open joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joe christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi joe joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst can we start on just the 2q bridge for a second so i think your implied earnings guide is about 0 58 to 0 61 and that s just a little bit lower than typical seasonality and so i know you guys have called out tax and fx as headwinds but are there other things that we need to consider from just a growth perspective or from an incremental margin perspective as we think about 2q christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer no i d say the you ve got the primary headwinds there fx is a year over year headwind that we think will be similar to what we encountered in q1 we ve obviously got a difference in the tax rate over the prior year we re on a good trajectory for the year last year just had the benefit from the r d tax credits that we went after for prior years that was facilitated by the sale of the fluid handling business and so i d say that those are really the two key items the other thing to note is that the financing that we did in conjunction with the djo acquisition we get the first full quarter of that in q2 so q1 reflected part of the interest cost and the equity issuance that we did and then q2 will reflect the full impact for that joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay all right no that makes a little bit more sense and then i guess my second question there have been some reports out there regarding potential auction process for the air gas handling business you guys made comments earlier that it was proceeding with speed so to the extent that there is anything else that you can tell us around how that process is working and i guess what your expectation would be that would be helpful matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes first the business is performing very well and i think that s always a good thing when you re going through a process like this it s a robust process as we ve talked about before and we still have a full expectation that we will complete the process here in the first half of the year and then complete the transaction in the second half of the year consistent with what we ve said before joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay great and then maybe my one last follow on here is just on djo and as you re thinking about the platform or adjacency opportunities is this something that when you re thinking about the expediency of adding the djo is this do you think going to be more of a multi year process deleveraging and then pursuing m a or do you think that you can maybe get at it a little quicker once you get this transaction taken care of on the air gas handling side matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so first i d say certainly the med tech space and the orthopedic solutions area within that med tech space have ample opportunity for both small and larger bolt ons that d be attractive ways to strengthen and expand the business second we ve consistently said that 2019 is going to be about operational progress and deleveraging and really not to focus on bolt ons we ve got ones we ve done in the past few years that are performing well and we re focusing on make sure that they deliver their full potential but with the other things we need to focus on in 2019 we don t expect to be doing any significant bolt ons but certainly as we turn the corner over into 2020 we expect to be working a proactive pipeline there and looking to be able to get back to bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and expand our platforms joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you i ll pass it on operator thank you and our following question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz with citi your line is open andrew kaplowitz citi analyst hi good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning andrew andrew kaplowitz citi analyst matt you mentioned the six new products you introduced at djo how long did it take in the med tech space to really gain penetration and help your overall growth and now that you ve been in the business for a little bit of time when would you anticipate a step up in growth in that prevention rehabilitation business matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so i think by the time we launched the products they went through the regulatory approvals and things so we were ready to start selling them and i think like other industries there is some benefit from the new products themselves and there is some benefit from just having a fresher new product line and how that affects the channel and how they view you and so we certainly feel like as we work through the next few quarters the benefits of those new products should start to show up we ve actually got 17 new products coming through total this year in djo and so as we get to the back half of the year we expect the operational improvements and the new products coming through to be able to accelerate the growth get that part of the business over into a positive growth range in line with our plans andrew kaplowitz citi analyst that s helpful and then just shifting to air gas obviously power has been a pretty difficult market for you but you did record 11 order growth there you specifically mentioned some recovery in asian power so maybe you could talk about that what you re specifically seeing in power now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes again we ve been consistent that we see power as a flat market but then in any given quarter there could be some ups and downs based on the newbuild park in particular and the industry has gotten back to a little bit of a capacity build out in asia and then there s also an environmental opportunity in india that will play out over the coming years and i think both of those are contributing just a little bit in terms of positive order flow and positive funnel and opportunity to keep that business flat or better going forward andrew kaplowitz citi analyst and then one more quick one for chris if tariffs do move to 25 how should we think about price versus cost for you guys can you maintain the positive price dynamic that you have in fab tech at this point christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so the tariffs that have hit to date the majority of them that we ve been able to pass through pretty quickly to the market and then there is a small amount that we ve absorbed in our equipment and are working on some different supply chain options in order to be able to offset that and a new round of tariffs we d expect to be able to pass through quite quickly based on the nature of those some of the other price increases take a little bit more time whereas the tariffs based on the nature of them are something that typically we can turn around and pass through quite quickly andrew kaplowitz citi analyst thanks matt operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst hi there so maybe starting with air gas handling the margins were really impressive this quarter just thinking about i know you guys talked about this is like a potential source of upside throughout the rest of the year but is there any reason why this level of improvement that you saw in margins isn t sustainable as we think of like phasing of backlog coming through revenues maybe the phasing of the restructuring payback that you ll see this year if you could just talk through that that will be helpful matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer nicole the margin improvement on a year over year basis is something that we see as something that we can continue as we work through the year it s really based on structural improvement of the business choices we ve made about what projects to do or not do restructuring that we ve done and more of which comes through pricing actions on aftermarket that are sustainable and then ongoing productivity in the business and so we see those as sustainable as we work through the year and we should be able to hold the year over year gains consistently nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay got it great and then just as my follow up if we could talk a little bit about what you saw within oil and gas for the quarter what drove that 38 organic order growth and whether you re seeing a pretty good pipeline for continued order growth throughout the rest of the year matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think we ve consistently said that there is a healthy amount of projects out there but they tend to even now start and stop and it doesn t affect us as much because we re no longer going after the big low margin ones but the smaller ones tend to some come in some quarters and some come in other quarters but the pipeline remains healthy based on the environment there the oil price level environment and so this quarter we were a little heavier on the projects we don t see that as a new reality of that level of growth rate but we do see it as a positive signal that that long cycle recovery continues and we expect to continue to have positive momentum in that piece of the business nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst thanks matt i ll pass it on operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt trusz with g research your line is open matthew trusz g research analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning matthew trusz g research analyst so you mentioned the order strength for air gas in april can you comment on the overall industrial trends you ve seen in 2019 year to date specifically did you see a weak january and stronger march like several of your peers and are you seeing more broadly the march trend hold in april and has there been any change in level of customer caution or confidence matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so in terms of the industrial question as it relates to the air gas handling we re seeing continue to see healthy demand there and some of that s market driven and some of it is based on some things regulatory driven things from the chinese government that are generating demand as well i think the second part of the question sounds like it was aimed more at welding and i d say we did see a little slower start to the year in january but then the quarter rounded out as we ve shared here in the mid single digits range and our plan for the balance of the year is to stay in that mid single digit range and the way that we ve started the second quarter would i would say that we re on track for that matthew trusz g research analyst thank you and a follow up on that to the extent that you have visibility of the fab tech end markets are you seeing long cycle performance quite strong there similar to at air gas and would that mean to what extent are you seeing short cycle general industrial more weak thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure i think certainly some of the things that are fueling the demand in fab tech are long cycle and the infrastructure are the things that are the healthier parts of the demand and there is no question that some of the pieces like automotive that we participate in a little less are tailing off but overall there is still a positive growth in inaudible there matthew trusz g research analyst thanks matt operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to kevin johnson for closing remarks kevin johnson vice president of finance thanks for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you on our next call operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for

from operations of approximately for the year strong cash position of 142 million at quarter end at quarter end on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and is proceeding with an expansion project to increase fekola s processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the company will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study preliminary economic assessment pea for the fekola mine including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and is proceeding

expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from to and to increase the accordion feature from to the upsized rcf is expected to close by for full year 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold 2019 first quarter operational results consolidated gold production in the first quarter of 2019 was 230 859 ounces 6 12 704 ounces above budget gold production from the company s fekola masbate otjikoto and el limon mines all exceeded their targeted production the fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines continued their very strong operational performances with both well above their budgeted production for the quarter for the first quarter of 2019 the fekola mine produced 110 349 ounces of gold well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces and the masbate mine produced 57 481 ounces of gold significantly above budget by 15 7 490 ounces compared to the prior year quarter gold production was marginally lower by 8 825 ounces consolidated cash operating costs in the quarter were 545 per ounce sold below budget by 27 per ounce 5 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly attributable to masbate s above budget gold production and significantly lower than budgeted mining costs see operations section below also contributing to the favourable budget variance were otjikoto s sales of lower cost gold ounces from its opening inventory and higher ore tonnage than budgeted from its otjikoto and wolfshag pits compared to the prior year quarter consolidated cash operating costs on a per ounce of gold sold basis were 74 per ounce higher 16 primarily due to the lower grade stockpile material processed during the first quarter of 2019 at fekola as a result of fekola s significantly higher than budgeted mill throughput as well as to lower gold sales the comparative quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 lower cost ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production consolidated aisc in the first quarter were 848 per ounce sold q1 2018 719 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 133 per ounce 14 reflecting the lower per ounce cash operating costs noted above and lower than planned capital expenditures which were 24 million lower than budget this reflects mainly timing differences as the majority of the capital underspend is expected to be incurred later in 2019 given the gold production outperformance in the first quarter of 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production for full year 2019 forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces for the first half of 2019 consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 436 000 and 456 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 499 000 and 519 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 consolidated cash costs are projected to remain low in 2019 with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold as previously released consolidated gold production for full year 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to the planned development of open pits in the first half of the year and subsequent ore production from those pits in the second half 2019 first quarter financial results consolidated gold revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was 302 million on sales of 232 076 ounces at an average price of 1 300 per ounce compared to 344 million on sales of 259 837 ounces at an average price of 1 325 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 gold sales of 232 076 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 were 6 13 564 ounces above budget compared to the prior year quarter the decrease in revenue related mainly to the timing of gold shipments as the prior year quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production cash flow provided by operating activities was 86 million 0 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 147 million 0 15 per share in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease mainly reflects lower gold revenue as the comparative quarter benefitted from the sale of its opening gold inventories for full year 2019 if a gold price assumption of 1 300 per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately 400 million for the year for the first quarter of 2019 the company generated net income of 27 million 0 02 per share compared to net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted net income see non ifrs measures for the first quarter of 2019 was 38 million 0 04 per share compared to adjusted net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 liquidity and capital resources at march 31 2019 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 142 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of 103 million at december 31 2018 working capital at march 31 2019 was 206 million compared to 156 million at december 31 2018 at march 31 2019 the company had drawn 400 million under the 500 million rcf leaving an undrawn and available balance under the existing facility of 100 million in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize its rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million in addition as a reflection of b2gold s financial strength the upsized rcf is expected to include increased flexibility for permitted borrowings and equipment financings coupled with less onerous financial covenants and lower pricing the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 and will be for a term of four years to mid 2023 final closing of the facility and the availability of funds under it remains subject to completion of customary closing conditions the upsized rcf coupled with strong operating cash flows from the company s existing mine operations is expected to provide the company with continued financial flexibility to advance existing assets and pursue exploration opportunities the company s current strategy is to continue to reduce debt expand the fekola mine throughput and annual production further advance its pipeline of development and exploration projects and evaluate

production of 110 349 ounces well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces as the processing facilities continued to outperform throughout the quarter the operation continued to demonstrate sustained high processing throughput without reduced recoveries for the first quarter of 2019 mill throughput was 1 73 million tonnes exceeding budget by 25 and the prior year quarter by 31 overall mill throughput increased during the quarter from past quarters due to a combination of factors metallurgy was favourable and excellent recoveries were achieved with a grind coarser than planned approximately 12 of the feed came from weathered saprolite ore which requires little grinding low grade ore feed during the quarter coming mostly from upper elevations in the pit appears to have been softer than anticipated and overall feed size to the plant was finer than budgeted in addition fine tuning of the plant circuit by the operators also played a role in the positive plant performance given the plant s ability to process significantly higher than budgeted throughput during this period the company took the decision to add lower grade material from the stockpiles to the plant feed this resulted in higher gold production at a lower average grade and as expected in marginally higher per ounce cash operating costs for the quarter the average grade processed was 2 11 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 2 48 g t gold grades from the mine continue to reconcile closely to the block model gold recoveries in the quarter averaged 94 1 compared to budget of 94 0 and 94 8 in the first quarter of 2018 fekola s first quarter cash operating costs were 397 per ounce sold marginally above budget by 28 per ounce or 8 and higher than the prior year quarter of 270 per ounce sold by 127 per ounce or 47 the increase over budget and the comparative quarter was mainly due to the lower grade stockpile material being processed during the quarter as discussed above fekola s aisc for the first quarter were 614 per ounce sold q1 2018 474 per ounce sold slightly below budget by 31 per ounce capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 21 million mainly consisting of 7 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 5 million for pre stripping and 5 million for fadougou village relocation costs for full year 2019 the fekola mine is expected to produce between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 370 and 410 per ounce sold and aisc of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as new high grade ore production from phase 4 of the fekola pit is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2019 for the first half of 2019 the fekola mine is forecast to produce between 205 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 215 000 and 220 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study pea for the fekola mine as a result the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the pea took into account the significant increase in the fekola mineral resource announced on october 25 2018 based on the pea once this expansion is complete the fekola mine is expected to produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous life of mine lom project economic highlights from the pea include estimated optimized lom extended into 2030 including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and over 400 000 ounces per year over the lom 2019 2030 projected gold production of approximately 5 000 000 ounces over the new mine life of 12 years of mining and processing including 2019 an increase in project pre tax net present value of approximately 500 million versus the comparable amounts in the company s latest aif mineral reserve lom model filed on sedar on march 20 2019 assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 and forecast lom pre tax net present value of over 2 2 billion the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which are expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2020 with public release of the pea results b2gold has filed a material change report and will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study pea will be realized fekola exploration for 2019 exploration on the licenses in mali is budgeted to total 18 million the company continues its drilling program to convert fekola s inferred resources to indicated and plans to further drill the potential to the north of fekola which remains open the new cardinal target located west of the fekola pit and the anaconda zones masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines continued its very strong operational performance into the first quarter of 2019 producing 57 481 ounces of gold 15 7 490 ounces above budget and 8 4 334 ounces higher compared to the prior year quarter gold production was significantly above budget due to both higher than expected head grade and recovery as ore grade oxide ore tonnage and total ore tonnage mined from the main vein pit were all better than modelled masbate s gold production for the quarter resulted from processing 1 83 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 85 million tonnes and 1 79 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2018 at an average grade of 1 32 g t compared to budget of 1 20 g t and 1 17 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 73 8 compared to budget of 69 7 and 78 5 in the first quarter of 2018 oxide ore represented 31 of the processed tonnage for the quarter versus budget of 8 and 78 in the first quarter of 2018 as planned compared to the first quarter of 2018 gold grades increased while recoveries decreased as higher grade transition fresh ore was mainly mined from the main vein pit in the first quarter of 2019 whereas the prior year quarter included lower grade oxide ore mined from the colorado pit masbate s first quarter cash operating costs were 546 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 123 per ounce 18 and comparable with the prior year quarter the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was driven by the above budget gold production and masbate s mining costs which were well below budget for the quarter by 24 cost savings were mainly in the areas of drilling blasting mining locations included backfill areas which did not require blasting and blast pattern spacing was increased resulting in savings for drill meters and blast agents loading hauling mainly due to lower fuel and maintenance costs and fewer total tonnes of waste moved which was a result of fleet activity focused in main vein area resulting in a lower than budgeted strip ratio masbate s aisc for the quarter were 743 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 222 per ounce 23 mainly due to the lower than budgeted mining costs and comparable with the prior year quarter capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 8 million which mainly consisted of masbate processing plant upgrades of 4 million mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds of 1 million pre stripping costs of 1 million and tailings storage facility costs of 1 million the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 mtpa was completed in early 2019 with the expansion now fully commissioned and online masbate s annual gold production is projected to average approximately 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed in the subsequent period after open pit mining activities have ceased for full year 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce sold otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia also had a solid first quarter producing 32 712 ounces of gold q1 2018 39 499 ounces 4 1 275 ounces above budget this was attributable to above budget mining tonnage from the otjikoto pit and higher than budgeted processed grade as previously released otjikoto s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 during the first quarter of 2019 the otjikoto mine processed 0 8 million tonnes comparable to budget and the prior year quarter at an average grade of 1 29 g t compared to budget of 1 19 g t and 1 51 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 98 6 compared to budget of 98 0 and 98 7 in the first quarter of 2018 for first quarter 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 519 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 136 per ounce 21 and 30 per ounce below the first quarter of 2018 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly due to lower cost gold ounces sold from opening inventory and from higher than budgeted ore stockpile additions in the first quarter of 2019 more ore tonnes were stockpiled than budgeted as a result of higher ore tonnage than budgeted from phase 2 of the otjikoto pit and phase 2 of the wolfshag pit these positive ore tonnage reconciliations decreased the strip ratio and increased stockpiled tonnage for the first quarter of 2019 on a total cost basis otjikoto s mining processing and site general costs were approximately as budgeted for the quarter otjikoto s aisc for the quarter were 829 per ounce sold q1 2018 723 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 293 per ounce 26 mainly due to higher than budgeted sales also sustaining capital expenditures were 4 million below budget mainly relating to lower capitalized stripping which is expected to be an overall capital expenditure saving for the year capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million consisting of 4 million for pre stripping and 3 million for new mobile equipment and mobile equipment rebuilds for full year 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold primarily from the otjikoto pit at cash operating costs of between 520 and 560 per ounce and aisc of between 905 and 945 per ounce for the first half of 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 66 000 and 71 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 99 000 and 104 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 el limon gold mine nicaragua el limon mine in nicaragua produced 12 231 ounces of gold q1 2018 13 529 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 slightly above budget during the quarter ore production from the new limon central pit commenced with 49 000 tonnes mined at an average grade of 3 43 g t development of the limon central pit remains the focus of surface operations at el limon mine the santa pancha underground mine continues to operate normally and development of the veta nueva underground mine is proceeding as planned as previously released el limon s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as high grade ore production from the new limon central pit is scheduled to fully come on line at the beginning of the second half of 2019 for first quarter 2019 el limon s cash operating costs were 991 per ounce sold compared to budget of 876 per ounce sold and aisc were 1 524 per ounce sold compared to budget of 1 400 per ounce sold both above budget primarily due to lower than budgeted gold sales el limon s gold sales were 6 below budget in the quarter due to the timing of gold shipments production costs were on budget on a total basis capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million which mainly consisted of underground development costs for santa pancha and veta nueva of 4 million and limon central pre stripping costs of 3 million for full year 2019 el limon is expected to produce between 55 000 and 60 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 720 and 760 per ounce sold and aisc of between 1 005 and 1 045 per ounce sold for the first half of 2019 el limon mine is forecast to produce between 22 000 and 25 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 33 000 and 35 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 la libertad gold mine nicaragua la libertad mine in nicaragua produced 18 086 ounces of gold q1 2018 19 367 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 14 2 899 ounces below budget gold production at la libertad was affected by lower than planned grade from the san diego pit which was partly offset by higher than planned ore tonnage and grade from the san juan pit as previously released la libertad s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as la libertad s production forecast assumes that production will start from the new jabali antenna pit in the second half of 2019 dependent upon the successful completion of resettlement activities and receipt of the jabali antenna open pit permit during the quarter the company concluded an agreement for jabali antenna with the small miners in the area and successfully conducted the public consultation that is required for issuance of a mine permit with the permitting issues related to the site largely resolved the company anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 as budgeted la libertad s cash operating costs in the quarter were 1 295 per ounce sold q1 2018 1 040 per ounce sold 249 per ounce 24 above budget and were impacted by the lower than budgeted production discussed above la libertad s aisc were 1 647 per ounce sold 145 per ounce 8 below budget as previously released la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year the lower than budgeted aisc resulted from lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures arising from timing delays in developing the jabali antenna open pit and underground mines 6 million and the construction of the tailings storage facility 4 million partially offset by higher cash operating costs as described above and lower gold ounces sold compared to budget these delayed capital costs are expected to be incurred in later in 2019 total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 were 4 million consisting primarily of tailings storage facility costs of 3 million for full year 2019 la libertad mine is expected to produce between 95 000 and 100 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 840 and 880 per ounce sold and aisc of between 1 150 and 1 190 per ounce sold for the first half of 2019 la libertad mine is forecast to produce between 43 000 and 45 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 52 000 and 55 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and the timing of capital expenditures relating to the tailings storage facility lift 11 million which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2019 outlook looking forward in 2019 b2gold plans to continue to maximize cash flows and maintain a strong financial position by continuing the impressive

principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver or gold ounce sold net of by product credits aisc the company has adopted aisc as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the company believes it is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of operating our consolidated business than traditional cash costs per payable ounce as it includes the cost of replacing ounces through exploration the cost of ongoing capital investments sustaining capital general and administrative expenses as well as other items that affect the company s consolidated earnings and cash flow total debt is calculated as the

over the past year the u s economy added an average of 213 000 jobs every month driving unemployment down to 3 6 percent its lowest point since 1969 the last time this much of the american workforce was on the job the beatles were still a band and presidential hopefuls pete buttigieg cory booker and kirsten gillibrand hadn t been born yet the overall economy gdp grew at 3 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 twice as fast as the last two years of the obama administration average wages grew far faster than inflation and are now at 27 77 per hour and yet there s no sign of inflation as legendary late night tv host johnny carson might have said to ed mcmahon this trump economy is so hot how hot is it what do economists think about the current state of our nation s fiscal health spectacular is the only way to describe this jobs report economist sung won sohn of loyola marymount university told the washington post who asked in their own headline is this economy too good to be true and economist ryan bourne of the cato institute says that when it comes to jobs the economy is even stronger than it looks i think the most striking thing for me is the employment to population ratio which is now performing better than at the height of the pre crash boom once you adjust for how the population has aged since then bourne tells insidesources adjusted for the older population the actual employment rate today is 62 8 percent much higher than the estimated rate of 62 2 percent in 2006 if today s population structure is applied the us labor market on employment rates at least appears to be performing better now than prior to the crash bourne says and that s not all how hot is this economy so hot it s reducing inequality peter morici of the university of maryland tells insidesources that s in stark contrast to the obama years when despite economic growth in the wake of the great recession income inequality accelerated as top earners wealth increased faster than lower income families the income gap generally worsened during the obama administration and was still increasing during his last year in office it s been a different story under donald trump in march goldman sachs reported that blue collar and middle class wages for the previous year rose by four percent twice as fast as higher earners during obama s time inequality increased morici said in a fox news interview now inequality is decreasing minorities women the handicapped they re all benefitting dramatically from this more robust growth they re being drawn into the labor market they re getting better jobs so this is a really good economy and then there s rising worker productivity which some economists believe is the single best indicator of the underlying health of an economy and its potential for continued growth in the first quarter of 2019 productivity rose a robust 3 6 percent the highest rate in nearly a decade in the end all growth comes from productivity economist john cochrane of the hoover institution tells insidesources we are immensely better off than our great grandparents only because each person can produce so much more per hour stimulus redistribution negotiation splitting the pie nothing else comes close when it comes to impacting our economy cochrane says and economist mark j perry of the american enterprise institute notes this data point dining out the restaurant performance index from the national restaurant association provides a monthly measure of economic conditions nationally perry says like new cars consumers spend more eating at restaurants when they are confident about their jobs and economic situation etc the trend from the rpi is up and the restaurant association reports that roughly one half of restaurant operators expect to see stronger sales volumes in six months still while the economic skies look clear some economists see potential dark clouds on the horizon desmond lachman of aei tells insidesources says one might wonder whether the economy has feet of clay thanks to the trump administration we now have a ballooning budget deficit and a debt level that is on track to exceed 100 percent of gdp we also have had the economy pumped up by a massive amount of money printing that has led to asset price bubbles and credit misallocation around the globe we also now have an america first policy that is heightening the chances of a trade war with china and then with europe all of this means that should the us economy turn down for any reason we will not have much budget or monetary policy ammunition to fight it lachman warns and ted bauman senior research analyst and economist at banyan hill publishing has an outlook that s positively bleak how good is this economy so good that people are seriously comparing it to the 1920 s bauman jokes they re calling this the roaring 2020 s stock prices are at all time highs the wealthiest one percent once again hold enormous wealth and call the shots in government the labor movement is on its heels and inequality is as high as it has ever been government deficits have exploded in the aftermath of big wars nationalism is on the rise says bauman but we ve still got more than a decade to go until the anniversary of the great crash of october 2029 so what s not to like bauman s view is definitely an outlier even media outlets and think tanks hostile to the trump presidency have acknowledged the economy s success and predictions of doom from just a few weeks ago today look downright embarrassing on february 28 obama white house economist jason furman tweeted given the large amount of fiscal stimulus in 2018 is unlikely to be repeated and the labor market has less room than it did a year ago it s very likely this is a high water mark for the recent period growth in 2019 is tracking around 1 percent and potential growth is around 1 75 percent if this economic success continues into 2020 donald trump may get the last laugh

economic assessment pea for the fekola mine including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and is proceeding with an expansion project to increase fekola s processing throughput by 1 5 million tonnes per annum mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the company will issue an updated

report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize the revolving credit facility rcf capacity from to and to increase the accordion feature from to the upsized rcf is expected to close by for full year 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold 2019 first quarter operational results consolidated gold production in the first quarter of 2019 was 230 859 ounces 6 12 704 ounces above budget gold production from the company s fekola masbate otjikoto and el limon mines all exceeded their targeted production the fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines continued their very strong operational performances with both well above their budgeted production for the quarter for the first quarter of 2019 the fekola mine produced 110 349 ounces of gold well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces and the masbate mine produced 57 481 ounces of gold significantly above budget by 15 7 490 ounces compared to the prior year quarter gold production was marginally lower by 8 825 ounces consolidated cash operating costs in the quarter were 545 per ounce sold below budget by 27 per ounce 5 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly attributable to masbate s above budget gold production and significantly lower than budgeted mining costs see operations section below also contributing to the favourable budget variance were otjikoto s sales of lower cost gold ounces from its opening inventory and higher ore tonnage than budgeted from its otjikoto and wolfshag pits compared to the prior year quarter consolidated cash operating costs on a per ounce of gold sold basis were 74 per ounce higher 16 primarily due to the lower grade stockpile material processed during the first quarter of 2019 at fekola as a result of fekola s significantly higher than budgeted mill throughput as well as to lower gold sales the comparative quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 lower cost ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production consolidated aisc in the first quarter were 848 per ounce sold q1 2018 719 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 133 per ounce 14 reflecting the lower per ounce cash operating costs noted above and lower than planned capital expenditures which were 24 million lower than budget this reflects mainly timing differences as the majority of the capital underspend is expected to be incurred later in 2019 given the gold production outperformance in the first quarter of 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production for full year 2019 forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces for the first half of 2019 consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 436 000 and 456 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 499 000 and 519 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 consolidated cash costs are projected to remain low in 2019 with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold as previously released consolidated gold production for full year 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to the planned development of open pits in the first half of the year and subsequent ore production from those pits in the second half 2019 first quarter financial results consolidated gold revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was 302 million on sales of 232 076 ounces at an average price of 1 300 per ounce compared to 344 million on sales of 259 837 ounces at an average price of 1 325 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 gold sales of 232 076 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 were 6 13 564 ounces above budget compared to the prior year quarter the decrease in revenue related mainly to the timing of gold shipments as the prior year quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production cash flow provided by operating activities was 86 million 0 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 147 million 0 15 per share in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease mainly reflects lower gold revenue as the comparative quarter benefitted from the sale of its opening gold inventories for full year 2019 if a gold price assumption of 1 300 per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately 400 million for the year for the first quarter of 2019 the company generated net income of 27 million 0 02 per share compared to net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted net income see non ifrs measures for the first quarter of 2019 was 38 million 0 04 per share compared to adjusted net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018

march 31 2019 was 206 million compared to 156 million at december 31 2018 at march 31 2019 the company had drawn 400 million under the 500 million rcf leaving an undrawn and available balance under the existing facility of 100 million in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize its rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million in addition as a reflection of b2gold s financial strength the upsized rcf is expected to include increased flexibility for permitted borrowings and equipment financings coupled with less onerous financial covenants and lower pricing the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 and will be for a term of four years to mid 2023 final closing of the facility and the availability of funds under it remains subject to completion of customary closing conditions the upsized rcf coupled with strong operating cash flows from the company s existing mine operations is expected to provide the company with continued financial flexibility to advance existing assets and pursue exploration opportunities the company s current strategy is to continue to reduce debt expand the fekola mine throughput and annual production further advance its pipeline of development and exploration projects and evaluate exploration

110 349 ounces well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces as the processing facilities continued to outperform throughout the quarter the operation continued to demonstrate sustained high processing throughput without reduced recoveries for the first quarter of 2019 mill throughput was 1 73 million tonnes exceeding budget by 25 and the prior year quarter by 31 overall mill throughput increased during the quarter from past quarters due to a combination of factors metallurgy was favourable and excellent recoveries were achieved with a grind coarser than planned approximately 12 of the feed came from weathered saprolite ore which requires little grinding low grade ore feed during the quarter coming mostly from upper elevations in the pit appears to have been softer than anticipated and overall feed size to the plant was finer than budgeted in addition fine tuning of the plant circuit by the operators also played a role in the positive plant performance given the plant s ability to process significantly higher than budgeted throughput during this period the company took the decision to add lower grade material from the stockpiles to the plant feed this resulted in higher gold production at a lower average grade and as expected in marginally higher per ounce cash operating costs for the quarter the average grade processed was 2 11 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 2 48 g t gold grades from the mine continue to reconcile closely to the block model gold recoveries in the quarter averaged 94 1 compared to budget of 94 0 and 94 8 in the first quarter of 2018 fekola s first quarter cash operating costs were 397 per ounce sold marginally above budget by 28 per ounce or 8 and higher than the prior year quarter of 270 per ounce sold by 127 per ounce or 47 the increase over budget and the comparative quarter was mainly due to the lower grade stockpile material being processed during the quarter as discussed above fekola s aisc for the first quarter were 614 per ounce sold q1 2018 474 per ounce sold slightly below budget by 31 per ounce capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 21 million mainly consisting of 7 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 5 million for pre stripping and 5 million for fadougou village relocation costs for full year 2019 the fekola mine is expected to produce between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 370 and 410 per ounce sold and aisc of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as new high grade ore production from phase 4 of the fekola pit is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2019 for the first half of 2019 the fekola mine is forecast to produce between 205 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 215 000 and 220 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study pea for the fekola mine as a result the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the pea took into account the significant increase in the fekola mineral resource announced on october 25 2018 based on the pea once this expansion is complete the fekola mine is expected to produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous life of mine lom project economic highlights from the pea include estimated optimized lom extended into 2030 including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and over 400 000 ounces per year over the lom 2019 2030 projected gold production of approximately 5 000 000 ounces over the new mine life of 12 years of mining and processing including 2019 an increase in project pre tax net present value of approximately 500 million versus the comparable amounts in the company s latest aif mineral reserve lom model filed on sedar on march 20 2019 assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 and forecast lom pre tax net present value of over 2 2 billion the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which are expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2020 with public release of the pea results b2gold has filed a material change report and will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study pea will be realized fekola exploration for 2019 exploration on the licenses in mali is budgeted to total 18 million the company continues its drilling program to convert fekola s inferred resources to indicated and plans to further drill the potential to the north of fekola which remains open the new cardinal target located west of the fekola pit and the anaconda zones masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines continued its very strong operational performance into the first quarter of 2019 producing 57 481 ounces of gold 15 7 490 ounces above budget and 8 4 334 ounces higher compared to the prior year quarter gold production was significantly above budget due to both higher than expected head grade and recovery as ore grade oxide ore tonnage and total ore tonnage mined from the main vein pit were all better than modelled masbate s gold production for the quarter resulted from processing 1 83 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 85 million tonnes and 1 79 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2018 at an average grade of 1 32 g t compared to budget of 1 20 g t and 1 17 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 73 8 compared to budget of 69 7 and 78 5 in the first quarter of 2018 oxide ore represented 31 of the processed tonnage for the quarter versus budget of 8 and 78 in the first quarter of 2018 as planned compared to the first quarter of 2018 gold grades increased while recoveries decreased as higher grade transition fresh ore was mainly mined from the main vein pit in the first quarter of 2019 whereas the prior year quarter included lower grade oxide ore mined from the colorado pit masbate s first quarter cash operating costs were 546 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 123 per ounce 18 and comparable with the prior year quarter the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was driven by the above budget gold production and masbate s mining costs which were well below budget for the quarter by 24 cost savings were mainly in the areas of drilling blasting mining locations included backfill areas which did not require blasting and blast pattern spacing was increased resulting in savings for drill meters and blast agents loading hauling mainly due to lower fuel and maintenance costs and fewer total tonnes of waste moved which was a result of fleet activity focused in main vein area resulting in a lower than budgeted strip ratio masbate s aisc for the quarter were 743 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 222 per ounce 23 mainly due to the lower than budgeted mining costs and comparable with the prior year quarter capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 8 million which mainly consisted of masbate processing plant upgrades of 4 million mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds of 1 million pre stripping costs of 1 million and tailings storage facility costs of 1 million the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 mtpa was completed in early 2019 with the expansion now fully commissioned and online masbate s annual gold production is projected to average approximately 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed in the subsequent period after open pit mining activities have ceased for full year 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce sold otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia also had a solid first quarter producing 32 712 ounces of gold q1 2018 39 499 ounces 4 1 275 ounces above budget this was attributable to above budget mining tonnage from the otjikoto pit and higher than budgeted processed grade as previously released otjikoto s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 during the first quarter of 2019 the otjikoto mine processed 0 8 million tonnes comparable to budget and the prior year quarter at an average grade of 1 29 g t compared to budget of 1 19 g t and 1 51 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 98 6 compared to budget of 98 0 and 98 7 in the first quarter of 2018 for first quarter 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 519 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 136 per ounce 21 and 30 per ounce below the first quarter of 2018 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly due to lower cost gold ounces sold from opening inventory and from higher than budgeted ore stockpile additions in the first quarter of 2019 more ore tonnes were stockpiled than budgeted as a result of higher ore tonnage than budgeted from phase 2 of the otjikoto pit and phase 2 of the wolfshag pit these positive ore tonnage reconciliations decreased the strip ratio and increased stockpiled tonnage for the first quarter of 2019 on a total cost basis otjikoto s mining processing and site general costs were approximately as budgeted for the quarter otjikoto s aisc for the quarter were 829 per ounce sold q1 2018 723 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 293 per ounce 26 mainly due to higher than budgeted sales also sustaining capital expenditures were 4 million below budget mainly relating to lower capitalized stripping which is expected to be an overall capital expenditure saving for the year capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million consisting of 4 million for pre stripping and 3 million for new mobile equipment and mobile equipment rebuilds for full year 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold primarily from the otjikoto pit at cash operating costs of between 520 and 560 per ounce and aisc of between 905 and 945 per ounce for the first half of 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 66 000 and 71 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 99 000 and 104 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 el limon gold mine nicaragua el limon mine in nicaragua produced 12 231 ounces of gold q1 2018 13 529 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 slightly above budget during the quarter ore production from the new limon central pit commenced with 49 000 tonnes mined at an average grade of 3 43 g t development of the limon central pit remains the focus of surface operations at el limon mine the santa pancha underground mine continues to operate normally and development of the veta nueva underground mine is proceeding as planned as previously released el limon s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as high grade ore production from the new limon central pit is scheduled to fully come on line at the beginning of the second half of 2019 for first quarter 2019 el limon s cash operating costs were 991 per ounce sold compared to budget of 876 per ounce sold and aisc were 1 524 per ounce sold compared to budget of 1 400 per ounce sold both above budget primarily due to lower than budgeted gold sales el limon s gold sales were 6 below budget in the quarter due to the timing of gold shipments production costs were on budget on a total basis capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million which mainly consisted of underground development costs for santa pancha and veta nueva of 4 million and limon central pre stripping costs of 3 million for full year 2019 el limon is expected to produce between 55 000 and 60 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 720 and 760 per ounce sold and aisc of between 1 005 and 1 045 per ounce sold for the first half of 2019 el limon mine is forecast to produce between 22 000 and 25 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 33 000 and 35 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 la libertad gold mine nicaragua la libertad mine in nicaragua produced 18 086 ounces of gold q1 2018 19 367 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 14 2 899 ounces below budget gold production at la libertad was affected by lower than planned grade from the san diego pit which was partly offset by higher than planned ore tonnage and grade from the san juan pit as previously released la libertad s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as la libertad s production forecast assumes that production will start from the new jabali antenna pit in the second half of 2019 dependent upon the successful completion of resettlement activities and receipt of the jabali antenna open pit permit during the quarter the company concluded an agreement for jabali antenna with the small miners in the area and successfully conducted the public consultation that is required for issuance of a mine permit with the permitting issues related to the site largely resolved the company anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 as budgeted la libertad s cash operating costs in the quarter were 1 295 per ounce sold q1 2018 1 040 per ounce sold 249 per ounce 24 above budget and were impacted by the lower than budgeted production discussed above la libertad s aisc were 1 647 per ounce sold 145 per ounce 8 below budget as previously released la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year the lower than budgeted aisc resulted from lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures arising from timing delays in developing the jabali antenna open pit and underground mines 6 million and the construction of the tailings storage facility 4 million partially offset by higher cash operating costs as described above and lower gold ounces sold compared to budget these delayed capital costs are expected to be incurred in later in 2019 total capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 were 4 million consisting primarily of tailings storage facility costs of 3 million for full year 2019 la libertad mine is expected to produce between 95 000 and 100 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 840 and 880 per ounce sold and aisc of between 1 150 and 1 190 per ounce sold for the first half of 2019 la libertad mine is forecast to produce between 43 000 and 45 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 52 000 and 55 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year mainly due to higher expected gold production in the second half and the timing of capital expenditures relating to the tailings storage facility lift 11 million which is expected to be completed

great start in 2019 first quarter results were a bit better than expected and our first month of djo was in line with expectations fabrication technology achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of quarter sales growth all major markets grew fueled by price that is offsetting steel and other inflation air gas handling drove its third consecutive quarter of double digit order growth with all end markets moving in a positive direction we increased margins 160 basis points through productivity pricing and strong project execution the djo integration is on track with initial focus on operational improvement growth acceleration and transitioning to a cbs culture of continuous improvement moving to slide four you can see esab s continued growth trajectory in q1 margins improved as planned up 20 basis points year over year and up 180 basis points sequentially our fab tech business margins are improving on the strength of restructuring productivity and pricing actions while we have converted to adjusted ebitda to simplify reporting we still have conviction and line of sight to drive to 15 aop our mid single digit growth was driven by price as volume flattened in the quarter but we still saw a positive volume growth in our flow business part from market and part from share gain we continue to make great progress across the range of growth initiatives in both equipment and consumables and customers are excited by our lineup of new products and technologies a good example is the new automation product called versotrac the most versatile and user friendly tractor on the market the tractor allows the mechanization of certain welding processes to improve productivity and quality versotrac is unmatched in terms of portability up time and ease of use the gce acquisition is performing well and we re thoughtfully integrating our businesses in the welding market while driving growth initiatives to expand our position in specialty gases that serve attractive markets like life science research and healthcare slide five shows continued very strong growth in air gas handling orders in the first quarter our core industrial orders grew 21 on top of 24 in 2017 and 19 in 2018 we are clearly benefiting from the strategic shift in this business over the past few years orders in all other key end markets also grew consistent with the long cycle recovery momentum oil and gas was up 38 and the profitability of new orders continues to improve mining orders grew organically 29 and our mining project funnel and outlook remains in good shape our power orders grew 11 and we believe this part of the business has stabilized with improving prospects in asia air gas handling margins improved to 11 3 in the first quarter as shown in slide six this improvement resulted primarily from restructuring programs improvements in executing customer projects and strategic choices in oil and gas to focus on higher margin projects this is a very strong start and sets the path for significant expansion in margins for the full year sales in the quarter were lower than the prior year including fx pressures but higher orders of inaudible in the past three quarters have created a healthy backlog that supports our forecast for sales growth in the back half of this year slide seven summarizes results in our new med tech segment the djo acquisition was completed on february 22nd so the first quarter results only include one month of performance sales of 124 million and adjusted ebitda of 26 million in march were both in line with expectations march and q1 year over year core revenue growth were both positive led by performance in the reconstructive business djo launched six new products in the first quarter that will contribute to an improving growth trajectory later this year and in 2020 for example the djo surgical adaptable arm launched in march is the first fully sterile surgeon controlled leg and retractor holder for hip implant surgery the adaptable was recognized as one of the 10 products you need to know at the recent 2019 aaos meeting by the mdl organization like versotrac and esab this type of mechanization in implant procedures is expected to be an attractive area for differentiation that will support the business and continue to gain market share on slide eight i want to share with you our progress integrating djo and creating a healthy path for sustained performance improvement all of djos key leaders have attended cbs leadership training and we re quickly cascading foundational training throughout the business we are collaborating with the djo team to strengthen the operating discipline through monthly operating reviews that are supported by aggressive weekly and daily management our initial cbs focus areas are the completion of the transformation projects and transition to a continuous improvement culture we are working closely together to improve delivery and service in the performance rehab segment and this will support growth acceleration and lower structural costs we are also focused on procurement and value engineering to offset inflation and support margin expansion going forward in addition to these supply chain areas we ve targeted the reimbursement and product innovation processes as key opportunities for cbs to support accelerated growth on slide nine we look ahead we have made significant improvements in our air gas handling business that are now leading through with consistent growth in orders and margins and the business is expected to return to top line growth in the second half this improved business performance is creating a healthy level of interest from potential acquirers our fab tech business continues to grow in line with expectations outlined earlier this year supported by our global strength new products and pricing the integration teams at djo and colfax are working quickly and effectively to minimize disruption while accelerating business improvements everyone s excited by the opportunities ahead wrapping up we re off to a great start to what i expect will be a very successful year for colfax in 2019 i ll now hand over to chris christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer thanks matt and good morning continuing on to slide 10 company sales grew 14 in the first quarter to just over 1 billion reflecting 2 organic growth and 19 from acquisitions including 14 from djo we also faced a 6 currency translation headwind in the quarter from a stronger us dollar mostly compared with the argentine peso the euro and the russian ruble we grew gross profit by 87 million in the quarter and gross margin by nearly 5 full points 220 basis points from operating improvements and 260 basis points from acquiring the higher margin djo business higher gross profit contributed to better operating profitability despite over 6 million of year over year fx translation pressure adjusted ebitda increased 36 million and margins increased 230 basis points to 14 6 below the line interest expense was consistent with our expectations and will increase in q2 as we recognize the full quarter impact from the djo acquisition we continue to expect our full year tax rate of 22 which implies a lower rate for the remainder of the year to offset the higher q1 rate overall eps of 0 53 was slightly ahead of our expectations and represented 10 growth despite a translational fx headwind of about 0 04 a few other q1 housekeeping items to note first our air gas handling business completed the tender of all shares of its publicly traded subsidiary in south africa increasing its stake from 55 to 100 following an investment of 93 million second one of our largest uk pensions went into buyout and recorded a 44 million non cash charge this action is similar to our q4 2017 buyout of a different pension which also created a longer term de risking benefit for colfax third and lastly as expected our cash flow in the quarter included 56 million of strategic transaction costs and 16 million of djo working capital investment that we signaled to you on our previous call you should expect to see another 20 million to 25 billion working capital investment in q2 slide 11 shows the eps growth outlook for the first half of 2019 compared with 1 09 in the prior year during the first half of 2019 we expect strong operating performance from the fab tech and air gas handling businesses supported by current momentum and outlooks we continue to forecast the djo acquisition to be accretive and the other recent acquisitions such as gce are delivering expected results we anticipate fx to remain a headwind in the second quarter versus the prior year at current rates year over year pressures would ease in the second half as a reminder last year s q2 tax rate benefited from the one time implementation catch up of r d tax credits that will not recur this year our outlook for the full year on slide 12 is not changed we continue to guide 2 55 to 2 65 which represents growth of 10 or more for the year fab tech market conditions are expected to remain constructive for the rest of the year with strong price offsetting inflation and currency pressures air gas handling performance should continue to improve as we progress through 2019 supported by recent strong order growth restructuring actions and improved order quality the djo integration is progressing well and performing in line with expectations seasonal revenue patterns completion of large operating improvement projects and early cbs contributions should drive improvements throughout the balance of the year that concludes our prepared remarks operator please open up the call for questions questions and answers christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer operator instructions and our first question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets your line is open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so just on welding very good price volumes a little bit lower can you just talk about as you go through the year when you start to lap some of that price action and can you just talk about where volumes might be more mixed given some of the more mixed macro news we re seeing and where you seeing maybe areas of resiliency matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah sure jeff first on the price question certainly in q2 we start to lap it a little bit but it s really the back half of the year where we significantly lap some of the pricing actions and so the price impact will start to fade as we go through the year and we expect in our plan to have some volume growth in the year and we still fully expect to have the volume growth needed to get to that mid single digits plan number that we put out there in terms of how different places in the world are playing out certainly the north american markets slowed down a little in the first quarter as expected and planned after a strong back half of last year but we still see that as a positive growth markets european market is in similar place its been in the last few years with some parts of the market growing and some parts of the market not growing we ve been able to consistently grow over there and think that we ve been able to take some healthy share and then in the emerging markets around the world there is some positive momentum in some parts of south america turn it over to some decent volume growth india is still in a healthy volume growth range and some recovery starting to come through in places like the middle east and asia outside of china and while china has some industrial pressure on it the infrastructure investments in china are still on a pretty healthy clip and so we ve been able to stay in a positive range there jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just to understand the first half second half guidance a little bit better is that a function of more air gas seasonality or can you help us with how you re thinking about djo for 2q and how the seasonality lines up there christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so typically in the djo business jeff you d see the lowest quarter being in q1 and the strongest in q4 with development from q1 or a step up from q1 into q2 the transition from q2 to q3 can be generally not a lot of change in the sales levels sequentially and then the step up in q4 it s typically what the business has seen and that s in line with our expectations for the year in terms of the air gas handling business we expect to see the similar patterns to what you ve seen in the past there again with lowest q1 little bit of a step up in the sales levels as you head into q2 and q3 generally trading to be up or down a bit and then of course you step up into the q4 level so typical seasonality that you would expect to see in the business jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just one housekeeping item how are we looking for tax rate for 2q and for the rest of the year christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so for the full year jeff we re still expecting the rate to come in at about 22 or so it was little higher in q1 and that implies that we ll be doing some work to offset that in q2 q3 and q4 so you expect to see the rate below the 22 level just to get it to average out to 22 for the year jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our follow on question comes from the line of nathan jones of stifel your line is open nathan jones stifel analyst good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi nathan nathan jones stifel analyst just wanted to follow up on the welding volume side of that did i hear you matt say you still expect volume growth for the year in the mid single digits matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer no our guidance for the year was mid single digits overall core revenue growth and so obviously a decent chunk of that comes from price and then the rest comes from volume and we still have an expectation we will be able to be in a positive volume growth range nathan jones stifel analyst okay so you would expect the price tailwind to fade here just as you lap comps and that should be made up by a little bit of accelerating volume matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yeah that s correct as i said in my comments our flow business had positive volume growth in the first quarter and so really was we had less cutting systems shipped sort of strong shipments of cutting systems last year a little less shipped in the first quarter of this year and our funnel and backlog shows that that ll correct itself in the next quarter or two here nathan jones stifel analyst got it and then you guys said you had line of sight to adjusted operating margins of 15 you ve got i worked out about 130 basis points of amortization in that so 16 3 on the way you are reporting it now can you maybe talk about the things that you have line of sight to that gets you to that kind of number when we should recognize those things and any kind of estimate you can give us on when you should get to that margin level now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes i mean as you can see we ve started the year right where we need to be versus our plan we re already in the range of what we put out there as guidance for the year and so that has us in the right range to execute through this year s plan and as we ve talked about previously we ve built some good price muscle through the last few years unfortunately it had to be exercised just to offset a lot of inflation we expect that as steel flattens and some of the other inflation flattens which is starting to happen here that we will be able to more selectively exercise that price muscle and get a little bit in that price as things flatten or even turn down and then we ve also got productivity programs ongoing and then need to have a little bit of volume growth in the next couple of years to get the rest of the way to that 15 aop and we ll take you through later in the year at our investor day we ll give an update more on an ebitda basis but we just wanted to be clear that we haven t lost the trail on the aop at 15 commitment nathan jones stifel analyst all right thanks i ll pass it on operator thank you and our next question comes from joe giordano with cowen your line is open joe giordano cowen analyst hi guys good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joe joe giordano cowen analyst so i wanted to start on air gas obviously good quarter there in orders and on margin so just curious as we move through the year how much of that is kind of pulled in how does the funnel look on the order side what is the outlook for incremental spending there for the rest of the year and obviously the business you re trying to sell is still having good quarters holding stuff next year kind of makes sense but just curious as to how sustainable some of these metrics are for the remainder of the year should it remain under your ownership matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so first off the good strong first quarter on the back of a few other quarters of strong order growth is really driven by a healthy market environment across all of our end markets really a healthy long cycle recovery there as well as strong execution by the team and not by any kind of fire drill order pull ins i think we certainly didn t need to be above 20 to show a good strong quarter of growth we still see healthy growth in the second quarter and very clear line of sight on the mid to high single digit order growth that we signaled for the year with obviously the possibility of healthier than that based on how we ve started we have healthy funnels and april was another good month of orders there and so things are in on a good track there and on the margin front this was a good strong start really showing that the improvements that we made down the back half of last year are structural and sustainable and as the volume grows through the year in that business and we continue to see read through of the improvements we ve made we can continue to improve margins through the year in the business joe giordano cowen analyst and then chris on the full year guide keeping flat there can you talk through some of the puts and takes like how much more is fx of a headwind in there in that guidance three months ago how much was operationally kind of moved higher within the context of a flat like headline number christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer the view that we ve taken is number one the fx rates really haven t changed significantly over the last three months so so far this is playing out in line with what we had expected when we put together the guidance back in december and then reaffirmed in february and again in march from the other puts and takes as we looked at this it s really the start of the year there are some good things that are playing out it s a bit early for us to be moving the guidance around but clearly there s some good operating momentum as matt mentioned in the air gas handling business we see that continue to play out that represents upside opportunity for us but we re just at the beginning of the year and thought it was thought we d keep the guidance in place joe giordano cowen analyst okay and then maybe last from me matt i know it s early djo early stage with them but your initial impressions as you start talking to the business leaders there can you just take us through your thought process in the last month what you have been spending time on and what you ve seen matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure we ve spent over the last couple of months quite a bit of time with the leadership team there doing cbs training and assimilation and starting to dig in on some of the key operational issues and working on our 100 days strategic plan where we focus on some of the key strategic focus areas together there s great talent there the leadership team has got some terrific experience there very excited about being a part of colfax and they ve embraced cbs as a way to accelerate the progress in the business and to really transition from a couple years of more big project based transformational change to more of a long term steady state continuous improvement culture so some great start there and i ve also gotten to meet a lot of the talent further in their organization the gms that run different parts of europe and some of the key marketing and technology folks in the bracing business and in the surgical and other businesses there s a lot of great talent in this business that is energized and excited about the opportunity we ve got ahead there s obviously some heavy lifting out of the gate there always is when you go through a transition like this but i think there is some very good positive energy about where we ll go together joe giordano cowen analyst okay thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of julian mitchell with barclays your line is open lee sandquist barclays analyst hi good morning this is lee on for julian despite the increase in adjusted net income free cash flow became even more negative year over year i understand the strategic transaction costs and djo working capital headwinds but could you just walk us through the free cash flow outlook for the rest of the year are we still on track for the original 190 million to 210 million guide christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes we are still on track for the 190 million to 210 million as you could imagine we anticipated the payment of these transaction related costs when we did our guidance and we also planned for the working capital investment that we would make in the djo business in the first two quarters of this year so we remain very much on track lee sandquist barclays analyst okay and what was the actual djo organic sales growth rate for the first full quarter and is the 1 to 3 organic growth rate still the right assumption christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes the core growth in both march and the first quarter was a little bit positive and in the 1 to 2 range and so we still very much see that 1 to 3 core range as the right full year outlook q2 is a tougher comp they had pretty strong q2 last year and so we expect to stay in a similar range as we work through q2 but then have some acceleration in the back half of the year lee sandquist barclays analyst thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of joe ritchie with goldman sachs your line is now open joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning everyone matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning joe christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer hi joe joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst can we start on just the 2q bridge for a second so i think your implied earnings guide is about 0 58 to 0 61 and that s just a little bit lower than typical seasonality and so i know you guys have called out tax and fx as headwinds but are there other things that we need to consider from just a growth perspective or from an incremental margin perspective as we think about 2q christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer no i d say the you ve got the primary headwinds there fx is a year over year headwind that we think will be similar to what we encountered in q1 we ve obviously got a difference in the tax rate over the prior year we re on a good trajectory for the year last year just had the benefit from the r d tax credits that we went after for prior years that was facilitated by the sale of the fluid handling business and so i d say that those are really the two key items the other thing to note is that the financing that we did in conjunction with the djo acquisition we get the first full quarter of that in q2 so q1 reflected part of the interest cost and the equity issuance that we did and then q2 will reflect the full impact for that joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay all right no that makes a little bit more sense and then i guess my second question there have been some reports out there regarding potential auction process for the air gas handling business you guys made comments earlier that it was proceeding with speed so to the extent that there is anything else that you can tell us around how that process is working and i guess what your expectation would be that would be helpful matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes first the business is performing very well and i think that s always a good thing when you re going through a process like this it s a robust process as we ve talked about before and we still have a full expectation that we will complete the process here in the first half of the year and then complete the transaction in the second half of the year consistent with what we ve said before joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst okay great and then maybe my one last follow on here is just on djo and as you re thinking about the platform or adjacency opportunities is this something that when you re thinking about the expediency of adding the djo is this do you think going to be more of a multi year process deleveraging and then pursuing m a or do you think that you can maybe get at it a little quicker once you get this transaction taken care of on the air gas handling side matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so first i d say certainly the med tech space and the orthopedic solutions area within that med tech space have ample opportunity for both small and larger bolt ons that d be attractive ways to strengthen and expand the business second we ve consistently said that 2019 is going to be about operational progress and deleveraging and really not to focus on bolt ons we ve got ones we ve done in the past few years that are performing well and we re focusing on make sure that they deliver their full potential but with the other things we need to focus on in 2019 we don t expect to be doing any significant bolt ons but certainly as we turn the corner over into 2020 we expect to be working a proactive pipeline there and looking to be able to get back to bolt on acquisitions that strengthen and expand our platforms joseph ritchie goldman sachs analyst thank you i ll pass it on operator thank you and our following question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz with citi your line is open andrew kaplowitz citi analyst hi good morning guys matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning andrew andrew kaplowitz citi analyst matt you mentioned the six new products you introduced at djo how long did it take in the med tech space to really gain penetration and help your overall growth and now that you ve been in the business for a little bit of time when would you anticipate a step up in growth in that prevention rehabilitation business matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so i think by the time we launched the products they went through the regulatory approvals and things so we were ready to start selling them and i think like other industries there is some benefit from the new products themselves and there is some benefit from just having a fresher new product line and how that affects the channel and how they view you and so we certainly feel like as we work through the next few quarters the benefits of those new products should start to show up we ve actually got 17 new products coming through total this year in djo and so as we get to the back half of the year we expect the operational improvements and the new products coming through to be able to accelerate the growth get that part of the business over into a positive growth range in line with our plans andrew kaplowitz citi analyst that s helpful and then just shifting to air gas obviously power has been a pretty difficult market for you but you did record 11 order growth there you specifically mentioned some recovery in asian power so maybe you could talk about that what you re specifically seeing in power now matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes again we ve been consistent that we see power as a flat market but then in any given quarter there could be some ups and downs based on the newbuild park in particular and the industry has gotten back to a little bit of a capacity build out in asia and then there s also an environmental opportunity in india that will play out over the coming years and i think both of those are contributing just a little bit in terms of positive order flow and positive funnel and opportunity to keep that business flat or better going forward andrew kaplowitz citi analyst and then one more quick one for chris if tariffs do move to 25 how should we think about price versus cost for you guys can you maintain the positive price dynamic that you have in fab tech at this point christopher hix senior vice president finance chief financial officer yes so the tariffs that have hit to date the majority of them that we ve been able to pass through pretty quickly to the market and then there is a small amount that we ve absorbed in our equipment and are working on some different supply chain options in order to be able to offset that and a new round of tariffs we d expect to be able to pass through quite quickly based on the nature of those some of the other price increases take a little bit more time whereas the tariffs based on the nature of them are something that typically we can turn around and pass through quite quickly andrew kaplowitz citi analyst thanks matt operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of nicole deblase with deutsche bank your line is open nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer hi nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst hi there so maybe starting with air gas handling the margins were really impressive this quarter just thinking about i know you guys talked about this is like a potential source of upside throughout the rest of the year but is there any reason why this level of improvement that you saw in margins isn t sustainable as we think of like phasing of backlog coming through revenues maybe the phasing of the restructuring payback that you ll see this year if you could just talk through that that will be helpful matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer nicole the margin improvement on a year over year basis is something that we see as something that we can continue as we work through the year it s really based on structural improvement of the business choices we ve made about what projects to do or not do restructuring that we ve done and more of which comes through pricing actions on aftermarket that are sustainable and then ongoing productivity in the business and so we see those as sustainable as we work through the year and we should be able to hold the year over year gains consistently nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst okay got it great and then just as my follow up if we could talk a little bit about what you saw within oil and gas for the quarter what drove that 38 organic order growth and whether you re seeing a pretty good pipeline for continued order growth throughout the rest of the year matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes i mean i think we ve consistently said that there is a healthy amount of projects out there but they tend to even now start and stop and it doesn t affect us as much because we re no longer going after the big low margin ones but the smaller ones tend to some come in some quarters and some come in other quarters but the pipeline remains healthy based on the environment there the oil price level environment and so this quarter we were a little heavier on the projects we don t see that as a new reality of that level of growth rate but we do see it as a positive signal that that long cycle recovery continues and we expect to continue to have positive momentum in that piece of the business nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst thanks matt i ll pass it on operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matt trusz with g research your line is open matthew trusz g research analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer good morning matthew trusz g research analyst so you mentioned the order strength for air gas in april can you comment on the overall industrial trends you ve seen in 2019 year to date specifically did you see a weak january and stronger march like several of your peers and are you seeing more broadly the march trend hold in april and has there been any change in level of customer caution or confidence matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes so in terms of the industrial question as it relates to the air gas handling we re seeing continue to see healthy demand there and some of that s market driven and some of it is based on some things regulatory driven things from the chinese government that are generating demand as well i think the second part of the question sounds like it was aimed more at welding and i d say we did see a little slower start to the year in january but then the quarter rounded out as we ve shared here in the mid single digits range and our plan for the balance of the year is to stay in that mid single digit range and the way that we ve started the second quarter would i would say that we re on track for that matthew trusz g research analyst thank you and a follow up on that to the extent that you have visibility of the fab tech end markets are you seeing long cycle performance quite strong there similar to at air gas and would that mean to what extent are you seeing short cycle general industrial more weak thanks matthew l trerotola president and chief executive officer yes sure i think certainly some of the things that are fueling the demand in fab tech are long cycle and the infrastructure are the things that are the healthier parts of the demand and there is no question that some of the pieces like automotive that we participate in a little less are tailing off but overall there is still a positive growth in inaudible there matthew trusz g research analyst thanks matt operator thank you and i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to kevin johnson for closing remarks kevin johnson vice

pr newswire vancouver may 7 2019 vancouver may 7 2019 prnewswire b2gold corp tsx bto nyse american btg nsx b2g b2gold or the company is pleased to announce its operational and financial results for the first quarter of 2019 the company previously released its gold production and gold revenue for the first quarter of 2019 see news release dated 04 17 19 all dollar figures are in united states dollars unless otherwise indicated 2019 first quarter highlights 2019 first quarter operational results consolidated gold production in the first quarter of 2019 was 230 859 ounces 6 12 704 ounces above budget gold production from the company s fekola masbate otjikoto and el limon mines all exceeded their targeted production the fekola mine in mali and the masbate mine in the philippines continued their very strong operational performances with both well above their budgeted production for the quarter for the first quarter of 2019 the fekola mine produced 110 349 ounces of gold well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces and the masbate mine produced 57 481 ounces of gold significantly above budget by 15 7 490 ounces compared to the prior year quarter gold production was marginally lower by 8 825 ounces consolidated cash operating costs in the quarter were 545 per ounce sold below budget by 27 per ounce 5 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly attributable to masbate s above budget gold production and significantly lower than budgeted mining costs see operations section below also contributing to the favourable budget variance were otjikoto s sales of lower cost gold ounces from its opening inventory and higher ore tonnage than budgeted from its otjikoto and wolfshag pits compared to the prior year quarter consolidated cash operating costs on a per ounce of gold sold basis were 74 per ounce higher 16 primarily due to the lower grade stockpile material processed during the first quarter of 2019 at fekola as a result of fekola s significantly higher than budgeted mill throughput as well as to lower gold sales the comparative quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 lower cost ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production consolidated aisc in the first quarter were 848 per ounce sold q1 2018 719 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 133 per ounce 14 reflecting the lower per ounce cash operating costs noted above and lower than planned capital expenditures which were 24 million lower than budget this reflects mainly timing differences as the majority of the capital underspend is expected to be incurred later in 2019 given the gold production outperformance in the first quarter of 2019 b2gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production for full year 2019 forecast to be in the range of between 935 000 and 975 000 ounces for the first half of 2019 consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 436 000 and 456 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 499 000 and 519 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 consolidated cash costs are projected to remain low in 2019 with cash operating costs forecast to be between 520 and 560 per ounce sold and aisc forecast to be between 835 and 875 per ounce sold as previously released consolidated gold production for full year 2019 is expected to be weighted towards the second half of 2019 due to the planned development of open pits in the first half of the year and subsequent ore production from those pits in the second half 2019 first quarter financial results consolidated gold revenue in the first quarter of 2019 was 302 million on sales of 232 076 ounces at an average price of 1 300 per ounce compared to 344 million on sales of 259 837 ounces at an average price of 1 325 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 gold sales of 232 076 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 were 6 13 564 ounces above budget compared to the prior year quarter the decrease in revenue related mainly to the timing of gold shipments as the prior year quarter benefitted from additional sales of 20 153 ounces generated from the net drawdown of opening january 1 2018 gold inventories built up in late 2017 in part as a result of fekola ramping up to full steady state production cash flow provided by operating activities was 86 million 0 09 per share in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 147 million 0 15 per share in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease mainly reflects lower gold revenue as the comparative quarter benefitted from the sale of its opening gold inventories for full year 2019 if a gold price assumption of 1 300 per ounce is used the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of approximately 400 million for the year for the first quarter of 2019 the company generated net income of 27 million 0 02 per share compared to net income of 57 million 0 06 per share in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted net income see non ifrs measures for the first quarter of 2019 was 38

march 31 2019 the company had drawn 400 million under the 500 million rcf leaving an undrawn and available balance under the existing facility of 100 million in may 2019 the company received commitments from its existing syndicate of banks plus one new lender to upsize its rcf capacity from 500 million to 600 million and to increase the accordion feature from 100 million to 200 million in addition as a reflection of b2gold s financial strength the upsized rcf is expected to include increased flexibility for permitted borrowings and equipment financings coupled with less onerous financial covenants and lower pricing the upsized rcf is expected to close by mid may 2019 and will be for a term of four years to mid 2023 final closing of the facility and the availability of funds under it remains subject to completion of customary closing conditions the upsized rcf coupled with strong operating cash flows from the company s existing mine operations is expected to provide the company with continued financial flexibility to advance existing assets and pursue exploration opportunities the company s current strategy is to continue to reduce debt expand the fekola mine

875 fekola gold mine mali the fekola mine in mali had a very strong start to the year with first quarter gold production of 110 349 ounces well above budget by 6 6 724 ounces as the processing facilities continued to outperform throughout the quarter the operation continued to demonstrate sustained high processing throughput without reduced recoveries for the first quarter of 2019 mill throughput was 1 73 million tonnes exceeding budget by 25 and the prior year quarter by 31 overall mill throughput increased during the quarter from past quarters due to a combination of factors metallurgy was favourable and excellent recoveries were achieved with a grind coarser than planned approximately 12 of the feed came from weathered saprolite ore which requires little grinding low grade ore feed during the quarter coming mostly from upper elevations in the pit appears to have been softer than anticipated and overall feed size to the plant was finer than budgeted in addition fine tuning of the plant circuit by the operators also played a role in the positive plant performance given the plant s ability to process significantly higher than budgeted throughput during this period the company took the decision to add lower grade material from the stockpiles to the plant feed this resulted in higher gold production at a lower average grade and as expected in marginally higher per ounce cash operating costs for the quarter the average grade processed was 2 11 grams per tonne g t compared to budget of 2 48 g t gold grades from the mine continue to reconcile closely to the block model gold recoveries in the quarter averaged 94 1 compared to budget of 94 0 and 94 8 in the first quarter of 2018 fekola s first quarter cash operating costs were 397 per ounce sold marginally above budget by 28 per ounce or 8 and higher than the prior year quarter of 270 per ounce sold by 127 per ounce or 47 the increase over budget and the comparative quarter was mainly due to the lower grade stockpile material being processed during the quarter as discussed above fekola s aisc for the first quarter were 614 per ounce sold q1 2018 474 per ounce sold slightly below budget by 31 per ounce capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 21 million mainly consisting of 7 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds 5 million for pre stripping and 5 million for fadougou village relocation costs for full year 2019 the fekola mine is expected to produce between 420 000 and 430 000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between 370 and 410 per ounce sold and aisc of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as new high grade ore production from phase 4 of the fekola pit is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2019 for the first half of 2019 the fekola mine is forecast to produce between 205 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold before increasing to between 215 000 and 220 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 on march 26 2019 the company announced very positive results from the expansion study pea for the fekola mine as a result the company is proceeding with an expansion project to increase processing throughput by 1 5 mtpa to 7 5 mtpa from the current base rate of 6 mtpa the pea took into account the significant increase in the fekola mineral resource announced on october 25 2018 based on the pea once this expansion is complete the fekola mine is expected to produce more gold over a longer life with more robust economics and higher average annual gold production revenues and cash flows than the previous life of mine lom project economic highlights from the pea include estimated optimized lom extended into 2030 including significant estimated increases in average annual gold production to over 550 000 ounces per year during the five year period 2020 2024 and over 400 000 ounces per year over the lom 2019 2030 projected gold production of approximately 5 000 000 ounces over the new mine life of 12 years of mining and processing including 2019 an increase in project pre tax net present value of approximately 500 million versus the comparable amounts in the company s latest aif mineral reserve lom model filed on sedar on march 20 2019 assuming an effective date of january 1 2019 a gold price of 1 300 per ounce and a discount rate of 5 and forecast lom pre tax net present value of over 2 2 billion the processing upgrade will focus on increased ball mill power with upgrades to other components including a new cyclone classification system pebble crushers and additional leach capacity to support the higher throughput and increase operability the capital costs of this mill expansion are estimated to be less than 50 million with spending evenly split between 2019 and 2020 critical path items include ball mill motors and the lime slaker both of which are expected to be commissioned in the third quarter of 2020 with public release of the pea results b2gold has filed a material change report and will issue an updated fekola expansion technical report pursuant to the requirements of ni 43 101 by may 10 2019 mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the expansion study pea is preliminary in nature and includes indicated and inferred mineral resources inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves consequently there is no certainty that the expansion study pea will be realized fekola exploration for 2019 exploration on the licenses in mali is budgeted to total 18 million the company continues its drilling program to convert fekola s inferred resources to indicated and plans to further drill the potential to the north of fekola which remains open the new cardinal target located west of the fekola pit and the anaconda zones masbate gold mine the philippines the masbate mine in the philippines continued its very strong operational performance into the first quarter of 2019 producing 57 481 ounces of gold 15 7 490 ounces above budget and 8 4 334 ounces higher compared to the prior year quarter gold production was significantly above budget due to both higher than expected head grade and recovery as ore grade oxide ore tonnage and total ore tonnage mined from the main vein pit were all better than modelled masbate s gold production for the quarter resulted from processing 1 83 million tonnes compared to budget of 1 85 million tonnes and 1 79 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2018 at an average grade of 1 32 g t compared to budget of 1 20 g t and 1 17 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 73 8 compared to budget of 69 7 and 78 5 in the first quarter of 2018 oxide ore represented 31 of the processed tonnage for the quarter versus budget of 8 and 78 in the first quarter of 2018 as planned compared to the first quarter of 2018 gold grades increased while recoveries decreased as higher grade transition fresh ore was mainly mined from the main vein pit in the first quarter of 2019 whereas the prior year quarter included lower grade oxide ore mined from the colorado pit masbate s first quarter cash operating costs were 546 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 123 per ounce 18 and comparable with the prior year quarter the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was driven by the above budget gold production and masbate s mining costs which were well below budget for the quarter by 24 cost savings were mainly in the areas of drilling blasting mining locations included backfill areas which did not require blasting and blast pattern spacing was increased resulting in savings for drill meters and blast agents loading hauling mainly due to lower fuel and maintenance costs and fewer total tonnes of waste moved which was a result of fleet activity focused in main vein area resulting in a lower than budgeted strip ratio masbate s aisc for the quarter were 743 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 222 per ounce 23 mainly due to the lower than budgeted mining costs and comparable with the prior year quarter capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2019 totaled 8 million which mainly consisted of masbate processing plant upgrades of 4 million mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds of 1 million pre stripping costs of 1 million and tailings storage facility costs of 1 million the masbate expansion project for the upgrade of the processing plant to 8 0 mtpa was completed in early 2019 with the expansion now fully commissioned and online masbate s annual gold production is projected to average approximately 200 000 ounces per year during the mining phase and above 100 000 ounces per year when the low grade stockpiles are processed in the subsequent period after open pit mining activities have ceased for full year 2019 the masbate mine is expected to produce between 200 000 and 210 000 ounces of gold primarily from the main vein pit at cash operating costs of between 625 and 665 per ounce sold and aisc of between 860 and 900 per ounce sold otjikoto gold mine namibia the otjikoto mine in namibia also had a solid first quarter producing 32 712 ounces of gold q1 2018 39 499 ounces 4 1 275 ounces above budget this was attributable to above budget mining tonnage from the otjikoto pit and higher than budgeted processed grade as previously released otjikoto s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 during the first quarter of 2019 the otjikoto mine processed 0 8 million tonnes comparable to budget and the prior year quarter at an average grade of 1 29 g t compared to budget of 1 19 g t and 1 51 g t in the first quarter of 2018 and average gold recoveries of 98 6 compared to budget of 98 0 and 98 7 in the first quarter of 2018 for first quarter 2019 otjikoto s cash operating costs were 519 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 136 per ounce 21 and 30 per ounce below the first quarter of 2018 the favourable budget variance on a per ounce of gold sold basis was mainly due to lower cost gold ounces sold from opening inventory and from higher than budgeted ore stockpile additions in the first quarter of 2019 more ore tonnes were stockpiled than budgeted as a result of higher ore tonnage than budgeted from phase 2 of the otjikoto pit and phase 2 of the wolfshag pit these positive ore tonnage reconciliations decreased the strip ratio and increased stockpiled tonnage for the first quarter of 2019 on a total cost basis otjikoto s mining processing and site general costs were approximately as budgeted for the quarter otjikoto s aisc for the quarter were 829 per ounce sold q1 2018 723 per ounce sold significantly below budget by 293 per ounce 26 mainly due to higher than budgeted sales also sustaining capital expenditures were 4 million below budget mainly relating to lower capitalized stripping which is expected to be an overall capital expenditure saving for the year capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 totaled 7 million consisting of 4 million for pre stripping and 3 million for new mobile equipment and mobile equipment rebuilds for full year 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 165 000 and 175 000 ounces of gold primarily from the otjikoto pit at cash operating costs of between 520 and 560 per ounce and aisc of between 905 and 945 per ounce for the first half of 2019 the otjikoto mine is forecast to produce between 66 000 and 71 000 ounces of gold before significantly increasing to between 99 000 and 104 000 ounces in the second half of 2019 as a higher grade zone of the otjikoto pit is forecast to be processed in the third quarter of 2019 and high grade ore production from phase 2 of the wolfshag pit is scheduled to begin in late 2019 el limon gold mine nicaragua el limon mine in nicaragua produced 12 231 ounces of gold q1 2018 13 529 ounces in the first quarter of 2019 slightly above budget during

2019 14 2 899 ounces below budget gold production at la libertad was affected by lower than planned grade from the san diego pit which was partly offset by higher than planned ore tonnage and grade from the san juan pit as previously released la libertad s full year 2019 gold production is scheduled to be weighted towards the second half of the year as la libertad s production forecast assumes that production will start from the new jabali antenna pit in the second half of 2019 dependent upon the successful completion of resettlement activities and receipt of the jabali antenna open pit permit during the quarter the company concluded an agreement for jabali antenna with the small miners in the area and successfully conducted the public consultation that is required for issuance of a mine permit with the permitting issues related to the site largely resolved the company anticipates receiving the permit in time to start production from the pit in the second half of 2019 as budgeted la libertad s cash operating costs in the quarter were 1 295 per ounce sold q1 2018 1 040 per ounce sold 249 per ounce 24 above budget and were impacted by the lower than budgeted production discussed above la libertad s aisc were 1 647 per ounce sold 145 per ounce 8 below budget as previously released la libertad s aisc per ounce are forecast to decrease in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of the year the lower than budgeted aisc resulted from lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures arising from timing delays in developing the jabali antenna open pit and underground mines 6 million and the construction of the tailings storage facility 4 million partially offset by higher cash operating costs as described above and lower gold ounces sold compared to

gaap this press release includes information regarding certain non gaap financial measures management uses ebitda adjusted ebitda segment adjusted ebitda and commercial margin collectively the non gaap measures as performance metrics and believes these measures provide additional information commonly used by the holders of the 2023 junior priority notes and parties to our term loan facility and the abl facility with respect to the ongoing performance of our underlying business activities as well as our ability to meet our future debt service capital expenditures and working capital needs in addition ebitda with certain adjustments is a component of certain covenants under the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes adjusted ebitda including the impact of metal price lag is a component of certain financial covenants under the credit agreement governing the abl facility management also uses commercial margin as a performance metric and believes that it provides useful information regarding the performance of our segments because it measures the price at which we sell our aluminum products above the hedged cost of the metal and the effects of metal price lag thereby reflecting the value added components of our commercial activities independent of aluminum prices which we cannot control our ebitda calculations represent net income and loss before interest income and expense provision for and benefit from income taxes and depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda excluding metal price lag unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments restructuring charges currency exchange gains and losses on debt stock based compensation expense start up costs loss on extinguishment of debt and certain other gains and losses segment adjusted ebitda represents adjusted ebitda on a per segment basis ebitda as defined in the credit agreement governing the term loan facility and the indenture governing the 2023 junior priority notes also limits the amount of adjustments for cost savings operational improvement and synergies for the purpose of determining our compliance with such covenants adjusted ebitda as defined under the abl facility also limits the amount of adjustments for restructuring charges and requires additional adjustments be made if certain annual pension funding levels are exceeded commercial margin represents revenues less the hedged cost of metal and the effects of metal price lag the non gaap measures as we use them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies we calculate the non gaap financial measures by eliminating the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of

the world bank wb on 8 april 2019 reported that migrants remittances to low and middle income countries reached a record high in 2018 according to the wb study officially recorded annual remittance flows to those countries reached 529 billion dollars last year an increase of 9 6 percent over the previous record high of 483 billion dollars in 2017 significantly these migrants most hardly won savings do also benefit rich countries in fact the wb reports that global remittances which include flows to high income countries reached 689 billion dollars in 2018 up from 633 billion dollars in 2017 remittances on track to become the largest source of external financing in developing countries wrote on this dilip ratha lead economist at the world bank in a breakdown of this data the wb informs that regionally growth in remittance inflows ranged from almost 7 percent in east asia and the pacific to 12 percent in south asia the oil factor and that the overall increase was driven by a stronger economy and employment situation in the united states and a rebound in outward flows from some gulf cooperation council countries united arab emirates bahrain saudi arabia oman qatar and kuwait as well as the russian federation excluding china remittances to low and middle income countries 462 billion dollars were significantly larger than foreign direct investment flows in 2018 344 billion dollars foreign direct investment flows record the value of cross border transactions related to direct investment during a given period of time according to the organisation for economic co operation and development the top remittance recipients were india with 79 billion dollars followed by china 67 billions mexico 36 billions the philippines 34 billions and egypt 29 billions the world financial institution also estimates that in 2019 remittance flows to low and middle income countries are expected to reach 550 billion dollars to become their largest source of external financing lost in commissions the 529 billion dollars that migrant workers have transferred to their countries of origin in 2018 came obviously at a high costs both economic and human on the one hand the global average cost of sending 200 dollars remained high at around 7 percent in the first quarter of 2019 according to the wb s remittance prices worldwide database this means that each migrant is forced to sacrifice in the concept of money transfer commissions 7 of 100 dollars that she or he managed to save at the cost of renouncing to many basic human needs meantime remittance costs across many african corridors and small islands in the pacific remain above 10 percent this means that african migrants are compelled to pay as much as 1 in 10 dollars of their savings in the concept of money transfer fees to private banking and financial business on this the wb says that banks were the most expensive remittance channels charging an average fee of 11 percent in the first quarter of 2019 while post offices were the next most expensive at over 7 percent on ways to lower remittance costs dilip ratha lead author of the study says that remittances are on track to become the largest source of external financing in developing countries the high costs of money transfers reduce the benefits of migration the immense human cost for his part michal rutkowski senior director of the social protection and jobs global practice at the world bank says that millions of low skilled migrant workers are vulnerable to recruitment malpractices including exorbitant recruitment costs iom the un migration agency released a new report on migrant deaths and disappearances worldwide through its berlin based global migration data analysis centre since 2014 more than 23 000 migrant deaths and disappearances have been recorded globally by the iom the real number is likely to be much higher as many deaths are never recorded how many migrants are there a new study launched on 5 december 2018 by the international labour organization ilo reveals that the number of migrant workers has jumped by millions leaving some countries without the most productive part of their workforce according to the second edition of ilo s global estimates on international migrant workers approximately 164 million people left home in search of work between 2013 and 2017 a nine percent increase since 2013 when that number stood at 150 millions breaking down the figures 96 milliona are men a rise of two percent while 68 milliona are women a fall of 2 percent compared to 2013 of the 164 million migrant workers worldwide approximately 111 2 millions or 67 9 percent live in high income countries 30 5 millions or 18 6 percent in upper middle income countries 16 6 millions or 10 1 percent in lower middle income countries 5 6 millions or 3 4 percent in low income countries and where do they live a sample group of nearly two thirds of migrant workers shows that 23 percent are in north america 23 9 percent in northern southern and western europe and 13 9 percent in arab countries other regions that host more than five percent of migrant workers include eastern europe sub saharan africa south eastern asia and the pacific and central and western asia in contrast north africa hosts less than one per cent why do migrants migrate having said that a harsh question arises why all these millions and millions of human beings have been forced to abandon their homes and families to fall prey to smugglers deadly voyages separation of their children detention torture forced repatriation etcetera let alone being victims of human traffickers who buy and sell them as just human flesh merchandise to feed the business of prostitution child recruitment as soldiers slave labourers and even for trading their organs three chief reasons lay behind most of the migrants need to flee impoverishment most migrants and refugees proceed from former european colonies in africa asia and latin america and the caribbean from countries which had been practically enslaved under european military occupation and which since their formal independence have been easy prey to intensive exploitation by big private business one of the dramatic consequences of that occupation and the ongoing exploitation is the deepening impoverishment of native populations a fact that has been aggravated by the dominant neo liberalism led globalisation most migrants and refugees proceed from former european colonies in africa asia and latin america and the caribbean from countries which had been practically enslaved under european military occupation and which since their formal independence have been easy prey to intensive exploitation by big private business one of the dramatic consequences of that occupation and the ongoing exploitation is the deepening impoverishment of native populations a fact that has been aggravated by the dominant neo liberalism led globalisation conflicts most of the around 40 ongoing armed conflicts are due to either the fictitious splitting of nations and compact ethnic communities through aribitrarian borders imposed by former european colonisers or more recently directly or indirectly fuelled by the voracious exploitation of natural resources by huge translational private business most of the around 40 ongoing armed conflicts are due to either the fictitious splitting of nations and compact ethnic communities through aribitrarian borders imposed by former european colonisers or more recently directly or indirectly fuelled by the voracious exploitation of natural resources by huge translational private business climate change the growing wave of unusual droughts floods loss of harvests of homes and lives which is caused by climate change which an immense number of the migrants countries of origin did no generate just know that a whole continent like africa which is home to around 1 2 billion human beings has contributed just 4 per cent to greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of more than 80 percent of its dramatic consequences these three main reasons laying behind the forced migration of so many millions of human beings should suffice to explain why the number of people fleeing exploitation wars and climate change driven disasters need to search for other places where to feel safer or simply just survive while working hard to help their families also survive one billion climate migrants refugees imagine a world with as many as one billion people facing harsh climate change impacts resulting in devastating droughts and or floods extreme weather destruction of natural resources in particular lands soils and water and the consequence of severe livelihoods conditions famine and starvation although not yet based on definite scientific projections the proven speed with which the process of climate change has been taking place might lead to such a scenario by 2050 if so 1 in 9 human beings would be on the move by then currently forecasts vary from 25 million to 1 billion environmental migrants by 2050 moving either within their countries or across borders on a permanent or temporary basis with 200 million being the most widely cited estimate according to a 2015 study carried out by the institute for environment and human security of the united nations university other specialised sources estimate that every second one person is displaced by disaster on this the oslo based norwegian refugee council nrc reports that in 2015 only more than 19 2 million people fled disasters in 113 countries disasters displace three to ten times more people than conflict and war worldwide exploitation slavery among the numerous human costs of those remittances there is the fact that millions more migrant workers mean their countries of origin lose most productive part of workforce the international labour organization ilo underscored that domestic workers are one of the groups most vulnerable to exploitation violence harassment and forced labour saying that many women end up being trapped in abusive work situations which in some cases may amount to modern forms of slavery sixty seven million domestic workers who care for our homes and loved ones frequently suffer violence harassment exploitation and coercion ranging from verbal abuse to sexual violence and sometimes even death those who live in home are especially vulnerable at the root of this situation is discrimination explains philippe marcadent chief of the ilo branch related to inclusive labour markets labour relations and working conditions domestic workers are often not recognised as workers and face discrimination as women often from poor and marginalised groups such as migrants and indigenous peoples for many daily abuses like lack of rest and non payment of wages can quickly turn into forced labour forced labour can be imposed to adults and children by state authorities by private enterprises or by individuals it is observed in all types of economic activity such as domestic work construction agriculture manufacturing sexual exploitation forced begging etc and in every country traditional practices of forced labour such as vestiges of slavery or slave like practices and various forms of debt bondage as well as new forms of forced labour that have emerged in recent decades such as human trafficking facts and figures an estimated 40 3 million people are in modern slavery including 24 9 in forced labour and 15 4 millions in forced marriage there are 5 4 victims of modern slavery for every 1 000 people in the world 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children out of the 24 9 million people trapped in forced labour 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work construction or agriculture 4 8 million people in forced sexual exploitation and 4 million people in forced labour imposed by state authorities women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labour accounting for 99 percent of victims in the commercial sex industry and 58 percent in other sectors for its part the global report on trafficking in persons released on 29 january 2019 by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc at un headquarters in new york shows a record high number of cases detected during 2016 but also the largest recorded conviction rate of traffickers anyway women and girls remain a major target according to unodc traffickers the world over continue to target women and girls wrote executive director yury fedotov in the report s preface the vast majority of detected victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and 35 per cent of those trafficked for forced labour are female the report notes considerable regional differences in the sex and age profiles of detected trafficking victims in west africa most of the detected victims are children both boys and girls while in south asia victims are equally reported to be men women and children in central asia a larger share of adult men is detected compared to other regions while in central america and the caribbean more girls are recorded sexual exploitation top form of trafficking most of the victims detected globally are trafficked for sexual exploitation especially in the americas europe and east asia and the pacific in sub saharan africa and the middle east trafficking for forced labour is the most commonly detected form in central asia and south asia trafficking for forced labour and sexual exploitation are equally prevalent other forms of human trafficking include girls forced into marriage more commonly detected in south east asia children for illegal adoption more common in central and south american countries forced criminality mainly reported in western and southern europe and organ removal primarily detected in north africa and central and eastern europe victims can be in restaurants fisheries brothels farms homes and even organ trafficking and illegal adoption said rani hong who survived child trafficking herself as she was taken from her family in india at age 7 submitted to intimidation physical abuse and slavery until she was sold for illegal adoption in canada and later the united states begging porno forced marriage many other forms such as trafficking for exploitation in begging or for the production of pornographic material are reported in different parts of the world the report also shows that armed conflicts can increase vulnerability to trafficking in different ways as areas with weak rule of law and lack of resources to respond to crime provide traffickers with a fertile terrain to carry out their operations preying on those who are desperately in need armed groups and other criminals may take the opportunity to traffic victims including children for sexual exploitation sexual slavery forced marriage armed combat and various forms of forced labour this is the case for example in sub saharan africa north africa and the middle east south east asia and elsewhere in some refugee camps in the middle east also it has been documented that girls and young women have been married off without their consent and subjected to sexual exploitation in neighbouring countries in addition recruitment of children for use as armed combatants is widely documented unodc s report notes that within conflict zones armed groups can use trafficking as a strategy to assert territorial dominance spread fear among civilians in the territories where they operate to keep the local population under control sex slaves they may also use women and girls as sex slaves or force them into marriages to appeal to new potential male recruits the study shows that in all the conflicts examined for the report forcibly displaced populations refugees and internally displaced families have been specifically targeted from settlements of syrian and iraqi refugees to afghans and rohingya fleeing conflict and persecution notably the risk faced by migrants and refugees travelling through conflict areas such as libya or parts of sub saharan africa is also well documented in libya for example militias control some detention centres for migrants and refugees and are coercing detained migrants and asylum seekers for different exploitative purposes while we are far from ending impunity we have made headway in the 15 years since the protocol against trafficking in persons entered into force said unodc s chief as he noted that nearly every country now has legislation in place criminalising human trafficking abused maimed killed children are being smuggled sexually abused maimed killed for their vital organs recruited as soldiers or otherwise enslaved not only 69 million children under five will die from mostly preventable causes 167 million will live in poverty and 263 million are out of school and 750 million women will have been married as children by 2030 according to the international labour organization forced labour alone one component of human trafficking generates an estimated 150 billion dollars in profits per annum as of 2014 all the above is just one part of the 529 billion dollars that migrant workers had to save in one year to rescue their families from imposed impoverishment war and climate catastrophes that they did anything but cause

india s general elections kicked off on april 11 and run until may 19 with the ruling bharatiya janata party facing off against the main opposition force the indian national congress one of the main issues opposing the two are charges of crony capitalism against prime minister narendra modi as epitomised by the ongoing rafale scam modi has been accused of favouritism toward his friend and political ally anil ambani a multi millionaire at the head of reliance a 1 7 billion dollar firm in 2015 ambani formed reliance defence limited which bypassed the mandated procedures to obtain a deal with french defence company dassault for the sale of 36 rafale fighters for 8 billion euros ambani s company won the contract over the government owned hal and the deal reportedly pushed up the price of the aircraft by more than 40 yet ambani s firm was not a defence specialist billionaires in politics such examples of intertwined relationships between government and business figures in india are so frequent that a book by financial times journalist james crabtree the billionaire raj a journey through india s new gilded age has become a bestseller in 2002 the latest year for which figures are available 30 of the 245 members of the upper house the rajya sabha were from business this involvement of business directly in politics is common in france 21 senators are listed as being heads of enterprises in the united states two notable if very different examples are the current president donald trump and the former mayor of new york 2001 2013 michael bloomberg as pointed out by paul a baran of stanford and paul m sweezy of harvard it is rare for politicians to be open with voters about their business dealings does business mean development most such politicians describe their approach as business friendly or connections as progress which in hindi is translated as vikas the word has been at the heart of narendra modi s campaign since 2014 yet the country faces serious economic and development issues the table below is based on selected indicators from world bank and other sources and is important for understanding the background to the statistics being bandied for example when inflation was running at above 10 during 2009 2012 it was a serious election issue but today it is not because inflation is down to 5 world bank author provided data indicate that in india poverty levels have fallen from 40 to 20 but with a population of 1 4 billion people the 20 figure means that 280 million of the country s population is living in poverty the combined total population of the biggest four or five european countries certainly india s gross national income per capita has quadrupled but has only tripled in purchasing power parity terms this means that the currency is devalued against the us dollar and the real progress is significantly less gdp growth rates have been as high as 10 in a few years and given that the poverty ratio is reduced part of this seems to have trickled down as can be seen from the world bank data for example almost all indian villages have now been electrified even though this may mean that only a small number of people actually have electricity an unequal access to progress this unequal access to progress is disturbing as indicated by india s gini coefficient a measure of inequality a gini coefficient of 0 shows perfect equality while 1 indicates maximal inequality a recent oecd working paper shows that income inequality is higher in emerging economies including india where it is almost 0 5 than those in developed countries the gini coefficient is usually looked at in terms of income or wealth income is a flow concept of what one earns over a year while wealth is a stock concept of the assets one owns at a point in time the gini coefficient of wealth inequalities are much higher than gini coefficients of income inequalities even in the oecd for example the wealth gini of france would be 0 70 and that of the united states and most scandinavian countries would be over 0 80 however for emerging countries the data required to calculate these is not available and other proxies must be used for example credit suisse reports that wealth inequality in india is second only to russia the top 1 and the top 10 control more than 50 and 70 respectively of the country s wealth decline of the industrial world one of the reasons for such disparities is the tendency of capitalism to limit wages and increase profits this is enhanced by mergers and acquisitions that increase monopoly power this in turn leads to the rise of the happy few who concentrate and aggregate wealth stock options and companies however there is a limit to what these few people can consume as a result aggregate demand falls limiting growth and pushing into poverty greater numbers of those who need to consume but do not have the purchasing power they in term search the cheapest solution which is often to purchase chinese made goods in china growth is fuelled by global demand economies of scale and high productivity of its workers in india however the share of industry seems to be rapidly declining unable to compete with imports some observers such as dani rodrik amrit amirapu and arvind subramanian consider that it is unlikely that industrialisation will return to india and that the country still relies heavily on its software services dibyangshu sarkar afp the table above shows that the value added by agriculture and industry has reduced to 16 and 27 of gdp respectively however these sectors still employ a lot of people 43 and 24 respectively during the elections the votes of farmers and industry workers remained important and politicians have to appeal to the two sectors as much as to services whose share has grown to 33 of the occupational structure the working class in india are no longer the traditional voters of the waning communist parties which now rule only in the southern most kerala state the other major state is west bengal where the working class brought them to power two decades ago but have now changed their support to the regional party trinamool congress headed by mamata banerjee this partly explains why the farmers remain the core of support for several political parties for example the congress party has promised a farm loan waiver during the ongoing elections it has also pushed its nyuntam aay yojanan nyay scheme which would assure minimum income to all farmers day to day development left out many in india feel that the basic infrastructure has improved the digital divide remains a major problem for those who do not have electricity to charge phones or get internet primary education has taken a great leap forward but secondary education has still a long way to go nevertheless the secondary enrolment rate has increased by over 60 in the 15 year period reported from 45 to 74 the life expectancy has increased very little 68 years in india compared to 80 in developed countries indicating that public and private investments in health have not kept up at the same time pollution has doubled since 2000 as indicated by the co 2 emissions according to a recent statement by greenpeace 22 of the world s most polluted cities are in india money sharma afp unemployed youth a demographic time bomb unemployment today in india is only 6 7 considerably below that of france and many developed countries but 80 of the jobs are vulnerable or within the informal sector this represents a demographic time bomb as most of those who fall victim to unemployment are men and women between 15 and 24 years as indicated in the table their unemployment rate in 2015 was 10 4 almost three times the overall figure of 3 5 the impact of youth unemployment is particularly severe as recent studies have demonstrated that it can create or increase substance abuse issues and mental problems but with india s gdp growing at 8 per year the impact on politics has been considerable many indian voters seem willing for the moment to overlook the everyday struggles they may face hoping that the trickle down effect of a business friendly government will help the overall economy

it s getting tiresome watching donald trump s bipolar presidency it seems he can t let a day go by without making some massive announcement to raise tariffs threaten sanctions or overthrow a government every 24 hours is another exercise in chasing the trump reality show around every lull in the perpetual news cycle has to be seized upon to create more chaos so he can validate his insanity trump has so many plates spinning there s no way he s actually thinking anything through take the latest fiasco chinese trade talks one day talks are going well the next we re raising tariffs to 25 that s where we are today because trump thinks he s winning the trade war and china won t give him what he wants so he ll disrupt global trade until he does the free society laurence m vance best price 13 55 buy new 17 54 as of 04 55 utc details it doesn t matter how many times he s told tariffs don t work the costs are not paid by the exporter they are paid by the consumer tariffs don t shift manufacturing of the goods imported onshore they are supplied by other countries or substituted for lesser goods the consumer pays higher prices for end user goods the domestic members of the supply chain pay higher input prices while sclerotic domestic producers are subsidized to stay non competitive warfare is welfare the problems with threatening these tariffs are myriad but the main ones are trump is an economic ignoramus who only likes to look at one side of the trade ledger his advisors are all paranoid neoconservatives who can only see the world in terms of power because these advisors are who they are they all push trump to his worst decisions by feeding him exactly what he wants to hear it doesn t matter if it s intelligence about the potential for a venezuelan coup or the efficacy of sanctioning everyone who buys a drop of iranian oil trump likes punishing people he thinks have wronged him the national security council played a key role in driving the argument to end the waiver program especially richard goldberg a new member of the trump administration and a longtime advocate for confronting iran according to the two sources he was instrumental one of the sources said national security adviser john bolton added goldberg to the nsc in january previously goldberg was an adviser at the foundation for defense of democracies fdd think tank headed by mark dubowitz a leading advocate for tougher handling of iran since the united states first round of sanctions against the country under former president barack obama in 2012 goldberg was an aide to then senator mark kirk a republican and delivered a blow to tehran by writing legislation that closed iran s last legal loophole in selling oil under the obama sanctions that legislation targeted the belgium based swift financial messaging system over which iran was conducting billions of dollars in oil trade bolton was in charge of the failed venezuela operation and is the architect of both the iran sanctions plan as well as scuttling peace talks with north korea do you really think he s not involved in telling trump to up the pressure on china by giving them an ultimatum to deal or see tariffs raised to 25 this the same day that bolton announces moving an aircraft carrier group to the persian gulf as a message to iran never forget that all of this can be avoided by trump having one shred of courage to stop this welfare for the merchants of death dollars locked and loaded that the impetus to weaponize the u s dollar through trade and hybrid warfare comes from this corner of trump s administration is not news neither is trump s impulsiveness cravenness and inability to think systemically what is news however is that trump thinks he has the leverage here because the s p 500 is flirting with a new all time high as i said above trump is an economic ignoramus he refuses to see the opposite side of the trade ledger we export trillions in debt which fuels our trade deficit with china and receive goods in return those funds created out of thin air aren t used for domestic investment they simply goose gdp gross national spending as that money flows through the economy tariffs won t solve this trump lowered corporate tax rates to 20 a good thing certainly and is trying to cut through regulatory red tape also a good thing but it isn t enough if he doesn t cut government spending at the same time what s never admitted by mainstream economists is that gdp can fall and economic value created by the economy can rise boosting gdp with fake spending fueled by new debt at artificially low rates isn t wealth creation in fact it is ultimately capital destructive it is malinvestment that shows up everywhere as ghost cities empty malls crumbling infrastructure and cultural malaise which leads to political degradation this is why trump is a coward he doesn t have the courage to confront this he just blames everyone else for not paying their fair share he s focused the anger and frustration of americans impoverished by these policies on everyone else there is no issue that gets people more angry with me among trump supporters ripping him on tariffs it s insane how deeply this idea is embedded it s economic warfare in which the bombs go up and come straight back down a courageous president however would level with the american people and say we ve spent beyond our means we in washington with our insane policies have destroyed your communities government can t solve these problems only you can we ve cut taxes and and now we re cutting spending and i will veto any budget that doesn t do so the best way to improve the american economy is to get real and put the money back into your hands government doesn t produce wealth at best it shuffles it around you produce wealth it will be tough but i have faith in you the american people stephen miller will never write that speech that s the fight he won t have instead he does what every other crackpot politician has ever done guns and butter and then sells that as a trade war with china no one is ever to blame for their economic messes blame the other guy blame the corporations blame everyone except the people who actually did it and compound the problem by taking it out on the rest of the world trump s market problem he thinks the stock market is the weather vane of his presidency and that when it s rising he can make outrageous demands and when it s falling he has to tack against it it s why everything is so bipolar and we re being pushed every day in a different direction a quick look at the dow jones industrials on a weekly basis since trump embarked on his trade and tariff war should give you an idea of how much volatility has increased in case the picture itself is unclear the numbers are since hitting a peak in january 2017 volatility as measured by the difference in closing prices week to week and the range of each week has more than doubled for move of the second half of 2018 we saw got used to three sigma or grater movements in the dow this is the real effect of political and policy uncertainty and if trump s goal is a rising stock market someone should show him this chart 2017 is what you want don not 2018 because for all intents and purposes it hasn t gone anywhere in over a year not that i think trump is the only reason for this volatility but his pressure on dollar liquidity and his consistent scaring capital markets with shutting down trade isn t helping anything the fed is helping this along no doubt he helped break the eurodollar system last year with his overnight tariffs on aluminum and his pullout from the jcpoa the u s share market is rising precisely because he has embarked on a mad policy of weaponizing the dollar he thinks there is no possible way anyone can get out of using the dollar and therefore this won t hurt him or the u s in the long run in the short run he s right dollar liquidity is causing massive capital flight into u s assets but it isn t coming here necessarily as long term investment tariffs have consequences the problem is he forgets that he s the one subject to an election while china s leadership is not everything china has done politically under xi jinping has been to safeguard the chinese state in the event of a crisis back here we have one major party half of the president s party his own staff and the permanent bureaucracy actively plotting a coup against him oh and there s an election in eighteen months but his advisers keep telling him china is a paper tiger squeeze them and they will capitulate but it hasn t happened yet and it won t the foundations of mor hazlitt henry best price 7 77 buy new 15 00 as of 12 15 utc details china s not going to implode over these tariffs it will give xi and his central bank the opportunity to devalue the yuan in response to the slower flow of dollars it has to protect the lion s share of its trade with southeast asia and europe whose currencies are already in trouble and it will bail out the most strategically sensitive banks and businesses over exposed to them it s what they did last year in response to the 10 tariff and it is what will happen this time so if trump doesn t want a stronger dollar he can t look to the fed to give it to him the structure of the offshore dollar markets is not under their control as always markets are bigger than central planners if global trade is the m0 of the world then restricting it at a time of maximal dollar based debt capacity is the stupidest thing you can do if your goal is a lower dollar and trade balance with china we don t need a lower dollar we need a dollar that buys more value at home and that can t happen with the fed and treasury pumping money in while choking us with the debt behind it but don t worry folks economic warfare man has a plan for that too reprinted with permission from gold goats n guns the best of tom luongo

if you ever wanted to learn how to not handle a currency crisis you should observe the way president recep erdogan is mismanaging the turkish lira this mishandling substantially heightens the likelihood that turkey will soon default on its external debt mountain that in turn could cast a dark cloud over the rest of the emerging market economies prospects as well as over those european especially spanish banks with high turkish debt exposure mosads that turkey is in the grips of a vicious currency crisis can be in little doubt indeed after argentina the country has the dubious distinction of having the world s second worst performing currency after plunging by some 30 percent in 2018 the currency has lost a further 14 percent in value in 2019 and is showing no signs of stabilizing at the heart of the swooning turkish lira has been the loss of domestic and foreign investor confidence in the turkish government s ability and willingness to correct the large economic imbalances built up by years of overly easy monetary and fiscal policies in this regard it has hardly helped investor confidence that inflation has been allowed to rise to 20 percent or to four times the turkish central banks official inflation target nor has it helped that president erdogan has leant heavily on the central bank to refrain from raising interest rates to stem the currency s slide and to curb inflation sadly there are all too many other ways in which president erdogan seems to have gone out of his way to undermine confidence in the currency these include his having got rid of competent economic officials in favor of yes men like the minister of finance who happens to be his son in law to run the economy to make matters worse erdogan has overturned the istanbul local election and has soured turkish relations with the united states due to his close cooperation with russia on defense issues turkey s exceedingly high level of short term external debt and the fact that its corporate sector has borrowed excessively in u s dollars make its crisis that much more dangerous to its economic health it is estimated that over the next year turkey has as much 180 billion in external debt service payments to make at a time that its international reserves have already dwindled to around three months of import payment it is also estimated that its corporate sector has borrowed as much as 300 billion in u s dollar terms whose servicing burden becomes all the more onerous as the currency falls and the economy contracts it s regrettable that president erdogan is showing no sign of urgency in addressing the currency crisis and is in fact adding to political uncertainty by forcing a rerun of the istanbul local election this risks having the currency succumb to another round of its vicious cycle mossecondads a weakening currency could very well lead to corporate bankruptcies that further erode investor confidence that leads to a further currency weakness that in turn could add to further political instability which would be yet another factor contributing to currency weakness and to a draining of investor confidence one has to hope that president erdogan soon recognizes that once lost investor confidence is difficult to restore that might induce him to do something radical like call in the international monetary fund for help or fire his minister of finance to show that he has become serious about breaking the downward economic spiral if he does not do that the rest of the emerging market economies and the spanish banking system should brace themselves for economic shock waves coming from a turkish debt default desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
for the past year experts and stakeholders across the country have worked together to develop a new industrial policy that explicitly ties the goals of rebuilding america s manufacturing base to that of revitalizing economically vulnerable communities and distressed regions this endeavor has been called the high wage america project whose interlinked priorities include spurring innovation reshoring and revitalizing sustainable industries reinvesting in workers and mobilizing responsible capital these objectives represent the best thinking of leading experts and practitioners from communities in the industrial heartland and will create the first ever bottom up sustainable and inclusive regional industrial policy this handbook gives policymakers quick access to the nine best actions for bringing this groundbreaking policy vision to fruition they are 1 avert layoffs the workforce innovation and opportunity act wioa requires states to commit part of their rapid response program for economic dislocation to efforts that prevent layoffs however the fine print of those requirements gave states wide latitude and implementation has lagged this trend must be reversed states should establish the capacity to provide proactive business turnaround assistance in partnership with skilled organizations outside the workforce system this should include assistance to businesses in economic distress and helping exiting owners convert to employee ownership example pennsylvania strategic early warning network the workforce innovation and opportunity act wioa requires states to

government already requires made in america iron steel and other manufactured goods for all federally financed infrastructure and defense projects states can extend these protections to state funded infrastructure projects including permanent and temporary public buildings like schools and hospitals roads and bridges mass transit waterways and airports that are not already covered by federal buy america rules states should prioritize requiring made in america iron and steel which are the easiest components to label and identify example 2017 new york and texas buy america policies the federal

reshoring has developed some national momentum but as companies recognize the closing cost gap between offshoring and producing domestically still no systematic state or federal initiatives yet assist firms with transitioning back to producing and hiring on american soil states should fund and implement a reshoring technical assistance team that helps overcome the market failures lack of information and uncertainty that lead firms not to consider reshoring and to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of making the transition for more information see the reshoring initiative reshoring has

sector partnerships aggregate employer demand identify skill gaps and make it possible for job seekers to fill them states should stabilize and scale up public private joint investment in industry led and worker centered manufacturing sector partnerships states can appropriate general or employer funded state training resources and combine them with federal funding for specific groups of workers like the funds created by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the temporary assistance for needy families program the u s department of transportation and the supplemental nutrition assistance program s employment and training programs public funding is crucial for planning and starting up and private sector match is crucial for sustaining and scaling example pennsylvania

example pennsylvania industrial partnerships 5 nurture industrial apprenticeships states should bolster industrial apprenticeships through tax credits of 1 000 2 000 per year per apprentice as well as through state financial aid for related instruction at higher education institutions this funding should come alongside support for strong multi firm apprenticeship hub organizations that focus on reaching women and people of color examples the wisconsin regional training partnership and the afl cio industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeship states should bolster industrial apprenticeships through tax credits of 1 000 2 000 per year per apprentice as well as through state financial aid for related instruction at higher education institutions this funding should come alongside support for strong multi firm apprenticeship hub organizations that focus on reaching women and people of color examples the wisconsin regional training partnership and the afl cio industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeship 6 increase the number of minorities and women in manufacturing states should focus on leveraging the manufacturing recovery to create a more diverse workforce companies need to work with workforce providers and educational institutions with deep roots in communities of color and with state programs that provide sufficient resources for marketing wrap around services post placement mentoring skills training and work based learning one promising tool is the u s employment plan which allows localities to give vendors additional points for

innovation states should continue and increase investments in university based cooperative research and development centers that break down barriers between scientific research engineering applications and product and process commercialization to complement these efforts states should offer small innovation vouchers up to 50 000 to small manufacturers who seek to work with local universities or research centers example rhode island innovation vouchers states should continue and increase investments in university based cooperative research and development centers that break down barriers between scientific research engineering applications and product and process commercialization to complement these efforts states should offer small innovation vouchers up to 50 000 to small manufacturers who seek to work with local universities or research centers example rhode island innovation vouchers 8 invest responsibly state and city pension funds and other institutions should adopt the united nations principles of responsible investment un pri and enact investment policy measures to comply with the department of labor s guidance on economically targeted investments dol 2015 1 the un pri are voluntary standards committed to analyzing potential investments by environmental social and governance principles the dol 2015 1 guidance allows pension funds to consider social needs as long as financial returns are not compromised economically targeted pension funds should invest in promoting in state manufacturing and community development and ensuring sustainable investment in cities and communities example the office of the illinois state treasurer is a signatory to the un pri state and city pension funds and other institutions should adopt the united nations

communities example the office of the illinois state treasurer is a signatory to the un pri 9 create state manufacturing task forces governors should convene multiple stakeholders including business labor academia and workforce providers to develop a state manufacturing strategy as well as identifying key manufacturing clusters and coordinated industrial and workforce policies that would support the strategy s success example national governors association center for best practices policy academy this report is edited by andrew stettner senior fellow with sections authored by members of the high wage america advisory committee tom croft stephen herzenberg jack mills michael shields christy veeder and joel yudken action 1 avert layoffs rationale job insecurity is not only an enormous stressor on working people it also undermines our economy s ability to maintain or regain its competitive leadership on the world stage by investing in tools that help workers to keep their jobs we invest in our nation s stability as a whole one key tool available to us for this purpose is called layoff aversion many shutdowns and mass layoffs can be averted with sufficient early warning especially when coupled with a well organized and expedient business turnaround or buyout effort states and local workforce development boards should establish layoff aversion programs in good times as well as in hard times because small business owners managers and workers need dependable business and jobs retention policies initiatives and capacities not intermittent actions by government a sustained aversion initiative should include early identification of firms at risk of layoffs a quick response to assess at risk firms needs and options the delivery of investment and financial restructuring economic development and adjustment and employment and training services that address risk factors early warning is crucial not only to prevent dislocations but also to help workers who need critical transition services key actions the workforce innovation and opportunity act wioa requires states and local workforce boards to commit part of their rapid response program for economic dislocation to efforts that prevent layoffs however the fine print of those requirements gave states wide latitude and implementation has lagged this trend must be reversed states should establish the capacity to provide proactive business turnaround assistance in partnership with skilled organizations outside the workforce system this should include assistance to businesses in economic distress and helping retiring owners convert to employee or alternative ownership and should ensure that women and minority shareholders interests are fully accounted for issues to remember states and communities need to establish core turnaround services e g financial restructuring and production process interventions shared work systems market diversification and buy outs which are integral to an effective layoff aversion system there are several bedrock policies that bolster layoff aversion states can give workers and communities more notice by improving on the federal worker adjustment and retraining notification act for example new york requires ninety days notice as opposed to sixty federally and applies to layoffs of twenty five workers or more versus 50 federally similarly thirty states have established shared work short time compensation programs which allow firms to make workers part time rather than laying them off and to use partial unemployment insurance payments to make up the difference furthermore courts have upheld the rights of municipalities to use their power of eminent domain to buy time to examine alternatives to the liquidation of prospectively viable manufacturing firms there are new exciting developments in the broader arsenal of layoff aversion tools ramping up sector partnerships and incumbent worker strategies engaging with broader value chains providing ownership transition guidance and business sustainability strategies however these aversion services alone generally will not prevent the closure of distressed enterprises and must complement bedrock policies like those described above recent progress a number of states have recently established layoff aversion programs and local workforce areas have experimented with models as well in the last two years the north carolina department of commerce has established the business edge be program bringing together local workforce investment boards wibs state agencies and other partners to identify at risk firms and utilize a variety of resources including certified turnaround professionals ctps to prevent layoffs and closures california consolidated the federal wioa rapid response into a single guidance providing a policy framework for local wibs to design and implement sub state business engagement and layoff aversion model program in pennsylvania the steel valley authority sva has implemented the strategic early warning network sewn a successful layoff aversion initiative with five offices that integrates into the commonwealth s overall dislocated worker services system since 1993 sewn has engaged 1 100 at risk small and medium enterprises and averted or deferred the loss of 26 000 manufacturing jobs sewn through a regional retention team and other partners monitors industries and provides services to retain and assist at risk manufacturing businesses here are three key facets of the initiative timely identification of at risk businesses sewn utilizes numerous intelligence gathering tools including early warning research sources warn notices dun and bradstreet reports on company problems newspaper notices etc it has nurtured a diverse and extensive public referral network and an informal network of banks cpas and attorneys acts as both a conduit for early warning intelligence and as a leverageable resource to coordinate responses to both mass layoffs and distressed firms initial viability assessments within forty eight hours of a request sewn staff cooperates with the requesting firm s management and its workforce to provide an evaluation and a situational analysis of the company it also makes referrals to other public or private agencies where indicated and appropriate delivery of key services sewn provides five core services financial restructuring operational restructuring and cost management market diversification ownership transition employee stock ownership plans etc and high performance workplace strategies

infrastructure spending that money on made in america products keeps our money in the economy supporting good paying manufacturing jobs and companies that pay local taxes infrastructure spending is one of the most important parts of state spending when it comes to making an impact on u s manufacturing infrastructure whether it is roads or bridges or mass transportation depends on iron steel and many other manufactured goods and materials like cement concrete and glass and federal and international law give states more leeway to require domestic contest than for other types of purchased goods states should make sure they have strong buy america rules for infrastructure and then explore preferences for other procured goods key actions the federal government already requires made in america iron steel and other manufactured goods in federally financed infrastructure and defense projects states can extend these protections to state funded infrastructure projects including public buildings like schools hospitals roads bridges mass transit waterways and airports that are not covered by federal buy america rules here are some steps that states should take states should prioritize requiring made in america iron and steel which are the easiest to label and determine if they are fully manufactured in the united states other manufactured goods should also be included in state protections lists but these goods will require more oversight from state agencies to determine the production location of components states should allow limited exemptions to buy america provisions for goods that are not produced in the united states at sufficient and reasonably available quantities or if the purchase of domestic material will increase the overall project contract by more than 25 percent issues to remember states should not restrict infrastructure to producers from their own state but rather use the broader based made in usa content rules short of content requirements states can bolster local manufacturing through procurement by creating publicly supported markets for in state goods and holding made in marketing campaigns within overall rules regarding procurement by the lowest qualified bidder states can institute preferences not requirements for locally produced goods for example one proposal suggests giving a preference to contractors who use locally produced food and whose services are no more than 10 percent more expensive than any other bidder states and localities should pay special attention to the purchase of rolling stock as outlined by jobs to move america and the century foundation the u s department of transportation s u s employment plan gives regional governments a format to follow in structuring bids in ways that boost u s manufacturing and provide training pathways for disadvantaged workers recent progress in december 2017 new york state extended buy america provisions for structural iron and steel to a wide variety of entities such as the metropolitan transportation authority and the state university of new york s dormitory authority in september 2017 texas extended buy america rules for iron and steel for state financed construction products and added buy america protections for iron in all state funded transportation projects which already required american steel model program the american alliance for manufacturing can provide model legislation of buy america implementation their model requires construction repairs and maintenance of public buildings and public works to use iron steel and manufactured goods that are produced in the united states the model provides limited exemptions including when there are insufficient materials of a given category made in the united states and when it increases the cost of a project by more than 25 percent it also provides a thirty day notice and comment period for any such waiver request furthermore it provides enforcement provisions that would debar any contractor from bidding on state construction projects if they are found to have intentionally violated buy america rules with a false made in usa label or other means of misrepresenting where materials are made for more information contact brian lombardozzi american alliance for manufacturing download the action 2 buy america pdf sign up for updates sign up follow us action 3 reshore rationale several economic factors have led u s companies in recent years to question decades old assumptions about the greater profitability of offshore production these factors include rising wages in china notwithstanding inadequate data labor s declining share in the cost of production problems with quality control issues of intellectual property protection in china the availability of low cost natural gas in parts of the united states and a shift in u s trade policy into a stance less favorable to offshore production in 2012 the boston consulting group predicted that reshoring will create between two million and three million jobs over the next decade about a third of them direct manufacturing jobs states should rely on the hard numbers and seek to shift the conventional wisdom in favor of reshoring and thereby trigger a tectonic shift in favor of u s sourcing states should rely on the hard numbers and seek to shift the conventional wisdom in favor of reshoring and thereby trigger a tectonic shift in favor of u s sourcing key actions while reshoring has gathered national momentum no systematic state or federal initiatives yet exist to assist firms thus the key action for states is to implement a state funded reshoring technical assistance team that helps overcome the market failures lack of information and uncertainty that lead firms to count out reshoring when it would in fact deliver savings and to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the public capacity initial reshoring analysis services should be offered at no cost to combat the lack of information misinformation and uncertainty concerning the subject these reshoring assistance teams would conduct firm and market specific financial analysis and then deliver technical assistance to help firms with potential for cost saving reshoring to access economic and workforce services that will enable them to shift sourcing back to the united states issues to remember since systematic state support to help firms reshore is new territory state reshoring initiatives need not be expensive what are most needed are low cost e g 1 million for reshoring technical assistance three year proof of concept initiatives in multiple states along with peer learning across states and careful evaluation of results shifting production back onshore often has transition costs e g for shipping capital equipment back home and other startup costs for new domestic production beyond the cost of the technical assistance capacity firms identified as having profitable reshoring opportunities should be given priority for state funded economic development technical assistance recent progress the state of pennsylvania conducted initial reshoring projects in 2015 and 2016 projects which identified the need for reshoring technical assistance and financial analysis of the pros and cons of reshoring to be highly customized to the markets and production of each company that experience helped shape the proposal outlined below components of a model program a three year reshoring proof of concept could be either an executive branch or legislative initiative it could also be a cost shared federal state initiative aimed specifically at upending long standing assumptions about the superiority of offshore production the essential activities and services performed by such a proof of concept include the following form a reshoring team led by staff of experienced managers and turnaround specialists and with partners from manufacturing extension partnerships meps who have production expertise and executive branch staff e g the governor s action team in pennsylvania who have knowledge of and access to financing the team would identify criteria for selecting original equipment manufacturers oems and suppliers to assist with reshoring such as companies in target industries in which the state has competitive strength that have significant offshore production that source some similar production in the state that are open to reshoring production and can demonstrate that if initial reshoring went well they could reshore additional jobs for whom enough jobs would be reshored initially to enable the state to drive the cost per job reshored below 10 000 and with some or many similar in state manufacturer who then might explore reshoring if it works for the first company market e g through the same channels and customer base used to identify companies that need layoff aversions services the opportunity to participate in the reshoring proof of concept select financial analysis tools suitable for initial evaluation of the potential to profitably reshore production at the selected companies conduct a more detailed financial analysis of reshoring potential and of the additional state support needed for transition costs associated with reshoring select companies to assist with reshoring based on the probability of success the cost per reshored job and the other criteria established initially evaluate the success of the effort including estimating the number of jobs reshored and the cost per job developing recommendations for refining reshoring technical assistance programs to best meet the needs of oems suppliers and startups and developing a reshoring guide for other states and cities that want to support reshoring for more information contact steve herzenberg keystone

need a stronger sectoral skills development infrastructure without that small and medium sized manufacturers struggle to attract good young workers training and education programs disconnected from industry also fail to deliver the soft and technical skills manufacturers seek or the opportunities job seekers want too often when u s manufacturers can t find the workers they want they choose lower wage lower skill paths to profitability in response regions and states have invested in sector partnerships these partnerships bring together multiple employers with overlapping skill needs in some cases jointly with their unions partnerships aggregate employer demand identify common skill gaps and make it possible for job seekers and workers to fill them sector partnerships can cost effectively deliver training that meets industry needs develop curricula and credentials and strengthen career pathways within and across firms partnerships can also identify and spread including through peer learning organizational and human resource practices that achieve high performance for employers increase hiring and fair treatment of employment of underrepresented groups and lead more employers to pay better and invest more in training on and off the job partnerships aggregate employer demand identify common skill gaps and make it possible for job seekers and workers to fill them high quality research documents positive outcomes of sector partnerships for workers across race ethnicity and gender lines the 2014 federal workforce innovation and opportunity act wioa requires policy and funding in states to support sector partnerships key actions states should seek to stabilize and scale up public private joint investment in industry led and worker centered manufacturing sector partnerships states can appropriate general funds and many have flexible state training funds financed by small contributions from employers combining flexible state funds with funding for specific groups of workers e g from wioa temporary assistance for needy families transportation funds corrections supplemental nutrition assistance program employment and training etc and aligning k 12 and community college training with employer needs can further grow available resources for sector partnerships private sector match for public funds is crucial for sustaining and scaling up sector partnerships states should create training and peer learning opportunities for sector partnership staff and employer and labor representatives such learning opportunities can increase partnership capacity to promote improvements in management and organizational practices that have the biggest productivity profitability and job quality payoff states should require sector partnerships to use wioa reporting requirements regarding repeat business earnings and industry recognized credentials and to report earnings and credentials for sub populations such as by race ethnicity and gender issues to remember improving job quality company performance productivity etc and employment equity should be criteria for distributing funds to and evaluating manufacturing sector partnerships currently most state sector partnership policy and funding where states provide it is about closing skill gaps for employers and increasing access to good jobs and career paths for job seekers and

increasingly automated factories a new hybrid industrial manufacturing technician apprenticeship has been developed that provides a new middle rung on manufacturing career ladders and a way to recognize and make more portable the skills of experienced manufacturing workers and new hires to support small high tech startups another competency based apprenticeship program the maker professional has been developed that provides an introduction to the digital toolset and a platform for further skill development including more advanced apprenticeships key actions increase subsidies for manufacturing apprenticeships that lead to good paying jobs these may come in the form of grant funding and or tax credits or by articulating apprenticeship related instruction with college credit and making apprenticeship classes eligible for federal pell grants and state support for community colleges provide technical assistance to employers and apprenticeship sponsors apprenticeship is under utilized in the united states in manufacturing and other sectors in part because employers don t know about it and because some non union employers assume that apprenticeship only exists in unionized companies outreach to employers can be done by hiring staff with experience in sales through a statewide marketing campaign and with validation from employers with successful apprenticeships use group approaches to expand apprenticeship more rapidly a growing number of states embrace group apprenticeships in which at least the classroom portion of the curriculum is coordinated across companies by a sector partnership technical or community college or other intermediary use the workforce development system to grow manufacturing apprenticeships promote capacity building and peer learning among manufacturing apprenticeships emulating sector academies that have helped grow sector partnerships build community based pathways to manufacturing apprenticeships in low income communities and among diverse demographic groups and women expand youth apprenticeships pre apprenticeships and other pipelines to apprenticeship including by articulating the latter stages of high school career and technical education and career pathways with manufacturing apprenticeships issues to remember high road manufacturing companies e g in the precision machining sector invest their own funds heavily in apprenticeship and like many high tech manufacturers have no trouble attracting great workers these champions can teach other manufacturers that training is an investment and not a cost and encourage partnering with educators on solutions instead of blaming schools for the low skills of their graduates as with sector partnerships job quality and employee turnover should be used as criteria for distributing funds to and evaluating manufacturing apprenticeships with any state workforce investment a danger exists that some of the employers most interested in training money are those with low quality jobs high rates of turnover and an ongoing appetite for a new group of workers trained at least partly at public expense recent progress in 2017 new york established the empire

the action 5 nurture industrial apprenticeships pdf action 6 increase the number of minorities and women in manufacturing rationale america s manufacturing workforce needs are forecasted to grow but it s unclear if women and people of color and black and latinx workers in particular will have access to those opportunities before proceeding it s important to note that research on people of color in manufacturing focuses mostly on black and latinx experience but some researchers include all non whites in their definitions while others define people of color as black and latinx alone despite employers recognition of the multiple benefits of diverse workplaces participation by african american and hispanic people working in manufacturing increased only modestly over the past twenty five years this slow diversity growth suggests that companies will need new strategies to hire and retain the growing numbers of people of color in the country who are projected to comprise half of the u s workforce by 2045 similarly although women make up 47 percent of the total u s workforce they fill only 29 percent of manufacturing jobs and women were hired for a mere 7 percent of the 650 000 manufacturing jobs that were created in the united states between 2010 and 2014 women s low participation in the manufacturing sector is not due to having bad experiences in factory employment or a lack of interest in a 2012 survey over 70 percent of women working in manufacturing described their careers as interesting and rewarding highlighting good pay and opportunities for challenging assignments as top reasons to stay in the industry women and people of color present an enormous untapped human resource and states should support programs that can strengthen and build on the work some manufacturers are already doing to grow their inclusive hiring practices women and people of color present an enormous untapped human resource and states should support programs that can strengthen and build on the work some manufacturers are already doing to grow their inclusive hiring practices key actions in order to increase the number of women and people of color in manufacturing jobs programs need to address barriers to entry two primary barriers are access to childcare and transportation childcare in particular can be an especially difficult obstacle for single parents who may be new on the job and are required to work night shifts during which access to reliable affordable childcare may be hard to find opportunities for earn and learn training are also hugely important low wage workers may be interested in switching to a manufacturing career but leaving a wage paying job to take training courses may not be a viable option even if the cost of the training is covered workers are still giving up a valuable paycheck all workers including women and people of color are much more likely to seek employment in a particular sector if they can imagine themselves in a job in that sector unlike fields such as it and medicine many people can t easily visualize what manufacturing work is like hence in a sense it can remain an invisible option to job seekers mentoring programs both at the career coaching stage and the post placement stage are low cost initiatives that can build a sense of manufacturing identity and potentially yield outsize results for recruiting people of color and women these programs can be especially impactful if they come from within the local community educational outreach both to young people and adults has the potential to greatly increase enrollment in the manufacturing workforce manufacturing focused stem programs for k 12 students can tap the next generation of workers who will be needed to replace the millions of current manufacturing employees who are slated to retire over the next decade at the same time contextualized education for adults who may need additional literacy and or numeracy skills can get workers into the many available jobs that need to be filled right now the u s employment plan is a policy tool that government agencies can use in their requests for proposals to directly address hiring in the manufacturing sector while an agency s minority and women s business enterprise standards can support inclusivity for small business owners the u s employment plan accomplishes similar goals for workers manufacturers bidding on federally funded agency contracts can win extra points on their bids by committing to inclusive high road hiring plans should they be awarded the contract issues to remember the u s employment plan has been shown to not have a significant impact on price or the number of bidders and was therefore found to be consistent with the federal laws and regulations that require all procurement involving federal funds be conducted in a way that maximizes full and open competition recent progress in march 2018 illinois state representative mary flowers introduced h b 5062 a bill to sustain and expand advanced skills manufacturing training and education programs in illinois public schools the bill directs the state board of education to institute a program aimed at facilitating education in advanced manufacturing technical skills in twelve public high schools where the youth unemployment rate is at least twice the national average the bill ensures that the

who have been successful in the manufacturing sector to new trainees states can bring together their departments of education and departments of labor in coordination with perkins funding to develop comprehensive manufacturing focused recruiting training and education programs using programs like manufacturing connect as a prototype ohio has developed such a program the state s department of education career tech education cte team in collaboration with the national alliance for partnerships in equity used perkins funding that was earmarked for outreach to nontraditional populations to create a set of resources one for students and parents and one for teachers specifically designed to recruit female students and students of color to manufacturing careers the educational program creates a pathway for interested middle school students to take part in high school work based learning programs that allow students to apply pre apprenticeship work towards their graduation requirements ohio s department of job and family services oversees the certification of participating apprenticeship programs thanks to the program s success maine and colorado are both now in the process of developing their own versions of ohio s program the national skills coalition provides guidance on state policy for alignment programs which have been shown to be key to building career success for low income and or low skilled adults comprehensive alignment programs can be focused to address manufacturing workforce needs and should include integrated education and training career counseling support services attainment of high school diplomas or equivalent credentials training leading to industry recognized and stackable postsecondary credentials and industry engagement among

strategy innovation is a vital component of a sustainable manufacturing future because the new products and processes that result drive growth and create new wealth state investments in innovation should focus on strengthening regional industrial clusters building resources to support research and development r d can be a cost effective way of supporting networks of manufacturers and anchoring them to the region r d creates value that regions can capture and keeps firms competitive in the global market yet small and medium sized firms which comprise a growing share of the manufacturing base often lack r d capabilities of their own to be effective states must carefully direct resources to activities that will create growth among firms that operate in the region and retain investments in a thriving workforce states can build out existing resources to establish an industrial commons of public resources that all local manufacturers can tap lastly states should anticipate the impact of innovation on the manufacturing workforce and take steps to both support job creating innovation and to mitigate job losses from technological changes in the production process key actions build capacity for innovation to strengthen regional industrial clusters states can do this by supporting manufacturing innovation through formal funded relationships with state universities to engage in applied research for example a group of ohio s institutes originally formed through its edison program such as the university of akron s edison polymer innovation center and ohio university s edison biotechnology institute deliver an applied research capacity that can create new marketable technologies and work with existing firms to solve engineering and research challenges state programs can provide cost share grants to such projects and centers in support of the fourteen federally funded regional manufacturing usa institutes which are developing next generation advanced manufacturing often in partnership with higher education manufacturing extension programs meps provide another vehicle for innovation that strengthens regional manufacturing infrastructure meps already excel at assisting individual manufacturers with a wide variety of competitiveness issues states should increase capacity and specifically task meps with identifying and leading process and supply chain innovation strategies that could benefit whole clusters in manufacturing industries that are vital to the region thereby giving small and medium manufacturers a greater role in the state s innovation ecosystem choose investments to help manufacturers to overcome a specific hurdle in the development process of an otherwise marketable product clearing a production hurdle for a good that has or can generate consumer demand enables firms to expand innovation vouchers and research and development tax credits are two forms of state support to address these challenges issues to remember innovation can take the form of either product development or changes in the manufacturing process product innovation tends to be job creating at least within the scope of a given firm because it results in a new or better product that the firm must scale up to produce process innovation is important in a different way because it increases productivity which is vital to sustained economic growth and keeping manufacturers competitive and viable states should focus on helping firms to identify how new technologies and automated production strategies can augment workers instead of replacing them innovation investments should require that technology design take interactions into account and require state funded innovation projects to partner with education and training institutions and employers to develop specific trainings for new technology a good example is the federally funded lightweight innovations for tomorrow in detroit which has developed multiple educational programs to prepare students and incumbent workers for careers in advanced manufacturing focusing on lightweight metal states must also tackle the fact that process innovations can cause job losses improving layoff notification and strengthening unemployment insurance are some important state actions investing in manufacturing innovation is a key component for retaining and reshoring strong industry clusters because proximity to the physical manufacturing process enables a clearer understanding of challenges and better problem solving manufacturers that offshore the production portion of their work often lose their competitive edge recent progress rhode island provides innovation vouchers of up to 50 000 for small manufacturers to partner with rhode island universities research centers or

and worker trustees can be represented on public and multi employer pension boards with assets of around 4 trillion that s a lot of capital many cities and states are tapping a growing source of capital right in their backyards workers capital which represents an enormous share of economic and capital market wealth the pension funds of hard working americans across the country such as public employees teachers construction workers and steelworkers are collectively bargained deferred wages that are owed to them they were won only after decades of fighting to ensure retirement security once

by baher kamal the immense human cost over 260 million migrant workers do pay to rescue their families the world bank wb on 8 april 2019 reported that migrants remittances to low and middle income countries reached a record high in 2018 according to the wb study officially recorded annual remittance flows to those countries reached 529 billion dollars last year an increase of 9 6 percent over the previous record high of 483 billion dollars in 2017 significantly these migrants most hardly won savings do also benefit rich countries in fact the wb reports that global remittances which include flows to high income countries reached 689 billion dollars in 2018 up from 633 billion dollars in 2017 remittances on track to become the largest source of external financing in developing countries wrote on this dilip ratha lead economist at the world bank in a breakdown of this data the wb informs that regionally growth in remittance inflows ranged from almost 7 percent in east asia and the pacific to 12 percent in south asia the oil factor and that the overall increase was driven by a stronger economy and employment situation in the united states and a rebound in outward flows from some gulf cooperation council countries united arab emirates bahrain saudi arabia oman qatar and kuwait as well as the russian federation excluding china remittances to low and middle income countries 462 billion dollars were significantly larger than foreign direct investment flows in 2018 344 billion dollars foreign direct investment flows record the value of cross border transactions related to direct investment during a given period of time according to the organisation for economic co operation and development the top remittance recipients were india with 79 billion dollars followed by china 67 billions mexico 36 billions the philippines 34 billions and egypt 29 billions the world financial institution also estimates that in 2019 remittance flows to low and middle income countries are expected to reach 550 billion dollars to become their largest source of external financing lost in commissions the 529 billion dollars that migrant workers have transferred to their countries of origin in 2018 came obviously at a high costs both economic and human on the one hand the global average cost of sending 200 dollars remained high at around 7 percent in the first quarter of 2019 according to the wb s remittance prices worldwide database this means that each migrant is forced to sacrifice in the concept of money transfer commissions 7 of 100 dollars that she or he managed to save at the cost of renouncing to many basic human needs meantime remittance costs across many african corridors and small islands in the pacific remain above 10 percent this means that african migrants are compelled to pay as much as 1 in 10 dollars of their savings in the concept of money transfer fees to private banking and financial business on this the wb says that banks were the most expensive remittance channels charging an average fee of 11 percent in the first quarter of 2019 while post offices were the next most expensive at over 7 percent on ways to lower remittance costs dilip ratha lead author of the study says that remittances are on track to become the largest source of external financing in developing countries the high costs of money transfers reduce the benefits

that host more than five percent of migrant workers include eastern europe sub saharan africa south eastern asia and the pacific and central and western asia in contrast north africa hosts less than

the growing wave of unusual droughts floods loss of harvests of homes and lives which is caused by climate change which an immense number of the migrants countries of origin did no generate just know that a whole continent like africa which is home to around 1 2 billion human beings has contributed just 4 per cent to greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of more than 80 percent of its dramatic consequences these three main reasons laying behind the forced migration of so many millions of human beings should suffice to explain why the number of people fleeing exploitation wars and climate change driven disasters need to search for other places where to feel safer or simply just survive while working hard to help their families also survive one billion climate migrants refugees

photo from wall street international exploitation slavery among the numerous human costs of those remittances there is the fact that millions more migrant workers mean their countries of origin lose most productive part of workforce the international labour organization ilo underscored that domestic workers are one of the groups most vulnerable to exploitation violence harassment and forced labour saying that many women end up being trapped in abusive worksituations which in some cases may amount to modern forms of slavery sixty seven million domestic workers who care for our homes and loved ones frequently suffer violence harassment exploitation and coercion ranging from verbal abuse to sexual violence and sometimes even death those who live in home are especially vulnerable at the root of this situation is discrimination explains philippe marcadent chief of the ilo branch related to inclusive labour markets labour relations and working conditions domestic workers are often not recognised as workers and face discrimination as women often from poor and marginalised groups such as migrants and indigenous peoples for many daily abuses like lack of rest and non payment of wages can quickly turn into forced labour forced labour can be imposed to adults and children by state authorities by private enterprises or by individuals it is observed in all types of economic activity such as domestic work construction agriculture manufacturing sexual exploitation forced begging etc and in every country traditional practices of forced labour such as vestiges of slavery or slave like practices and various forms of debt bondage as well as new forms of forced labour that have emerged in recent decades such as human trafficking unodc endhumantrafficking visual according to the unodc global report on trafficking in persons 30 of human trafficking victims are children facts and figures an estimated 40 3 million people are in modern slavery including 24 9 in forced labour and 15 4 millions in forced marriage there are 5 4 victims of modern slavery for every 1 000 people in the world 1 in 4 victims of modern slavery are children out of the 24 9 million people trapped in forced labour 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work construction or agriculture 4 8 million people in forced sexual exploitation and 4 million people in forced labour imposed by state authorities women and girls are disproportionately affected by forced labour accounting for 99 percent of victims in the commercial sex industry and 58 percent in other sectors for its part the global report on trafficking in persons released on 29 january 2019 by the united nations office on drugs and crime unodc at un headquarters in new york shows a record high number of cases detected during 2016 but also the largest recorded conviction rate of traffickers anyway women and girls remain a major target according to unodc traffickers the world over continue to target women and girls wrote executive director yury fedotov in the report s preface the vast majority of detected victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and 35 per cent of those trafficked for forced labour are female the report notes considerable regional differences in the sex and age profiles of detected trafficking victims in west africa most of the detected victims are children both boys and girls while in south asia victims are equally reported to be men women and children in central asia a larger share of adult men is detected compared to other regions while in central america and the caribbean more girls are recorded sexual exploitation top form of trafficking most of the victims detected globally are trafficked for sexual exploitation especially in the americas europe and east asia and the pacific in sub saharan africa and the middle east trafficking for forced labour is the most commonly detected form in central asia and south asia trafficking for forced labour and sexual exploitation are equally prevalent other forms of human trafficking include girls forced into marriage more commonly detected in south east asia children for illegal adoption more common in central and south american countries forced criminality mainly reported in western and southern europe and organ removal primarily detected in north africa and central and eastern europe victims can be in restaurants fisheries brothels farms homes and even organ trafficking and illegal adoption said rani hong who survived child trafficking herself as she was taken from her family in india at age 7 submitted to intimidation physical abuse and slavery until she was sold for illegal adoption in canada and later the united states begging porno forced marriage many other forms such as trafficking for exploitation in begging or for the production of pornographic material are reported in different parts of the world the report also shows that armed conflicts can increase vulnerability to trafficking in different ways as areas with weak rule of law and lack of resources to respond to crime provide traffickers with a fertile terrain to carry out their operations preying on those who are desperately in need armed groups and other criminals may take the opportunity to traffic victims including children for sexual exploitation sexual slavery forced marriage armed combat and various forms of forced labour this is the case for example in sub saharan africa north africa and the middle east south east asia and elsewhere in some refugee camps in the middle east also it has been documented that girls and young women have been married off without their consent and subjected to sexual exploitation in neighbouring countries in addition recruitment of children for use as armed combatants is widely documented unodc s report notes that within conflict zones armed groups can use trafficking as a strategy to assert territorial dominance spread fear among civilians in the territories where they operate to keep the local population under control sex slaves they may also use women and girls as sex slaves or force them into marriages to appeal to new potential male recruits the study shows that in all the conflicts examined for the report forcibly displaced populations refugees and internally displaced families have been specifically targeted from settlements of syrian and iraqi refugees to afghans and rohingya fleeing conflict and persecution notably the risk faced by migrants and refugees travelling through conflict areas such as libya or parts of sub saharan africa is also well documented in libya for example militias control some detention centres for migrants and refugees and are coercing detained migrants and asylum seekers for different exploitative purposes while we are far from ending impunity we have made headway in the 15 years since the protocol against trafficking in persons entered into force said unodc s chief as he noted that nearly every country now has legislation in place criminalising human trafficking abused maimed killed children are being smuggled sexually abused maimed killed for their vital organs recruited as soldiers or otherwise enslaved not only 69 million children under five will die from mostly preventable causes 167 million will live in poverty and 263 million are out of school and 750 million women will have been married as children by 2030 according to the international labour organization forced labour alone one component of human trafficking generates an estimated 150 billion dollars in profits per annum as of 2014 all the above is just one part of the 529 billion dollars that migrant workers had to save in one year to rescue their families from imposed impoverishment war and climate

answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2019 ncs multistage earnings conference call as a reminder this conference call is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to your host mr ryan hummer chief financial officer ryan hummer chief financial officer thank you isabella and thank you for joining ncs multistage s first quarter 2019 conference call our call today will be led by robert nipper our chief executive officer and i will also provide comments before we begin our call today we would like to caution listeners that some of the statements that will be made on this call could be forward looking statements and to the extent that our remarks today contain information other than historical information please note that we are relying on the safe harbor protections afforded by federal law such forward looking statements may include comments regarding future financial results and are subject to several known and unknown risks i d like to refer you to our press release issued last night along with other public filings made from time to time with the securities and exchange commission that outline those risks i also need to point out that in our earnings release and in today s conference call we have discussed and will refer to adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda less share based compensation adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per diluted share free cash flow all of which are non gaap measures of operating performance we use these measures of operating performance because they allow us to compare our performance consistently over various periods without regard to costs associated with our current capital structure and in a manner that we believe better reflects our operating performance more from the motley fool our press release from yesterday which is posted on our website ncsmultistage com provides reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the nearest gaap financial measure with that said i ll turn the call over to our chief executive officer robert nipper robert nipper chief executive officer thank you ryan and welcome to our investors analysts and employees during our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call today i ll review high level first quarter results and will discuss what we are seeing in our canadian u s and international operations and i ll discuss how we are executing on some of our key strategic initiatives after that ryan will discuss the quarterly results in more detail i ll then provide some closing remarks highlighting some of our recent accomplishments total revenue in the first quarter was 52 9 million 25 below the year ago period and the 5 increase sequentially adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 7 4 million reflected a 14 adjusted ebitda margin starting with our canadian operations our revenue of 25 million for the first quarter was 30 higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 coming in right at the high end of the guidance range provided in last quarter s call the 30 sequential revenue growth was achieved despite a rig count that increased by only 3 over the same time frame while part of that performance was related to our customer mix we believe that the primary driver of that out performance relative to industry activity is due to the strength of our canadian franchise our people and our ability to execute on the initiatives that we outlined on the last quarter s call a few highlights from the quarter s canadian results included winning back business with customers that have trialed competing technologies successful trials of our new lower cost high pressure sliding sleeves the highest revenue quarter in our history for our canadian based tracer diagnostic service line with a 14 year over year revenue improvement the first sales of our purple seal frac plugs in canada during the quarter and the first installation of our new terrus water injection frac sleeves and our new qumulus ultimate recovery eor system which i ll discuss in more detail momentarily i was recently in calgary for the official unveiling of our new technology center when we hosted customers at the facility it was a fantastic event in which customers had the opportunity to tour the facility to see our current technology and certain r d concepts we ve been working on we had dedicated rooms set up for our fracturing systems well construction tracer diagnostics frac plugs and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery products and services many customers were exposed to the full breadth of what ncs has to offer for the first time over the course of the day we had more than 125 visitors from customer organizations through the technology center and i had the opportunity to spend time with many of them i m very excited about what our team in canada is accomplishing and in the challenging market as well and we re contributing to build on the unique franchise that we have in the canadian market based on recent conversations with our customers we continue to believe that their capital budgets for 2019 will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year than in prior years current oil and condensate process differentials in exchange rates as well as historically low service cost have positioned our customers to benefit from higher cash flows than expected in initial budgets while we believe that the primary application of excessive excess cash flow will be to reduce debt or return capital to shareholders if current commodity prices and differentials persist we believe that capital budgets could expand later in the year for the winter drilling season that extends into the first quarter of 2020 now turning to the u s our revenue for the first quarter of 25 3 million was 15 higher than an year ago period but was 8 lower sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter we delivered sequential growth in product revenues with 1 growth in the first quarter the product sales growth was primarily driven by our well construction and composite plug products we sold more airlock casing floatation systems in the u s in the first quarter than in any quarter in our history demonstrating robust demand for casing floatation systems we have also had initial success in packaging additional wellbore construction products such as toe sleeves together with airlocks direct to e p customers reducing our lines on distributors while we expect wellbore construction demand to remain strong we may not reach the same activity levels in the second quarter that we saw in q1 we had lower than expected activity in our fracturing systems business in the u s during the first quarter we expect fracturing systems activity to increase modestly in the second quarter before picking back up in the second half of the year from a customer count standpoint the number of u s customers utilizing our pinpoint fracturing systems over the last 12 months has remained stable at between 25 and 30 u s services revenue declined by 28 sequentially primarily reflecting a slow start to the year for completions activity as well as a reduction in discretionary spend on technology which adversely impacted our tracer diagnostics business tracer diagnostics activity improved late in the first quarter and has continued to strengthen thus far in the second quarter pricing for our tracer diagnostics services business in the u s has come under increased pressure as new competitors have entered into the market offering heavily discounted prices to gain traction we expect to continue to retain a premium to these discounted offerings based upon our ability to offer particular tracers and the quality of our field service and laboratory services we made a 10 million earnout payment to our joint venture partner in repeat precision during the first quarter and have no further earnout obligations the 10 million was earned based on the business exceeding financial forecast that were established when we entered into the joint venture repeat earned over 4 million in pre tax income during the quarter including contributions from third party sales of composite plugs and purple seal express systems as well as machining work done for ncs sliding sleeve components we believe that there s an opportunity for continued growth at repeat precision especially for the purple seal express system which integrates our purple seal composite plug with a disposable setting tool and an integrated easy to use system that is factory assembled just as customers see the efficiency and field safety benefits of integrated perf gun and charge systems for the perf part of plug and perf operations our purple seal express system brings similar efficiency and hst benefits to the plugs out of the equation over the last few quarters an increase in percentage of our plug sales at repeat precision are of our purple seal express system our international revenue for the first quarter of 2 5 million was in line with the low end of our guidance range as we moved through the quarter we saw increased activity in argentina and china which we believe will continue into the second quarter before our work in europe picks up later in the year a few moments ago i mentioned the successful field trials of our terrus water injection frac sleeves and our qumulus ultimate recovery system with customers in canada these new products represent a further extension of ncs technology into production applications and are exciting examples of the new technology being developed within ncs leveraging the capabilities of our new technology center i m excited about our participation in the secondary recovery and eor space because it leverages several of our strengths as an organization including our ability to design and deliver leading sleeve based technology our expertise in tracer diagnostics to assess water flood and eor performance and the detailed understanding of our customers resources through our reservoir strategies team in addition our eor offering can be utilized by customers across our north american and international geographies and both conventional and unconventional reservoirs the products and systems we ve developed aim to reduce some of the key risk operators may see as they begin to apply eor using multistage horizontal wells and range from relatively simple applications to advanced systems that offer precise control our terrus water injection frac sleeves utilize sliding sleeves for the initial completion and are designed to allow the customers to ship the sleeves after fracturing to configure that well as an injector in a manner that allows for more even injection profile along the lateral without the need for conventional tubing conveyed secondary completions to compartmentalize the wellbore the customer therefore can choose a frac sleeve that has a built in water injection feature at a very reasonable cost the qumulus ultimate recovery system is expected to be our flagship offering in helping customers optimize long term recovery and enhanced oil recovery applications the system which is installed into a well when converted from a producer to an injector or when beginning a miscible gas cycling operation allows customers to increase the efficiency of their eor operations in horizontal wells this is accomplished by facilitating the independent and interventionist control of several valves installed throughout the lateral with ceiling elements provided to compartmentalize the individual sections of the wellbore the individual valves can be controlled remotely in real time from virtually anywhere through a web based system by compartmentalizing the wellbore and controlling each compartment the injector wells can be optimized to create more efficient drive patterns and mitigate premature injection fluid breakthrough through to the producing wells the system is being engineered to facilitate injection and production therefore within an individual huff and puff well the system can serve to ensure that the injected gas is evenly distributed along the lateral or focused into those intervals that the customer believes will yield more oil reducing the requirements for the injected gas which is the largest operating expense for these operations these are just a couple of examples of why we see this technology as being broadly applicable to both legacy conventional and unconventional titled assets because there is a universal need to maximize the efficiency of eor applications that utilize horizontal wells we believe that as our customers continue to manage their business to grow production within cash flow an important piece of that puzzle is mitigating the decline from the existing production base and that secondary and eor applications whether they be water flood co2 flood miscible gas injection or otherwise will be an increasingly important option for our customers to improve their capital efficiencies we plan to complement the terrus and qumulus ultimate recovery systems with other innovative eor technologies that will support our customers as they mitigate declines maximize resource recovery and improve their financial returns ncs continues to balance the investments like the investment we ve made in developing the terrus water injection frac sleeve and the qumulus ultimate recovery system which are required to innovate and drive revenue growth with a capital light business model that can produce free cash flow the investments that we ve made in the past several years organically and through our joint venture and the spectrum acquisition provide us with multiple long term opportunities for capital efficient growth in each of the markets in which we operate through disciplined growth and free cash flow generation we plan to continue to improve our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders i ll now turn the call over to ryan to discuss our financial results in more detail ryan hummer chief financial officer thank you robert as reported in yesterday s earnings release our first quarter revenues were 52 9 million 25 lower than the prior year s first quarter we increased our u s revenue by 15 and our international revenue by 66 as compared to the last year s fourth quarter these increases were more than offset by a decrease in our canadian revenue of 47 resulting from reduced market activity levels pricing adjustments that we made in late 2018 and a weaker canadian dollar as compared to the u s dollar on a sequential basis overall revenue in the first quarter was 5 higher than revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a 30 sequential increase in canadian revenue partially offset by sequential declines in the u s and international markets gross profit defined as total revenue less total cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense was 26 1 million in the first quarter or 49 of revenue this compared to 37 1 million or 52 of revenue in the prior year s first quarter with higher margins from product sales offset by lower margins on services revenue the gross margin percentage was slightly above the midpoint of the guidance that we provided for the quarter for a sequential comparison gross profit was 24 2 million or 48 of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 selling general and administrative costs increased to 23 million in the first quarter from 21 million in the prior year s first quarter and also increased from the fourth quarter of 2018 s level up to 20 3 million as a reminder our reported sg a includes share based compensation as well as certain nonrecurring expenses the year over year increase was primarily driven by headcount additions support services related to our new erp system increases to share based compensation as well as 0 6 million in bad debt expense in the quarter related to operations in russia our first quarter 2019 depreciation and amortization expense totaled 2 6 million adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was 7 4 million as compared to 18 7 million in the prior year s first quarter adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 14 in the first quarter of 2019 we booked a valuation allowance of 9 8 million against our u s deferred tax asset during the quarter and absent that valuation allowance we would have recognized an income tax benefit of 0 2 million we had net income attributable to non controlling interests of 2 1 million in the quarter reflecting positive net income at repeat precision we expect to continue to have positive contributions from repeat in 2019 and into the future our average basic share count for the quarter was 46 million and is currently approximately 46 7 million reflecting the conversion of exchangeable shares during the quarter our adjusted loss per diluted share in the first quarter was 0 04 which compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 21 in the prior year s first quarter turning now to cash flow items in the balance sheet cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative 3 million which included 3 million of the 10 million in contingent consideration paid to repeat precision the remainder of that payment was booked in cash flow from financing activities our net capital expenditures for the first quarter were 2 8 million as a result our free cash flow for the quarter was negative 5 8 million which was impacted by seasonal movements in working capital at march 31 2019 we had 12 million in cash and total debt of 26 million which included 20 million drawn under our u s revolving credit facility we also have up to 55 million in total availability under our revolving credit facilities bringing our total potential liquidity at march 31 to approximately 67 million we amended and restated our revolving credit facility on may 1 on largely the same terms as the prior credit facility with a new maturity date of may 2023 i ll close with a few points of guidance for the second quarter for the second quarter we currently expect revenue to be between 35 million to 40 million with u s revenue flat on a sequential basis a seasonal sequential decline in canadian revenue of between 55 and 65 from the first quarter of 2019 and international revenue of approximately 2 million to 2 5 million as offshore work slides a bit seasonally into the summer months approaching the higher end of that range will primarily depend on favorable weather conditions in canada related to spring breakup we expect our gross margin to be between 46 and 50 as it has been in the last two quarters we expect our reported sg a inclusive of share based compensation and nonrecurring items 2 million the increase compared to the first quarter will primarily be driven by higher share based compensation expense which is expected to be approximately 3 6 million for the second quarter we expect our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be between 2 5 million and 3 million we expect our net interest expense to be between 0 5 million and 0 6 million in the second quarter and we expect our book effective tax rates for the remaining quarters of 2019 to be in the 10 to 15 range with a book tax expense benefit in periods of pre tax losses additionally we continue to expect that cash taxes will be minimal during the year we have reduced our expected capital expenditure range for 2019 by 1 million with a new range of 8 million to 12 million we will continue to review opportunities to reduce our capital spending including leveraging our supply chain partners in place of internal capacity additions i ll now hand it over to robert for closing remarks robert nipper chief executive officer thank you ryan before we open up the call for q a i d like to highlight some of our accomplishments so far in 2019 in canada we completed initial field trials for our new lower cost sleeves and expect more work as we exit spring breakup our tracer diagnostics business continues to perform well and set an all time quarterly revenue record in the first quarter we are fully moved into the new technology center and hosted a customer day there with over 125 customer attendees well construction sales continued to outperform overall market activity we ve had several repeat orders for our purple seal composite plugs that we first brought into the market in january and we have successfully installed our first terrus water injection frac sleeves and our first qumulus ultimate recovery system further expanding the addressable market for ncs technology in the u s we just completed our sixth straight quarter of sequential increase in product revenue and we posted record quarterly sales of composite plugs toe sleeves and airlocks in the first quarter internationally we delivered strong year over year revenue growth we expanded our tracer diagnostics customer base in argentina and are evaluating tracer diagnostics opportunities in multiple additional geographies and we shipped our first order to the middle east and i ll close with just a couple of brief comments we continued to execute on the strategies that we ve had in place for the past couple of years we have leadership positions in product lines and services in which we compete we ve expanded our product and service offering over time and have invested in our sales force and the international infrastructure to allow us to capitalize on our revenue opportunities across the globe as a technology driven company we continue to innovate bring new products and services to market that are highly valued by our customers improving efficiency reducing cost enhancing recoveries and improving their financial returns as a result we believe we are well positioned to deliver capital efficient long term organic growth through increased adoption of our innovative completions equipment and services our capital light business model provides us with the ability to generate free cash flow while maintaining a strong balance sheet this provides us with the optionality to allocate capital to high return investments and evaluate options for the return of capital to shareholders over time and with that we d be happy to take your questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line with george o leary with tph company george o leary tph and company analyst at the decent bit of investors at least a lot of the questions we get are just around the cadence of u s completions versus u s drilling activity and you provided some color on that during the call i wonder if you could just expand on that a little bit and just maybe discuss what you re seeing on a leading edge basis or what you saw in april in both of those buckets completions and well construction versus what you saw in march and then maybe versus what you saw in january and february just so we can get a sense for the progression of activity through the year thus far robert nipper chief executive officer yes generally we saw a pretty slow start to the year most of the products that we have in the u s the product lines we have pretty low market shares in outside of just some of the well construction products so we think about the completions around fracturing systems so our sliding sleeves systems a lot of our customers in the u s are smaller independents who operate out of cash flow and we saw a later start to the year for those customers which affected the sales for our frac sleeves we expect that that activity based on what we ve seen so far in the quarter we expect that activity is going to continue to increase into the second quarter and into the latter half of the year now overall i wouldn t say that i believe that we re going to see a big change in activity or this big recovery in the second half of the year but when we look at some of the customers that we have in our customer base we believe that those customers will have increased activity but generally i don t really see a lot of increase in activity our plug sales were very robust in the quarter we continue to see higher performance in that product line but that s really driven primarily by market share gains because again we re a new entrant into that business being fully commercialized only just over a year now i think we re in our fifth quarter of commercialization or into our sixth quarter now so that s mostly driven by market share gains and then wellbore construction that s driven primarily or the largest revenue generator is our airlock product line and we see what s driving that market or the increases in that market is primarily more adoption so there s a lower percentage of the wells that are using some type of casing buoyancy system today however we do see the adoption rate of that type of technology is increasing and so that s helped to drive that performance as well but again generally in terms of market conditions we see no real green shoots for a big recovery in the second half of the year we remain hopeful that could change but right now we re not counting on that but we re i think we re in pretty position because of the low market shares that we can continue to perform throughout the year and just you didn t ask about that but internationally one of the things that we see is increasing activity i think i mentioned earlier that we had some things slip in china and argentina into the second quarter and the third quarter however in the fourth quarter or in the second half of the year our european activity in the north sea is increasing and we expect to see something of the magnitude of 2 5 times to 3 times increase in the second half of the year versus the first half year internationally george o leary tph and company analyst and that s very helpful color and then maybe just tacking on in a slightly different topic although i guess it is related to the north sea just on the offshore side it does seem like we re in the nascent stages of an offshore recovery wondered if you could just talk generally about shots on goal or bidding opportunities that you re seeing out there in the market and if there might be anything outside of the north sea that s caught you all s attention or where folks are trying to rope you into prospects there robert nipper chief executive officer right well as you know right now primarily our offshore effort is in the north sea we were awarded the contract last year there it was a multiyear contract it s activity that s ramping over time we expect to see the majority of the activity in 2020 and 2021 however there is work ongoing now the project that we re on started it started earlier we had shipments in last year for work that s being performed this year that went in the country we ll have more shipments later in the year but the project did get delayed a bit there were some issues with fracturing fluid that the customer had to work through those have been resolved so that the project is moving ahead again when we think about opportunities outside of the north sea we re looking at potential activity in the gulf of mexico but that s a longer term play that s something that we haven t identified as a for sure thing for us yet however some of the work that we re doing in alaska now is similar work to what we would see in the gulf of mexico so we continue to evaluate that but primarily we ll see this contract we have with aker bp in the north sea but there is interest from a number of other parties in the north sea for work that would be in the out years george o leary tph and company analyst great that s super helpful color sneak in one more if i could i realize you guys had some payments around the repeat precision joint venture early this year and that will stay could you just talk about the outlook for cash flow from operations and free cash flow as we progress forward given that s also another hotbed topic with investors today ryan hummer chief financial officer sure george this is ryan well i think we still feel comfortable in our ability to generate free cash flow on the year part of that has to do with the fact that our ebitda and really our adjusted ebitda translates pretty cleanly to cash in the year where we have very nominal interest expense and expect limited cash tax payments we had a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter which is normal for us given the q1 activity in canada it s primarily receivables growth we expect that will release on a net basis over the course of the rest of the year typically we ll see some working capital release in q2 it will build again a bit in q3 and then release in q4 i d also say that we can expect a moderation in the level of capex as we move through the year we had close to 3 million in the first quarter we ve got a range of 8 million to 12 million with i think some opportunities to move that lower so any of the gains of capital spending reduces during the year as well operator your next question comes from the line of ian macpherson with simmons ian macpherson simmons energy analyst it s too early to tell for sure but so far it looks like there s just not a lot of capex elasticity the oil prices here but i sort of inferred from your opening comments that you thought that might be a little bit different in canada can you expand on that robert nipper chief executive officer yes i mean just what i said more around costs are pretty low in canada compared to where they have been in prior years cost are low the bidding wars are just crazy up there in terms of the frac fleets and the pricing our customers are seeing so cash flow and with some of the exchange rates and some of the other issues that our customers are seeing with oil prices kind of stabilized the differentials closing up what we re seeing is that their cash flows are a bit better than they projected so it s we re fairly optimistic that budgets could actually increase a bit from what the original budget levels were the recent conversations that we re having with customers up there ian macpherson simmons energy analyst ok it s hard to benchmark your canadian revenue seasonality because it hasn t really been stable for the past few years obviously last year was significantly front half loaded but in the past couple of years 55 to 65 of your full year canada revs have been in the second half do you think that that would be 55 plus would be a reasonable starting point for us to think about your second half weighting for canada ryan hummer chief financial officer yes we do think that the second half will be more heavily weighted than the first half ian macpherson simmons energy analyst ok and then so how material is eor today to your business i d imagine it s quite small and early but maybe you could talk about if you don t mind what you think the opportunity is there going forward and the materiality of the eor market relative to new well construction for your suite of products ryan hummer chief financial officer so the canadian market is a lot more advanced i d say in eor than the u s market just because we ve been producing longer as an industry we ve been using water flood longer and so there s a bit of history there and customers have had success with eor i mean there is a number of canadian operators who talk about increasing ultimate recoveries by large percentages through water flooding activities and so we ve watched that over time we participated in that market with our multi cycle sleeves our customers have been using multi cycle sleeves in the past and for the past few years they would run multi cycle so that they d have the option of being able to without compartmentalizing the wellbore with additional products and services and additional equipment in the well they could use the multi cycle sleeves to close off areas that they thought that needed to be injected into because there was breakthrough and they weren t effectively sweeping through those areas the problem that we ve seen with that though is that it s very difficult number one to determine which areas of the wellbore we need to stop injecting in and we need to increase injection at so the two products that i mentioned earlier the more economical product basically it s a sliding sleeve that gives the customer the ability to produce through it frac through it but also to be able to put it into a position where there s a metered flow that goes through the sleeve so gas or water can be injected down the well and create backpressure across every sleeve that s open in this particular position so that they can effectively control how the fluid goes through the entry points but not necessarily control which entry point to go that fluid goes into without physically going into the wellbore with an intervention and completely closing sleeves or completely opening sleeves up so the qumulus system that i mentioned earlier what that does is it gives the customer the ability to be able to understand temperature and pressure in every compartment that we place in the wellbore so just as an example let s say we put five compartments in a one mile lateral so there are five different places in the wellbore that injection can be controlled through and so what customers are doing with the technology so we have the one installation that has been installed for about a one and a half month to two months now and operationally it was a total success the system worked as designed what the customer has is the ability to see pressure and temperature at each one of those compartments so what they ve done is they ve closed all the compartments in the wellbore and then compartment by compartment they re going in and injecting into the well and based on injection pressure based on the amount of fluid that s going into the well and then they stop injecting and monitor the pressure and the temperature at that compartment as well as the adjacent compartments and what they re able to determine is which compartments they should be injecting into and which ones they shouldn t inject into and that changes over time as they inject into these wellbores into the reservoirs there s what we call short circuits in the reservoir where there s a breakthrough of fluid and this path is created or the water the injected water just moves through this path and it doesn t move any oil in front of it it s moved all it s going to move so that compartment needs to be closed and we inject into other compartments and effectively change the injection regime and so by having the ability to do this the customer in real time sitting at their desk can manipulate these valves and understand how best to inject and so what one of the things that we re doing is using artificial intelligence to learn from the injection at wells as well as the production wells how different types of injection regimes affect the production and so over time we believe that we may be able to come up with an automated way that the wellbore or the computer can control the well in near real time so how big is the opportunity well there s a large percentage of our customers in canada today that are using water flood for secondary recovery and they re looking for ways to improve that because right now it s basically just inject down the wellbore they can put some compartments in the well but it s expensive to do and there s not a lot of control it s just one extra level the products that we talked about are products that allow the customer to have a lot more control which they believe can help extend the life of the secondary recovery effort that they re doing and as we look at what s going on in the u s in the unconventionals and in the conventionals as well we re seeing the same types of things that we saw a few years ago so in the u s we have some customers that are running multi cycle sleeves and second recovery so that they can do what the canadian market was doing a few years ago open and close the sleeves and redirect the injection effort so we believe that over time that this will grow as customers as part of their being able to maintain production over time part of that is going to be heavily dependent on how well they re able to execute on secondary recovery and tertiary recovery operator your next question comes from the line of with raymond james unknown speaker i guess to the same point on the r d side you guys have obviously introduced a lot of products can you talk about how you think of it moving forward in terms of as you re developing new products do you think the does the r d go more toward new products or does it go more toward improving existing products how do you think about how it goes how it moves going forward robert nipper chief executive officer so it s both as you would imagine we have a group in engineering now that that s all product performance and 100 of what they work on is just improvements to existing products whether that be fracturing services or composite plugs or whatever the product line is one of the things that and we think about the balance of investing for longer term products versus got to have today kind of products what we look at and think about in the near term development that we re doing is we re almost focused 100 around efficiency from a time saving standpoint so working on developing products that help our customers save time and dollars on the location where at the end of that installation of whatever product or service it is that the customers can see all right this is how much money i save versus something with a longer term play and we ve been focused on that for quite some time as we look down the road we think it s important that we are investing in some longer term products like the two eor systems i discussed earlier those are products that we started developing almost two years ago and so now they re just now turning into revenue generators and we ve got two more of the qumulus systems sold that are scheduled for installation so we see that that is not going to be something that affects the revenue in 2019 significantly but in the out years we see that as being very important that we have those types of products but it s just the balance of the shorter term projects and the longer term projects as we think about sg a spend and r d spend we just have to think about the balance of and the investment that we re making and how that return is coming back to us unknown speaker right i guess that we can fall on just the rollout so when we even i guess maybe taking the eor as a proxy how do you think about introducing that and then getting that to kind of good run rate in terms of rollouts and in commercialization and should we think of it as a canadian rollout initially and then followed by u s further adoption or how do we think about that actually becoming a material part of the business robert nipper chief executive officer yes i think we have to think about it as a canadian rollout just because the canadian market is so far ahead of the u s market in terms of secondary recovery in the unconventionals we see areas of the permian where there is starting to be a focus so we think that that would probably be the first areas in the u s that we move into but it s certainly there s a few years gap between where the canadian market is in terms of secondary recovery in the u s market unknown speaker ok that s helpful j b lowe citi analyst in your prepared remarks you kind of mentioned your factory assembled plug in setting system i was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more what are the benefits of that system is it beyond just the safety that it provides is there a cost or pricing benefit you guys what s kind of the value proposition to the customer robert nipper chief executive officer yes it s a cost savings primarily for the customer through efficiency and in real dollars so the cost for the customer to use what we call the purple seal express which is the it s basically a bridge plug the device that connects the bridge plug to the setting tool and a setting tool that s assembled in the factory environment it s not put together on location in the middle of the night by somebody who s just got is doing stage after stage after stage and so the cost for the customer to do that versus what they were doing which is a composite plug on a electric setting tool for wire line that s rerun over and over and redressed with some frequency the cost is about the same if not a little bit cheaper to be able to buy the purple seal express and just toss away the setting tool and the adapter kit but the real savings for customer is the efficiency and the reliability around the setting tool itself so what our customers have been telling us and the whole reason that this product is done so well in the market is because there s a high percentage of time where there are failures with the setting tool because they were improperly redressed they weren t redressed or they weren t properly applied and run in the wellbore and so one of the things that we can do is it s a brand new setting tool it s dressed in the factory environment so we know it s dressed properly so the failure rate has been almost nothing on these disposable setting tools so that means real dollars for the customers and so our customer the uptake for the customers is pretty high right now these setting tools have been run for probably about one and a half years on a stand alone basis where they would the setting tool is thrown away but it s not delivered to the location with a plug installed on it so the customers have become accustomed to these disposable setting tools but what we ve been able to do with the purple seal express is be able to have the setting tool already preassembled onto the plug and that whole unit delivered to the location so that removes an operation on location which is a serviceman having to install the plug on a setting tool so it removes the cost of that serviceman to do that and it also takes some of the risk out of having the proper maintenance and qa qc done to the tool so that s we believe that that is why that tool is being successful and it s used and that combination of a low percentage of wells today but we see that continuing to grow on a quarter to quarter basis j b lowe citi analyst yes i was wondering if you could just put kind of a magnitude around the market opportunity and there s a these are competing offering in the marketplace you guys are you guys doing this alone just maybe some kind of qualitative market analysis and that would be helpful robert nipper chief executive officer well depending on which analyst you talk to and look at the work that they ve done there s somewhere around 700 000 frac stages that are done in the u s on an annual basis so just say it s 500 000 that s what the total opportunity is and today we re the only company that is providing a complete assembled unit with the frac plug and the setting tool all assembled and delivered to location so we re the only one doing that and it s done on a very small percentage of the well so the opportunity is quite large j b lowe citi analyst all right excellent robert nipper chief executive officer thank you operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to robert nipper chief executive officer

harry j holzer is a professor of public policy at georgetown university a senior fellow at the brookings institution and a former chief economist of the labor department when congressional republicans and the trump administration pushed for their tax cuts in 2017 they promised american workers that slashing the corporate tax rate would raise their wages they offered two rationales for this promise that companies would share some of their gains with workers right away by raising their pay and that they would also invest more in equipment thereby raising productivity and worker wages over time indeed higher wages were supposed to be the main benefit to the broad public of a tax cut package that otherwise was heavily tilted toward the rich and inflated the national debt but to date those predictions have mostly failed to come true corporate stock buybacks have swamped other uses of the tax savings wage growth has edged up very modestly since the tax cuts passed more likely due to tight labor markets than the tax cut when helping workers many companies have chosen one time bonuses instead of permanent increases in base pay furthermore the growth in investment has also been modest and more likely driven by high oil prices than lower taxes advertisement but a different version of the same corporate tax cut could indeed raise worker wages suppose congress which cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent in 2017 clawed back several percentage points and then doled them back out to companies that actually paid their workers more in this case the overall size of the corporate tax cut could remain the same but it would encourage companies to raise wages how would such a tax law work in one approach firms could earn reductions in their tax rate for annual wage increases above a certain base rate of wage growth with tax cuts growing larger as wage growth rises and firms that already pay their workers above their industry average might also get a tax cut with larger cuts for companies paying more above the average we could also provide additional tax cuts for profit sharing generous benefits or even apprenticeships through which companies invest in their workers productivity and pay would such a proposal constitute undue government meddling in private sector labor markets not at all the wages of america s workers especially those without college degrees have stagnated for decades now with too little of private sector productivity growth being shared with them in fact the stagnation in the living standards of ordinary american workers along with massively growing inequality in wages and incomes ultimately threatens the legitimacy of our private market system and the stability of our politics advertisement and there is another strong economic rationale for rewarding good paying firms companies in any given industry don t all pay their workers a single market wage they often choose to pay well above or below that average even in competitive markets companies choosing the low road in wages compete on the basis of low labor costs while those choosing the high road compete on the basis of higher worker performance and productivity as well as lower turnover costs share this article share if some companies can be equally profitable by paying workers less or more while also making the overall economy less or more productive then the high wage approach is what economists call a public good and private markets provide too little of it on their own so the government should encourage higher wage employers through subsidies including tax cuts and other regulations including higher minimum wages and legal protections for unions in recent years fewer and fewer companies appear to be taking the high road though there are some exceptions for instance walmart and amazon have recently chosen to raise their employees pay and invest more in training them they are experimenting with whether a higher road approach to employment actually improves their bottom lines amazon chief executive jeff bezos owns the post advertisement of course some companies might respond to tax cuts for higher pay by gaming the system they might lay off some of their lower wage workers or turn them into independent contractors to raise the average pay of those still on their payrolls they could also raise average pay but meanwhile cut benefits such as health insurance but congress could stipulate that companies engaging in such tactics would forfeit their rights to the larger tax cut right now we re not sure how much companies would respond to these kinds of tax incentives by raising worker wages but given the costs that wage stagnation now imposes on american workers and our overall economy and politics it s worth a shot and we would finally make true the original promise of higher wages on which the republican tax cuts were based while imposing no great burden on corporate america

1q2018 the smaller difference in realized prices was due to a smaller vasconia marker discount and significant improvements in commercial and transportation discounts in colombia that began in january 2019 in colombia the vasconia marker discount averaged 3 5 per bbl in 1q2019 compared to 4 1 in 1q2018 and commercial and transportation discounts in colombia averaged 12 0 in 1q2019 compared to 15 0 per bbl in 1q2018 as shown in the realized oil price table below commercial and transportation discounts in colombia improved by 3 0 bbl during 1q2019 positively impacting realized oil revenues in colombia these lower discounts on oil revenues in colombia were partially offset by 1 0 bbl of higher selling expenses thus generating a net margin improvement of 2 0 bbl please refer to selling

and stable realized oil prices oil deliveries increased by 19 to 30 498 bopd realized prices remained flat at 48 2 despite lower brent oil prices resulting from a lower vasconia differential and improved commercial and transportation discounts colombian earn out payments increased to 6 1 million in 1q2019 compared to 4 3 million in 1q2018 in line with higher oil revenues and increased production chile in 1q2019 oil revenues decreased by 22 to 3 3 million due to lower volumes sold and lower oil prices oil deliveries decreased by 19 to 668 bopd due to the natural decline of the fields whereas realized oil prices decreased by 5 to 54 9 per bbl in line with lower brent prices argentina in 1q2019 oil revenues were 7 9 million with deliveries of 1 616 bopd and a realized oil

1q2019 compared to 12 8 million in 1q2018 revenues dropped due to an 8 decrease in gas prices however this was offset by the 6 increase in gas deliveries chile in 1q2019 gas revenues increased by 14

non operated 10 wi reduced gas deliveries by 30 to 10 577 mcfpd 1 763 boepd gas prices decreased by 2 to 5 5 per mcf 33 2 per boe due to the impact of the local currency devaluation which was partially offset by the annual price inflation adjustment of approximately 6 effective january 2019 argentina in 1q2019 gas revenues were 1 4 million resulting from deliveries of 3 807 mcfpd 635 boepd and realized gas prices of 4 0 per mcf 24 1 per boe from the blocks acquired in argentina commodity risk management contracts consolidated commodity risk management contracts refers to two different components a realized and an unrealized portion the realized portion of the commodity risk management contracts registered a cash gain of 1 8 million in 1q2019 compared to a 10 6 million loss in 1q2018 realized gains in 1q2019 resulted from hedges in place covering 15 000 bopd with floors of 60 65 per bbl which were higher than prevailing oil prices during a portion of the quarter the unrealized portion of the commodity risk management contracts amounted to 23 1 million loss in 1q2019 compared to a 6 7 million gain in 1q2018 unrealized losses during 1q2019 resulted from an increase in the forward brent oil price curve compared to december 2018 the company uses risk management contracts to minimize the impact of oil price fluctuations on its work program production and operating costs5 consolidated operating costs per boe were 7 8 in 1q2019 lower than the 8 3 per boe in 4q2018 but higher than the 7 2 per boe in 1q2018 due to the addition of the new blocks in argentina which have higher costs per boe consolidated operating costs increased by 5 4 million to 25 3 million in 1q2019 compared to 19 9 million in 1q2018 the majority of the increase 4 3 million was explained by the acquisition in argentina the breakdown of operating costs is as follows colombia operating costs per boe increased slightly to 5 5 in 1q2019 compared to 5 4 in 1q2018 total operating costs increased by 21 to 15 0 million in line with higher volumes delivered which increased by 20 chile operating costs per boe decreased by 22 to 18 1 in 1q2019 compared to 23 3 in 1q2018 due to lower well intervention activities total operating costs decreased by 16 to 4 5 million in 1q2019 from 5 4 million in 1q2018 despite an increase of 8 in oil and gas deliveries brazil operating costs per boe increased by 36 to 9 6 in 1q2019 compared to 7 0 in 1q2018 due to the impact of fixed costs over lower production and deliveries which decreased by 30 total operating costs decreased by 38 to 1 0 million in 1q2019 from 1 6 million in 1q2018 argentina operating costs per boe decreased by 29 to 24 3 in 1q2019 compared to 34 4 in 4q2018 total operating costs decreased to 4 8 million in 1q2019 from 7 2 million in 4q2018 the 1q2019 costs decreased compared to the previous quarter due to lower well intervention activities consolidated royalties fell by 0 8 million to 13 3 million in 1q2019 compared to 14 1 million in 1q2018 reaching 9 of net revenue in 1q2019 compared to 11 in 1q2018 this decrease was due to a lower high price royalty component in colombia which is a variable rate royalty depending on prevailing oil prices the high price royalty has a countercyclical effect when oil prices are lower this effect was partially offset by higher oil and gas deliveries selling expenses consolidated selling expenses increased by 3 1 million to 3 5 million in 1q2019 of which 3 0 million or 1 1 bbl correspond to colombia compared to 0 4 million in 1q2018 the increase of 1 0 per barrel in colombia is explained by accounting differences for the different kinds of sales transportation costs associated to sales at the wellhead are accounted for as a deduction from revenues whereas transportation costs associated to sales at other delivery points are accounted for as selling expenses as shown in the reference and realized oil price section of this document commercial and

ebitda is not a measure of profit or cash flow as determined by ifrs the company excludes the items listed above from profit for the period in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted

compensation adjusted net income adjusted net earnings per diluted share free cash flow all of which are non gaap measures of operating performance we use these measures of operating performance

officer robert nipper robert nipper chief executive officer thank you ryan and welcome to our investors analysts and employees during our first quarter 2019 earnings conference call today i ll review high level first quarter results and will discuss what we are seeing in our canadian u s and international operations and i ll discuss how we are executing on some of our key strategic initiatives after that ryan will discuss the quarterly results in more detail i ll then provide some closing remarks highlighting some of our recent accomplishments total revenue in the first quarter was 52 9 million 25 below the year ago period and the 5 increase sequentially adjusted ebitda in the first quarter of 7 4 million reflected a 14 adjusted ebitda margin starting with our canadian operations our revenue of 25 million for the first quarter was 30 higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 coming in right at the high end of the guidance range provided in last quarter s call the 30 sequential revenue growth was achieved despite a rig count that increased by only 3 over the same time frame while part of that performance was related to our customer mix we believe that the primary driver of that out performance relative to industry activity is due to the strength of our canadian franchise our people and our ability to execute on the initiatives that we outlined on the last quarter s call a few highlights from the quarter s canadian results included winning back business with customers that have trialed competing technologies successful trials of our new lower cost high pressure sliding sleeves the highest revenue quarter in our history for our canadian based tracer diagnostic service line with a 14 year over year revenue improvement the first sales of our purple seal frac plugs in canada during the quarter and the first installation of our new terrus water injection frac sleeves and our new qumulus ultimate recovery eor system which i ll discuss in more detail momentarily i was recently in calgary for the official unveiling of our new technology center when we hosted customers at the facility it was a fantastic event in which customers had the opportunity to tour the facility to see our current technology and certain r d concepts we ve been working on we had dedicated rooms set up for our fracturing systems well construction tracer diagnostics frac plugs and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery products and services many customers were exposed to the full breadth of what ncs has to offer for the first time over the course of the day we had more than 125 visitors from customer organizations through the technology center and i had the opportunity to spend time with many of them i m very excited about what our team in canada is accomplishing and in the challenging market as well and we re contributing to build on the unique franchise that we have in the canadian market based on recent conversations with our customers we continue to believe that their capital budgets for 2019 will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year than in prior years current oil and condensate process differentials in exchange rates as well as historically low service cost have positioned our customers to benefit from higher cash flows than expected in initial budgets while we believe that the primary application of excessive excess cash flow will be to reduce debt or return capital to shareholders if current commodity prices and differentials persist we believe that capital budgets could expand later in the year for the winter drilling season that extends into the first quarter of 2020 now turning to the u s our revenue for the first quarter of 25 3 million was 15 higher than an year ago period but was 8 lower sequentially for the sixth consecutive quarter we delivered sequential growth in product revenues with 1 growth in the first quarter the product sales growth was primarily driven by our well construction and composite plug products we sold more airlock casing floatation systems in the u s in the first quarter than in any quarter in our history demonstrating robust demand for casing floatation systems we have also had initial success in packaging additional wellbore construction products such as toe sleeves together with airlocks direct to e p customers reducing our lines on distributors while we expect wellbore construction demand to remain strong we may not reach the same activity levels in the second quarter that we saw in q1 we had lower than expected activity in our fracturing systems business in the u s during the first quarter we expect fracturing systems activity to increase modestly in the second quarter before picking back up in the second half of the year from a customer count standpoint the number of u s customers utilizing our pinpoint fracturing systems over the last 12 months has remained stable at between 25 and 30 u s services revenue declined by 28 sequentially primarily reflecting a slow start to the year for completions activity as well as a reduction in discretionary spend on technology which adversely impacted our tracer diagnostics business tracer diagnostics activity improved late in the first quarter and has continued to strengthen thus far in the second quarter pricing for our tracer diagnostics services business in the u s has come under increased pressure as new competitors have entered into the market offering heavily discounted prices to gain traction we expect to continue to retain a premium to these discounted offerings based upon our ability to offer particular tracers and the quality of our field service and laboratory services we made a 10 million earnout payment to our joint venture partner in repeat precision during the first quarter and have no further earnout obligations the 10 million was earned based on the business exceeding financial forecast that were established when we entered into the joint venture repeat earned over 4 million in pre tax income during the quarter including contributions from third party sales of composite plugs and purple seal express systems as well as machining work done for ncs sliding sleeve components we believe that there s an opportunity for continued growth at repeat precision especially for the purple seal express system which integrates our purple seal composite plug with a disposable setting tool and an integrated easy to use system that is factory assembled just as customers see the efficiency and field safety benefits of integrated perf gun and charge systems for the perf part of plug and perf operations our purple seal express system brings similar efficiency and hst benefits to the plugs out of the equation over the last few quarters an increase in percentage of our plug sales at repeat precision are of our purple seal express system our international revenue for the first quarter of 2 5 million was in line with the low end of our guidance range as we moved through the quarter we saw increased activity in argentina and china which we believe will continue into the second quarter before our work in europe picks up later in the year a few moments ago i mentioned the successful field trials of our terrus water injection frac sleeves and our qumulus ultimate recovery system with customers in canada these new products represent a further extension of ncs technology into production applications and are exciting examples of the new technology being developed within ncs leveraging the capabilities of our new technology center i m excited about our participation in the secondary recovery and eor space because it leverages several of our strengths as an organization including our ability to design and deliver leading sleeve based technology our expertise in tracer diagnostics to assess water flood and eor performance and the detailed understanding of our customers resources through our reservoir strategies team in addition our eor offering can be utilized by customers across our north american and international geographies and both conventional and unconventional reservoirs the products and systems we ve developed aim to reduce some of the key risk operators may see as they begin to apply eor using multistage horizontal wells and range from relatively simple applications to advanced systems that offer precise control our terrus water injection frac sleeves utilize sliding sleeves for the initial completion and are designed to allow the customers to ship the sleeves after fracturing to configure that well as an injector in a manner that allows for more even injection profile along the lateral without the need for conventional tubing conveyed secondary completions to compartmentalize the wellbore the customer therefore can choose a frac sleeve that has a built in water injection feature at a very reasonable cost the qumulus ultimate recovery system is expected to be our flagship offering in helping customers optimize long term recovery and enhanced oil recovery applications the system which is installed into a well when converted from a producer to an injector or when beginning a miscible gas cycling operation allows customers to increase the efficiency of their eor operations in horizontal wells this is accomplished by facilitating the independent and interventionist control of several valves installed throughout the lateral with ceiling elements provided to compartmentalize the individual sections of the wellbore the individual valves can be controlled remotely in real time from virtually anywhere through a web based system by compartmentalizing the wellbore and controlling each compartment the injector wells can be optimized to create more efficient drive patterns and mitigate premature injection fluid breakthrough through to the producing wells the system is being engineered to facilitate injection and production therefore within an individual huff and puff well the system can serve to ensure that the injected gas is evenly distributed along the lateral or focused into those intervals that the customer believes will yield more oil reducing the requirements for the injected gas which is the largest operating expense for these operations these are just a couple of examples of why we see this technology as being broadly applicable to both legacy conventional and unconventional titled assets because there is a universal need to maximize the efficiency of eor applications that utilize horizontal wells we believe that as our customers continue to manage their business to grow production within cash flow an important piece of that puzzle is mitigating the decline from the existing production base and that secondary and eor applications whether they be water flood co2 flood miscible gas injection or otherwise will be an increasingly important option for our customers to improve their capital efficiencies we plan to complement the terrus and qumulus ultimate recovery systems with other innovative eor technologies that will support our customers as they mitigate declines maximize resource recovery and improve their financial returns ncs continues to balance the investments like the investment we ve made in developing the terrus water injection frac sleeve and the qumulus ultimate recovery system which are required to innovate and drive revenue growth with a capital light business model that can produce free cash flow the investments that we ve made in the past several years organically and through our joint venture and the spectrum acquisition provide us with multiple long term opportunities for capital efficient growth in each of the markets in which we operate through disciplined growth and free cash flow generation we plan to continue to improve our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders i ll now turn the call over to ryan to discuss our financial results in more detail ryan hummer chief financial officer thank you robert as reported in yesterday s earnings release our first quarter revenues were 52 9 million 25 lower than the prior year s first quarter we increased our u s revenue by 15 and our international revenue by 66 as compared to the last year s fourth quarter these increases were more than offset by a decrease in our canadian revenue of 47 resulting from reduced market activity levels pricing adjustments that we made in late 2018 and a weaker canadian dollar as compared to the u s dollar on a sequential basis overall revenue in the first quarter was 5 higher than revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 with a 30 sequential increase in canadian revenue partially offset by sequential declines in the u s and international markets gross profit defined as total revenue less total cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization expense was 26 1 million in the first quarter or 49 of revenue this compared to 37 1 million or 52 of revenue in the prior year s first quarter with higher margins from product sales offset by lower margins on services revenue the gross margin percentage was slightly above the midpoint of the guidance that we provided for the quarter for a sequential comparison gross profit was 24 2 million or 48 of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 selling general and administrative costs increased to 23 million in the first quarter from 21 million in the prior year s first quarter and also increased from the fourth quarter of 2018 s level up to 20 3 million as a reminder our reported sg a includes share based compensation as well as certain nonrecurring expenses the year over year increase was primarily driven by headcount additions support services related to our new erp system increases to share based compensation as well as 0 6 million in bad debt expense in the quarter related to operations in russia our first quarter 2019 depreciation and amortization expense totaled 2 6 million adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was 7 4 million as compared to 18 7 million in the prior year s first quarter adjusted ebitda as a percentage of total revenue was 14 in the first quarter of 2019 we booked a valuation allowance of 9 8 million against our u s deferred tax asset during the quarter and absent that valuation allowance we would have recognized an income tax benefit of 0 2 million we had net income attributable to non controlling interests of 2 1 million in the quarter reflecting positive net income at repeat precision we expect to continue to have positive contributions from repeat in 2019 and into the future our average basic share count for the quarter was 46 million and is currently approximately 46 7 million reflecting the conversion of exchangeable shares during the quarter our adjusted loss per diluted share in the first quarter was 0 04 which compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 21 in the prior year s first quarter turning now to cash flow items in the balance sheet cash flow from operations for the first quarter was negative 3 million which included 3 million of the 10 million in contingent consideration paid to repeat precision the remainder of that payment was booked in cash flow from financing activities our net capital expenditures for the first quarter were 2 8 million as a result our free cash flow for the quarter was negative 5 8 million which was impacted by seasonal movements in working capital at march 31 2019 we had 12 million in cash and total debt of 26 million which included 20 million drawn under our u s revolving credit facility we also have up to 55 million in total availability under our revolving credit facilities bringing our total potential liquidity at march 31 to approximately 67 million we amended and restated our revolving credit facility on may 1 on largely the same terms as the prior credit facility with a new maturity date of may 2023 i ll close with a few points of guidance for the second quarter for the second quarter we currently expect revenue to be between 35 million to 40 million with u s revenue flat on a sequential basis a seasonal sequential decline in canadian revenue of between 55 and 65 from the first quarter of 2019 and international revenue of approximately 2 million to 2 5 million as offshore work slides a bit seasonally into the summer months approaching the higher end of that range will primarily depend on favorable weather conditions in canada related to spring breakup we expect our gross margin to be between 46 and 50 as it has been in the last two quarters we expect our reported sg a inclusive of share based compensation and nonrecurring items 2 million the increase compared to the first quarter will primarily be driven by higher share based compensation expense which is expected to be approximately 3 6 million for the second quarter we expect our second quarter depreciation and amortization expense to be between 2 5 million and 3 million we expect our net interest expense to be between 0 5 million and 0 6 million in the second quarter and we expect our book effective tax rates for the remaining quarters of 2019 to be in the 10 to 15 range with a book tax expense benefit in periods of pre tax losses additionally we continue to expect that cash taxes will be minimal during the year we have reduced our expected capital expenditure range for 2019 by 1 million with a new range of 8 million to 12 million we will continue to review opportunities to reduce our capital spending including leveraging our supply chain partners in place of internal capacity additions i ll now hand it over to robert for closing remarks robert nipper chief executive officer thank you ryan before we open up the call for q a i d like to highlight some of our accomplishments so far in 2019 in canada we completed initial field trials for our new lower cost sleeves and expect more work as we exit spring breakup our tracer diagnostics business continues to perform well and set an all time quarterly revenue record in the first quarter we are fully moved into the new technology center and hosted a customer day there with over 125 customer attendees well construction sales continued to outperform overall market activity we ve had several repeat orders for our purple seal composite plugs that we first brought into the market in january and we have successfully installed our first terrus water injection frac sleeves and our first qumulus ultimate recovery system further expanding the addressable market for ncs technology in the u s we just completed our sixth straight quarter of sequential increase in product revenue and we posted record quarterly sales of composite plugs toe sleeves and airlocks in the first quarter internationally we delivered strong year over year revenue growth we expanded our tracer diagnostics customer base in argentina and are evaluating tracer diagnostics opportunities in multiple additional geographies and we shipped our first order to the middle east and i ll close with just a couple of brief comments we continued to execute on the strategies that we ve had in place for the past couple of years we have leadership positions in product lines and services in which we compete we ve expanded our product and service offering over time and have invested in our sales force and the international infrastructure to allow us to capitalize on our revenue opportunities across the globe as a technology driven company we continue to innovate bring new products and services to market that are highly valued by our customers improving efficiency reducing cost enhancing recoveries and improving their financial returns as a result we believe we are well positioned to deliver capital efficient long term organic growth through increased adoption of our innovative completions equipment and services our capital light business model provides us with the ability to generate free cash flow while maintaining a strong balance sheet this provides us with the optionality to allocate capital to high return investments and evaluate options for the return of capital to shareholders over time and with that we d be happy to take your questions questions answers operator your first question comes from the line with george o leary with tph company george o leary tph and company analyst at the decent bit of investors at least a lot of the questions we get are just around the cadence of u s completions versus u s drilling activity and you provided some color on that during the call i wonder if you could just expand on that a little bit and just maybe discuss what you re seeing on a leading edge basis or what you saw in april in both of those buckets completions and well construction versus what you saw in march and then maybe versus what you saw in january and february just so we can get a sense for the progression of activity through the year thus far robert nipper chief executive officer yes generally we saw a pretty slow start to the year most of the products that we have in the u s the product lines we have pretty low market shares in outside of just some of the well construction products so we think about the completions around fracturing systems so our sliding sleeves systems a lot of our customers in the u s are smaller independents who operate out of cash flow and we saw a later start to the year for those customers which affected the sales for our frac sleeves we expect that that activity based on what we ve seen so far in the quarter we expect that activity is going to continue to increase into the second quarter and into the latter half of the year now overall i wouldn t say that i believe that we re going to see a big change in activity or this big recovery in the second half of the year but when we look at some of the customers that we have in our customer base we believe that those customers will have increased activity but generally i don t really see a lot of increase in activity our plug sales were very robust in the quarter we continue to see higher performance in that product line but that s really driven primarily by market share gains because again we re a new entrant into that business being fully commercialized only just over a year now i think we re in our fifth quarter of commercialization or into our sixth quarter now so that s mostly driven by market share gains and then wellbore construction that s driven primarily or the largest revenue generator is our airlock product line and we see what s driving that market or the increases in that market is primarily more adoption so there s a lower percentage of the wells that are using some type of casing buoyancy system today however we do see the adoption rate of that type of technology is increasing and so that s helped to drive that performance as well but again generally in terms of market conditions we see no real green shoots for a big recovery in the second half of the year we remain hopeful that could change but right now we re not counting on that but we re i think we re in pretty position because of the low market shares that we can continue to perform throughout the year and just you didn t ask about that but internationally one of the things that we see is increasing activity i think i mentioned earlier that we had some things slip in china and argentina into the second quarter and the third quarter however in the fourth quarter or in the second half of the year our european activity in the north sea is increasing and we expect to see something of the magnitude of 2 5 times to 3 times increase in the second half of the year versus the first half year internationally george o leary tph and company analyst and that s very helpful color and then maybe just tacking on in a slightly different topic although i guess it is related to the north sea just on the offshore side it does seem like we re in the nascent stages of an offshore recovery wondered if you could just talk generally about shots on goal or bidding opportunities that you re seeing out there in the market and if there might be anything outside of the north sea that s caught you all s attention or where folks are trying to rope you into prospects there robert nipper chief executive officer right well as you know right now primarily our offshore effort is in the north sea we were awarded the contract last year there it was a multiyear contract it s activity that s ramping over time we expect to see the majority of the activity in 2020 and 2021 however there is work ongoing now the project that we re on started it started earlier we had shipments in last year for work that s being performed this year that went in the country we ll have more shipments later in the year but the project did get delayed a bit there were some issues with fracturing fluid that the customer had to work through those have been resolved so that the project is moving ahead again when we think about opportunities outside of the north sea we re looking at potential activity in the gulf of mexico but that s a longer term play that s something that we haven t identified as a for sure thing for us yet however some of the work that we re doing in alaska now is similar work to what we would see in the gulf of mexico so we continue to evaluate that but primarily we ll see this contract we have with aker bp in the north sea but there is interest from a number of other parties in the north sea for work that would be in the out years george o leary tph and company analyst great that s super helpful color sneak in one more if i could i realize you guys had some payments around the repeat precision joint venture early this year and that will stay could you just talk about the outlook for cash flow from operations and free cash flow as we progress forward given that s also another hotbed topic with investors today ryan hummer chief financial officer sure george this is ryan well i think we still feel comfortable in our ability to generate free cash flow on the year part of that has to do with the fact that our ebitda and really our adjusted ebitda translates pretty cleanly to cash in the year where we have very nominal interest expense and expect limited cash tax payments we had a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter which is normal for us given the q1 activity in canada it s primarily receivables growth we expect that will release on a net basis over the course of the rest of the year typically we ll see some working capital release in q2 it will build again a bit in q3 and then release in q4 i d also say that we can expect a moderation in the level of capex as we move through the year we had close to 3 million in the first quarter we ve got a range of 8 million to 12 million with i think some opportunities to move that lower so any of the gains of capital spending reduces during the year as well operator your next question comes from the line of ian macpherson with simmons ian macpherson simmons energy analyst it s too early to tell for sure but so far it looks like there s just not a lot of capex elasticity the oil prices here but i sort of inferred from your opening comments that you thought that might be a little bit different in canada can you expand on that robert nipper chief executive officer yes i mean just what i said more around costs are pretty low in canada compared to where they have been in prior years cost are low the bidding wars are just crazy up there in terms of the frac fleets and the pricing our customers are seeing so cash flow and with some of the exchange rates and some of the other issues that our customers are seeing with oil prices kind of stabilized the differentials closing up what we re seeing is that their cash flows are a bit better than they projected so it s we re fairly optimistic that budgets could actually increase a bit from what the original budget levels were the recent conversations that we re having with customers up there ian macpherson simmons energy analyst ok it s hard to benchmark your canadian revenue seasonality because it hasn t really been stable for the past few years obviously last year was significantly front half loaded but in the past couple of years 55 to 65 of your full year canada revs have been in the second half do you think that that would be 55 plus would be a reasonable starting point for us to think about your second half weighting for canada ryan hummer chief financial officer yes we do think that the second half will be more heavily weighted than the first half ian macpherson simmons energy analyst ok and then so how material is eor today to your business i d imagine it s quite small and early but maybe you could talk about if you don t mind what you think the opportunity is there going forward and the materiality of the eor market relative to new well construction for your suite of products ryan hummer chief financial officer so the canadian market is a lot more advanced i d say in eor than the u s market just because we ve been producing longer as an industry we ve been using water flood longer and so there s a bit of history there and customers have had success with eor i mean there is a number of canadian operators who talk about increasing ultimate recoveries by large percentages through water flooding activities and so we ve watched that over time we participated in that market with our multi cycle sleeves our customers have been using multi cycle sleeves in the past and for the past few years they would run multi cycle so that they d have the option of being able to without compartmentalizing the wellbore with additional products and services and additional equipment in the well they could use the multi cycle sleeves to close off areas that they thought that needed to be injected into because there was breakthrough and they weren t effectively sweeping through those areas the problem that we ve seen with that though is that it s very difficult number one to determine which areas of the wellbore we need to stop injecting in and we need to increase injection at so the two products that i mentioned earlier the more economical product basically it s a sliding sleeve that gives the customer the ability to produce through it frac through it but also to be able to put it into a position where there s a metered flow that goes through the sleeve so gas or water can be injected down the well and create backpressure across every sleeve that s open in this particular position so that they can effectively control how the fluid goes through the entry points but not necessarily control which entry point to go that fluid goes into without physically going into the wellbore with an intervention and completely closing sleeves or completely opening sleeves up so the qumulus system that i mentioned earlier what that does is it gives the customer the ability to be able to understand temperature and pressure in every compartment that we place in the wellbore so just as an example let s say we put five compartments in a one mile lateral so there are five different places in the wellbore that injection can be controlled through and so what customers are doing with the technology so we have the one installation that has been installed for about a one and a half month to two months now and operationally it was a total success the system worked as designed what the customer has is the ability to see pressure and temperature at each one of those compartments so what they ve done is they ve closed all the compartments in the wellbore and then compartment by compartment they re going in and injecting into the well and based on injection pressure based on the amount of fluid that s going into the well and then they stop injecting and monitor the pressure and the temperature at that compartment as well as the adjacent compartments and what they re able to determine is which compartments they should be injecting into and which ones they shouldn t inject into and that changes over time as they inject into these wellbores into the reservoirs there s what we call short circuits in the reservoir where there s a breakthrough of fluid and this path is created or the water the injected water just moves through this path and it doesn t move any oil in front of it it s moved all it s going to move so that compartment needs to be closed and we inject into other compartments and effectively change the injection regime and so by having the ability to do this the customer in real time sitting at their desk can manipulate these valves and understand how best to inject and so what one of the things that we re doing is using artificial intelligence to learn from the injection at wells as well as the production wells how different types of injection regimes affect the production and so over time we believe that we may be able to come up with an automated way that the wellbore or the computer can control the well in near real time so how big is the opportunity well there s a large percentage of our customers in canada today that are using water flood for secondary recovery and they re looking for ways to improve that because right now it s basically just inject down the wellbore they can put some compartments in the well but it s expensive to do and there s not a lot of control it s just one extra level the products that we talked about are products that allow the customer to have a lot more control which they believe can help extend the life of the secondary recovery effort that they re doing and as we look at what s going on in the u s in the unconventionals and in the conventionals as well we re seeing the same types of things that we saw a few years ago so in the u s we have some customers that are running multi cycle sleeves and second recovery so that they can do what the canadian market was doing a few years ago open and close the sleeves and redirect the injection effort so we believe that over time that this will grow as customers as part of their being able to maintain production over time part of that is going to be heavily dependent on how well they re able to execute on secondary recovery and tertiary recovery operator your next question comes from the line of with raymond james unknown speaker i guess to the same point on the r d side you guys have obviously introduced a lot of products can you talk about how you think of it moving forward in terms of as you re developing new products do you think the does the r d go more toward new products or does it go more toward improving existing products how do you think about how it goes how it moves going forward robert nipper chief executive officer so it s both as you would imagine we have a group in engineering now that that s all product performance and 100 of what they work on is just improvements to existing products whether that be fracturing services or composite plugs or whatever the product line is one of the things that and we think about the balance of investing for longer term products versus got to have today kind of products what we look at and think about in the near term development that we re doing is we re almost focused 100 around efficiency from a time saving standpoint so working on developing products that help our customers save time and dollars on the location where at the end of that installation of whatever product or service it is that the customers can see all right this is how much money i save versus something with a longer term play and we ve been focused on that for quite some time as we look down the road we think it s important that we are investing in some longer term products like the two eor systems i discussed earlier those are products that we started developing almost two years ago and so now they re just now turning into revenue generators and we ve got two more of the qumulus systems sold that are scheduled for installation so we see that that is not going to be something that affects the revenue in 2019 significantly but in the out years we see that as being very important that we have those types of products but it s just the balance of the shorter term projects and the longer term projects as we think about sg a spend and r d spend we just have to think about the balance of and the investment that we re making and how that return is coming back to us unknown speaker right i guess that we can fall on just the rollout so when we even i guess maybe taking the eor as a proxy how do you think about introducing that and then getting that to kind of good run rate in terms of rollouts and in commercialization and should we think of it as a canadian rollout initially and then followed by u s further adoption or how do we think about that actually becoming a material part of the business robert nipper chief executive officer yes i think we have to think about it as a canadian rollout just because the canadian market is so far ahead of the u s market in terms of secondary recovery in the unconventionals we see areas of the permian where there is starting to be a focus so we think that that would probably be the first areas in the u s that we move into but it s certainly there s a few years gap between where the canadian market is in terms of secondary recovery in the u s market unknown speaker ok that s helpful j b lowe citi analyst in your prepared remarks you kind of mentioned your factory assembled plug in setting system i was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more what are the benefits of that system is it beyond just the safety that it provides is there a cost or pricing benefit you guys what s kind of the value proposition to the customer robert nipper chief executive officer yes it s a cost savings primarily for the customer through efficiency and in real dollars so the cost for the customer to use what we call the purple seal express which is the it s basically a bridge plug the device that connects the bridge plug to the setting tool and a setting tool that s assembled in the factory environment it s not put together on location in the middle of the night by somebody who s just got is doing stage after stage after stage and so the cost for the customer to do that versus what they were doing which is a composite plug on a electric setting tool for wire line that s rerun over and over and redressed with some frequency the cost is about the same if not a little bit cheaper to be able to buy the purple seal express and just toss away the setting tool and the adapter kit but the real savings for customer is the efficiency and the reliability around the setting tool itself so what our customers have been telling us and the whole reason that this product is done so well in the market is because there s a high percentage of time where there are failures with the setting tool because they were improperly redressed they weren t redressed or they weren t properly applied and run in the wellbore and so one of the things that we can do is it s a brand new setting tool it s dressed in the factory environment so we know it s dressed properly so the failure rate has been almost nothing on these disposable setting tools so that means real dollars for the customers and so our customer the uptake for the customers is pretty high right now these setting tools have been run for probably about one and a half years on a stand alone basis where they would the setting tool is thrown away but it s not delivered to the location with a plug installed on it so the customers have become accustomed to these disposable setting tools but what we ve been able to do with the purple seal express is be able to have the setting tool already preassembled onto the plug and that whole unit delivered to the location so that removes an operation on location which is a serviceman having to install the plug on a setting tool so it removes the cost of that serviceman to do that and it also takes some of the risk out of having the proper maintenance and qa qc done to the tool so that s we believe that that is why that tool is being successful and it s used and that combination of a low percentage of wells today but we see that continuing to grow on a quarter to quarter basis j b lowe citi analyst yes i was wondering if you could just put kind of a magnitude around the market opportunity and there s a these are competing offering in the marketplace you guys are you guys doing this alone just maybe some kind of qualitative market analysis and that would be helpful robert nipper chief executive officer well depending on which analyst you talk to and look at the work that they ve done there s somewhere around 700 000 frac stages that are done in the u s on an annual basis so just say it s 500 000 that s what the total opportunity is and today we re the only company that is providing a complete assembled unit with the frac plug and the setting tool all assembled and delivered to location so we re the only one doing that and it s done on a very small percentage of the well so the opportunity is quite large j b lowe citi analyst all right excellent robert nipper chief executive officer thank you operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to robert nipper chief executive officer for closing remarks robert nipper chief executive officer thank you operator on behalf of the entire management team and our board we d like to thank everyone that joined us on the call today including our shareholders employees and the research analysts who cover ncs i d like to personally thank our 400 plus employees around the globe whose effort allow us to achieve amazing results i continue to believe that we have the best team in the industry and we re committed to preserving the culture of the employee development and innovation that has supported us from the beginning we appreciate everyone s interest in ncs multistage and we look forward to talking again on our next quarterly earnings call in august ryan hummer chief financial officer thank you operator operator duration 46 minutes call participants ryan hummer chief financial officer

this release should be read with the company s financial statements and management discussion analysis md a available at www tasekomines com and filed on www sedar com except where otherwise noted all currency amounts are stated in canadian dollars taseko s 75 owned gibraltar mine is located north of the city of williams lake in south central british columbia production volumes stated in this release are on a 100 basis unless otherwise indicated vancouver may 8 2019 prnewswire taseko mines limited tsx tko nyse american tgb taseko or the company reports the results for the three months ended march 31 2019 first quarter ebitda was 16 7 million and adjusted ebitda of 10 2 million the company reported earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization of 15 7 million and a net loss of 7 9 million or 0 03 per share russell hallbauer president and ceo of taseko commented with a grade profile similar to 2018 copper and molybdenum production are expected to increase through 2019 and our previously stated guidance remains unchanged at 130 million lbs 5 copper production in the first quarter was 25 million pounds similar to the first quarter 2018 gibraltar mine sequencing on a quarterly basis creates some grade variability but year over year production will be much more consistent site operating costs of us 1 91 lb and site operating cost per ton milled of 10 88 remain within our expectations and should decline as production increases continued mr hallbauer mr hallbauer added metal recoveries for both copper and molybdenum were excellent considering the lower copper head grade molybdenum production was up nearly 70 from the first quarter 2018 to 738 000 pounds with moly prices stable at approximately us 12 per pound we recorded a by product credit of us 0 32 per pound the highest in a number of years as was experienced throughout western canada in the quarter severe winter weather affected all aspects of our gibraltar operation from shovel availabilities through to waste stripping and ore release this in combination with harder ore in the current granite pit pushback reduced average mill throughput to 76 000 tons per day which affected both copper and molybdenum production those issues are now behind us and we are back to normal throughput with increasing head grade we made great progress at our florence copper project wellfield operations commenced late last year and after approximately three months of initial leaching the copper leach solution was introduced to the sx ew plant by the middle of april the plant was producing high quality copper cathode which was assayed at 99 9 copper while we have always been confident with the process it is fair to say that our expectations were surpassed in producing such high quality copper so quickly after wellfield start up added mr hallbauer non gaap performance measure see end of news release going forward the company will be focusing on three key areas the amendment to the operating permits for commercial operation optimization of the leach process and completion of a financing package for the commercial facility build out a number of years ago the decision was made to include a test phase to the project development plan the permits that are currently in place only need to be amended for commercial scale up the advantage of operating the test facility is to have real operational data to provide to the state and federal regulators this data is proof of performance and reliability as opposed to theoretical predictions and is constantly shared with regulators this data will support a seamless and expedited amendment process which will be commencing in the coming weeks the success we are having with both the quantity and quality of cathode being produced is a major step in de risking the project and creating many different financing opportunities for taseko the interest to participate in the future of one of the lowest cost copper producers in the world cannot be understated the economics of the project are very compelling for all types of finance providers and we believe we can successfully arrange an attractive financing package concluded mr hallbauer first quarter review first quarter earnings from mining operations before depletion and amortization were 15 7 million and adjusted ebitda was 10 2 million and adjusted ebitda was net loss

molybdenum production was 738 thousand pounds a 67 increase over the first quarter of 2018 due to strong operating performance in the molybdenum plant site operating costs net of by product credits were us 1 91 per pound produced and total operating costs c1 were us 2 21 per pound produced per pound produced and total operating costs c1 were per pound produced in april 2019 the company announced first copper production from the test facility at the florence copper project the first harvest resulted in 3 700 pounds of copper cathode which was assayed at higher than 99 9 copper the company

million pounds copper grade for the quarter averaged 0 216 which was in line with management expectations and the mine plan and approximately 15 below the life of mine average grade production was also affected by lower than planned mill throughput as a result of harder ore a total of 23 3 million tons were mined during the period which was below plan due an extended period of extremely cold weather and unplanned mechanical issues which impacted shovel availability the strip ratio for the first quarter was 3 2 to 1 and mill feed was supplemented with 1 2 million tons of ore drawn from the stockpile site operating cost per ton milled was 10 88 in the first quarter of 2019 in addition capitalized stripping costs totaled 8 0 million 75 basis or 1 57 per ton milled total site spending including capitalized stripping costs was 7 lower than the previous quarter however site operating costs per pound produced increased to us 2 23 from us 1 92 in the previous quarter as a smaller portion of costs were allocated to capitalized stripping in the current period molybdenum production was 738 thousand pounds in the first quarter a result of continued strong molybdenum plant operating performance by product credits per pound of copper produced increased to us 0 32 in the first quarter from us 0 30 in the previous quarter off property costs per pound produced were us 0 30 for the first quarter of 2019 off property costs consist of concentrate treatment refining and transportation costs and these costs are in line with recent quarters non gaap performance measure see end of news release gibraltar outlook gibraltar is expected to produce approximately 130 million pounds 5 on a 100 basis in 2019 comparable to the production level achieved in 2018 while there will be quarterly fluctuations in both copper and molybdenum production the company does not anticipate those fluctuations to be as significant as in 2018 the fundamentals for copper remain strong and most industry analysts are projecting a growing deficit and higher copper prices in the coming years review of projects taseko s strategy has been to grow the company by leveraging cash flow from the gibraltar mine to assemble and develop a pipeline of projects we continue to believe this will generate long term returns for shareholders our development projects are located in british columbia and arizona and represent a diverse range of metals including gold copper molybdenum and niobium our current focus is on the development of the florence copper project florence copper wellfield operations at the production test facility ptf commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 during the first quarter of 2019 concentrations of copper in the leach solution increased to levels which allowed the sx ew plant to begin operation and on april 12th the company announced that the sx ew plant was producing first copper the initial leaching period has taken approximately three months which was in line with expectations the proportion of ore contacted underground with leach solution known as sweep efficiency has been encouraging to date the company s modelling predicted a 55 sweep efficiency after the first year of leaching and that level was achieved after the first three months non gaap performance measure see end of news release the main focus of the ptf phase is to demonstrate to regulators and key stakeholders that hydraulic control of underground leach solutions can be maintained and provide valuable data to validate the company s leach model as well as optimize well designs and performance and hydraulic control parameters successful operation of the in situ leaching process will allow permits to be amended for the full scale commercial operation which is expected to produce 85 million pounds of copper cathode annually for 20 years the permit amendment process has started and it is anticipated that construction of the commercial scale operation could be commenced in the first half of 2020 the estimated capital cost of the commercial scale operation is us 204 million and the company has begun initial discussions to advance project financing options from a variety of sources including debt providers royalty companies and potential joint venture partners management is encouraged by the expressions of interest from all potential sources to date and is targeting to have committed funding in place before the end of the year total expenditures at the florence project in the first quarter of 2019 were 3 3 million which includes ptf operation and other project development costs yellowhead copper on december 4 2018 the company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of yellowhead mining inc yellowhead that it did not already own in exchange for 17 3 million taseko common shares the transaction was structured as a plan of arrangement pursuant to the business corporations act british columbia and required the approval of the supreme court of british columbia and yellowhead shareholders all approvals were received and the transaction closed on february 15 2019 yellowhead holds a 100 interest in a copper gold silver development project located in south central british columbia the project feasibility study dated july 31 2014 proposed a 70 000 tonne per day concentrator with total pre production capital costs of approximately 1 billion and an average operating cost of us 1 46 per pound of copper using us 3 00 per pound of copper a canadian us dollar exchange rate of 0 80 an 8 discount rate and other assumptions from the 2014 feasibility study results in a pre tax net present value of 1 1 billion since the closing of the acquisition taseko has restarted the environmental review process for the

performance and is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry many of which present ebitda when reporting their results issuers of high yield securities also present ebitda because investors analysts and rating agencies consider it useful in measuring the ability of those issuers to meet debt service obligations the company believes ebitda is an appropriate supplemental measure of debt service capacity because cash expenditures on interest are by definition available to pay interest and tax expense is inversely correlated to interest expense because tax expense goes down as deductible interest expense goes up depreciation is a non cash charge adjusted ebitda is presented as a further

by tom luongo it s getting tiresome watching donald trump s bipolar presidency it seems he can t let a day go by without making some massive announcement to raise tariffs threaten sanctions or overthrow a government every 24 hours is another exercise in chasing the trump reality show around every lull in the perpetual news cycle has to be seized upon to create more chaos so he can validate his insanity trump has so many plates spinning there s no way he s actually thinking anything through take the latest fiasco chinese trade talks one day talks are going well the next we re raising tariffs to 25 that s where we are today because trump thinks he s winning the trade war and china won t give him what he wants so he ll disrupt global trade until he does it doesn t matter how many times he s told tariffs don t work the costs are not paid by the exporter they are paid by the consumer tariffs don t shift manufacturing of the goods imported onshore they are supplied by other countries or substituted for lesser goods the consumer pays higher prices for end user goods the domestic members of the supply chain pay higher input prices while sclerotic domestic producers are subsidized to stay non competitive warfare is welfare the problems with threatening these tariffs are myriad but the main ones are trump is an economic ignoramus who only likes to look at one side of the trade ledger his advisors are all paranoid neoconservatives who can only see the world in terms of power because these advisors are who they are they all push trump to his worst decisions by feeding him exactly what he wants to hear it doesn t matter if it s intelligence about the potential for a venezuelan coup or the efficacy of sanctioning everyone who buys a drop of iranian oil trump likes punishing people he thinks have wronged him the national security council played a key role in driving the argument to end the waiver program especially richard goldberg a new member of the trump administration and a longtime advocate for confronting iran according to the two sources he was instrumental one of the sources said national security adviser john bolton added goldberg to the nsc in january previously goldberg was an adviser at the foundation for defense of democracies fdd think tank headed by mark dubowitz a leading advocate for tougher handling of iran since the united states first round of sanctions against the country under former president barack obama in 2012 goldberg was an aide to then senator mark kirk a republican and delivered a blow to tehran by writing legislation that closed iran s last legal loophole in selling oil under the obama sanctions that legislation targeted the belgium based swift financial messaging system over which iran was conducting billions of dollars in oil trade bolton was in charge of the failed venezuela operation and is the architect of both the iran sanctions plan as well as scuttling peace talks with north korea do you really think he s not involved in telling trump to up the pressure on china by giving them an ultimatum to deal or see tariffs raised to 25 this the same day that bolton announces moving an aircraft carrier group to the persian gulf as a message to iran never forget that all of this can be avoided by trump having one shred of courage to stop this welfare for the merchants of death dollars locked and loaded that the impetus to weaponize the u s dollar through trade and hybrid warfare comes from this corner of trump s administration is not news neither is trump s impulsiveness cravenness and inability to think systemically what is news however is that trump thinks he has the leverage here because the s p 500 is flirting with a new all time high as i said above trump is an economic ignoramus he refuses to see the opposite side of the trade ledger we export trillions in debt which fuels our trade deficit with china and receive goods in return those funds created out of thin air aren t used for domestic investment they simply goose gdp gross national spending as that money flows through the economy tariffs won t solve this trump lowered corporate tax rates to 20 a good thing certainly and is trying to cut through regulatory red tape also a good thing but it isn t enough if he doesn t cut government spending at the same time what s never admitted by mainstream economists is that gdp can fall and economic value created by the economy can rise boosting gdp with fake spending fueled by new debt at artificially low rates isn t wealth creation in fact it is ultimately capital destructive it is malinvestment that shows up everywhere as ghost cities empty malls crumbling infrastructure and cultural malaise which leads to political degradation this is why trump is a coward he doesn t have the courage to confront this he just blames everyone else for not paying their fair share he s focused the anger and frustration of americans impoverished by these policies on everyone else there is no issue that gets people more angry with me among trump supporters ripping him on tariffs it s insane how deeply this idea is embedded it s economic warfare in which the bombs go up and come straight back down we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us a courageous president however would level with the american people and say we ve spent beyond our means we in washington with our insane policies have destroyed your communities government can t solve these problems only you can we ve cut taxes and and now we re cutting spending and i will veto any budget that doesn t do so the best way to improve the american economy is to get real and put the money back into your hands government doesn t produce wealth at best it shuffles it around you produce wealth it will be tough but i have faith in you the american people stephen miller will never write that speech that s the fight he won t have instead he does what every other crackpot politician has ever done guns and butter and then sells that as a trade war with china no one is ever to blame for their economic messes blame the other guy blame the corporations blame everyone except the people who actually did it and compound the problem by taking it out on the rest of the world trump s market problem he thinks the stock market is the weather vane of his presidency and that when it s rising he can make outrageous demands and when it s falling he has to tack against it it s why everything is so bipolar and we re being pushed every day in a different direction a quick look at the dow jones industrials on a weekly basis since trump embarked on his trade and tariff war should give you an idea of how much volatility has increased in case the picture itself is unclear the numbers are since hitting a peak in january 2017 volatility as measured by the difference in closing prices week to week and the range of each week has more than doubled for move of the second half of 2018 we saw got used to three sigma or grater movements in the dow this is the real effect of political and policy uncertainty and if trump s goal is a rising stock market someone should show him this chart 2017 is what you want don not 2018 because for all intents and purposes it hasn t gone anywhere in over a year not that i think trump is the only reason for this volatility but his pressure on dollar liquidity and his consistent scaring capital markets with shutting down trade isn t helping anything the fed is helping this along no doubt he helped break the eurodollar system last year with his overnight tariffs on aluminum and his pullout from the jcpoa the u s share market is rising precisely because he has embarked on a mad policy of weaponizing the dollar he thinks there is no possible way anyone can get out of using the dollar and therefore this won t hurt him or the u s in the long run in the short run he s right dollar liquidity is causing massive capital flight into u s assets but it isn t coming here necessarily as long term investment tariffs have consequences the problem is he forgets that he s the one subject to an election while china s leadership is not everything china has done politically under xi jinping has been to safeguard the chinese state in the event of a crisis back here we have one major party half of the president s party his own staff and the permanent bureaucracy actively plotting a coup against him oh and there s an election in eighteen months but his advisers keep telling him china is a paper tiger squeeze them and they will capitulate but it hasn t happened yet and it won t china s not going to implode over these tariffs it will give xi and his central bank the opportunity to devalue the yuan in response to the slower flow of dollars it has to protect the lion s share of its trade with southeast asia and europe whose currencies are already in trouble and it will bail out the most strategically sensitive banks and businesses over exposed to them it s what they did last year in response to the 10 tariff and it is what will happen this time so if trump doesn t want a stronger dollar he can t look to the fed to give it to him the structure of the offshore dollar markets is not under their control as always markets are bigger than central planners if global trade is the m0 of the world then restricting it at a time of maximal dollar based debt capacity is the stupidest thing you can do if your goal is a lower dollar and trade balance with china we don t need a lower dollar we need a dollar that buys more value at home and that can t happen with the fed and treasury pumping money in while choking us with the debt behind it but don t worry folks economic warfare man has a plan for that too

phase during the pre production and production ramp up period number of wind blade manufacturing lines that were being transitioned to a new wind blade model during the period as explained in our press release issued last week our first quarter results were disappointing due to a few extraordinary events which occurred during the quarter said steve lockard ceo of tpi composites despite the challenges we faced specifically the difficulties with senvion and the loss of production because of labor issues in matamoros our mature operations are performing at or above expectations and our core strategy remains intact and we remain focused on execution the fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to partner with our customers to support their global production needs we have invested heavily in new line startups and existing line transitions laying the groundwork for doubling the company s revenue over a three year period and beyond from our perspective the first quarter was a small setback in our longer term vision which continues to be supported by an increasingly improving global wind market outlook concurrent with our earnings release today we announced key management changes that will better position tpi going forward bill siwek our long time cfo has been promoted to president and bryan schumaker has been appointed cfo effective may 13 2019 brian joins us after having spent 11 years at first solar inc most recently as their chief accounting officer these changes are in addition to the appointment of ramesh gopalakrishnan as our coo wind last week we are excited about these changes and have confidence in each individual s ability to excel in their role and lead tpi through its next phase of growth the first quarter did not meet our expectations and as a result we have updated our guidance to reflect our current expectations for 2019 we now expect 2019 net sales to be between 1 45 billion and 1 5 billion and 2019 adjusted ebitda to be between 80 million and 85 million with the first quarter behind us we are focused on delivering solid performance for the remainder of 2019 we remain confident in our ability to execute against our plan to double revenue over a three year period concluded mr lockard first quarter 2019 financial results net sales for the quarter increased by 45 8 million or 18 0 to 299 8 million compared to 254 0 million in the same period in 2018 total billings increased by 55 8 million or 24 9 to 279 5 million for the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to 223 7 million in the same period in 2018 net sales of wind blades were 277 0 million for the quarter as compared to 234 2 million in the same period in 2018 the increase was primarily driven by a 15 increase in the number of wind blades produced and a higher average sales price due to the mix of wind blade models produced year over year these increases were partially offset by adjustments recorded in 2019 under asc 606 based upon changes in estimates of future revenue cost of sales and operating income as well as reductions of revenue based upon the insolvency of senvion and foreign currency fluctuations the impact of the fluctuating u s dollar against the euro in our turkey operations and the chinese renminbi in our china operations on consolidated net sales and total billings for the three months ended march 31 2019 was a net decrease of 3 3 and 3 5 respectively as compared to 2018 total cost of goods sold for the quarter was 301 2 million and included 16 1 million related to 13 lines in startup in our plants in mexico iowa and china the startup of new wind blade models for a customer in turkey and 2 1 million related to the five lines in transition during the quarter this compares to total cost of goods sold of 225 7 million for the same period in 2018 which included 14 7 million related to startup costs in our new plants in turkey and mexico a new customer in china and no transition costs cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased by nearly 12 percentage points during the three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 driven primarily by a significant increase in underutilized labor in matamoros mexico which contributed to higher startup costs than planned liquidated damages that we are required to pay for lost or delayed production in matamoros and an overall 3 4 million increase in startup and transition costs furthermore the extended startup of our newton iowa transportation facility and the acceleration of depreciation on property plant and equipment which was used to fulfill the senvion contract contributed to the overall increase these increased costs were partially offset by the impact of savings in raw material costs the impact of the fluctuating u s dollar against the euro turkish lira chinese renminbi and mexican peso decreased consolidated cost of goods sold by 6 4 for three months ended march 31 2019 as compared to 2018 our corporate overhead costs included within general and administrative expenses for the three months ended march 31 2019 totaled 8 0 million down from 11 2 million for the same period in 2018 the decrease in expenses was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and a reduction in the performance assumptions related to certain of our share based plans as a percentage of net sales corporate overhead costs were 2 7 for the three months ended march 31 2019 down from 4 4 in the same period in 2018 the 2 2 million of remaining general and administrative expenses during the three months ended march 31 2019 primarily related to the loss on the sale of certain receivables on a non recourse basis to financial institutions pursuant to supply chain financing agreements provided by certain of our customers the net loss for the quarter was 12 1 million as compared to net income of 8 6 million in the same period in 2018 the decrease was primarily due to the senvion related reductions to revenues and the acceleration of depreciation the impact of the matamoros labor strike and the increase in startup and transition costs partially offset by a tax benefit the loss per share for the quarter was 0 35 compared to diluted earnings per share of 0 24 for the 2018 period ebitda for the quarter decreased to a loss of 4 1 million compared to positive ebitda of 21 0 million

most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap are contained in our earnings release with that i ll turn the call over to our chief executive officer brian harris brian harris chief executive officer thank you michelle after quite a bit of market turbulence at the end of 2018 i m pleased to report that ladder had core earnings a non gaap measure of 46 9 million in the first quarter or 0 40 per share our annualized after tax core return on average equity was 11 6 during the quarter we made new investments totaling 910 million and our assets grew by 252 5 million in the quarter to 6 5 billion our conduit business featured higher profit margins on loans we securitized however securitization volumes at ladder and the overall market were muted during the quarter we contributed 169 7 million in mortgage loans into a transaction that produced a core gain of 6 2 million we also participated in a second transaction contributing 86 7 million in loans resulting in a core gain of 3 8 million but this gain will be reported in our second quarter results because the transaction settled in april in the first quarter we originated 175 3 million of loans held for securitization our balance sheet lending efforts produced newly originated loan totals for the quarter of 281 1 million and we received payoffs of 245 4 million on our last earnings call we highlighted our increased holdings of highly rated liquid securities acquired during the volatility that markets experienced toward the end of 2018 while we acquired 468 3 million of these securities in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continued our acquisition spree by adding an additional 432 9 million in the first quarter and 193 million in the first five weeks of the second quarter while demand for new mortgage loans has been relatively soft the resulting lack of new supply of securities coupled with a newly dovish federal reserve bank have caused credit spreads to tighten driving prices higher so we are pleased with the timing of our shift in preference for investing in securities in our real estate portfolio we actively managed three assets that i ll highlight here and marc can focus on the accounting details for these assets later on during the quarter and after some cost overruns and construction delays we decided to derisk our equity investment in a new york city residential and retail condominium development we negotiated with the construction lender and our equity partner to take over the construction loan fund a mezzanine loan and convert our equity investment into a preferred position reducing our last dollar exposure by 13 million we took these steps because we felt that the risk reward relationship favored this structure where all of our exposure is senior in timing and priority of payment in all respects after modifying the capital stack in february with construction substantially completed unit sales commenced and we ve already been paid down by 10 8 million the second asset i d like to mention is a hotel in omaha nebraska in may of 2018 we made a 17 75 million loan on a 180 room full service holiday inn shortly after we executed this cash in refinance we noticed some friction among the partners in the ownership structure following the sudden death of one of the partners in an automobile accident a default followed and we moved quickly to replace management and foreclose on the asset we took title to the property very quickly and are currently developing our business plan for managing and owning this hotel we are also pursuing a 4 5 million payment guarantee that runs joint and several to the partners in the previous ownership we do not expect to report a loss on this asset and we believe that the troubles we witnessed had more to do with poor management than low valuation we ll update you on our longer term plans for this asset on our next call the last asset i ll report on for the quarter involves our sale of a new jersey suburban office building that we purchased four years ago for 9 7 million the sale resulted in a core gain of 540 000 which will be reported in our second quarter results because the sale closed in may we were able to negotiate a lease termination payment with the lone tenant in the building and with these funds in hand we paid off our mortgage loan along with a 1 1 million prepayment penalty we then sold the vacant building to an end user resulting in the gain of 540 000 our annual irr over the four years we owned this property was 19 per year before i turn you over to marc i ll briefly touch upon our view of general market conditions and how we plan to navigate them going forward while recent headlines include the lowest unemployment rate in the u s in 50 years low inflation a patient fed in no hurry to raise interest rates record stock market levels low interest rates and a three plus percent gdp in the first quarter we still remain somewhat cautious in late cycle management of our investments in commercial real estate we see a world of have and have nots in retail stores with a large amount of store closures to start the new year we think industrial properties and apartments are doing well while student housing and self storage seem somewhat overbuilt we believe hotel cash flows are stable but have peaked for this cycle we are somewhat wary of rising gasoline prices since the beginning of the year as we enter the summer driving season while stock markets are up quite a bit much of the year to date gains are the result of multiple expansion rather than higher earnings while we see large percentage moves in market value from some very large companies after they report earnings the so called earnings beats are oftentimes as a result of estimates being lowered too much after the market turmoil last december we have witnessed a v shaped recovery in many markets yet interest rates in the u s and elsewhere remain much lower than they were in the fall of 2018 many market participants believe rates remain low because the fed has reversed its hawkish tone now preaching patience we think this is only partially true what gives us pause is that interest rates are low while energy prices are rising and yet there is seemingly no inflation to speak of after 10 years of low interest rates despite a massive government deficit and then there is the flat and sometimes inverted yield curve and a very high reported gdp for the first quarter largely as a result of rising inventories in short we think that growth in the united states is a bit overstated we think things are fine but we don t think the economy is as strong as some of the headlines would indicate in lending markets competition is pretty strong and bridge loans on transitional properties are currently being financed at rates that are 100 basis points lower than they were just a year ago as stated earlier our preference lately has been to invest in a combination of conduit loans bridge loans and a great preference for acquiring safe and liquid securities that produce levered returns of almost 8 while we wait patiently for better investment opportunities to present themselves to sum things up we like the way our gain on sale business is performing and we like securities also we are more cautious lately around bridge loans and real estate but over all the economy seems to be doing well credit is stable and our businesses are generating enough returns to easily support our cash dividend with room to spare i ll now turn you over to marc fox marc fox chief financial officer thank you brian i will now review ladder capital s financial results for the quarter ended march 31 2019 in the first quarter of 2019 ladder generated core earnings of 46 9 million resulting in core eps of 0 40 per share and an after tax return on average equity of 11 6 this compares to core earnings of 63 8 million core eps of 0 55 per share and after tax roae of 16 3 for the quarter ended march 31 2018 a quarter during which sales of real estate contributed 18 4 million to core earnings during the first quarter of 2019 core earnings were primarily derived from net interest income generated by ladder s balance sheet loan and securities portfolios net rental income from our real estate portfolio and gains on the sale of securitized loans and securities investments over all in q1 net interest income and net rental income totaling 58 7 million was supplemented by 6 2 million of gains on the sale of loans and 2 million of core gains on sales of securities on a gaap basis ladder generated net income before taxes of 21 7 million in the quarter ended march 31 2019 compared to 71 7 million in q1 18 the year over year change was primarily the result of real estate sales gains last year and the unfavorable impact of declining interest rates during q1 19 on the value of interest rate hedges the largest gaap to core earnings adjustments in the first quarter related to non cash stock based compensation as well as the timing of the recognition of hedge results that coincide with the realization of gains and losses on the disposition of hedged assets at the end of the first quarter balance sheet loans totaled 3 3 billion and the conduit loan balance stood at 189 5 million reflecting the origination payoff and securitization activity detailed earlier finally during the first quarter ladder acquired 432 9 million in securities investments ladder s securities portfolio grew to 1 6 billion at the end of the quarter up 14 8 since the end of 2018 and up over 60 from only six months ago as previously mentioned during the first quarter there were three events that affected a number of income statement and balance sheet line items with only modest economic impacts with regard to the new york city condo development mentioned earlier we executed transactions in february to convert our equity interest into a more senior secured investment position and that result is reflected in an increase in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures line item on the balance sheet as a result of the transactions we converted a 35 million common equity interest into a 35 million priority preferred equity position in addition we refinanced the joint venture s mortgage debt with a 50 5 million first mortgage loan and funded a 6 5 million mezzanine loan going forward ladder will receive all distributions of available cash until all of its debt and preferred equity investments have been repaid after the operating partner receives a return of and on its investment ladder will receive 20 of any remaining cash distributions the net result places ladder in a first priority position for return of its invested capital with our jv partner responsible for all additional costs and equity risk no gain or loss was recorded on the recent hotel loan foreclosure we now own the hotel at a basis of 18 million or about 100 000 per key we have contracted with an experienced hotel manager to operate the property on the balance sheet the hotel is now a real estate asset replacing the mortgage loan asset on the income statement in future quarters if and when the amounts are material you should expect to see an income from operating properties line item that reflects the results of this hotel as brian also noted in january we received a 10 million lease termination payment from the sole tenant of an office building that we owned in new jersey on may 1 we sold the building at a price of 1 75 million the property was originally acquired for 9 7 million after writing off 400 000 in straight line rent receivable and paying a 1 1 million debt defeasance fee the transactions will contribute 540 000 to core earnings in the second quarter for gaap purposes only we will recognize the 10 million fee as rental income over only four months we have recorded a 1 35 million impairment charge in q1 and another in q2 while recognizing the defeasance charge in q1 also turning to the balance sheet and investment activity metrics as of march 31 2019 96 7 of our debt investments were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprise 77 5 of our total asset base total assets stood at 6 53 billion which is 4 higher than at the end of 2018 total unencumbered assets including cash were 2 billion at year end and unsecured debt outstanding stood at 1 2 billion reflecting an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio of 1 71 times at the end of the quarter 83 1 of the securities portfolio was comprised of securities rated aaa or backed by a u s government agency and the weighted average duration was 30 months which compares to 36 months a year prior the weighted average loan to value ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at march 31 2019 was approximately 68 4 there were no core impairment charges in the quarter the average mortgage loan interest rate on balance sheet loans originated during the first quarter reflected a weighted average spread of approximately 4 36 which is lower than the balance sheet loan origination spreads in prior quarters reflecting general market conditions the average interest rate on conduit loans originated in the first quarter was 5 42 on the financing side as of march 31 2019 ladder had 4 2 billion of adjusted debt outstanding and committed financing availability of 2 4 billion for additional investments adjusted leverage at 3 31 was 2 57 times up from 2 34 times at 12 31 18 reflecting the addition of investment assets during the quarter excluding securities the adjusted leverage ratio is less than 1 6 times at march 31st at march 31 2019 debt was comprised of 1 17 billion of unsecured bond debt outstanding maturing in 2021 22 and 25 739 5 million of long term non recourse mortgage debt financing on our real estate holdings and 497 3 million of non recourse clo debt when combined with the 1 64 billion of permanent equity and 148 9 million of other

dividends of 1 33 per share and 1 89 of core eps at this point it s time to open the line for questions and answers questions answers operator our first question is from tim hayes with b riley fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst hey good evening everyone and thanks for taking my questions brian this one just to start bridge loan originations were a bit lower than your usual run rate this quarter and how much would you say was due to market volatility and just lower or lighter transaction activity versus your broader caution there and your increased appetite to invest in cmbs and the conduit loan side brian harris chief executive officer sure i hope i can answer that understandably and i would just tell you that the lower loan volumes i think really reflect a couple of vectors that are leaning on our process we do see many loans that we like market conditions are seeing our competitors bid these loans at levels that we think are relatively unattractive and when i say relatively unattractive that s not to say we think they re going to lose money there on a relative value basis we ve been able to acquire aaa clo paper at yields that in our opinion would make those liquid safe investments with 50 subordination much more attractive rather than owning the whole loan at libor plus 300 so i think that we re originating less one because of our preference for a very similar surrogate to it while the yields are lower we think that the risks inherent in writing the whole loans don t justify moving off of the aaa category into the whole loan category in some of those asset classes you do see some of our rates on average lower so that would also be supportive of what i just said to you there and in general i think now i don t know if lower loan demand to start the year is really a hangover from 2018 s turbulence at the end of the year or whether or not it s just burnout with all the pull forward demand that took place over the last 10 years because interest rates have been so low for so long but whatever it is it s pretty clear to me that loan demand is not what it was a couple of years ago tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst ok so just kind of putting that all together do you see this kind of being a trend throughout the year where you re maybe originating less bridge whole loans and acquiring more of that either the clo paper or the aaas or just investment rated cmbs or sticking with the conduit business is that when we think about capital allocation should we expect kind of this pace of the bridge originations to persist through the year brian harris chief executive officer i don t know the answer to that and the reason i don t is because if you told me that i could continue buying aaa clo paper on acceptable collateral with 50 subordination at spreads of libor over 100 there was a deal today that printed at that level well over 100 and people were going to continue writing loans at libor plus 275 to 300 over on the competitive landscape then i would say yes i would be surprised a year from today if aaa two year clos are transacting at spreads with a 100 plus handle on libor tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst got it ok that s helpful appreciate the comments there and then did the december and january volatility have any impact on loan spreads i know you mentioned your spreads are down there i don t know if that s i would have thought maybe less competition as a result of that might actually help spreads and we see some of your competitors talk about spreads coming in but would you say the volatility have impact on either spreads or collateral type or loan structure in terms of what you re looking to originate today and then i know you highlighted the strong gain on sales on the conduit transactions it seems like volatility actually helped you there maybe this quarter would you expect that gain on sale to rationalize as spreads have tightened a bit brian harris chief executive officer yeah i would suspect it will get a little bit more back to the mean but i also think that part of the reason that some of the profit margins in the gain on sale business were so high is because of how quickly rates fell while a lot of loans were under application and typically falling rates would increase a lot of demand and that would create a lot of supply that would drive spreads wider that kind of falling rate environment that took place in december didn t do that so what happened was i think in december as you saw the stock market really take a heavy correction largely as a result of i would say a misstep by the fed and when that happened i think there were a lot of market participants on the investment side that kind of unloaded their fixed income investments or at least pared them back because they felt interest rates were going higher based on comments from the fed chairman and then when he reversed course and suddenly became patient i think that created an unusual amount of demand the exact opposite of what happened in december so i think that s one reason spreads are tightening at least on the securities side what s interesting on the bridge loan portfolio though is while clo spreads were widening in the secondary market where we were acquiring hundreds of millions of dollars of aaa securities that were pricing wider and wider the loan participants the lenders in the space were tightening as a result of competition which is a phenomenon that obviously cannot continue but i think there s frankly too much capital in the space and too little demand so i think that we ll just stick to our discipline and if that means we re going to continue to curtail our activity in the bridge loan space that s fine with us we won t force the issue we take what the market will give us and we allocate capital accordingly and if we can allocate capital into extraordinarily safe investments that are really being created by our competitors and generate a yield of 8 that might be a very good place to hide out until the market decides which way it s going to go and we re a little concerned about volatility no better proof than today in the markets and we don t think it s over and as we get into this election cycle we think that situations could continue to be because we ve got such massively polarized political parties that when one looks like they re going to win it may swing markets one way and if the momentum goes the other way the markets will swing the other way so we don t think it s a time to get overly aggressive we re very late in the cycle the economy is doing well and interest rates have been low for a very long time but i don t think it s time to start making calls that it s time to be aggressive keep in mind making loans today at a given spread is fine because we know where market spreads are what we worry about is getting paid back in two years or three years and we re a little afraid what that might look like so we probably are a little more cautious than some of our competitors on that tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst appreciate those comments and just one more from me the assets you highlighted this quarter are pretty different from each other in terms of asset type geographies and there seem to be some idiosyncratic issues but do you see any cautionary trends developing or just any areas of stress in your portfolio worth noting brian harris chief executive officer well i think we ve been mentioning that with libor having increased rather quickly over a couple year period of time when people were coming up on extensions the one category of loan if i can give a description the one category that we felt was a little problematic was anything that didn t have cash flow that needed an extension at a much higher rate because libor moved and this was going to require a large interest reserve and a new libor cap and actually of the assets we re talking about two of those in many ways occurred in that regard the condominium transaction that we were invested in on the equity side when it came time to ask the construction lender to extend his loan yes there was plenty of equity in the deal so he was happy to extend it but the rate was quite high as a result of having been a construction loan from ground up and we felt that as a lender if we could take over the construction loan which was now mostly complete there really wasn t very much risk in finishing it at that point we felt the economics were better so the versatility of our platform allowing us to move from the equity chair to the debt chair we think will pay benefits not so much benefits in we re going to make a lot of money but i think that the returns due to the delay and the cost overruns were really diluting our returns on the equity side and so as disciplined investors we wanted to move out of that and get into a safer place the hotel you re right a very idiosyncratic situation certainly not what we expected but we made a loan in june and we owned the hotel in february and when we made that loan in june the borrower came to the table with an equity check of 2 5 million to refinance the prior loan and wrote a recourse obligation joint and several to three parties for 4 5 million so that wouldn t indicate to us that there was any intent certainly to lose the property but sometimes when you ve got partnerships they get a little weird and then in this case one of the principals was killed and the last one was just a payoff of a triple net lease property which is sort of interesting because i think we take a little different take than a lot of reits because that was a net lease property it was an office building it was leased to a very healthy company there was a lot of time left on the lease but they clearly made it their intentions were to leave so they asked if because they were healthy and they wanted to close the books for the year they asked us if they could pay off a negotiated lease termination i think a lot of reits would have sat their and clipped the coupon for the remaining term and that was years and there was no problem at all but i think from our perspective looking down the road long term when that tenant left that was going to turn into a lease up story or else we would have been in a situation where that tenant would have had to sublease the property i think from our perspective we had a pretty good gain it wasn t a lot of dollars but it was a rather small investment and the transaction began to veer off course in that the tenant wasn t going to stay so we had an opportunity to print a gain and we took it tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst got it that s helpful thanks for your comments brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question is from jade rahmani with kbw please proceed jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks can you give your net exposure in the lower east side condo deal before and after the 10 8 million pay down you noted that took place after february brian harris chief executive officer jade if you don t mind i m going to have pamela go through those numbers because she actually handled that transaction jade rahmani kbw analyst ok pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate so jade we restructured the investment to reduce our last dollar exposure by 13 million from 105 million to 91 8 million and subsequent to that we ve been paid down and now our on the loan first our outstanding current exposure is 76 9 million as of today jade rahmani kbw analyst ok and what kind of all in inclusive of i guess the construction loan the mezzanine loan and your preferred equity position what kind of all in return are you expecting brian harris chief executive officer do you have the rates on here marc fox chief financial officer on the first mortgage loan which is 50 5 million we re getting libor plus 475 on the mezzanine loan which is 6 5 million we re getting a 12 fixed rate pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate and the preferred equity is it s really more like a kicker at this point we get a return of the principal and then we will get a split if there is a return over 13 our partner will get back their capital and a 13 return before there will be any profit split on that above our return of principal marc fox chief financial officer and we get 20 of that brian harris chief executive officer so i would use libor plus 475 for the 51 million 50 5 million 12 for the 6 5 million and i would use a 0 for the equity which will be a return of principal as opposed to return on principal jade rahmani kbw analyst ok anything on the watch list we are starting to see kind of these we call them one offs but they re now one offs with every mortgage reit that reports but we are seeing them pick up gradually nothing too alarming and it s pretty normal this late in the cycle but anything on the watch list that we should be on the lookout for pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate the answer is no jade i think we re actively getting in front of issues and restructuring i think we re just looking we balance the return with risk mitigation and we don t feel like there s anything coming we re actively looking at stuff and always thinking about how to maximize returns at large but we don t have anything on our watch list that we re currently concerned about brian harris chief executive officer and i indicated to you jade that we feel like credit is stable here it is that one column where things need extension where there is no cash flow that s a very expensive proposition so we re particularly monitoring things like that and i know we ve had a few of those recently that are not being reported here today because what we ve done in advance of them is said we re happy to extend the loan but you re going to have to pay down the loan for the extension fortunately most of our borrowers are well heeled enough that they can do that and they have been responding to those payments so we don t have any heavy negotiations going on or anything in the on deck circle presently pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate i think the safest thing to say is we re very comfortable at our basis on all the assets so that s what gives us a lot of comfort jade rahmani kbw analyst i think that the mortgage reits have said publicly that around 25 to maybe 35 of their originations are bridge to bridge kind of scenarios are you seeing a similar trend are you inclined to deny those turn down those term sheets when you see them how are you looking at that brian harris chief executive officer we look at assets for what assets are but i think we would generally have the impression that if we re going bridge to bridge the other lender could have extended and has decided not to so we re naturally cynical in those scenarios so i would say we re certainly not 25 to 35 of our production we do see a lot of those loans in fact we re a little surprised that we see borrowers seeking cash out refinances on bridge to bridge fundings and we are doubly cautious on those so we are seeing that but we re not apt to be chasing those in too many aggressive ways jade rahmani kbw analyst in terms of the decline in book value was that related to the stock compensation of 12 4 million which was outsize so i d appreciate it if you could give some color on that or did that relate to interest rate movements with respect to the cmbs portfolio marc fox chief financial officer yeah no it s really about the shares between the we had the stock dividend where we issued 1 2 million shares in the first quarter and we had another million and a half shares net on the equity compensation grant so that was 2 7 million shares about a 2 3 increase and that s what really just drove it jade rahmani kbw analyst and the comp grant related to what year on an annual basis what s reasonable to expect this is a multiyear level of issuance isn t it marc fox chief financial officer yeah i think the equity compensation grants i think that was in line with what you d expect in a year when we made 230 million and so 230 million was more than what we had expected so i think that that s about you should look at it in proportion jade rahmani kbw analyst ok brian harris chief executive officer we do have stock compensation for our higher earners in the company and so in periods where in years where we have high income that would naturally correspond to high compensation and that would require higher stock grants however you should note that those stock grants are handed over at higher stock prices and they don t vest for three years except if you ve got a retirement eligibility situation so it s in line with the way it s always worked around here i think that you re seeing this outsized item because of the outsized income of 2018 jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks regarding the 2q originations and repayments so far i just want to make sure i heard you correctly i think you said 193 5 million was that inclusive of bridge loans and conduit loans can you just clarify that and secondly what have you received in terms of repayments so far in the second quarter brian harris chief executive officer i don t have my second quarter notes handy here i don t know if pamela has it pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate we ve done about 100 million in the second quarter and i think we received to date and repayments slightly in excess of that at the moment but we re projecting right now i think we re projecting running the book at close to even jade rahmani kbw analyst ok brian harris chief executive officer the loan book pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate the loan book the balance sheet loan book jade rahmani kbw analyst right yeah brian harris chief executive officer and we anticipate the securities book will go higher i indicated to you 190 some odd million in the first five weeks and i assure you that number is higher today so we did see a slowdown in pay downs if you remember in the last quarter we had about 800 million in pay downs which was an absolute anomaly but it has largely reverted back to what we would expect which is about 240 million a quarter jade rahmani kbw analyst great thanks for taking the questions brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate thanks jade operator our next question is from steve delaney with jmp securities please proceed steve delaney jmp securities analyst good evening everyone thanks for taking the question brian last friday cma showed about 21 million of new cmbs issuance year to date you already knew that number but down 19 year over year rates are lower now than they were end of last year early this year just curious what your outlook is for the rest of this year and do you think we have a chance to get back to match 2018 at this point brian harris chief executive officer there s a lot of factors that go into the mortgage origination business primarily you get loans from two places refinance and acquisition steve delaney jmp securities analyst right brian harris chief executive officer acquisition i think will move around up and down depending on many factors including how comfortable foreigners feel investing in the united states the refinance pipeline i suspect is going to be muted and the reason why is because interest rates have been so low for so long and i just do not see rents going higher in anything but apartments and some industrial areas so typically a refinance will be driven by the opportunity to save money through a lower rate which i don t think can be done today and secondly as a result of trying to get more cash out of the asset because it s been leased and stabilized so i think that that s really where you could see some growth but i just don t lease ups are taking longer than they re supposed to as i said i think hotels we believe hotels are peaked already so i don t think we re getting back to where 2018 was however there s a couple of private equity firms that could easily change that with a few assets but if you take out the largest borrower in the cmbs business i guess it s blackstone the business is downsized it s slower and down 20 sounds pretty reasonable to me i don t anticipate rates if rates do go lower i don t think they will spark a refinance boom because i think if rates go lower it s going to be because of a reason that is not going to be very comfortable for steve delaney jmp securities analyst for activity yeah understand and your comments about kind of hitting it right with your first quarter and second quarter margins kind of bouncing below and above 4 very strong it sounds like that was a little bit pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate sorry i didn t mean to interrupt you steve delaney jmp securities analyst sorry pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate i think the lower volume is offset a little bit by higher margin across the board steve delaney jmp securities analyst ok great that s kind of where i was going and some of that may have been circumstantial with going from volatility to tightening etc but it sounds like you feel like they ve while the volume is lower the profitability of that business for you all is it sounds like it on a unit basis is as good as it s been in quite some time brian harris chief executive officer yeah and do i think that will continue we re not writing loans to make four point margins but if you make four points on 200 million last year you would have had to write 800 million worth of loans to make that amount of dollars so it is sort of a little bit circular i understand pamela s point there but we always look for relative value and i don t anticipate the conduit business will continue throwing off those kinds of returns even if volume does come back or get lower i think a combination of falling rates reasonably depleted fixed income coffers because they thought rates were going higher at the direction of the fed chairman and then coupled with rates falling and little supply coming if you take a look at the leveraged loan market and the high yield corporate market you ll see the same phenomenon credit spreads have simply tightened i think largely through a lack of supply steve delaney jmp securities analyst well thank you both for your comments brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks brian harris chief executive officer we d just like to thank everybody for joining us tonight and hearing us and all the supporters that invest in our company things are pretty comfortable here at ladder despite a little bit of a slowing business we have the tools to oscillate around various products and take the right steps to ensure the best returns so very comfortable with where we sit today and even into a

china may expand stimulus in response to potential us trade war tariff hike analysts say china may up the pace and size of its economic stimulus to cushion the impact on already sluggish consumption following the escalation of trade tensions analysts said the options include additional cuts in taxes and fees incentives for buying big ticket items like appliances and cars and a further lowering of interest rates to boost lending to the real economy particularly for small firms that will be hit hardest by increased trade tensions a further reduction in property sales restrictions in smaller cities as well as further measures to open up the economy to foreign investors could also be considered they said stronger than expected economic growth figures for the first quarter led to the chinese government downplaying the need for additional economic stimulus however a couple of explosive tweets from us president donald trump on sunday may force beijing to reconsider a scenario of no trade deal was the hypothesis condition when the government was designing the economic policy for this year said ding shuang chief greater china economist for standard chartered bank the government has had countermeasure plans now it is time for them to come in handy unexpectedly trump threatened to increase tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese imports from 10 per cent to 25 per cent as of friday and said he would consider imposing tariffs on the remaining us 325 billion in chinese imports which are currently not subjected to trade war tariffs trump complained that the ongoing trade talks were moving too slowly despite the fact that other senior us officials had intimated in recent weeks that a deal may be close the outburst left the future of trade talks up in the air a planned trip by chinese vice premier liu he china s chief trade negotiator to washington this week for what many hoped would be among the last rounds of trade talks is now uncertain the south china morning post reported that liu s trip may either cancelled or delayed but that no decision had yet been made a foreign ministry spokesperson said that china still planned to send a delegation but did not confirm details on the size or personnel involved becky liu head of standard chartered s macro strategy thinks it is likely that china will accelerate a stimulus plan that is already in the pipeline such as enacting targeted reserve cuts by the central bank designed to boost lending to small and medium sized firms in fact the people s bank of china cut the reserve requirement ratio the amount of cash banks need to hold in reserve for certain small banks on monday to 8 per cent from 11 5 per cent to help galvanise lending to small companies china still wants a trade deal very much said liu adding that tax cuts took effect only last month leaving policymakers room to tweak the plan after monitoring its initial progress china s premier li keqiang in march announced tax cuts worth 2 trillion yuan us 296 86 billion for this year including a reduction in manufacturers value added tax the government also reduced the contribution rate to the national pension fund that companies are required to make for each of their employees further reducing their costs the trade war has dampened business and consumer sentiment leading to lower investment and spending in addition an increasing number of manufacturers are moving their operations out of china both to avoid the us tariffs on chinese exports and higher operating costs at home at the same time china s economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate for three decades and private companies which account for 60 per cent of the country s gross domestic product gdp have struggled to access the funds they need to survive as a result of beijing s deleveraging campaign aimed at reducing debt and risky lending exports which contributed around 18 per cent of china s gdp last year remain relatively resilient despite us trade tariffs however some of the increase late in the year was due to front loading of us export contracts to avoid higher us tariffs which were due to go into effect at the beginning of the year weak consumption meanwhile remains a sore spot for beijing particularly in vehicle sales china s vehicles sales fell for the ninth straight month in march prompting the national development and reform commission ndrc the state planner to consider plans to relax controls over the issuance of new car licences in major cities to boost sales in addition the ndrc drafted a plan to increase subsidies for purchases of appliances and cars especially in rural areas though that plan has not yet been implemented analysts at nomura noted that the government s rhetoric regarding additional stimulus had cooled in recent weeks but that was before trump s tweets on sunday we believe a worsening of the trade conflict between the us and china will evoke another dovish turn by beijing especially on its monetary easing stance said nomura s analysts in a research note published on monday nomura said that export demand property sales in smaller cities and passenger car sales are still facing strong headwinds despite the current level of stimulus an escalation of trade tensions with the us would surely increase significantly the pressure on chinese exports and investment the note read source south china morning

in accordance with gaap are contained in our earnings release with that i ll turn the call over to our chief executive officer brian harris advertisement advertisement brian harris chief executive officer thank you michelle after quite a bit of market turbulence at the end of 2018 i m pleased to report that ladder had core earnings a non gaap measure of 46 9 million in the first quarter or 0 40 per share our annualized after tax core return on average equity was 11 6 during the quarter we made new investments totaling 910 million and our assets grew by 252 5 million in the quarter to 6 5 billion our conduit business featured higher profit margins on loans we securitized however securitization volumes at ladder and the overall market were muted during the quarter we contributed 169 7 million in mortgage loans into a transaction that produced a core gain of 6 2 million we also participated in a second transaction contributing 86 7 million in loans resulting in a core gain of 3 8 million but this gain will be reported in our second quarter results because the transaction settled in april in the first quarter we originated 175 3 million of loans held for securitization our balance sheet lending efforts produced newly originated loan totals for the quarter of 281 1 million and we received payoffs of 245 4 million on our last earnings call we highlighted our increased holdings of highly rated liquid securities acquired during the volatility that markets experienced toward the end of 2018 while we acquired 468 3 million of these securities in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continued our acquisition spree by adding an additional 432 9 million in the first quarter and 193 million in the first five weeks of the second quarter advertisement advertisement while demand for new mortgage loans has been relatively soft the resulting lack of new supply of securities coupled with a newly dovish federal reserve bank have caused credit spreads to tighten driving prices higher so we are pleased with the timing of our shift in preference for investing in securities in our real estate portfolio we actively managed three assets that i ll highlight here and marc can focus on the accounting details for these assets later on during the quarter and after some cost overruns and construction delays we decided to derisk our equity investment in a new york city residential and retail condominium development we negotiated with the construction lender and our equity partner to take over the construction loan fund a mezzanine loan and convert our equity investment into a preferred position reducing our last dollar exposure by 13 million we took these steps because we felt that the risk reward relationship favored this structure where all of our exposure is senior in timing and priority of payment in all respects after modifying the capital stack in february with construction substantially completed unit sales commenced and we ve already been paid down by 10 8 million the second asset i d like to mention is a hotel in omaha nebraska in may of 2018 we made a 17 75 million loan on a 180 room full service holiday inn shortly after we executed this cash in refinance we noticed some friction among the partners in the ownership structure following the sudden death of one of the partners in an automobile accident a default followed and we moved quickly to replace management and foreclose on the asset we took title to the property very quickly and are currently developing our business plan for managing and owning this hotel we are also pursuing a 4 5 million payment guarantee that runs joint and several to the partners in the previous ownership we do not expect to report a loss on this asset and we believe that the troubles we witnessed had more to do with poor management than low valuation we ll update you on our longer term plans for this asset on our next call the last asset i ll report on for the quarter involves our sale of a new jersey suburban office building that we purchased four years ago for 9 7 million advertisement advertisement the sale resulted in a core gain of 540 000 which will be reported in our second quarter results because the sale closed in may we were able to negotiate a lease termination payment with the lone tenant in the building and with these funds in hand we paid off our mortgage loan along with a 1 1 million prepayment penalty we then sold the vacant building to an end user resulting in the gain of 540 000 our annual irr over the four years we owned this property was 19 per year before i turn you over to marc i ll briefly touch upon our view of general market conditions and how we plan to navigate them going forward while recent headlines include the lowest unemployment rate in the u s in 50 years low inflation a patient fed in no hurry to raise interest rates record stock market levels low interest rates and a three plus percent gdp in the first quarter we still remain somewhat cautious in late cycle management of our investments in commercial real estate we see a world of have and have nots in retail stores with a large amount of store closures to start the new year we think industrial properties and apartments are doing well while student housing and self storage seem somewhat overbuilt we believe hotel cash flows are stable but have peaked for this cycle we are somewhat wary of rising gasoline prices since the beginning of the year as we enter the summer driving season while stock markets are up quite a bit much of the year to date gains are the result of multiple expansion rather than higher earnings while we see large percentage moves in market value from some very large companies after they report earnings the so called earnings beats are oftentimes as a result of estimates being lowered too much after the market turmoil last december we have witnessed a v shaped recovery in many markets yet interest rates in the u s and elsewhere remain much lower than they were in the fall of 2018 advertisement advertisement many market participants believe rates remain low because the fed has reversed its hawkish tone now preaching patience we think this is only partially true what gives us pause is that interest rates are low while energy prices are rising and yet there is seemingly no inflation to speak of after 10 years of low interest rates despite a massive government deficit and then there is the flat and sometimes inverted yield curve and a very high reported gdp for the first quarter largely as a result of rising inventories in short we think that growth in the united states is a bit overstated we think things are fine but we don t think the economy is as strong as some of the headlines would indicate in lending markets competition is pretty strong and bridge loans on transitional properties are currently being financed at rates that are 100 basis points lower than they were just a year ago as stated earlier our preference lately has been to invest in a combination of conduit loans bridge loans and a great preference for acquiring safe and liquid securities that produce levered returns of almost 8 while we wait patiently for better investment opportunities to present themselves to sum things up we like the way our gain on sale business is performing and we like securities also we are more cautious lately around bridge loans and real estate but over all the economy seems to be doing well credit is stable and our businesses are generating enough returns to easily support our cash dividend with room to spare i ll now turn you over to marc fox advertisement advertisement marc fox chief financial officer thank you brian i will now review ladder capital s financial results for the quarter ended march 31 2019 in the first quarter of 2019 ladder generated core earnings of 46 9 million resulting in core eps of 0 40 per share and an after tax return on average equity of 11 6 this compares to core earnings of 63 8 million core eps of 0 55 per share and after tax roae of 16 3 for the quarter ended march 31 2018 a quarter during which sales of real estate contributed 18 4 million to core earnings during the first quarter of 2019 core earnings were primarily derived from net interest income generated by ladder s balance sheet loan and securities portfolios net rental income from our real estate portfolio and gains on the sale of securitized loans and securities investments over all in q1 net interest income and net rental income totaling 58 7 million was supplemented by 6 2 million of gains on the sale of loans and 2 million of core gains on sales of securities on a gaap basis ladder generated net income before taxes of 21 7 million in the quarter ended march 31 2019 compared to 71 7 million in q1 18 the year over year change was primarily the result of real estate sales gains last year and the unfavorable impact of declining interest rates during q1 19 on the value of interest rate hedges the largest gaap to core earnings adjustments in the first quarter related to non cash stock based compensation as well as the timing of the recognition of hedge results that coincide with the realization of gains and losses on the disposition of hedged assets at the end of the first quarter balance sheet loans totaled 3 3 billion and the conduit loan balance stood at 189 5 million reflecting the origination payoff and securitization activity detailed earlier finally during the first quarter ladder acquired 432 9 million in securities investments ladder s securities portfolio grew to 1 6 billion at the end of the quarter up 14 8 since the end of 2018 and up over 60 from only six months ago advertisement advertisement as previously mentioned during the first quarter there were three events that affected a number of income statement and balance sheet line items with only modest economic impacts with regard to the new york city condo development mentioned earlier we executed transactions in february to convert our equity interest into a more senior secured investment position and that result is reflected in an increase in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures line item on the balance sheet as a result of the transactions we converted a 35 million common equity interest into a 35 million priority preferred equity position in addition we refinanced the joint venture s mortgage debt with a 50 5 million first mortgage loan and funded a 6 5 million mezzanine loan going forward ladder will receive all distributions of available cash until all of its debt and preferred equity investments have been repaid after the operating partner receives a return of and on its investment ladder will receive 20 of any remaining cash distributions the net result places ladder in a first priority position for return of its invested capital with our jv partner responsible for all additional costs and equity risk no gain or loss was recorded on the recent hotel loan foreclosure we now own the hotel at a basis of 18 million or about 100 000 per key we have contracted with an experienced hotel manager to operate the property on the balance sheet the hotel is now a real estate asset replacing the mortgage loan asset on the income statement in future quarters if and when the amounts are material you should expect to see an income from operating properties line item that reflects the results of this hotel as brian also noted in january we received a 10 million lease termination payment from the sole tenant of an office building that we owned in new jersey on may 1 we sold the building at a price of 1 75 million the property was originally acquired for 9 7 million after writing off 400 000 in straight line rent receivable and paying a 1 1 million debt defeasance fee the transactions will contribute 540 000 to core earnings in the second quarter advertisement advertisement for gaap purposes only we will recognize the 10 million fee as rental income over only four months we have recorded a 1 35 million impairment charge in q1 and another in q2 while recognizing the defeasance charge in q1 also turning to the balance sheet and investment activity metrics as of march 31 2019 96 7 of our debt investments were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprise 77 5 of our total asset base total assets stood at 6 53 billion which is 4 higher than at the end of 2018 total unencumbered assets including cash were 2 billion at year end and unsecured debt outstanding stood at 1 2 billion reflecting an unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio of 1 71 times at the end of the quarter 83 1 of the securities portfolio was comprised of securities rated aaa or backed by a u s government agency and the weighted average duration was 30 months which compares to 36 months a year prior the weighted average loan to value ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at march 31 2019 was approximately 68 4 there were no core impairment charges in the quarter the average mortgage loan interest rate on balance sheet loans originated during the first quarter reflected a weighted average spread of approximately 4 36 which is lower than the balance sheet loan origination spreads in prior quarters reflecting general market conditions the average interest rate on conduit loans originated in the first quarter was 5 42 on the financing side as of march 31 2019 ladder had 4 2 billion of adjusted debt outstanding and committed financing availability of 2 4 billion for additional investments adjusted leverage at 3 31 was 2 57 times up from 2 34 times at 12 31 18 reflecting the addition of investment assets during the quarter excluding securities the adjusted leverage ratio is less than 1 6 times at march 31st at march 31 2019 debt was comprised of 1 17 billion of unsecured bond debt outstanding maturing in 2021 22 and 25 739 5 million of long term non recourse mortgage debt financing on our real estate holdings and 497 3 million of non recourse clo debt when combined with the 1 64 billion of permanent equity and 148 9 million of other liabilities 4 2 billion or 64 of ladder s capital base is comprised of equity unsecured debt and non recourse nonmark to market debt at quarter end we had 1 3 billion of fhlb borrowings with a 2 39 year weighted average maturity and an average cost of 2 61 during the quarter ladder amended one of its committed loan repurchase facilities to extend the initial terms of the facility from october 2020 to february 2022 and also amended its committed securities repurchase facility to extend the maturity date through march 2021 so summing up in the first quarter of 2019 ladder generated 46 9 million of core earnings 0 40 per share of core eps resulting in a core after tax return on average equity of 11 6 originated 456 4 million and securitized 169 7 million of loans resulting in 6 2 million of net securitization gains and paid a 0 34 per share dividend reflecting a cash dividend payout ratio of 85 on a rolling four quarter basis ladder s payout ratio was 70 4 reflecting cash dividends of 1 33 per share and 1 89 of core eps at this point it s time to open the line for questions and answers questions answers operator our first question is from tim hayes with b riley fbr please proceed with your question tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst hey good evening everyone and thanks for taking my questions brian this one just to start bridge loan originations were a bit lower than your usual run rate this quarter and how much would you say was due to market volatility and just lower or lighter transaction activity versus your broader caution there and your increased appetite to invest in cmbs and the conduit loan side brian harris chief executive officer sure i hope i can answer that understandably and i would just tell you that the lower loan volumes i think really reflect a couple of vectors that are leaning on our process we do see many loans that we like market conditions are seeing our competitors bid these loans at levels that we think are relatively unattractive and when i say relatively unattractive that s not to say we think they re going to lose money there on a relative value basis we ve been able to acquire aaa clo paper at yields that in our opinion would make those liquid safe investments with 50 subordination much more attractive rather than owning the whole loan at libor plus 300 so i think that we re originating less one because of our preference for a very similar surrogate to it while the yields are lower we think that the risks inherent in writing the whole loans don t justify moving off of the aaa category into the whole loan category in some of those asset classes you do see some of our rates on average lower so that would also be supportive of what i just said to you there and in general i think now i don t know if lower loan demand to start the year is really a hangover from 2018 s turbulence at the end of the year or whether or not it s just burnout with all the pull forward demand that took place over the last 10 years because interest rates have been so low for so long but whatever it is it s pretty clear to me that loan demand is not what it was a couple of years ago tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst ok so just kind of putting that all together do you see this kind of being a trend throughout the year where you re maybe originating less bridge whole loans and acquiring more of that either the clo paper or the aaas or just investment rated cmbs or sticking with the conduit business is that when we think about capital allocation should we expect kind of this pace of the bridge originations to persist through the year brian harris chief executive officer i don t know the answer to that and the reason i don t is because if you told me that i could continue buying aaa clo paper on acceptable collateral with 50 subordination at spreads of libor over 100 there was a deal today that printed at that level well over 100 and people were going to continue writing loans at libor plus 275 to 300 over on the competitive landscape then i would say yes i would be surprised a year from today if aaa two year clos are transacting at spreads with a 100 plus handle on libor tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst got it ok that s helpful appreciate the comments there and then did the december and january volatility have any impact on loan spreads i know you mentioned your spreads are down there i don t know if that s i would have thought maybe less competition as a result of that might actually help spreads and we see some of your competitors talk about spreads coming in but would you say the volatility have impact on either spreads or collateral type or loan structure in terms of what you re looking to originate today and then i know you highlighted the strong gain on sales on the conduit transactions it seems like volatility actually helped you there maybe this quarter would you expect that gain on sale to rationalize as spreads have tightened a bit brian harris chief executive officer yeah i would suspect it will get a little bit more back to the mean but i also think that part of the reason that some of the profit margins in the gain on sale business were so high is because of how quickly rates fell while a lot of loans were under application and typically falling rates would increase a lot of demand and that would create a lot of supply that would drive spreads wider that kind of falling rate environment that took place in december didn t do that so what happened was i think in december as you saw the stock market really take a heavy correction largely as a result of i would say a misstep by the fed and when that happened i think there were a lot of market participants on the investment side that kind of unloaded their fixed income investments or at least pared them back because they felt interest rates were going higher based on comments from the fed chairman and then when he reversed course and suddenly became patient i think that created an unusual amount of demand the exact opposite of what happened in december so i think that s one reason spreads are tightening at least on the securities side what s interesting on the bridge loan portfolio though is while clo spreads were widening in the secondary market where we were acquiring hundreds of millions of dollars of aaa securities that were pricing wider and wider the loan participants the lenders in the space were tightening as a result of competition which is a phenomenon that obviously cannot continue but i think there s frankly too much capital in the space and too little demand so i think that we ll just stick to our discipline and if that means we re going to continue to curtail our activity in the bridge loan space that s fine with us we won t force the issue we take what the market will give us and we allocate capital accordingly and if we can allocate capital into extraordinarily safe investments that are really being created by our competitors and generate a yield of 8 that might be a very good place to hide out until the market decides which way it s going to go and we re a little concerned about volatility no better proof than today in the markets and we don t think it s over and as we get into this election cycle we think that situations could continue to be because we ve got such massively polarized political parties that when one looks like they re going to win it may swing markets one way and if the momentum goes the other way the markets will swing the other way so we don t think it s a time to get overly aggressive we re very late in the cycle the economy is doing well and interest rates have been low for a very long time but i don t think it s time to start making calls that it s time to be aggressive keep in mind making loans today at a given spread is fine because we know where market spreads are what we worry about is getting paid back in two years or three years and we re a little afraid what that might look like so we probably are a little more cautious than some of our competitors on that tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst appreciate those comments and just one more from me the assets you highlighted this quarter are pretty different from each other in terms of asset type geographies and there seem to be some idiosyncratic issues but do you see any cautionary trends developing or just any areas of stress in your portfolio worth noting brian harris chief executive officer well i think we ve been mentioning that with libor having increased rather quickly over a couple year period of time when people were coming up on extensions the one category of loan if i can give a description the one category that we felt was a little problematic was anything that didn t have cash flow that needed an extension at a much higher rate because libor moved and this was going to require a large interest reserve and a new libor cap and actually of the assets we re talking about two of those in many ways occurred in that regard the condominium transaction that we were invested in on the equity side when it came time to ask the construction lender to extend his loan yes there was plenty of equity in the deal so he was happy to extend it but the rate was quite high as a result of having been a construction loan from ground up and we felt that as a lender if we could take over the construction loan which was now mostly complete there really wasn t very much risk in finishing it at that point we felt the economics were better so the versatility of our platform allowing us to move from the equity chair to the debt chair we think will pay benefits not so much benefits in we re going to make a lot of money but i think that the returns due to the delay and the cost overruns were really diluting our returns on the equity side and so as disciplined investors we wanted to move out of that and get into a safer place the hotel you re right a very idiosyncratic situation certainly not what we expected but we made a loan in june and we owned the hotel in february and when we made that loan in june the borrower came to the table with an equity check of 2 5 million to refinance the prior loan and wrote a recourse obligation joint and several to three parties for 4 5 million so that wouldn t indicate to us that there was any intent certainly to lose the property but sometimes when you ve got partnerships they get a little weird and then in this case one of the principals was killed and the last one was just a payoff of a triple net lease property which is sort of interesting because i think we take a little different take than a lot of reits because that was a net lease property it was an office building it was leased to a very healthy company there was a lot of time left on the lease but they clearly made it their intentions were to leave so they asked if because they were healthy and they wanted to close the books for the year they asked us if they could pay off a negotiated lease termination i think a lot of reits would have sat their and clipped the coupon for the remaining term and that was years and there was no problem at all but i think from our perspective looking down the road long term when that tenant left that was going to turn into a lease up story or else we would have been in a situation where that tenant would have had to sublease the property i think from our perspective we had a pretty good gain it wasn t a lot of dollars but it was a rather small investment and the transaction began to veer off course in that the tenant wasn t going to stay so we had an opportunity to print a gain and we took it tim hayes b riley fbr inc analyst got it that s helpful thanks for your comments brian harris chief executive officer sure operator our next question is from jade rahmani with kbw please proceed jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks can you give your net exposure in the lower east side condo deal before and after the 10 8 million pay down you noted that took place after february brian harris chief executive officer jade if you don t mind i m going to have pamela go through those numbers because she actually handled that transaction jade rahmani kbw analyst ok pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate so jade we restructured the investment to reduce our last dollar exposure by 13 million from 105 million to 91 8 million and subsequent to that we ve been paid down and now our on the loan first our outstanding current exposure is 76 9 million as of today jade rahmani kbw analyst ok and what kind of all in inclusive of i guess the construction loan the mezzanine loan and your preferred equity position what kind of all in return are you expecting brian harris chief executive officer do you have the rates on here marc fox chief financial officer on the first mortgage loan which is 50 5 million we re getting libor plus 475 on the mezzanine loan which is 6 5 million we re getting a 12 fixed rate pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate and the preferred equity is it s really more like a kicker at this point we get a return of the principal and then we will get a split if there is a return over 13 our partner will get back their capital and a 13 return before there will be any profit split on that above our return of principal marc fox chief financial officer and we get 20 of that brian harris chief executive officer so i would use libor plus 475 for the 51 million 50 5 million 12 for the 6 5 million and i would use a 0 for the equity which will be a return of principal as opposed to return on principal jade rahmani kbw analyst ok anything on the watch list we are starting to see kind of these we call them one offs but they re now one offs with every mortgage reit that reports but we are seeing them pick up gradually nothing too alarming and it s pretty normal this late in the cycle but anything on the watch list that we should be on the lookout for pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate the answer is no jade i think we re actively getting in front of issues and restructuring i think we re just looking we balance the return with risk mitigation and we don t feel like there s anything coming we re actively looking at stuff and always thinking about how to maximize returns at large but we don t have anything on our watch list that we re currently concerned about brian harris chief executive officer and i indicated to you jade that we feel like credit is stable here it is that one column where things need extension where there is no cash flow that s a very expensive proposition so we re particularly monitoring things like that and i know we ve had a few of those recently that are not being reported here today because what we ve done in advance of them is said we re happy to extend the loan but you re going to have to pay down the loan for the extension fortunately most of our borrowers are well heeled enough that they can do that and they have been responding to those payments so we don t have any heavy negotiations going on or anything in the on deck circle presently pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate i think the safest thing to say is we re very comfortable at our basis on all the assets so that s what gives us a lot of comfort jade rahmani kbw analyst i think that the mortgage reits have said publicly that around 25 to maybe 35 of their originations are bridge to bridge kind of scenarios are you seeing a similar trend are you inclined to deny those turn down those term sheets when you see them how are you looking at that brian harris chief executive officer we look at assets for what assets are but i think we would generally have the impression that if we re going bridge to bridge the other lender could have extended and has decided not to so we re naturally cynical in those scenarios so i would say we re certainly not 25 to 35 of our production we do see a lot of those loans in fact we re a little surprised that we see borrowers seeking cash out refinances on bridge to bridge fundings and we are doubly cautious on those so we are seeing that but we re not apt to be chasing those in too many aggressive ways jade rahmani kbw analyst in terms of the decline in book value was that related to the stock compensation of 12 4 million which was outsize so i d appreciate it if you could give some color on that or did that relate to interest rate movements with respect to the cmbs portfolio marc fox chief financial officer yeah no it s really about the shares between the we had the stock dividend where we issued 1 2 million shares in the first quarter and we had another million and a half shares net on the equity compensation grant so that was 2 7 million shares about a 2 3 increase and that s what really just drove it jade rahmani kbw analyst and the comp grant related to what year on an annual basis what s reasonable to expect this is a multiyear level of issuance isn t it marc fox chief financial officer yeah i think the equity compensation grants i think that was in line with what you d expect in a year when we made 230 million and so 230 million was more than what we had expected so i think that that s about you should look at it in proportion jade rahmani kbw analyst ok brian harris chief executive officer we do have stock compensation for our higher earners in the company and so in periods where in years where we have high income that would naturally correspond to high compensation and that would require higher stock grants however you should note that those stock grants are handed over at higher stock prices and they don t vest for three years except if you ve got a retirement eligibility situation so it s in line with the way it s always worked around here i think that you re seeing this outsized item because of the outsized income of 2018 jade rahmani kbw analyst thanks regarding the 2q originations and repayments so far i just want to make sure i heard you correctly i think you said 193 5 million was that inclusive of bridge loans and conduit loans can you just clarify that and secondly what have you received in terms of repayments so far in the second quarter brian harris chief executive officer i don t have my second quarter notes handy here i don t know if pamela has it pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate we ve done about 100 million in the second quarter and i think we received to date and repayments slightly in excess of that at the moment but we re projecting right now i think we re projecting running the book at close to even jade rahmani kbw analyst ok brian harris chief executive officer the loan book pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate the loan book the balance sheet loan book jade rahmani kbw analyst right yeah brian harris chief executive officer and we anticipate the securities book will go higher i indicated to you 190 some odd million in the first five weeks and i assure you that number is higher today so we did see a slowdown in pay downs if you remember in the last quarter we had about 800 million in pay downs which was an absolute anomaly but it has largely reverted back to what we would expect which is about 240 million a quarter jade rahmani kbw analyst great thanks for taking the questions brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate thanks jade operator our next question is from steve delaney with jmp securities please proceed steve delaney jmp securities analyst good evening everyone thanks for taking the question brian last friday cma showed about 21 million of new cmbs issuance year to date you already knew that number but down 19 year over year rates are lower now than they were end of last year early this year just curious what your outlook is for the rest of this year and do you think we have a chance to get back to match 2018 at this point brian harris chief executive officer there s a lot of factors that go into the mortgage origination business primarily you get loans from two places refinance and acquisition steve delaney jmp securities analyst right brian harris chief executive officer acquisition i think will move around up and down depending on many factors including how comfortable foreigners feel investing in the united states the refinance pipeline i suspect is going to be muted and the reason why is because interest rates have been so low for so long and i just do not see rents going higher in anything but apartments and some industrial areas so typically a refinance will be driven by the opportunity to save money through a lower rate which i don t think can be done today and secondly as a result of trying to get more cash out of the asset because it s been leased and stabilized so i think that that s really where you could see some growth but i just don t lease ups are taking longer than they re supposed to as i said i think hotels we believe hotels are peaked already so i don t think we re getting back to where 2018 was however there s a couple of private equity firms that could easily change that with a few assets but if you take out the largest borrower in the cmbs business i guess it s blackstone the business is downsized it s slower and down 20 sounds pretty reasonable to me i don t anticipate rates if rates do go lower i don t think they will spark a refinance boom because i think if rates go lower it s going to be because of a reason that is not going to be very comfortable for steve delaney jmp securities analyst for activity yeah understand and your comments about kind of hitting it right with your first quarter and second quarter margins kind of bouncing below and above 4 very strong it sounds like that was a little bit pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate sorry i didn t mean to interrupt you steve delaney jmp securities analyst sorry pamela mccormack head of transaction management global commercial real estate i think the lower volume is offset a little bit by higher margin across the board steve delaney jmp securities analyst ok great that s kind of where i was going and some of that may have been circumstantial with going from volatility to tightening etc but it sounds like you feel like they ve while the volume is lower the profitability of that business for you all is it sounds like it on a unit basis is as good as it s been in quite some time brian harris chief executive officer yeah and do i think that will continue we re not writing loans to make four point margins but if you make four points on 200 million last year you would have had to write 800 million worth of loans to make that amount of dollars so it is sort of a little bit circular i understand pamela s point there but we always look for relative value and i don t anticipate the conduit business will continue throwing off those kinds of returns even if volume does come back or get lower i think a combination of falling rates reasonably depleted fixed income coffers because they thought rates were going higher at the direction of the fed chairman and then coupled with rates falling and little supply coming if you take a look at the leveraged loan market and the high yield corporate market you ll see the same phenomenon credit spreads have simply tightened i think largely through a lack of supply steve delaney jmp securities analyst well thank you both for your comments brian harris chief executive officer you re welcome operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks brian harris chief executive officer we d just like to thank everybody for joining us tonight and hearing us and all the supporters that invest in our company things are pretty comfortable here at ladder despite a little bit of a slowing business we have the tools to oscillate around various products and take the right steps to ensure the best returns so very comfortable with where we sit today and even into a downturn from here so thanks very much for joining us and we ll catch

parliament questions and answers may 8 oral questions questions to ministers question no 1 prime minister 1 hon simon bridges leader of the opposition to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon jacinda ardern prime minister yes hon simon bridges is the government still committed to building 100 000 kiwibuild houses over 10 years rt hon jacinda ardern as the member well knows we re going through the process of a reset around the kiwibuild programme are we committed to building affordable homes are we committed to trying to improve access for first home buyers are we the government that has built more houses than any other government since the 1970s the answer to that is yes hon simon bridges is that a confirmation that the 100 000 houses in a decade commitment is now gone rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges is it phil twyford who s been reset rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges then why did the housing minister phil twyford say this morning on that 100 000 commitment it s like american nuclear ships in the 1980s it s a neither confirm nor deny situation rt hon jacinda ardern as i ve just said we are in the process of working through a kiwibuild reset but whilst we do so we are continuing to build houses again as i ve said many a time in this house we are a government building more houses than any other since the 1970s advertisement scroll to continue reading hon simon bridges when is the climb down on her flagship policy of 100 000 houses in a decade going to be confirmed rt hon jacinda ardern i will never resile from the fact that this is a government that has committed to changing the face of housing in this country in fact just look at the auckland housing market a significant change has happened there we know that there has been a softening we know even though prices are high that more first home buyers are getting into that market we are creating more transitional housing places we have built more state houses we put a stop to state house sales and we have increased housing first placements i am proud of what we ve done on housing but i have to say the last government set the bar pretty damn low rt hon winston peters i raise a point of order mr speaker you have just given the opposition 12 more questions today but the reality is that the prime minister has got a right to be able to give an answer to the question that is being put by the leader of the opposition excepting his colleagues are all screaming out and gerry brownlee is the worst of them they should be told to desist or action will be taken by you with respect speaker well i m hon gerry brownlee i never scream speaker i think most members are aware of the fact that the interjection during that question was excessive i am generally reluctant to interrupt a minister in full flight in those circumstances unless it goes even further i am watching it very carefully i want to assure the deputy prime minister but i on balance decided it was better to let it run the way it was going hon simon bridges how can she have confidence in phil twyford when he s seen only 80 kiwibuild houses built so far and he won t confirm her flagship policy of 100 000 houses rt hon jacinda ardern because we ve built more state houses more transitional houses and housed more who have been homeless we have also stopped the sale of residential housing to foreign buyers we have also closed tax loopholes we have made a difference to the housing market and that is ultimately making a difference for families we inherited a dire situation with our housing market and we are turning it around hon simon bridges how about a straight answer to a straight question speaker order order the member will resume his seat now he ll stand up and he will ask a question properly hon simon bridges is the 100 000 houses in a decade target gone rt hon jacinda ardern as i ve already said to the member s original question we are working through our kiwibuild reset when we have completed that we will be making announcements in due course hon simon bridges will we learn about this on a friday at 4 o clock say in a week or two rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges in light of the failure of kiwibuild the decision not to introduce a capital gains tax and to adopt only three of the 42 welfare report recommendations does she accept she has built up expectations in her year of delivery without a plan to deliver rt hon jacinda ardern no hon simon bridges why then did her minister for regional economic development shane jones say on television this morning that she had definitely built up expectations without a plan of delivery rt hon jacinda ardern i never would follow that member s attempt to paraphrase minister jones i don t actually accept even minister jones attempts to paraphrase himself hon simon bridges does she agree with her senior ministerial colleague shane jones that she built up expectations without a plan of delivery rt hon jacinda ardern i reject the premise of the question hon simon bridges to be clear has she had any input into the issue of removing the 100 000 kiwibuild commitment in recent times rt hon jacinda ardern if the member is asking whether or not i am concerned about the fact that we have inherited a housing crisis absolutely we as a government have set a priority that all new zealanders should be able to access a warm dry home that is why we put in the healthy homes guarantee it s why we stopped the sale of state houses it s why we ve boosted housing first placement for those who are homeless it s why we ve increased transitional housing in every test we have done more than that last government and we ventured into a space that no government has gone before and that was the affordable housing market we don t resile away from our focus on housing because it s the right thing to do rt hon winston peters can the prime minister confirm that housing construction in new zealand is at record levels over the last 44 years rt hon jacinda ardern yes i can including private developments there were 34 516 homes for new zealand in the march 2019 year and consents are reaching levels now that we haven t seen since the mid 1970s that s exactly what we need hon simon bridges wouldn t it be more accurate to compare kiwibuild to the titanic than an american warship rt hon jacinda ardern if the national party built the titanic hon simon bridges with an official cash rate cut just confirmed does she accept that the reserve bank is now doing her job propping up an economy that s significantly weakening rt hon jacinda ardern if the suggestion is that somehow i run every single global economy or that i m somehow responsible for the headwinds we are facing as a result of issues like trade tensions between china and the usa i m sure the member would not want to imply that hon simon bridges does she accept that her treasury just last week revised gdp for the first half of this year down to just 2 percent on the back of continued weak domestic business confidence and deteriorating future intentions from firms here rt hon jacinda ardern again as i have said many a time in this house the member seems to think we operate in complete isolation we do not of course the average quarterly growth rate in gdp per hour worked under the coalition government has been if i were to pick a figure 0 9 percent in contrast it has averaged 0 1 percent under the previous government and going forward we have to acknowledge that other developed oecd nations who we compare ourselves to are seeing downturns in their projected growth rates relative to them we are in a strong position hon david parker is the prime minister aware that growth forecasts for new zealand are higher than australia japan the oecd average most of europe canada and the united kingdom rt hon jacinda ardern yes that is indeed correct canada the uk the euro japan we are showing much stronger growth rates than all of those comparable nations hon simon bridges is her 1 5 billion mental health budget package over four years that is is it a 6 billion package overall rt hon jacinda ardern i heard the member throw around numbers in this house we of course have made no announcements on mental health and the budget hon simon bridges well is it also true that there is a 500 million pharmac boost in the budget as well and is that enough over four years rt hon jacinda ardern the member i know has a strategy here of just chucking out random numbers we have not announced anything for the budget in that regard hon dr nick smith which policy has been more successful in helping new zealanders get into homeownership homestart that has helped 60 000 new zealanders speaker order order question hon dr nick smith into homeownership or kiwibuild that has helped 60 into homeownership rt hon jacinda ardern i reject the premise of the question hon dr nick smith i seek leave to table the analysis from the parliamentary library showing that 60 000 new zealanders have been helped into homeownership speaker order order that s enough an analysis on this matter from the parliamentary library is there any objection to that there is objection question no 2 climate change 2 marama davidson co leader green to the minister for climate change what recent announcements has he made regarding climate change hon james shaw minister for climate change this morning the prime minister and i announced the introduction into parliament of the climate change response zero carbon amendment bill commonly known as the zero carbon bill now in april of this year tens of thousands of school students went on strike to protest the lack of decisive action on climate change we are acting now the zero carbon bill outlines our plan for the next 30 years to safeguard the future of those students and of their own children this is not the end of the journey but it is a good start marama davidson how will the zero carbon bill contribute to the global effort to limit warming to 1 5 degrees above pre industrial levels hon james shaw reducing emissions of our long lived gases including carbon dioxide to net zero means that those emissions will no longer contribute to further global warming the target range for biogenic methane is consistent with the central range of scenarios presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change in its most recent report which limit global warming to 1½ degrees with limited or no overshoot marama davidson why does the zero carbon bill propose a split target approach with biological methane separated from all other gases hon james shaw a split gas approach enables a target with a definite temperature outcome which lets us aim it at the goal of the paris agreement to limit warming to 1 5 degrees emissions of short lived gases do not need to reduce to zero in order to limit their effect on global warming whereas emissions of long lived gases need to be reduced to net zero or below the target in the bill is consistent with the latest science on what is required for the world to limit global warming to 1 5 degrees marama davidson what steps will be taken to ensure the transition to a climate safe future prioritises the needs of our most vulnerable and exposed communities and the interests of tangata whenua hon james shaw the bill sets the framework for our transition but as we decide what policies are needed to support us in reaching the budgets and the target we ll need to carefully consider their impact on communities and in the interests of tangata whenua what the bill does do up front is require particular attention be given to seeking nominations from iwi and māori representative organisations for the climate change commission under the bill we must include an emissions reduction plan a strategy to recognise and mitigate the impacts on iwi and māori of reducing emissions and we must ensure that iwi māori have been adequately consulted on that plan in preparing a plan we have to take into account the economic social health environmental ecological and cultural effects of climate change on iwi and māori marama davidson what impact will this bill have on new zealand s ability to meet the social and economic needs of all citizens through to 2050 hon james shaw the economic analysis that we did when we did the consultation on the zero carbon bill last year showed that the difference in terms of long term economic impact between the existing 2050 target that was gazetted by the rt hon john key of a 50 percent reduction below 1990 levels and the new target that we are proposing in this legislation is approximately 0 2 percent in other words it s marginal countries that have reduced their emissions over the course of the last 10 years have all seen their economies continue to grow and develop and household incomes continue to grow also for example in the united kingdom they ve seen a 42 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and have had the fastest growing economy in the europe union over the same period of time so the idea that this is a sunk cost to the economy is not borne out by what s actually happening on the ground around the world the transition to a low carbon economy is as i ve said actually the single greatest economic opportunity in at least a generation todd muller will the minister recommence good faith negotiations with the national party to find common ground on a methane target hon james shaw obviously the bill has now entered into the house but i am always prepared of course to talk to my colleagues in the national party about the shape of the bill and i look forward to the select committee process and to seeing what that throws up todd muller does he classify good faith negotiations as meeting in early march on targets silence for eight weeks and then being handed a bill on monday afternoon hon james shaw i want to apologise to mr muller personally for some of the background process here which has not gone as i would have liked nor in fact was what i had intended the bill is obviously very contentious and you can see some of that in the reaction in the media today so what we have done i think represents the best consensus that we can build at this point in time across new zealand society i think that the diversity of views that are represented here in this parliament approximate that todd muller could you please elucidate for the house what you mean when you say background process speaker substitute he for a you and go for it hon james shaw quite simply that over the course of the last 18 months there have been a series of rounds of consultation not just with the national party but with other political parties and also with other organisations outside this house in particular agricultural sector organisations iwi environmental organisations scientists and others question no 3 prime minister 3 hon paula bennett deputy leader national to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon jacinda ardern prime minister yes hon paula bennett does she agree that a binding referendum is set in law as opposed to a political party making an election promise that they will enact legislation rt hon jacinda ardern as the member will no doubt agree binding of course is an obligation that cannot be broken obviously we in this house all know and accept that no parliament is able really to bind any future parliament parliament is always sovereign so any bill that may have even if we were to put a full bill through this house it would still have the ability to be fully repealed by the next parliament the best way to be able to bind a future parliament is for the parties that make up that parliament to give a commitment to abide by its outcome and that is what the three parties of government have done hon paula bennett does she accept the cabinet paper that the cabinet saw that said to give the greatest certainty actually enacting legislation that the date would come in after a yes vote gives the most certainty and is the most like binding rt hon jacinda ardern again i would make the point that that is the difference between certainly whether or not you re talking about simply debating principles or a bill we have as a government settled on a bill to give that degree of certainty we ve also however acknowledged that the only way you can really assure anyone that a bill will come into effect is if political parties give that commitment to abide by the outcome that is what we have done we can continue to debate the process ultimately the question here is whether or not we as political parties commit to follow through on a referendum outcome so we have agreed to do that the question is whether or not the national party will hon paula bennett what would happen if another political party came in in the next election and as such hadn t been part of that legislative process rt hon jacinda ardern of course the legislation is going to be public how else can we expect people to vote on it no doubt i imagine the public would ask that political party for their position on it also we couldn t guarantee that if a bill went all the way through a process that after an election this mythical new party would come into parliament and repeal that bill too hon paula bennett so does she know the difference then between a binding referendum an indicative referendum and a legal or moral obligation and an election promise rt hon jacinda ardern yes but in every single case parliament is still sovereign rt hon winston peters so can we take it that the prime minister s position and explanation is that when you give your word in a circumstance like this you should keep it hon paul goldsmith like 100 speaker order order which member was that hon paul goldsmith i started and i stopped before actually finishing i didn t actually get a full word out before i stopped speaker the member will stand withdraw and apologise hon paul goldsmith i withdraw and apologise speaker right now we ll start again start the supplementary again hon paula bennett fantastic so if the speaker order order just start the supplementary again hon paula bennett if the prime minister then is true to her word and she wants to guarantee the vote of the public will be listened to and acted on given this is nothing more than an election promise then how come so many other election promises have been broken for example the capital gains tax or a chief technology officer role which have not eventuated hon chris hipkins i raise a point of order mr speaker that question infringed rulings and standing orders in about five different ways it wasn t a question it was a speech speaker yes it did hon gerry brownlee just speaking to that point of order speaker no no i ve ruled on it hon gerry brownlee well in that case a new point of order speaker that s not going to attempt to relitigate the ruling i ve just made hon gerry brownlee no no it doesn t relitigate your ruling it supports it and suggests that the same logic might be applied to the prime minister s answers speaker that s an interesting matter which i ll contemplate later but frankly i can t connect it to the ruling that i ve just made at the moment hon paula bennett how can she guarantee the vote of the public will be listened to and acted on given this is nothing more than an election promise and so many other election promises for example a capital gains tax and chief technology officer role have not eventuated under her prime ministership rt hon jacinda ardern again i refute the premise of many elements of that question however again what i would say is that we are acknowledging that we as the three parties that make up this government will abide by the outcome it is fair to say though that the public will be interested in the national party s position because that will also be contingent on whether or not their view is listened to hon paula bennett isn t this just similar to kiwibuild where you promised 100 000 houses that you won t deliver speaker order no try again hon paula bennett isn t this similar to kiwibuild where the prime minister has promised 100 000 houses that they are unable to deliver rt hon jacinda ardern i have to say that i am somewhat baffled by this this is an issue that the public want to have a say on and we are committed to giving them that say if that side of the house struggles so much with the idea of the public having an opinion and is so reluctant to commit to listening to them that is their issue not mine hon paula bennett so why didn t cabinet agree to option four given the cabinet paper was weighted towards enacted legislation and this was the preferred option of their coalition partner the greens rt hon jacinda ardern because the outcome is the same hon paula bennett if the aim of legalising marijuana is to displace the black market as we ve constantly heard has she seen a recent report from canada that despite legalisation 38 percent of users reported getting cannabis from illegal or black market sources rt hon jacinda ardern it is not my role to defend what other jurisdictions have done or the make up of their policy we have however in constructing the principles of the legislation that will be drafted the objectives include reducing the overall use of cannabis over time harm reduction disempowering the gangs and illegal trade and ensuring product safety and control of thc levels again the much better way for the member to engage though on issues that the party that she belongs to may have an interest in would be to engage in the drafting it s an offer i will continue to make hon paula bennett if part of the purpose of legalising marijuana as said in the cabinet paper is harm minimisation and reducing the number of users has she seen the national cannabis survey of the first quarter in canada of 18 percent reported using cannabis and it s 4 percent higher than the same period a year earlier when cannabis was illegal rt hon jacinda ardern again i make the point that if the member chooses to advocate against the legalisation of cannabis she is absolutely welcome to do that that is what the referendum is about if the member is interested in the drafting and the fulfilment of the objectives that will be put to the public of new zealand i welcome her engagement in the drafting of this bill i am not going to debate the pros and cons of legislation that will be decided by new zealanders not by this government rt hon winston peters can i ask the prime minister whether she s been advised by the prime minister of canada justin trudeau that their legislation has been so recent that there is still not enough time to get any lessons from it rt hon jacinda ardern there are of course a number of jurisdictions that we can learn from the netherlands colorado a number of states within the united states i am sure that members involved in the drafting of this legislation will look to international evidence and advice and experts in the drafting but ultimately what we want to do is provide as much advice and as much debate and discussion as possible for the public who will ultimately determine the outcome hon paula bennett on the back of the previous question why doesn t the government wait so that we can see the results from canada who only legalised in october and are probably the most similar jurisdiction to us so that we can do something that truly is evidence based rt hon jacinda ardern i think the point the deputy prime minister was making was that that was what the member was referring to there are a number of other states that we can draw evidence and advice from question no 4 finance 4 hon amy adams national selwyn to the minister of finance does he stand by his statement that we are building an economy that is more productive if so why is annual gdp per capita growth at its lowest level since 2011 hon dr david clark associate minister of finance on behalf of the minister of finance i stand by my speaker order part of the problem with the byplay is that it fools me as well david parker will behave himself start again david clark hon dr david clark on behalf of the minister i stand by my full statement last year that new zealanders will see a difference with next year s budget it will show how we are building an economy that is more productive more sustainable and more inclusive i stand by that statement given that gdp per hour worked has increased on average by 0 9 percent per quarter under the coalition government compared to just 0 1 percent under the previous government in terms of the second part of the member s question that is correct on one definition and not on others hon amy adams why does he continue to blame global headwinds for our economic performance when according to treasury at the same time that our economy is weakening us gdp growth has risen above 3 percent growth in china has stabilised above 6 percent and growth in australia and the euro area has recently picked up hon dr david clark there are global headwinds there s no doubt about that i would note that the imf forecast advanced economies to grow by 1 8 percent in 2019 and 1 7 percent in 2020 but within that the imf forecast new zealand s economy to growth 2 5 percent in 2019 and 2 9 percent in 2020 so compared to our peers we are set to grow solidly hon amy adams given he s so keen for global comparisons is he aware that the average growth rate per person across the oecd is three times higher than it is in new zealand hon dr david clark i stand by the statement that was made earlier that we re building an economy that s more productive more sustainable and more inclusive and i note that gdp per hour worked has increased by an average of 0 9 percent per quarter under the coalition government compared to just 0 1 percent under the previous government gdp per hour worked is growing faster on a quarterly basis under this government than under the previous government and that is a measure of labour productivity that looks at how much each labourer is producing in the economy hon amy adams what does it say about our economy that new zealand is now one of the only countries in the developed world that is lowering interest rates because of its rapidly weakening domestic economy hon dr david clark the reserve bank report came out at 2 o clock and on behalf of the minister of course i haven t had a chance to read the whole report yet but it noted concerns around the global economic outlook the underlying fundamentals of the new zealand economy it said are strong it noted that central banks around the world are easing monetary policy i thought the member would welcome lower interest rates for homeowners and businesses it means that housing is more affordable and businesses will have more incentives to invest hon amy adams well what does he think it says about his handling of the economy when he inherited an economy growing at close to 4 percent a year but 18 months in the reserve bank has now had to be one of the first in the world to act to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy hon dr david clark the fact remains that new zealand is one of the best performing economies in the oecd new zealand gpd growth of 0 6 percent in the december 2018 quarter was higher than australia higher than canada higher than the euro area higher than japan higher than the uk and higher than the oecd average the unemployment rate fell to 4 2 percent in the march quarter the second lowest since december 2008 wages grew 3 4 percent over the year and we have an economy that s in good shape the member should celebrate that hon amy adams is he worried about the role of monetary policy in the event of a future economic crisis considering the official cash rate ocr is now at its lowest ever rate and there is very little room left to stimulate the economy if something were to go seriously wrong offshore hon dr david clark i reject that assertion and i would also note that our economy is in good shape the reserve bank acts independently it makes independent decisions it has independent forecasts and it paints a picture of an economy in good shape in new zealand hon amy adams does he reject the fact that the ocr as of today is now at its lowest ever rate is that what he was rejecting in the question hon dr david clark no question no 5 education 5 jo luxton labour to the minister of education what if anything is the government doing to ensure that initial teacher education better prepares beginning teachers to meet the needs of students hon chris hipkins minister of education last month the teaching council released new initial teacher education programme approval requirements to better prepare graduating teachers for the classroom including a greater focus on practical experience in the classroom in order to meet those new requirements last week i announced that there ll be an increase to the funding rates that support initial teacher education the degree level funding rate will increase by over 600 per student and the taught postgraduate rate will increase by almost 750 per student from the beginning of next year with further increases from 2020 this recognises that the increased requirements by the teaching council will increase the cost of initial teacher education but it is an investment well made jo luxton will the changes to initial teacher education provide for more teacher training enrolments hon chris hipkins yes the tertiary education commission and the ministry of education will be working with planning directors from the institutions to ensure that from 2020 onwards there is an increase in initial teacher education places to support this the tertiary education commission will be making funding available to support extra levels of growth in initial teacher education and funding for initial teacher education will be ring fenced meaning that it cannot be used to support growth in other fields of study when we so desperately need more teachers jo luxton what response has he seen to this announcement hon chris hipkins the announcement s been welcomed by universities new zealand and also by the council of deans of education who have said that it is a welcome acknowledgment of the complexity of both the teaching profession and the preparation of new teachers those teachers and principals who have figured out that addressing many of the concerns they re raising will require recruiting more teachers have also welcomed it question no 6 housing and urban development 6 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development does he stand by his statement last thursday in regard to an additionality test on kiwibuild developments the assessment is embodied in a whole lot of other communications and they re going to get back to the national party research unit this afternoon with that documentation hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development yes i said in this house that the ministry would clarify its response to the national party research unit i understand that officials sat down with the member yesterday to explain the assessment process to her and her advisers and the types of documentation they have when answering questions on the bridge it was that process of clarifying i was referring to when i said the ministry would get back to the national party research unit the public release of departmental information is of course a matter for the chief executive under the official information act hon judith collins when he told radio new zealand last week that they re going to get back to the national party research unit this afternoon with that documentation why is he now saying that he meant they were going to clarify something hon phil twyford well as i told the media at the time i was aware that there were documents and that the ministry was going to clarify its response i was not informed of the nature of the documents and that is a matter for the chief executive to assess against the grounds in the official information act hon judith collins was he then simply not aware having been in the role for 18 months what the process is that his ministry has been working to around kiwibuild hon phil twyford well the answer is yes i am aware and i m a little surprised that the member is requesting the release of documents that are commercially sensitive i m sure she understands that if documents that are generated in the course of commercial negotiations are released to the national party research unit they are released publicly so all of the developer s competitors would have access to those commercially sensitive documents surely the member can see that s completely untenable paul eagle what reports has he seen on additional house construction as a result of government action including kiwibuild hon phil twyford i ve seen consent data that shows that government agencies are now building more homes than at any time since the 1970s and as well as the approximately 2 300 state houses currently under construction we are working with the private sector to build more affordable homes now working with developers on programmes like kiwibuild is a small part of what we re doing but we make no apology for working with the private sector to build the modest affordable homes that kiwis desperately need and that that party made no effort to build through nine years in government hon judith collins if that s so what the minister has said today to parliament then why did he say to radio new zealand last thursday that they re going to get back to the national party research unit this afternoon with that documentation rather than saying now that it s all commercially sensitive and couldn t be released why has he changed his mind hon phil twyford well i haven t changed my mind i told radio new zealand and assembled media that there were other documents that were involved that the matter that we were discussing of additionality was embodied in those documents and that the ministry would get back to them and clarify the situation and that s exactly what has happened i ask the member to lift her horizons and consider the importance of building affordable houses that kiwis desperately need instead of endlessly nit picking in the trivia and the minor operational details hon judith collins will the recalibration of kiwbuild drop the additionality tests as well as the 100 000 houses target hon phil twyford well i expect that in june we ll be releasing the results of the reset of kiwibuild but i would say this to the member this government will not back away from building large numbers of affordable homes for kiwis building more state housing reforming the rental market housing homeless people reforming the planning system and infrastructure financing all of the things that are part of our housing programme that that party never did for nine years in office question no 7 education 7 hon nikki kaye national auckland central to the minister of education is he confident that he can meet the expectations of the education sector and parents in budget 2019 in light of his promises and potential teacher strikes hon chris hipkins minister of education i m very optimistic about the budget although indications around the overall level of education spending in this year s budget will of course have to wait until budget day what i can say with regard to the announcements that have been made already about education spending in this year s budget is that i am confident that the significant increase in funding for teacher training that we announced last week will address the teacher shortage that we inherited hon nikki kaye hasn t he failed to meet expectations with the pre budget announcement in that it doesn t even deliver half of the 8 000 additional secondary teachers needed over the coming years and will he take responsibility for the increased class sizes and overcrowding that will occur hon chris hipkins the member s number of 8 000 is simply incorrect the correct numbers according to the ministry s teacher supply projections for primary schools are that in 2019 we needed 650 more teachers that actually starts to decrease to the point where in 2023 we re expecting a 90 teacher surplus with regard to secondary school teachers the extra number required this year was 170 that continues to increase to the point where by 2025 that number gets up to an extra 2 210 the extra funding that i have announced this week delivers over 2 500 extra teacher trainees in addition in addition to other teacher supply measures such as free refresher training for those who have already completed their training but who are not currently registered hon nikki kaye i seek leave to table those exact modelling documents which demonstrate the cumulative impact is 8 000 additional teachers over the next five years speaker the source hon nikki kaye it s the ministry of education documents speaker from a website hon nikki kaye well again i don t think it is i ve seen it via email but i can check that post question time speaker i ll put it anyway is there any objection there appears to be none documents by leave laid on the table of the house hon nikki kaye how will he meet the expectations of parents who believe the government promised to scrap school donations when he is a year late on the 150 payment that was promised and figures that i have seen project that at least half of schools would not scrap donations as a result hon chris hipkins with regard to the school donations policy we were always very clear that it was going to be a voluntary uptake amongst schools and that they would have the choice whether to take it up or not the financial modelling that the labour party did prior to the election did not assume that every school would take up that policy we recognise that in fact some schools particularly higher decile schools get significantly more than 150 per student and donations with regard to the commitments around timing the government made a commitment to deliver that policy within the first term hon nikki kaye how will he deliver on his promise to modernise all of the more than 20 000 school buildings in new zealand given that the potential true cost of that is 10 billion hon chris hipkins the member will have to wait until the budget hon nikki kaye when the prime minister said in the speech from the throne that the government will spend one point speaker order order order i don t think she did hon amy adams the governor general reads it out hon nikki kaye when the governor general read out from the speech from the throne the prime minister s commitment to spend 1 8 billion on teacher resources was it just another case of the government overpromising and under delivering hon chris hipkins no in fact we ve already delivered more than that the teacher salaries alone amount to 1 2 billion in extra funding and that s on top of the extra money that we ve put into recruiting more teachers to meet population growth which we funded in last year s budget the member will just have to wait and see what s in this year s budget jan tinetti what is the government doing to address the expectations of the education sector hon chris hipkins i will highlight just three things very briefly first of all as i indicated we ve already committed 1 2 billion to pay rises for the teaching profession the largest pay increases in a decade we ve committed half a billion dollars extra to support those children with additional learning needs including by employing 600 more teachers as dedicated learning support coordinators and we ve spent 135 million to address short and medium term teacher supply challenges question no 8 revenue 8 dr deborah russell labour new lynn to the minister of revenue what reports if any has he seen about the implementation of the business transformation programme hon stuart nash minister of revenue i m happy to inform the house that one of the largest it projects ever undertaken in the state sector the ird business transformation project has successfully passed its largest and most difficult phase over the easter and anzac period over 300 inland revenue staff successfully transitioned income tax and working for families into the new computer system that s more than 19 7 million taxpayer accounts 100 million records transactions 8 3 million web account log ins updated over 92 000 tests and 2 million customer contacts i congratulate the commissioner of inland revenue department naomi ferguson and her team for their hard work on achieving this significant milestone dr deborah russell what do these reports say about the improvements to service that taxpayers will see as a result of the successful implementation of this phase of business transformation hon stuart nash good news officials advise me that in 12 days time a mere three weeks since the system went online the first tax refunds will start automatically flowing into the bank accounts of hard working kiwis if this year is anything like 2018 an estimated 860 million will be refunded straight into people s bank accounts this year i can also advise that up to 330 000 families that have almost 600 000 children will now receive more accurate working for families payments during the year reducing the risk of finding themselves in debt at the end of the year these refunds and more accurate payments are only possible because of government legislation so i would like to thank new zealand first and the greens for their support i am disappointed that the national party stood in the way and opposed this legislation dr deborah russell what assurances has the minister received about the levels of customer service to taxpayers during this transition period hon stuart nash march to july is peak season for inland revenue so there is always a higher level of calls and interactions with the tax department to deal with the anticipated 25 percent increase in calls inland revenue has taken on an additional 325 staff to help and can deploy up to 900 existing staff as needed i encourage taxpayers to go online and see what new services are available such as filing for donations tax credits and setting up debt instalment arrangements it s encouraging to see that many people are going online for example on monday there were 324 000 logins to online services it is still early days and there are likely to be bumps along the way however inland revenue assures me it has plans in place and will be ready to respond question no 9 health 9 matt doocey national waimakariri to the minister of health what is his best estimate of the cost of increasing access to mental health and addiction services from the current target of 3 percent to 20 percent of the population which was identified as an indicative target in the executive summary on page 12 of the report of the government inquiry into mental health and addiction hon dr david clark minister of health as i said in answer to question no 7 last thursday none of the recommendations of the inquiry referred to a 20 percent access target the report does refer to a possible indicative target that may be 20 within the next 5 years but it then goes on to say on page 12 an explicit new access target must be set supported by funding for a wider range of therapies especially talk therapies alcohol and other drug services and culturally aligned services the government has worked on costings for specific proposals related to budget 2019 not costings for possible indicative targets that require further work and were not recommendations of the inquiry matt doocey i raise a point of order mr speaker with your permission in my next supplementary i d like to use a quote that might make my supplementary just a small bit longer speaker well have a go matt doocey thank you why is the minister refuting the access target when under main points of chapter 4 access and choice of the mental health inquiry recommendations it clearly states access to and funding for mental health and addiction services needs to be significantly increased from the 3 7 of the population who currently access specialist services to the 20 who experience mental health and addiction issues each year an explicit decision must be made to do this hon dr david clark as i said previously none of the recommendations of the inquiry referred to a 20 percent access target it does refer to possible indicative targets that the member quotes but it says an explicit new access target must be set supported by funding for a wider range of therapies it also talks about who might give advice on setting that target by no means does it suggest that that should be the target per se it is an indicative target that s discussed in the report it s not one of the recommendations of the report that is left open matt doocey so why is the minister after launching an inquiry in april last year reported back in december speaker order ask the question matt doocey twice delayed quietly backing away from increasing access to mental health and addiction services as identified speaker order order the member will resume his seat that s one supplementary gone the member can try again if he wants if the member has a question he should ask it matt doocey i raise a point of order mr speaker i think that question was very detailed and it needed to be speaker it included a whole pile of unnecessary words does the member have a further supplementary matt doocey does he agree the estimated cost to increase access to mental health and addiction services to 20 percent of the population would be approximately an additional 1 5 billion a year if not why not hon dr david clark i m not about to make budget commitments today i do think with that figure the member is being a bit cute because by implication he is suggesting that the current mix of forensic out patient and intensive services might be extended to all of those experiencing mental distress when those services are targeted traditionally towards those with the highest mental health needs what we re talking about is building new services for those with mild to moderate needs that is something that comes through very clearly in the mental health and addiction inquiry the cost of those services will be very different and the member knows that question no 10 social development 10 hon louise upston national taupō to the minister for social development what are the 15 recommendations from the welfare expert advisory group s report that the government are progressing and the five recommendations she has commissioned extra advice on as stated in her answers to oral questions nos 6 and 10 yesterday hon peeni henare associate minister for social development on behalf of the minister for social development she stated yesterday that work was already under way to address around 15 of the report s recommendations based on our initial analysis these are numbers three five eight nine 10 11 12 14 17 20 27 32 35 39 and 42 examples of this include expanded reporting on outcomes establishing a pacific steering group and a pacific reference group developing a kaupapa māori strategy at the ministry of social development msd rolling out mana in mahi and the three pre budget announcements we made on friday the additional five areas where further work is under way are recommendations number 15 16 23 36 and 38 i encourage the member to look at the cabinet paper titled welfare overhaul advice from the welfare expert advisory group and next steps which is available online for more information however work hasn t stopped there this is an ongoing and active work programme we are continuing to commission work and consider all of the other recommendations as we develop our three to five year plan that will sensibly address recommendations in the report through a systematic overhaul of the welfare system that is effective and enduring and ensures those who need to access msd support are actually better off hon louise upston of the 5 to 6 billion cost stated in the welfare expert advisory group report which of the recommendations she is progressing carries the greatest cost hon peeni henare the work is currently being done on those recommendations that level of detail can i ask the member to put that down in writing and we ll get her the answer hon louise upston what is the time frame for implementing recommendation number 14 on sustainable repayments hon peeni henare work as recommended in recommendation number 14 is already under way at msd and we will continue this msd is focused on using the approach to prevent clients incurring debt in the first place and supporting clients to make sustainable payments when a debt has occurred hon louise upston what does the minister say to the welfare expert advisory group member ganesh nana who said this morning my response back to the minister is we ve done a fair amount of the work we ve done the business plan we ve got to tackle this the quicker we tackle this the quicker it will be hon peeni henare we have a significant challenge in front of us we make no apologies about that we have a work plan to address the many issues that were raised by the welfare expert advisory group and many others who have presented themselves to this parliament i encourage that member and that side of the house to support the great work we re doing in the space to make sure that those who do access support through msd get full and correct entitlement marama davidson does the minister agree that successive governments have focused too much on reducing the costs of our welfare system rather than increasing the value provided by our welfare system and that this approach has failed hon peeni henare there are significant challenges and the overhaul of the system once again can t be considered in isolation through the work of the welfare expert advisory group there is a host of work that s being done across ministers and administrations to make sure that we do address the inequities and that we are able to provide the public with a system that is strong and gives them the full and correct entitlement that they re entitled to question no 11 immigration 11 dr liz craig labour to the minister of immigration what announcements has he made today about immigration settings for the regions hon iain lees galloway minister of immigration today i have announced updates to the essential skills in demand lists this includes replacing the immediate skills shortage list with 15 regional skills shortage lists this will allow us to target the lists more precisely make them more responsive to the needs of regional new zealand and show new zealanders and migrants where the work opportunities exist throughout the country dr liz craig so why make these changes hon iain lees galloway this government recognises that what is good for auckland is not necessarily the same as what is good for ashburton and that a one size fits all system is not delivering the more productive more sustainable and more inclusive economy that we need this government has committed to working with the regions to build thriving regional economies dr liz craig so what are the next steps for regional immigration settings hon iain lees galloway i m currently considering the results of consultation on extensive changes to the temporary work settings and working with my colleagues the minister for social development the minister of education the minister for regional economic development and the minister of employment to create a much more robust system to meet regional labour needs and support the transformation of our economy to one that is more productive more sustainable and more inclusive question no 12 police 12 hon dr nick smith national nelson to the minister of police does he stand by all his statements policies and actions hon stuart nash minister of police yes hon dr nick smith does he stand by his statement to tvnz on roadside drug testing last december in response to the matthew dow tragedy in nelson in which he said and i quote there s a discussion document that has been approved by cabinet that s going to go out to the public early next year hon stuart nash first of all let me say that if a person is impaired by drugs or alcohol they should not be driving it is against the law we are looking at a new strategy to improve road safety during 2019 an immediate 100 million increase of funding was made to improve road safety when we took office however more announcements will be made shortly hon dr nick smith i raise a point of order mr speaker my question was whether he stood by an important statement speaker the member very clearly got a no out of that carry on hon dr nick smith i certainly didn t hear a no i heard a comment on the issue i heard nothing about look he said cabinet had approved something speaker order order hon dr nick smith did cabinet last year approve a discussion paper on enabling police to do roadside drug testing if not why did he tell tvnz and the people of new zealand that it had approved such a discussion paper hon stuart nash that member s been around long enough to know that we don t discuss what goes on in cabinet in the house hon dr nick smith point of order mr speaker speaker no no i don t need it the member had a straight question and it was a very clear question it related to a direct quote from him we had already commented that a paper had been approved by cabinet i m sort of taking dr nick smith s word that the quote is accurate and it d be pretty serious if it s not but taking that at face value he cannot say on television that cabinet approved something and then say that it s not his role to say so in this house hon stuart nash what i can say is i do not recall saying that but what i will say is work is undergoing in this area hon dr nick smith will the minister apologise to the mother of matthew dow who would ve turned 25 today if not killed by a reckless drug driver given that he misled her in saying that cabinet had approved a discussion document and that it was to be released earlier this year rt hon winston peters i raise a point of order mr speaker with the greatest respect this is certainly no way to treat human tragedy in the way it s being played out politically in this house and we on this side of this house seriously object we don t diminish in any way hon michael woodhouse is the question out of order or not rt hon winston peters the harm or the hurt that the family might have felt but this is not the way for this parliament to behave surely speaker first of all i want to deal with the person who interjected during that point of order who was that hon michael woodhouse that would probably have been me mr speaker speaker the member will leave the chamber hon michael woodhouse withdrew from the chamber hon dr nick smith point of order mr speaker speaker no i m contemplating dealing with this point of order this is a very serious matter it involves the death of a loved one i think many of us are concerned at the approach that is being taken in the house now but in my opinion it is a matter of at the moment judgment of good taste and good taste rather than a matter at the moment of order so if dr smith wants to restate his question with that proviso the clear indication from me that there s a question of taste and appropriateness involved here but he is a very senior member and obviously the public will make their judgment on it hon dr nick smith i raise a point of order mr speaker you have rightly noted this is a serious matter a key part of that is the accuracy of the quote and i accept that speaker order the member has been invited to ask his supplementary question again as he did previously before he was interrupted by the deputy prime minister no one has doubted his word as far as the accuracy of that quote is concerned all we ve had is the minister saying that he can t recall saying it hon dr nick smith will the minister apologise to the dow family and to the people of new zealand for his false statement and i quote there s a discussion document that s been approved by cabinet that s going to go out to the public early next year when that was untrue hon stuart nash i have absolute sympathy for the dow family and your loss i cannot imagine it i will not apologise for something i have absolutely no responsibility for for every family that has lost someone on our roads because there is a drink or drug driver i have absolute sympathy what i can say is work is going on in this area though another thing i would say is mr scott brought a member s bill to the house last year i sat down with him and i tried to work with him on this because we felt that the scope of his bill was too narrow we asked to work with him he refused to do that so this government undertook to address this in a way that actually addressed the issue hon dr nick smith supplementary speaker no the member s run out of supplementaries scoop media

the united states unilateralist strategy has emerged under very special historical circumstances and is now exerting a growing impact on the world order and the livelihood of people worldwide first it is necessary to understand the circumstances and the environment that produced this us unilateralist strategy the strategy is not merely an impulsive action on the part of policy makers or the result of president donald trump s peculiar personal temperament its formation has deep rooted social economic and political causes on the domestic side as well as specific international dimensions the us has been the only superpower in the world since the disintegration of the soviet union in 1991 and the most advanced capitalist country in economic financial science and technology fields since the end of world war ii in 1945 in the assessment of many of its policy makers politicians entrepreneurs and mainstream think tanks the us possesses the best political systems and the best social and economic structures the us also holds the universal values of justice and democracy and the present international order was formulated under us leadership the us has veto powers and other unique strengths playing a dominant role in many key international organizations such as the un security council international monetary fund imf world bank and nato the us dollar is the world s most frequently used reserve currency the us also has a unique military presence in the world operating some 800 military bases and logistical facilities out of its sovereign territory and beyond it has abundant policy tools available and frequently employs sanctions against a growing number of sovereign countries such as iran the democratic people s republic of korea dprk cuba venezuela nicaragua russia and others it holds that it is the sole leader of the world and any change in the international order and global governance should be made under us leadership however the us assessment does not wholly accord with the rapidly changing realities of today s world the fast rise of newly emerged economies and numerous developing countries has begun to put cracks in america s ability to totally control world affairs the us is now not powerful enough to fully contain new developments as it had once succeeded in holding down the soviet union and in preventing german and japanese economic expansion from threatening its number one economic position in the world over the last several decades only on rare occasions has any single country or group of countries taken the initiative to retaliate against the us for some dispute under such circumstances it is only natural that the us has to try every means possible to pursue its own path on major world issues when it cannot compel others to adopt resolutions favorable to the us second the us unilateralist strategy is closely associated with the resurgence of nationalism in the us under the doctrine of america first in its dealings with the outside world this shift is the result of a misjudged assessment of the losses the us has suffered from economic globalization as america is itself the largest beneficiary of globalization it appears untenable to claim that the us led world system has greatly damaged the us national interest it cannot be denied that it is american selfishness that has driven the us out of the paris climate change accord the us withdrawal tells the world that america has gone so far as to shirk already promised duty bound international obligations for the sake of its changed energy development strategy third development under america s capitalist free market system have produced great social divisions that cannot be easily closed as a result some of the old political and social problems which urgently need to be resolved or alleviated have been dragged on with no reasonable solution in sight sharp political disputes between the republicans and the democrats often lead to partial or total government shutdowns damaging the prestige and credibility of the us federal government racial discrimination and immigration policy differences have been creating new divides the widening gap between the rich and the poor has been exacerbating existing social divisions which have become more and more associated with many election related foreign policy issues different trade and military policies tend to benefit different groups of voters as the party in power makes new policies to benefit its core voters the party not in office often takes action to change or block those policies as a result many of the policy differences between the two major political parties are exerting a growing impact on us foreign policy the recent unusual policy changes towards the middles east among other regions could be considered as typical examples of this phenomenon us withdrawal from the iran nuclear agreement its official recognition of israeli sovereignty over the golan heights the region seized by israel from syria after the six day war in 1967 and the move of the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem as well as increased arms sales to the region which account for about half of all us arms sales in the world in recent years could all in essence be boiled down to policy changes towards iran and israel us attitudes towards these two countries have a direct impact on jewish american voters notably voting records show that in fiercely contested swing states like ohio and florida jewish american voters might play a decisive role in elections this kind of interaction between foreign policy changes and the voting intentions of different groups might partly explain why the us would rather offend the international community by violating international agreements and offering more favors to israel the fourth the us unilateralist strategy has been one of the major causes of world economic uncertainty and stagnation decreasing international trade and investment has largely been the result of the tariff wars launched by the us against a number of countries and unreasonable restrictions on investment in the us under the pretext of national security concerns the international strategic balance is in danger of collapse as the us is trying to gain the upper hand over russia in their nuclear arms race by abandoning its previous commitments on nuclear disarmament global peace and stability have been harmed in the middle east in particular as tension between us and iran is growing meanwhile the normal functioning of the world trade organization wto dispute settlement has been disrupted by us moves at the same time amid strong international opposition to us unilateralism more and more actions have been taken by other countries to defend multilateralism the us withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership tpp agreement didn t stop the other 11 remaining countries from continuing their trade cooperation under the new comprehensive and progressive agreement for the trans pacific partnership cptpp the proposal by germany france canada and japan to form a multilateral alliance to deal with climate change and other global challenges which is expected to be officially put into action in september 2019 could be taken as a sign of their clear cut opposition to us unilateralism of course the china led belt and road initiative bri is the most influential multilateral endeavor for international cooperation in the world over the past 6 years 126 countries and 29 international organizations have signed cooperation agreements of various kinds under the bri framework the trade volume between china and other participating countries has surpassed 6 trillion and 82 industrial parks have been established creating some 300 000 local jobs the bri is playing an increasingly important role in enhancing multilateralism as it has become a key driver of global productivity world economic growth and common development the us is the only superpower in the world and it believes that its dominance in world affairs would continue and that no other country could surpass it in comprehensive national power in the near future therefore it is not realistic to expect that the us would change course and give up its unilateralist strategy any time soon but it cannot go too far down the road of monopolizing control over world affairs due to the unpopularity of unilateralism in other parts of the world and domestic diversity of opinion on vital world issues with the joint efforts of all countries that favor multilateralism global multilateral cooperation will continue to gain momentum and gradually prevail over unilateralism in international affairs in the days to come

kamoa kakula where massive to semi massive chalcopyrite bornite and chalcocite have locally replaced pyrite in the kamoa pyritic siltstone kps a pyritic siltstone that lies immediately above the basal diamictite unit that typically hosts the copper mineralization at kamoa kakula assay results for 10 new holes were received from the kamoa north drilling earlier this month a complete list of which is available in ivanhoe s may 3 news release significant new drilling intercepts at the kamoa north bonanza zone include dd1486 intersected 16 70 metres of 15 84 copper at a 3 and 2 copper cut off in

open along a westerly easterly strike for a considerable distance an east west lineament thought to represent the controlling growth structure can be traced in aeromagnetic data for up to 20 kilometres across the western side of the kamoa kakula mining licence and onto ivanhoe s adjoining 100 owned western foreland exploration licences the controlling east west structure was previously intersected in holes dd0015 dd1200 and dd1396 that were drilled as part of an earlier wide spaced resource delineation drilling program the recent detailed drilling in the hole dd1450 discovery area has led kamoa kakula geologists to consider that these earlier holes may have intercepted the same structure that hosts the kps bonanza grade copper inferring a corridor of high grade copper of at least 2 7 kilometres drilling a step out hole along strike at the kamoa north bonanza zone geologists lydia makong left and christelle nkulu logging copper rich drill core from the kamoa north bonanza zone the potential to fast track kamoa north under initial assessment given the shallow depth remarkable thickness and massive copper sulphide mineralization discovered within the kamoa north bonanza zone kamoa kakula s engineers are evaluating potential options to accelerate the development of this new discovery based on the shallow depth of the high grade mineralized intercepts to date at the kamoa north bonanza zone the discovery zone may be accessed by way of a surface box cut and decline similar to those at the kakula and kansoko deposits in a relatively short time frame any material mined at kamoa north could be processed at a nearby standalone plant or hauled to the plant that will be constructed at kakula this has the potential of significantly increasing the copper grades during the initial stages of production at kamoa kakula drilling extends the nine kilometre corridor of shallow high grade copper at the kamoa far north discovery to the boundary of ivanhoe s 100 owned western foreland exploration licences kamoa kakula geologists also are exploring another zone of shallow high grade copper mineralization in the far northern region of the kamoa kakula mining licence the far north exploration target is the more typical stratiform mineralization characteristic of the majority of the kamoa kakula copper deposits the high grade copper zone at kamoa far north follows a north south trend controlled by growth faulting and by the pinching out of the basal diamictite and the kps against the roan sandstone on the western flank of the kamoa dome the pinching out results in the sulphide rich upper portion of the diamictite and the kps being brought into direct contact with the roan aquifer resulting in the high copper grades seen at kamoa far north the mineralized corridor trends for more than nine kilometres and is projected to continue onto the adjacent western foreland exploration licences the kamoa geology team has been drill testing the high grade trend to the north of kamoa north and has successfully followed it to within 15 metres of the northern boundary of the kamoa kakula mining licence assays from 11 holes are pending from drilling in this area exploration drilling during q1 2019 was split between kakula west kamoa north and kamoa far north given the recent outstanding results from the kamoa north bonanza zone the focus of exploration now has shifted to kamoa north with four rigs there to delineate the extent of the discovery and assess its potential to be fast tracked to production to increase kamoa kakula s early copper grades drilling for the first quarter was completed with a maximum of nine drill rigs excellent progress was seen on the rigs overall despite challenging wet season conditions in total 12 943 metres were completed in 35 holes drilled by both contractors and project owned rigs the seismic survey data from work completed in 2018 was processed and preliminary observations made additional ground gravity and ground mag survey programs were started in kamoa north towards the end of q1 2019 including a ground mag survey over the kamoa north bonanza zone figure 8 kamoa far north exploration area showing the high grade mineralized zone delineated to date ongoing upgrading work enables mwadingusha hydropower station to supply clean electricity to the national grid ongoing upgrading work at the mwadingusha hydropower plant in the drc has significantly progressed with the major equipment being delivered on site the power station was shut down to replace sections of penstocks that were found to be in an advanced stage of corrosion the progressive re commissioning of the turbines fully refurbished and modernized with state of the art control and instrumentation has recently commenced and is expected to be completed in q3 2020 the refurbished plant is projected to deliver approximately 72 megawatts mw of power to the national power grid the work at mwadingusha part of a program to eventually overhaul and boost output from three hydropower plants is being conducted by engineering firm stucky of lausanne switzerland under the direction of ivanhoe mines and zijin mining in conjunction with the drc s state owned power company la société nationale d electricité snel once fully reconditioned the three plants will have a combined installed capacity of approximately 200 mw of electricity for the national grid which is expected to be more than sufficient for the kamoa kakula project the kansoko mine kakula mine and kamoa camp have been connected to the national hydroelectric power grid since the completion of a 12 kilometre 120 kilovolt dual circuit power line between kansoko and kakula in december 2017 the design of permanent 11 kilovolt reticulation to the vent shafts and mine has started which includes substations overhead lines and surface cables continued focus on community and sustainability the kamoa kakula sustainable livelihoods program is committed to sustainable development in the communities within the project s footprint the main objective of the livelihoods program is to enhance food security and the living standards of the people who reside within the project s footprint the program is mainly implemented through fish farming and food crops including farming of maize corn vegetables and bananas plus poultry production and beekeeping additional non farming related activities for q1 2019 included education and literacy programs the continuation of a community brick making program a basic training program the construction of a school and housing for teachers and the supply of fresh water to local communities fabrice mazeze with fresh tomatoes produced in the ecolivelihood vegetable garden the initiative is part of kamoa kakula s program to support and expand food production in nearby communities 4 western foreland exploration project 100 owned by ivanhoe mines democratic republic of congo ivanhoe s drc exploration group is targeting kamoa kakula style copper mineralization through a regional drilling program on its 100 owned western foreland exploration licences located to the north south and west of the kamoa kakula project during q1 2019 exploration drilling continued in the makoko area with three rigs one contractor rig and two project owned toyota land cruiser mounted lc rigs a total of 5 320 metres were completed in 17 diamond drill holes during the quarter ten holes were drilled by the project owned rigs for a total of 1 289 metres while seven holes were drilled by a contractor rig for a total of 4 031 metres the contractor rig drilling deeper holes concentrated on infill holes for geotechnical and metallurgical studies as well as testing the western and eastern limits of the currently defined makoko system to the north up dip of makoko ivanhoe used two project owned drill rigs to test the up dip limit of the nguba host stratigraphy along the basin margin as well as the limit of the roan sub basin associated with mineralization processing of seismic data has been ongoing through q1 2019 the 2d sections are being combined with detailed ground gravity data airborne magnetics and drilling data to create a predicted geological interpretation from kakula to makoko this work is providing an intricate insight into the behaviour of the mineralizing system in the western foreland the projected extensions of the kamoa north bonanza zone and the kamoa far north high grade discovery onto the western foreland licences are two high priority exploration targets that ivanhoe plans to target in its future drilling campaigns ground gravity and magnetic surveys are ongoing at kamoa north and on the western foreland licences in an attempt to pick up growth faults basin structures transfer faults and potentially stratigraphic changes in the target areas the kamoa north work is essentially complete and is being interpreted by the ivanhoe exploration team makoko copper discovery on october 1 2018 ivanhoe announced the makoko copper discovery on its 100 owned western foreland exploration licences near kamoa kakula the makoko discovery is ivanhoe s third major copper discovery in the drc and shows characteristics identical to ivanhoe s tier one kamoa kakula discoveries the initial discovery hole at makoko dd004 was drilled in september 2017 with follow up and infill drilling ongoing since that time drilling to date at makoko has defined a flat lying near surface stratiform copper deposit similar to the kamoa and kakula deposits the structure contour map indicates that the mineralized formation in the makoko area is within 1 000 metres of surface the majority of the drilling to date at makoko has intersected the copper rich zone between 400 metres and 800 metres below surface the mineralized zone at makoko strikes approximately south southeast it has been tested over a strike length of 4 5 kilometres and a dip extent of between one and two kilometres copper mineralization remains open both along strike and down dip selected quarterly financial information the following table summarizes selected financial information for the prior eight

this news release also contains references to estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves the estimation of mineral resources is inherently uncertain and involves subjective judgments about many relevant factors estimates of mineral reserves provide more certainty but still involve similar subjective judgments mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation including estimated future production from the company s projects the anticipated tonnages and grades that will be mined and the estimated level of recovery that will be realized which may prove to be unreliable and depend to a certain extent upon the analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences that ultimately may prove to be inaccurate mineral resource or mineral reserve estimates may have to be re estimated based on i fluctuations in copper nickel zinc platinum group elements pge gold or other mineral prices ii results of drilling iii metallurgical testing

the republic of uzbekistan has spent most of the past four decades doing precious little for most of the 1990s and 2000s it was all but economically inactive while to most western investors if it had an identity it was as a flyover state on the way to the likes of kazakhstan according to world bank data uzbekistan s economy was actually smaller in 2007 than it was in 1991 the year it declared independence from the withered husk of the soviet empire life began to change in 2016 with the passing of former president islam karimov a figure of stability in his early years who came to rule with an iron fist jailing opponents and keeping foreigners including most potential investors at arm s length karimov was replaced by shavkat mirziyoyev prime minister since 2003 but despite being part of the old entrenched system mirziyoyev appears to be cut from a different cloth once president he freed political prisoners sacked many of karimov s cronies and promoted capable forward thinking technocrats a virtual reception hall was launched allowing normal uzbeks to vent their spleen against the authorities online without fear of repercussion millions did so in the first few months but there has been no uzbek spring reforms have been progressive and steady not sharp and jolting travel restrictions were eased and in september 2017 mirziyoyev lifted exchange restrictions on the uzbek som devaluing the currency by 90 a decision that at a stroke eliminated one of the key obstacles to foreign investment and trade he made all the right noises promising to champion the private sector and break up state monopolies and to convince leading corporates to issue shares and bonds and sell them to global investors by any measure the process appears to be working in its latest world economic outlook published in april 2019 the imf tipped economic output to expand by 5 in 2019 and 5 5 in 2020 rising to 6 by the middle of the 2020s in a credit opinion published by moody s in february 2019 the ratings agency highlighted the country s robust growth potential underpinned by positive demographic trends and relatively low government debt it said the economy would continue to post strong nominal gdp growth and a modest budget deficit of around 1 5 uzbekistan is on an exciting path to opening up its economy alkis vryenios drakinos head of the resident office in uzbekistan at the ebrd tells globalmarkets it welcomes investors that are ready to take a long term approach and who look for impressive reforms macro economic robustness a young and growing population and an economy rich in natural resources debt issuance in june 2018 the international finance corporation the private sector arm of the world bank issued uzs80bn 9 5m worth of two year bonds on the london stock exchange the so called samarkand bonds were a global first for the country and the multilateral with the proceeds used to boost funding to local smes another key moment in uzbekistan s development came in february 2019 when it secured an international credit rating and printed 1bn worth of eurobonds the state s first foray into the international capital markets more sovereign prints are set to follow with uzbekneftegas the dominant local oil and gas firm looking to sell debt to international investors before the end of the year in its first quarter 2019 investor presentation tashkent based ipak yuli bank pointed to three key reforms helping to drive change and boost growth liberalising foreign currency rules made it easier the bank said to repatriate profit while lower business taxes encouraged firms to reinvest finally efforts to slash red tape created a more responsive government willing to support inward foreign investment in the world bank s 2019 doing business rankings uzbekistan ranked 76th up from 87th in 2017 the first full year of mirziyoyev s rule and 141st in 2015 the year before he was elected and sworn in as president in its latest survey the bank pointed to a host of positive moves made by the new administration from strengthening the rights of minority investors to making it easier to pay taxes and trade across borders in his first year in office mirziyoyev chose to stay close to home shoring up power in tashkent and meeting friends and allies around the region the new leader travelled to turkmenistan and tajikistan brokering a peace deal with the latter that included the re opening of the shared land border and visited kazakhstan on no fewer than four occasions despite having a smaller population kazakhstan with president nursultan nazarbayev at its helm until he left office in march 2019 spent decades courting global investors sucking foreign capital into energy and mining projects natural and human resources kazakhstan and its canny former president can act as handy benchmarks for respectively uzbekistan and mirziyoyev the two sovereigns are very similar to one another they are blessed with an overwhelmingly young population keen to build better richer lives ipak yuli bank reckons that 72 of uzbekistan s 33m people are under the age of 40 both are also incredibly rich in natural resources including oil and gas gold and silver and copper and cotton uzbek officials have estimated the total value of all of the country s mineral and energy resources at 5 7tr it is surely only a matter of time before the world s energy and natural resources giants strike profitable commercial joint ventures with leading local groups the ebrd s drakinos reckons reforms will transform uzbekistan into a more open mainstream and private sector oriented economy that is already well positioned to become one of the most most advanced in the region whether it has the capacity to transition into a middle or higher income market digitally and financially innovative and with a strong manufacturing base remains to be seen mercedes benz and telenor found it very challenging to invest here and those memories are still fresh notes gunter deuber head of economics fixed income and foreign exchange research at raiffeisen bank international it will take time to turn that around so i don t see sizeable fdi flowing in first we will need to see more progress on opening up yet mirziyoyev is clearly keen to continue to forge ahead with reforms in the final years of karimov s life uzbekistan was a virtual no go zone for foreign corporates and capital after peaking at 1 6bn in 2010 and 2011 according to data from unctad inbound fdi fell off a cliff tumbling to 133m in 2016 and 96m in 2017 more promising news arrived in 2018 when fdi rebounded to 255m scattered across 13 greenfield projects global tour that may explain why the president has emerged in the past 18 months as something of a globe trotter in the second half of 2018 he visited russia the united states saudi arabia and also china to attend the second belt road forum held in beijing in november uzbekistan is integral to the belt road initiative china s grand plan to redraw the world trade map in its image all overland trade routes between beijing and europe that pass north of afghanistan and south of the atrophied body of the aral sea have to pass through uzbekistan belt road capital has not been welcomed everywhere with open arms soft loans from china s twin development banks china exim bank and china development bank have critics say caused endemic indebtedness in a host of emerging states from tajikistan to sri lanka and pakistan to djibouti but uzbekistan so far at least has been amenable to beijing s overtures and more than happy to channel mainland money into infrastructure projects china has helped to electrify a 355km rail line linking bukhara with misken and co financed a highway connecting tashkent with turkmenbashi on the caspian sea mirziyoyev has continued this year to operate as a one man international investment bureau in february he visited the united arab emirates signing 10bn worth of deals with the sovereign and with the abu dhabi based mubadala investment company spanning a number of sectors ranging from renewable energy to infrastructure to agriculture another key trip scheduled for the second half of 2019 will see the president visit belgium with the aim of strengthening sovereign relations with the european union in february uzbekistan held the first round of negotiations in tashkent on an enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement road to reform but while much has already been achieved over the past two years this is a country that is by any measure still at the beginning of a very long sovereign journey four decades of self imposed isolation is not going to be negated overnight scroll back to the start of the decade and you find a country ranked 172nd in transparency international s corruption perceptions index ahead of just four other nation states including afghanistan and somalia it has inched up steadily ever since but it was still ranked 158th in 2018 sandwiched between mozambique and zimbabwe uzbekistan s capable president is making all the right moves visiting old friends and making new ones opening once closed borders securing credit lines from china s big development banks and seeking to strike economic and co operation partnerships with europe but deuber s point about western corporate reservations remains important and relevant in 2014 a swiss money laundering investigation targeting four uzbek men with links to the daughter of then president karimov also ensnared a swedish telecoms firm and indirectly telenor it eventually cost the chairman of the norwegian telecoms firm his job events like these are not quickly forgotten by western ceos they linger for years in the collective corporate memory nor is the overhaul of an economy kept isolated from the world for decades an inevitable and foregone conclusion uzbekistan has little experience of trading with the outside world let alone dealing with the labyrinthine complexity of adhering to the ever evolving tenets and rules of western style corporate and financial governance there will inevitably be growing pains as a conservative country used to following its own self penned rule book learns to adapt the road to reform in any country is strewn with obstacles whether economic financial societal political or all of the above mirziyoyev s route to power was linear and as these things go unusually seamless and painless but he wasted no time in removing individuals close to his predecessor from positions of power they may be gone but will they have forgotten the manner of their departure little wonder moody s in its february credit note warned the biggest threat to future stability stems from political risks that stem from potential opposition to the reform programme in the face of short term economic and social costs there are trials and tests ahead for an economy still finding its feet and its identity as it opens up to the outside world but they are challenges that are worth facing and which moreover will only make this resource rich market stronger

here s a two step exercise step 1 read this passage based on research to date there would seem to be little reason to worry about a protectionist backlash against globalization in response to rising inequality if the average economist thinks that technology s role has been four times as important as that of trade surely policy discussion is focusing on how to even out the gains from technology not on how to erect new trade barriers unfortunately this is not the case my reading of the current u s policy debate is that such a backlash is already underway this is particularly so with respect to setting the terms of trade policy debate this assessment is based on a few broad observations first in the united states there has not been a concerted policy effort at either the federal level or the state level to ameliorate the recent wage problems of the less skilled whether this is good or bad is open to debate on various philosophical and ethical grounds but regardless of this inaction has an important political implication the median u s voter has experienced disappointing wage performance for more than 20 years labour economists often distinguish the more skilled and less skilled by the college graduate high school graduate distinction table 3 shows that by this convention about 75 of the u s labour force is less skilled the wage problems of the less skilled affect the majority of the u s population not just a small minority of it has this voting bloc made its political might felt everal recent political events in the united states suggest a marked turn away from policies aimed at freer trade step 2 guess the year it was published done guessing here are the recent political events the author names the events include ross perot s strong electoral performance in 1992 the nafta north american free trade agreement debate and close congressional vote in 1993 pat buchanan s strong electoral performance in 1996 and the failure by congress to renew fast track negotiating authority for the president in 1997 and the house of republicans reluctance to renew funding for the international monetary fund in 1998 clearly all these events involved other issues in addition to trade but the consensus analysis of them factored in sentiment for greater protectionism based on events like these one can argue that a protectionist backlash is already underway yes this piece matthew slaughter s globalisation and wages a tale of two perspectives was published a full two decades ago in the world economy what should we conclude you could call the piece prescient but how prescient is it to predict a backlash against free trade almost two decades in advance what if that backlash is itself mostly rhetorical i say the real lesson of this piece is that free trade is a hardy weed politicians are always complaining about free trade free trade is never popular if you look at policy warning signs and harbingers of radical change abound before you announce the beginning of the end for free trade though remember that the world is vast a thousand dead canaries in the coal mine shows next to nothing when the world contains billions of canaries whispers of change pale before status quo bias the preachers of backlash habitually paint themselves as realists the real realists however aren t the people who highlight the multitudinous threats to free trade the real realists aren t the people who opine we need to seriously address inequality or else the populists will win no the real realists are the people who stare at the multitudinous threats and say meh the real realists are the people who refuse to be stampeded into fighting populism with populism be a real realist p s the rest of slaughter s piece by the way is golden he wasn t the first to say this but he says it well

recommendation summary source bloomberg nordstrom nyse jwn in my opinion is a deeply undervalued company since the company reported comp sales declines the stock has lost 40 of its value but the

year and opening two new ones this year a flagship women s store in manhattan and its first location in fairfield county connecticut with more people shifting to buying clothes online i would consider this a logical move by nordstrom in january the company announced several store closures nordstrom at the mall at wellington green in wellington florida nordstrom at macarthur center mall in norfolk northern virginia nordstrom at providence place mall in providence rhode island investment thesis source company presentation in the years ahead i expect nordstrom to continue closing down underperforming stores and drive digital sales growth although revenue growth has slowed down in the last year nordstrom rack chain along with nordstrom s online off price business is performing well comparable sales at nordstrom rack the company s off price store rose 4 additional increase of incentives in the nordy club program like members now earning three points up from two for every dollar they spend should continuously help the company increase their loyalty penetration although i see many news outlets talking about underperforming metrics nordstrom is surpassing industry average numbers on sales to capital ratios and is only 1 below industry average operating margin numbers additionally the openings of new nordstrom rack stores coupled with closing underperforming stores and increased digital presence should help nordstrom increase operating margins in the years to come in the graph below you can see how the company s operating metrics have performed through the last years source company filings and author s own estimates retail industry state of brick and mortar stores source census according to the u s department of commerce statistics total e commerce sales for 2018 were estimated at 513 6 billion an increase of 14 2 percent â 3 7 from 2017 total retail sales in 2018 increased 4 8 percent â 1 2 from 2017 e commerce sales in 2018 accounted for 9 7 percent of total sales e commerce sales in 2017 accounted for 8 9 percent of total sales from all this we can see online sales rising and believe this to be true especially for clothing chains but is brick and mortar really going away for good fact is brick and mortar stores still hold the economic power like i mentioned in my previous article on bed bath and beyond brick and mortar stores are more evolving then going away although there are more than a few good arguments in support of brick and mortar closures like consumer behavior shifting radically and labor getting more expensive companies like amazon are still increasing their physical presence and the company has good reasons for it according to a forbes analysis amazon sees shoppers dissatisfaction with the current in store experience and is setting out to improve it if amazon remained as only an e commerce retailer it would be missing out on all the ways a customer might want to shop by entering the world of bricks and mortar the retailer is ensuring it has a cut of another revenue stream according to inmarket a micro trip is a shopping trip that takes less than five minutes and a behavior that is becoming increasingly common as grocery stores add programs that let customers order online and pick up in person though traditionally retailers have been partial to longer shopping trips micro trips allow brick and mortars the advantage of more efficient store formats and improved targeted marketing with merging the ecommerce platform with the physical interaction brands like home depot and walmart are taking lessons from amazon and nike by installing lockers in stores so that shoppers can physically pick up online orders from all this i would conclude that transformation here is key i do not see brick and mortar going away at least not any time soon recent results source company presentation nordstrom recorded q4 18 revenue of 4 484 million representing a yearly decline of 4 6 for the quarter mainly due to full price comp sales decreasing by 1 6 in the graph below you can see operating margins staying mainly stale from 2017 to 2018 mainly due to decreases in cogs and sg a keep in mind jwn is coming out of a heavy investment cycle due to increased capex spending with e commerce and off price retailers being the big winners from the shift in consumer behavior nordstrom has been responding to this and has tried to shift its business nordstrom has doubled its nordstrom rack store count in the past five years improved its digital presence with the online off price business and it is preparing to open a flagship store in midtown manhattan source company filings and author s own estimates superior customer experience nordstrom does set the standard for customer experience the company has long been recognized for its customer service the nordstrom local and menswear only locations highlight a strategic focus on the customer above all else by offering them unique in store experiences nordstrom local stores allow customers to pick up or return online purchases but offer far more than just transactional benefits shoppers can get a mani pedi while they wait for items have clothing tailored by in store seamstresses or consult with trunk club stylists on their wardrobe choices last year nordstrom tested out a new customer experience strategy it starts with the smartphone customers can find clothes they like on social media and then reach out to personal stylists who then put together digital style boards with a variety of customized looks if the customer likes them he or she can mark items to try on in store nordstrom will then route the customers to the closest store and when they arrive they will find a dressing room with their name on it and the items already inside ready to be tried on a tablet within the dressing room lets customers contact an employee to get replacement clothes and pick out items they want to purchase via mobile pay with offering superior customer experience nordstrom should be able to easily expand its customer base which should help with revenue generation in the coming years industry peers in the analysis below i have included high end stores which offer a product range closest to nordstrom s pricing and quality i believe that macy s and dillards are appropriate peers to compare nordstrom with macy s source bloomberg macy s m is an american department store chain founded in 1858 the company operates over 750 department stores under brand names including macy s bloomingdale s and bluemercury in 44 states the company saw a revenue increase of 0 5 in the last year and had approximately 24 971 million in revenue in the last years macy s experienced weak performance in its core business combined with debt fueled share buybacks in 2015 causing each of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade macy s ratings at least once in 2016 and 2017 the company recently was able to clean up its balance sheet by paying 2bn of debt and stabilized its profitability while keeping operating margins around the industry average of 6 i think the biggest advantage of macy s is the property ownership alasdair mckinnon investment manager at scottish investment trust thinks the property portfolio is worth the market cap of the company and i actually couldn t agree more macy s has a vast network of more than 600 stores across the country macy s real estate with an estimated value of 16 billion is worth more than the company s market value of 6 4 billion according to an analysis by cowen the investment management and banking firm the macy s flagship store on 34th street is worth an estimated 3 3 billion alone the company has no plans to sell its manhattan flagship a tourist magnet that contains more than one million square feet of retail space and spent 400 million on renovating it between 2012 and 2016 in other cities macy s has already been selling off parts or all of its most distinct buildings one of them a former meier frank department store in portland ore will soon house creative office space with a coffee shop and a gym considering all this i find macy s a good long candidate despite the debt issues they had company s financials right now are in line with industry averages and see no reason for a sell off source company filings and author s own estimates dillard s source bloomberg dillard s dds is an american department store chain with approximately 292 stores in 29 states headquartered in little rock arkansas the company has approximately 6 503 million in revenue which marks an increase of 1 2 since last year and employs around 40 000 people in the past few years from 2016 to 2018 dillard s operating margins fell from 6 to 4 but in their last report we saw something of a comeback with the company reporting 2 comparable sales growth since the company doesn t do earnings calls or provide any guidance which to me is a red flag it s hard to know what management thinks of the future with the company having operating margins and revenue growth below industry averages it may not be the most advantageous time to buy according to an intrinsic value based on future cash flows the company seems to be overvalued based on its current share price i see macy s and nordstrom a much safer bet than dillard s source company filings and author s own estimates income statement breakdown revenue source company presentation as we can see from the income statement below nordstrom s revenue has grown steadily in the last three years with an average of around 3 per year the consecutive increase in revenues throughout the years is mainly due to an increase in digital sales growth which now represents 30 of the company s revenue stream looking forward i expect the company to grow at an average of 3 9 per year supported by the growing revenue from off price stores source company filings and author s own estimates operating margins the steady decrease in operating margin is mainly due to the company s increase in non operational items a one time contribution to nordstrom s employee profit sharing plan associated with tax reform as well as a legal settlement gain in 2016 for the 5 years ahead i forecast an increase in operating margins mainly supported from the company closing underperforming stores and increase in digital sales catalysts catalysts in the next 12 24 months for the price to increase include continued closures of underperforming stores nordstrom has been less aggressive in this respect than most of its larger lower end rivals looking to close three stores in 2019 and even looking to open one flagship women s store in manhattan and one store in fairfield county connecticut if the company continues to close 2 3 underperforming stores per year with digital sales increasing it should be more than enough to increase its margins in the years ahead i think such actions are logical due to the increase in digital sales and expensive labor force consumer confidence u s consumer confidence improved in february topping all forecasts and snapping a three month losing streak after the u s government ended the longest shutdown in the country s history and the trade war edged toward a resolution the confidence index climbed to 131 4 from 121 7 the new york based conference board said in a report tuesday that compared with a bloomberg survey of economists that called for a rise to 124 9 the measure gauging americans views on present conditions rose to an 18 year high while consumer expectations posted the largest monthly gain since 2011 valuation dcf analysis the analysis i have done here is centered on increasing operating margins due to digital sales and future possible store closures for the dcf analysis i have used the assumptions listed below which got me to an equity value of 8 879 4 million diluted shares outstanding of 170 and price per share of 52 23 a 7 average discount rate revenue growth for the next 5 years at an average of 3 9 per year and then slowly declining when reaching year 10 to the terminal growth rate of 2 5 operating margin at an average of 5 65 in the first 5 years and then decreasing to an average of 4 3 from year 6 to 10 a tax rate of 25 an roic at 12 at year 1 and slowly declining throughout the years until reaching 8 37 at year 10 please take into consideration that the scenario i have used above section in the analysis is pretty easily achievable with the underlying value the company has combined with the management s views for the foreseeable future risks risks surrounding a possible price per share decrease include slowdown in consumer spending u s personal income fell for the first time in more than three years in january and consumer spending dropped by the most since 2009 in december putting the economy on a weak growth path early in the first quarter the economic outlook was also darkened by other data on friday showing factory activity hit a more than two year low in february with manufacturers reporting slowing new orders and hiring the economy is losing speed as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package and increased government spending fades a trade war between the united states and china higher interest rates softening global growth and uncertainty over britain s exit from the european union are clouding the outlook the commerce department said retail sales fell 1 2 between november and december the sharpest drop in nine years the slowdown in consumer spending put a dent in overall economic growth forecasters at the federal reserve bank of atlanta lowered their estimate of fourth quarter growth to just 1 5 percent if that holds growth for all of 2018 would fall short of the trump administration s 3 target retailers had reported robust sales in the first half of the holiday season but consumers grew more cautious when a political standoff over border wall funding temporarily shuttered parts of the federal government just before christmas this followed a roller coaster ride on wall street as investors worried that trade tensions between the u s and china would cut into corporate profits possible increase labor costs u s labor costs accelerated in the third quarter of 2018 as wages for both private and government workers surged amid tightening labor market conditions the employment cost index the broadest measure of labor costs increased 0 8 percent after an unrevised 0 6 percent rise in the second quarter the labor department said on wednesday that left the year on year rate of increase at 2 8 percent wages and salaries were up 2 9 percent in the 12 months through september that was the biggest increase since september 2008 and followed a 2 8 percent gain in the year to june recently the labor department released a new statement which measured an increase in hourly output per worker by 3 6 in the last quarter that was the strongest pace since the third quarter of 2014 the strong pace of productivity suppressed growth in labor costs a potential boost to corporate profits unit labor costs the price of labor per single unit of output fell at a 0 9 rate in the first quarter after increasing at a 2 5 rate in the prior quarter compared to the first quarter of 2018 labor costs grew at a 0 1 rate the weakest pace since the fourth quarter of 2013 despite the weaker than expected reported growth in wages a tightening labor market could mean that employers have to compete for workers instead of the other way around a circumstance that pushes employers to outbid one another by offering better benefit packages higher wages and even more desirable working conditions to job candidates key takeaways in considering all catalysts and risks i see nordstrom as an undervalued company due to the recent sell off and troubled q2 and q3 2018 results i see the company s fair value between 48 and 52 and see bright future for nordstrom due to their strategy shift

the catastrophic impacts of the policies imposed by international monetary institutions were not confined to africa and latin america as discussed in the first part of this article they also played havoc with the lives of millions in asia and other parts of the world as well in asia the imf and the world bank first encouraged financial liberalization that partly led to the financial crisis in south east asia during the decade of the 1990s and they then prescribed a disastrous recipe to address this crisis several experts believe that the crisis was caused in large part by south korea thailand the philippines malaysia and indonesia s heavy reliance on short term foreign loans and openness to hot money when it became apparent in 1997 that private enterprises would not be able to meet their payment obligations international currency markets panicked and asian currencies plummeted what they forget to mention is the ideology of international monetary institutions that encourage the reliance of countries on short term foreign loans and openness to hot money which help speculators fulfill their gargantuan appetite for profit and money after pushing these countries towards a crisis the imf treated the asian meltdown like other emergency situations giving assistance only in exchange for structural adjustment policies which was totally unnecessary because these states were not facing a budgetary deficit issue nonetheless the fund instructed governments to cut spending which deepened the economic slowdown in south korea for example a country whose income approached european levels unemployment skyrocketed from approximately 3 percent to 10 percent imf suicides became common among workers who had lost their jobs and dignity in indonesia the worst hit country poverty rates rose from an official level of 11 percent before the crisis to 40 60 percent and gdp declined by 15 percent in one year malaysia stood out as a country that refused imf assistance and advice instead of further opening its economy malaysia imposed capital controls in an effort to eliminate speculative trading in its currency while the imf mocked this approach when adopted the fund later admitted that it succeeded the imf recipe proved to be very disastrous for the common indonesian who greatly suffered because of the policies imposed by the global financial body prior to the 1997 98 financial crisis indonesia had a relatively comfortable debt situation the government borrowed primarily from the world bank asian development bank and a group of bilateral donors grouped in the consultative group on indonesia cgi for funding its development budget jakarta approached imf in 1997 for a 43 billion bailout and within a few years the bailout turned out to be a great curse for the masses adding to their miseries and making their lives difficult in january 2003 the government of the then president megawati soekarnoputri raised the prices on fuel 22 percent telephone 15 percent and electricity 6 percent this was happening in a country where inflation was 10 percent in 2002 and more than half of the country s 220 million population lived on less than 2 a day and burdened with more than 40 million unemployed souls to tide over the crisis it was suggested that indonesia should take specific steps to liberalise trade and investment which included reducing tariffs on all imported food products to five percent and cutting non agricultural tariffs to 10 percent by 2003 opening banks to foreign ownership by june 1998 and lifting restrictions on foreign banks by february 1998 despite taking these drastic measures the country s financial woes did not decrease the official debt burden increased from 27 percent of gdp prior to the crisis to more than 100 percent by the end of 1999 before declining gradually in fact indonesia which was ranked as middle income and middle indebted before the crisis at the same level as its neighbours thailand and the philippines came to be ranked as belonging to the silic severely indebted low income countries category such reckless policies also contributed to the immiserating of the people in the philippines where the government kept domestic wages low at the behest of the international financial bodies this badly affected the marginalized sectors of society forcing 54 percent of the population to live in absolute poverty while the government debt service was eating up 50 percent of the national budget this was the brief history of the disastrous impacts caused by the policies of the global financial institutions it is difficult to imagine why we still insist on going to such institutions the policies of international monetary institutions clearly indicate that they seek to benefit the global north their agenda is to facilitate the plundering of third world countries by the advanced capitalist states their mission is not opaque their purpose is not mysterious they are very vocal in making it clear that the structural adjustment programmes are meant to promote the free market they want developing countries including pakistan to reduce import restrictions work for the advancement of exports carry out the privatization of public industries control wages and leave the social sector at the mercy of market forces which of these points could help the economy let us begin with privatization the mantra of selling state concerns was used to convince people that it would help the country repay loans we started the process of privatization in the 1980s which gathered pace after the restoration of democracy in 1988 according to the finance ministry our total debt and external liabilities was 20 90 billion in 1990 rising to 38 86 billion in 2007 and 99 1 billion now we have sold out more than 160 state run entities since the 1980s rendering hundreds and thousands of people jobless instead of seeing the country free from debt what we see today is nothing but a phenomenal surge in our external debt and liabilities which is likely to haunt our coming generations for decades or maybe centuries did these much vaunted reforms at the behest of international monetary institutions bring any positive change in the lives of millions of pakistanis the answer is not difficult to imagine while the world bank claims poverty has been reduced asserting it fell to 29 5 percent in 2014 from 64 3 percent in 2002 pakistan s first ever official report on multidimensional poverty launched by the pml n government in 2016 says nearly 39 percent of pakistanis live in multidimensional poverty the other social development indicators that were meant to be visible after the economic reforms seem to be nowhere either the country houses more than 25 million out of school children more than 40 percent of children are stunted infant mortality rate was 63 3 deaths per thousand live births in 2018 eighty percent of diseases are caused by contaminated water which is a rare commodity for the majority of the poor and hepatitis has become an epidemic in several parts of the country since the arrival of the tabdeeli sarkar inflation has skyrocketed the prices of petrol and gas have witnessed a phenomenal surge the champions of employment creation are planning to render tens of thousands workers jobless by privatizing state run concerns given all this it is more likely that the prescription of the imf will further add to the miseries therefore it is important that we think of the alternatives following the imf s dictation will do no good if the advisers of zardari nawaz and imran are unanimous in seeking help from global financial bodies then the people must realise that they just want to draw to hefty salaries from the public exchequer but want workers wages to be stagnated they want to see austerity in the lives of millions of people but would love to stay in five star hotels and make expensive foreign trips from the taxes of common people it is time we came up with our own alternative concluded the writer is a freelance journalist email egalitarianism444 gmail com
facebook improving payments is likely only the start of what s to come with currency thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe in the beginning there was bitcoin first proposed by the anonymous satoshi nakamoto in 2008 the first bitcoin was created or mined in january 2009 before 4k tv before snapchat before so much of the web we know today 10 years later cryptocurrencies only have a total value of 177 billion 138bn only might be the wrong word but that s approximately 500 times smaller than the total value of all money globally yet the media governments and central banks are all standing up and taking notice it s again scheduled for discussion at the forthcoming g20 meeting in japan this june and big companies like facebook amazon tesco microsoft and others rumoured to be looking into how they might get involved why all the fuss a cryptocurrency means an individual can become their own bank people can perform transactions anonymously with near nil fees in real time and cross border while storing their wealth independently without being able to be tracked it s a scary thing for governments to deal with dr richard whittle chief economist at the future economies research centre at manchester metropolitan university suggests that the real question is how can government handle this if they can t even control the banks the simple answer is that governments cannot fully control a cryptocurrency by virtue of their fundamental design they are stateless meaning that no nation has jurisdiction over it entirely banks are often prohibited from overseeing cryptocurrency transactions on behalf of their clients for regulatory reasons because senders of cryptocurrency are required to pay a small fee that is paid to an anonymous miner who verifies the transaction not knowing the geographic location of this person means that the bank cannot be certain that this small payment has not been made to a person in a sanctioned country such as iraq however unlikely it has been a key block in regulated banks experimenting more in the technology the taxation of cryptocurrencies poses similarly unique challenges just 802 us citizens declared cryptocurrency gains or losses on their irs tax returns in 2015 that figure is woefully small and almost certainly incorrect around 5 of americans are now said to have invested in bitcoin ownership and transactions can be anonymous and sit outside of the existing financial system meaning that if users wish to hide such activities from tax authorities then this is easily done ignoring the moral and legal implications of course this needs to be balanced with the level of volatility of cryptocurrency one bitcoin has been worth everything between 2 500 and nearly 15 000 in the last 18 months exactly three years ago one bitcoin was worth 320 and even the level of privacy is changing the irs achieved a court ruling to force cryptocurrency exchange coinbase to provide personal details of 13 000 of their high value account holders the value of bitcoin rose sharply at the start of april 2019 chart coindesk this tracking of exchanges is preferable for tax authorities rather than relying upon the morality of individuals who would perhaps shelter their gains anonymously whilst being forthcoming to declare their losses for relief purposes and there are further challenges cryptocurrency exchanges and supporting wallet storage technologies are largely unregulated meaning that in the event of a mistake or hack such as the mt gox scandal in 2014 there is no support or banking helpdesk to assist you being your own bank means exactly that despite the advantages you and you alone bear responsibility there are over 2 500 active cryptocurrencies according to investing com up from 1 600 less than a year ago the actual number is incredibly complex and up to three quarters of initial coin offerings icos the crypto version of an ipo to a stock market are said to be a scam government control at the macro level a nation state has two methods to control their economy fiscal policy of tax and spend alongside monetary policy controlling the supply and inflation rates through adjusting interest rates if adopted on scale this technology will wrestle control of the monetary system away from government and central banks and into the hands of individuals and corporations the million billion trillion dollar question is when might this happen cryptocurrencies are unlikely to disappear because they have unique advantages over traditional currencies and the existing banking system but without widespread regulatory approval and a global common standard they are unlikely to be adopted by the masses or receive long awaited backing from big investment groups we are in limbo and have been for some time now with adoption limited to a small minority of private investors scale adoption is likely to be seen when corporate backed cryptocurrencies are launched ironic given that bitcoin was created to oppose the centralisation and incumbent power of such institutions in contrast central banks have proposed a central bank issued digital currency cbdc this would leverage some of the technological benefits of cryptocurrencies and the underlying distributed ledger technology dlt a database held across a number of different locations or participants but with oversight being provided by a single state authority rather than from a decentralised community the bank of england has published four working papers on this subject over the previous 12 months trying to answer questions about how it would really work cryptocurrency has the potential to fundamentally change the relationship between the state and money system dr whittle says government is given a false sense of familiarity by the currency part of the phrase they think that this is something we have seen before something we can control the potential here is so much more than that long term we are likely to see the birth of a microtransaction economy where billions rather than thousands of transactions per second occur between a vast number of internet enabled devices referred to as the internet of things iot here transactions per second tps is key presently bitcoin processes approximately only 5 tps compared with visa which can process a reported 24 000 if microtransactions really catch on it would require millions or billions of tps while still difficult to imagine it is the direction of travel for this emerging technology space such a world would see real time payments receipts and taxation imagine receiving your salary continuously as you perform your employed work rather than at the end of the week or the month taxes such as paye and national insurance would also be remitted to a central tax authority in real time such principles would extend to corporates where the friction of tax corporation and vat and cash flow management is eliminated and replaced with this continuous real time system an accountant s nightmare in the nearer term a cryptocurrency can be coded and issued in a matter of hours given most of the money we directly spend rather than indirect taxation is spent with corporations you can already see the clues of where this is probably going air miles nectar points disney dollars clubcard points the list of loyalty schemes is endless corporations have always recognised that through the control of such incentives they can promote our custom harvest our purchasing data more completely and nudge our buying habits a corporate issued currency would take that to another level could we really see tesco coin or microsoft coin perhaps jp morgan released the jpm coin last quarter and now has 270 banks globally signed up to its interbank information network where it will be piloted japan s banking giant mizuho announced a j coin to promote digital currency usage alongside a consortium of banks representing 56 million customers reported leaks from a samsung insider suggest that the launch of samsung coin based upon the ethereum blockchain is being researched most interestingly is facebook s plans to integrate messenger whatsapp and instagram services was advertised to allow messaging across platforms what it hasn t talked about is that similar changes could allow a facebook coin only rumoured at least for now to move between these platforms as well as between connected subscribers improbable perhaps not the new york times reported in february that facebook is in advanced talks with leading cryptocurrency exchanges and former paypal president and coinbase board member david marcus was hired to head up facebook s new blockchain unit a digital wallet has just popped up on the new facebook release the wall street journal added further weight to rumours by reporting that facebook was seeking 1bn 760m in investment for its cryptocurrency project the widely rumoured launch of facebook s coin later this year would effectively bring the ability to store and transact money between all subscribers and vendors using these services approximately half the world s population many of whom are presently unbanked or underbanked it s not like brexit it s not like the millennium bug it s not a temporary or short term thing this is a supertrend which has the potential to change centuries if not millennia of banking structures if the banking industry is the current example of kodak hmv or blockbuster of times past which cryptocurrency will become the instagram itunes or netflix of tomorrow and will surely change the way the whole world sees money and chances are it is money that governments may never see unless they change regulations pretty quickly gavin brown is a senior lecturer in
