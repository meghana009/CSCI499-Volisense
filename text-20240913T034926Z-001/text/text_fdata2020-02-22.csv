it s hard to believe but just twenty years ago china was on the verge of abandoning the market reforms that have since propelled it to its current position as a world power conservatives had used the 1989 tiananmen massacre to reverse the country s economic direction many felt that china needed to return to a more soviet style economic system with stronger central planning and tighter regulation of people s personal lives but china had a first among equals deng xiaoping who would have none of it although already an old man he would die five years later aged ninety two he launched a brilliant guerrilla campaign almost surreptitiously he left the capital in early 1992 for china s freewheeling south making speeches that extolled reforms he declared that china s biggest threat was from the left not the right and is credited with uttering the credo of china s early reform era to get rich is glorious when conservatives blocked official media from carrying his remarks he used his influence to publish his pro reform message in regional newspapers eventually the center s resistance crumbled and deng put economic reformers in key positions of power unleashing a twenty year boom political change remained off limits but almost anything else went and it is defensible to say that china was freer and more dynamic than at any point in its modern history all of which brings us to today economic and political reformers are again on the defensive with the economy increasingly dominated by pro state forces that are squeezing private enterprise the economy is slowing with housing prices falling foreign investment down and consumer sales sluggish many economists advocating reforms of chinese statism have been stifled censors have banned the press and television from using the word monopoly in describing state enterprises socially rising expectations mean people aren t as easily satisfied with the deng era emphasis on achieving prosperity and enlarging personal opportunities many also want to have more say over how their lives are shaped but calls for political or social reform are blocked by a sophisticated stability maintenance apparatus that keeps a lid on the tens of thousands of protests that beset the country each year and punishes outspoken critics of the regime 1 the new group of leaders which takes over later this year might have a raft of reforms in mind but optimists are wary ten years ago most china experts proclaimed the incoming team of party secretary hu jintao and premier wen jiabao to be laden with reformers they turned out to be technocratic caretakers the difference between the stasis now and then is that china lacks a paramount leader like deng who can challenge the logjam of competing interests bureaucracies and regions lacking the legitimacy that would be conferred by democracy or tradition china s current rulers must seek consensus leaving them unable to challenge entrenched interests today s china features deng s political repression but without his era s dynamism a country still hurtling forward but its speed slowing and direction unclear stagnant china this isn t the story that became accepted over the past decade no country growing at double digit rates could be thought of as declining surely the label better describes sclerotic europe or the politically paralyzed united states the past ten years have seen a constant drumbeat of stories about china either as the world s next great thing or the next great enemy but all repeating the mantra that china is changing as if this were unique among the world s nations china fever peaked in 2008 first with beijing hosting the summer olympics and after the global economic crash later that year with china as the last bastion of global economic growth few then described it as beset by structural issues that would seriously hobble its rise 2 and yet this view is now widespread inside china even at the highest echelons top leaders regularly invoke the need for systemic reforms while chinese economists say the next decade will be more important than the past three when reforms were launched and china took off the topic is also slated to be discussed at the upcoming party congress when china s leadership for the next decade is to be appointed a recent study by the world bank and the chinese government s development research center declared in uncharacteristically bold language that china risked crisis if it didn t reform its system adding that calls for reform within the country have never been louder 3 how china got to this point is the subject of three new books focusing on economics and business all are written by highly qualified observers eager to make sense of china s growing malaise they come at it from different angles one is a leading american essayist and journalist another a chinese government insider and the third works at a washington think tank but their conclusions are strikingly similar china needs more than a few tweaks to regain the dynamism of past years and reach a new level of development all implicitly or explicitly make clear that most of all china s economic challenges are political the most ambitious of the three is james fallows s china airborne that might seem odd because fallows focuses on one particular industry aviation but he uses it as a window on china s effort to change its economy something it must do during its next phase aimed at a general audience it eschews many of the technical arguments found in the other two books but for most readers it is an excellent one volume look at the economic and political challenges of the post china fever era one of fallows s great strengths is his impartiality and fair mindedness he starts out with sensible caveats which too many even those of us living in china forget when speaking of this vast country of 1 3 billion he says that what struck him most about living in china is how diverse it is with regions as different from each other as many countries such observations may sound banal china land of contrasts but i have come to think that really absorbing them is one of the greatest challenges for the outside world in reckoning with china and its rise his focus on aviation stems from his passion for flying an earlier book of his discusses the aviation industry s mess 4 this leads him to experience firsthand many memorable scenes in one he copilots a cirrus propeller plane from an inland province to the coast in between is a mountain range but air traffic controllers don t respond to their requests to change altitude a good example of the poor training and low standards that still are widespread in many professions eventually a commercial jet heard the pleas and relayed them to the controllers who finally responded chinese aviation is a particularly telling subject the country s current five year economic plan which started in 2011 has china spending the equivalent of 200 billion on new airports navigation systems and planes the country s fleet is to increase to 4 500 planes from 2 600 representing half of new passenger plane sales in the world the need is equally great china has only 175 airports compared with one thousand commercial airports in the united states not to mention four thousand airstrips for enthusiasts and private pilots and here we begin to see china s problems china has a stunted civil aviation sector not so much because of its level of development but because of its authoritarian political system airspace is controlled by the military with small corridors doled out to civilian use in 2006 the military ordered shanghai s pudong airport to shut down for several hours with no reason given analogous he says to the us air force arbitrarily ordering los angeles s lax closed the corridors are so narrow that flights pile up while military restrictions force planes to fly at fuel wasting low altitudes this is a leading reason why chinese domestic flights use twice the fuel per kilometer than the international standard meaning that china could double its air traffic at no additional environmental cost if it simply adopted international norms it s one of the many fascinating facts that fallows reveals capturing at once the country s hobbled civil society but also the opportunity for improvement fallows also dissects china s quest to build a passenger jet the only manufacturer the commercial aircraft group of china is in government hands it has produced two models mostly based on foreign technology but neither is commercially usable owing to their cost and weight the lay reader may wonder why china can t pirate a boeing 737 an older model that is still a workhorse for many airlines fallows explains this by showing how much of china s economic prowess is due to customers being happy with crappy most don t care that china s products aren t first rate because they re much cheaper in the aircraft industry this is less workable how many airlines buy cheap but unreliable russian planes china s production methods are also unsuited to building ultra complex machines when assembling an ipad or a running shoe or even a car if the first batch is defective the manufacturer can adjust the production line and toss out the lemons this works for much production in china but obviously wouldn t work with aircraft that leads fallows to another memorable quote the chinese can go to the moon long before they build an airliner a moon shot is a one time event and requires brute engineering while a jetliner is an immensely sophisticated amalgam of hardware and software that has to work flawlessly for decades fallows argues that achieving this level of competence isn t a given to explain why he detours to china s education and political systems like the united states for many years after the september 11 terrorist attacks today s china is in a state of permanent emergency in which the security apparatus is constantly cracking down a string of events have convinced authorities that they are under siege the 2008 tibet and 2009 xinjiang riots the award of the nobel prize to liu xiaobo in 2010 last year s arab spring and now the leadership transition although many probably most chinese remain happily ignorant of china s parallel society of jails and guobao secret police agents they sense it indirectly access to foreign websites in china for example is painfully slow because of the regime s filtering software a far cry from the 1990s when china was ahead of the united states in cell phone networks the then cutting edge telecommunications infrastructure once they are on the internet users will find that almost all foreign social media sites are banned not getting onto facebook might seem trivial but it is a reminder to many chinese especially those educated abroad who might return home that china is one of a handful of countries the others are iran north korea and syria that permanently block this site as well as youtube and twitter most google sites are accessible but often subject to cyber harassment such as slow loading speeds the upshot fallows says is that entrepreneurs will come to china to make money in such industries but this is not the place you ll want to work if you want to be competing with the best and indeed most of china s internet platforms baidu weibo youku are copycats of western sites that are banned or hobbled in china they are big and mostly profitable but not innovative as for china s universities they get high rankings in surveys that apparently don t value academic freedom 5 but fallows notes that few in the country who have a choice not even politburo members want their kids educated there if they can they send their children abroad especially to the united states meanwhile a decade after joining the world trade organization the country makes only minimal efforts to protect intellectual property while the rule of law is often ignored his conclusion a china capable of creating its own boeing its own airbus would have to be a transformed china from the one we know now that isn t the government s view of course along with energy telecommunications and defense aviation is a sector over which the government has announced it will maintain absolute control it also says the state will maintain strong influence over automobiles machinery information technology steel metals and chemicals in most of these sectors state owned firms enjoy monopolistic or oligarchic positions private firms if they exist face significant discrimination such state planning has a long history in china which we are reminded of when reading justin yifu lin s demystifying the chinese economy born and raised in taiwan lin is probably china s most famous economist for reasons still unclear he swam over to china from a nearby island controlled by taiwan in 1979 and was feted as a patriot in taiwan where he had been on military service lin is still officially a deserter and cannot return without facing arrest he became an advocate of market reforms and cofounded a research center at peking university he recently retired as the world bank s chief economist lin s book requires a fair amount of patience not because it is particularly technical but because one has to plod through pages of politically correct mumbo jumbo to get to the interesting bits the history section is all but useless his explanations are so flawed as to be interesting only if one wants to be reminded how official communist historiography is a sequence of gloss overs and half truths we learn nothing about land reform or mao s disastrous decision to emulate the soviet economic model instead lin blithely concludes that copying the soviet model was a smart and practical option even though the book is based on his lecture notes at peking university he pulls more punches than most economists inside china at least for a foreign reader the book comes across as painfully circumspect but another way of looking at his book is that even though published by a prestigious academic publishing house it isn t meant to be a rigorous study instead it s to be read between the lines and indeed with the help of a bit of pekingology it has value his main point is that china first followed a comparative advantage denying strategy but under deng began to follow a comparative advantage following strategy this is lin s code for rejecting and then embracing market economics it s only toward the end that lin gets to his point since 2003 the chinese government has been using macro controls to cool the economy but it has not worked why for a simple reason the government failed to take radical action to tackle the cause the increasingly inequitable distribution of income in recent years that has led to a wealth gap that is among the largest in the world with the unemployed and retired left behind the result is that discontentment and grievances have begun to simmer in the community policies over the past decade he implies have been of the old comparative advantage denying variant in other words a turning back of the clock to state control after making these refreshingly clear statements lin then meekly prescribes a few general fixes without discussing the political implications essentially begging the question of why these issues have languished for a decade his main prescription is that state enterprises need to be privatized once they are viable although he doesn t say if most state enterprises are or when this might happen he has nothing to say about fostering creativity or innovation far more vigorous and systematic is nicholas lardy s take on the past four years lardy one of the preeminent economists working on china and a fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington has written a fairly technical book aimed at people who really care about the chinese economy like fallows lardy ends up pointing to the country s political dysfunctionality lardy starts by praising premier wen s team in an opening chapter that will give pause to many china skeptics he takes aim at foreign criticism of china s 2008 2009 stimulus package calling it early large and well designed china rolled out a 586 billion stimulus in 2008 months before the obama administration s measures were passed into law he notes approvingly that it was relatively much larger the us package was 787 billion but for an economy two and a half times larger than china s also the chinese plan almost completely focused on infrastructure projects james fallows s airports for example by contrast a third of the us stimulus measures were in the form of tax cuts which households predictably put toward paying down debt sensible for individuals but ineffective in stimulating demand the result is that while the us and the rest of the world plunged into recession china s economy chugged along somewhat slower but avoiding catastrophe china was better able to afford its hefty stimulus he argues because it had low levels of debt households and enterprises hadn t been sucked into dangerous debt quagmires because china resisted western advice to introduce fancy derivatives and other poorly understood financial products derided as too cautious china s mandarins began to look pretty smart something worth keeping in mind when considering today s predictions of doom having praised china s economic policymakers lardy proceeds to damn them he writes that china s leaders are aware that their policies are unsustainable in 2007 premier wen told parliament that china s economic growth is unsteady imbalanced uncoordinated and unsustainable but it was precisely during wen s time in office that china s economy went awry lardy points to political reasons the leadership he writes is focused on maintaining political stability by keeping inflation low and ensuring steady growth of nonagricultural employment these aren t bad goals but instead of achieving them through reforms wen and his advisers resorted to sleights of hand shortly after wen took office in 2002 for example china began holding down the rates paid on bank deposits which kept credit cheap for the state owned enterprises that get most bank loans in addition the exchange rate was held artificially low although the yuan has appreciated against the dollar in recent years on a trade weighted basis it only moved slightly from the government s perspective these policies funneled cheap capital not to mention subsidized power and land to state enterprises which kept employment up and prices down they also had the benefit of solidifying the role of state enterprises in a broad array of industries which made conservative planners happy the low exchange rate benefited export industries which are located in china s wealthy and politically powerful coastal provinces this allowed china s factories to hire the surplus labor that flows out of the countryside each year all of this was designed to tamp down social unrest but as lardy shows these policies had many serious costs households began to earn an ever shrinking share of china s economic output the low interest rates alone he estimates cost chinese families the equivalent of 100 billion between 2002 and 2008 unable to earn much by keeping money in the bank many chinese put their money in real estate causing a huge property bubble that has yet to deflate other assets from yunnanese tea to contemporary art also exploded in value rippling across global markets some government measures tried to help households over the past decade china has set up a welfare and health insurance system and abolished many rural taxes that caused local unrest but he shows that much of this has been eaten up by a repressive banking system and is too limited in scope these measures were politically easy ways to spend money because they did not challenge vested interests if policymakers knew these problems were brewing why didn t they take course corrections lardy is typically succinct the emergence of a collective leadership system and the rise of special interest groups is a much more compelling explanation of china s failure to pursue economic rebalancing policies more aggressively since 2004 and yet the implication of this statement is bleak surely no one can wish strongman rule on china perhaps one wonders the looming crisis may focus minds these books were written before the current political crisis when a member of the politburo was suspended and his wife held on suspicion of murdering a foreign businessman this chinese leader bo xilai symbolized the confluence of statist economics and repressive social politics in theory his removal could weaken those forces allowing the incoming leadership team of xi jinping and li keqiang to push through a deng style revolution it is possible but it is equally likely that bo s removal will force the new leadership to placate leftists already state propagandists have hit back at economists who propose reforms that many of them are politically liberal is no coincidence fallows s book provides an example of what could happen in china if it tries to muddle through instead of boeings or airbuses china could produce the equivalent of russian tupolevs second rate airplanes that will only sell among captive customers at home or client states abroad is this china s fate taking the long view fallows reminds us that we ve been asking this question for decades the contradictory signals from china make us eager for the choice to emerge clearly and definitively to end the suspense that has been building for forty years since richard nixon s 1972 visit so we can know whether to regard china as friend or foe wisely he refuses to predict
key economic releases and events the week ended on a more anxious note after all the optimism a week earlier when investors were lauding the decelerating new coronavirus cases there s still optimism that the corner has been turned but now it s the corporate side that s spooking investors this week apple and others were quick to warn about the economic consequences of the last month although few details were given at the time more will likely follow in the coming weeks which may continue to spoil the party for investors all too used to records at this point it s election year in the us and

brought some reprieve for the bank of england as inflation bounced back more impressively than expected traders weren t too deterred though and continue to price in a 60 chance of a rate cut this year which seems a little hopeful and pointless to me us michael bloomberg arrived fashionably late to the party this week and his entrance was reportedly far from extraordinary other candidates rounded on him and his billions most notably bernie sanders who is looking like a strong contender at this stage bloomberg has plenty left in the bank though and his first appearance may not have been one to remember but you don t become a billionaire and new york mayor by accident the democratic party may be the biggest thing standing between him and the white house china the hot topic is still covid 19 and its impact for asia and the global economy as a whole we ve now been through two iterations of the methodology for reporting the number of cases which now on the face of it appear to be slowing even though a bit of scepticism is creeping in among observers we are waiting for who comments on the latest change meantime asia is responding with economic stimulus measures and rate cuts china dropped its loan prime rate on thursday on the back of earlier cuts to its medium term lending facility mlf china and singapore have laid out stimulus measures to mitigate the economic impact of the virus anecdotal evidence out of china shows small private companies cutting wages delaying salary payments or even not paying staff at all we can expect more of these kind of reports in coming weeks data takes a backseat under these circumstances but for the record next week we have retail sales data and industrial production for january with the pmis for february on the last day of the month saturday a reversal in the slowdown of the number of new cases would take the edge off risk appetite capping the current equity rally at least temporarily and forcing flows into the usual safe havens of gold the yen swiss franc the us dollar and us treasuries it would again be negative for oil and industrial metals hong kong hurt by the protests and now covid 19 the hong kong economy is falling apart with tourist arrival collapsing and hotels with only 25 occupancy we see q4 gdp numbers next wednesday and they are unlikely to be good the economy is already in technical recession and facing the prospect of a third quarterly contraction in a row there haven t been any announcements of fiscal stimulus measures yet the hong kong 33 index is holding up well as is the local dollar despite the coronavirus effect and a firmer us dollar weak gdp data are likely to pressure local equities and could pull usd hkd back up to the middle of its trading band australia thursday s employment report for january showed an uptick in unemployment but strong jobs creation given the rba s focus on unemployment the higher rate saw australian yields lower and the aussie under pressure the focus now is on a dovish rba which could turn at any moment and whilst this in place will continue to pressure the aussie japan q4 gdp data came in worse than expected showing the first quarterly contraction in a year which was blamed on the covid 19 threat the economic toll is mounting not to mention the bad news from the cruise ship quarantined off japan data next week includes industrial production retail trade and unemployment with no end to the covid 19 situation in sight japan markets could trade negatively with the yen in demand if we see another spike in cases singapore singapore s close links with china have brought the city state to the forefront of coronavirus news and this week s budget introduced measures to mitigate the economic impact the wider budget deficit is not an issue for its aaa rating said fitch the mas has already said there is room within the neer trading band to ease policy and we may see an inter meeting adjustment given the next policy meeting is not scheduled until april the singapore dollar weakened to the lowest level since may 2017 versus the us dollar this week an early policy easing amid rising virus cases would pressure the sgd further market usd the us dollar index came within touching distance of 100 on thursday spurred on in recent weeks by everything from safe haven flows to the outperformance of the us whatever is happening dollar is king it s fallen just short of that psychological barrier though at the first time of asking but still finds itself at a near three year high oil it s been another good week for oil prices but the rally quickly ran out of gas after the inventory data on thursday the report gave brent one final kick higher before the profit taking kicked in at 60 and since then its been in paring mode the more downbeat end to the week isn t helping with crude slipping more than 1 on friday oil prices have been heavily punished throughout the outbreak though so if we really are in containment mode traders may become more interested in the dips once again gold gold is heading for its best week since august as it capitalized on growing insecurity in the stock market to charge through its 1 600 resistance and burst higher the yellow metal is now testing 1 650 and packing a punch with investors growing ever more fearful about the corporate fallout of the coronavirus the path of least resistance for gold looks upwards it s been quite a strong week though so a little profit taking in the near term wouldn t be outrageous with 1 650 possibly offering a logical zone for this bitcoin i m not sure bitcoin enthusiasts even know if it s a safe haven at this point but regardless it s hovering around 10 000 and as long it in around or being linked to the news in any way it seems capable of finding a reason to rally it s consolidated over the last couple of weeks but there s no major signs of weakness there at the moment the halving in may could keep prices elevated in the coming months content is for

local suppliers however these subsidized government run facilities will surely control the energy market that looks like nationalization in all but official nomenclature private companies that now rely on coal or natural gas will be further squeezed by mandated deep cuts in co2 emissions meanwhile energy demand for a mandated and growing fleet of electric vehicles will soar requiring still more

ic vehicles to 2035 the uk ban would even include hybrids france and other countries are holding to a 2040 date for mandating all electric fleets while norway has set a goal not a mandate to eliminate

charging a flat fixed rate of eight euros about 8 87 for a fast charging session that was less than 15 cents per kilowatt hour for a 60 kw charge that might be good for 210 miles on a continent where electricity prices are already 25 to 45 cents per kwh with eu gasoline prices ranging from 1 77 euros liter 7 35 per gallon in the netherlands to 4 41 gallon in romania drivers would need about 31 in

after the after the 1970s oil embargo the united states opted for a broad based energy sector so that shortages in one fuel would not cripple the national economy but today many cities have already moved to ban oil coal and natural gas nuclear is still taboo and wind and solar are intermittent the push toward an all electric society plus heavy and rising burdens on the power grid from intermittent power generations and charging all electric vehicles looks like a recipe for disaster at least for the average consumer the well connected always do well enough in controlled economies at least until government policies send energy prices soaring and send angry poor and working class protesters into the streets to rage and rampage as has happened in iran france and chile but what can a we the governed do but submit to the will of the all powerful state envisioned by sanders and his fellow democrat presidential wannabes they re all insulated by their wealth and positions from the

liechtenstein has long been recognized as one of the most free and prosperous countries in the world however there has been little analysis of liechtenstein s development because the scant research that existed was in german and therefore inaccessible to most american scholars furthermore many saw no need to study liechtenstein viewing it as an accident of history with an anachronistic political system liechtenstein s monarchy unlike the monarchies in most other european states retains extensive powers and is involved in the day today operations of government in fact in 2003 liechtensteiners voted to give the monarchy even more power prompting the bbc to remark that they had voted to make their prince an absolute monarch again recent scholarship however allows us to examine the reasons for liechtenstein s success david beattie former british ambassador to switzerland and liechtenstein published a comprehensive history of liechtenstein in 2004 this book along with pierre raton s earlier research provides sufficient material to analyze liechtenstein s development the work of economist and political philosopher hans hermann hoppe specifically his seminal book democracy the god that failed the economics and politics of monarchy democracy and natural order gives us a framework for analyzing liechtenstein s development in his book hoppe argues that contrary to popular belief the historical transition from monarchy to democracy represents decline not progress hoppe offers a two part thesis to support his theory first monarchs unlike democratic rulers tend to have low time preferences therefore they avoid if at all possible wars and high taxes for fear of hurting the state s long term capital value second there is a clear distinction between rulers and ruled under a monarchy this class consciousness as hoppe calls it encourages the public to resist governmental excesses the first part of this article will explain hoppe s thesis in detail focusing particularly on time preference and class consciousness two factors that have played a key role in liechtenstein s development the second part will apply hoppe s theory to liechtenstein s history the third part will explain why liechtenstein has maintained its freedom in an age of omnipotent government democracy u2013 the go hans hermann hoppe best price 24 77 buy new 37 61 as of 09 25 utc details hoppe s theory of monarchy and democracy it is first necessary to give hoppe s definition of time preference and his definition of a state time preference is the degree to which people value future benefits over present benefits a person with a low time preference is future oriented preferring savings and investments for example to current spending by contrast a person with a high time preference is present oriented preferring instant gratification hoppe defines a state as a territorial monopoly of ultimate decision making jurisdiction and expropriation of resources through property rights violations taxation states by nature tend to expand as the rulers try to increase the amount of territory under their jurisdiction furthermore rulers will tend to confiscate wealth at an increasing rate in short a state s rulers naturally utilize its resources for their own benefit in a monarchy the royal family owns the state since the reigning monarch maintains control of the state until his death passing ownership to his heir the state is in effect privately owned and hoppe therefore refers to hereditary monarchy as private government ownership a monarch will tax his subjects but he will keep taxes as low as possible because since he literally owns the state he has an incentive to keep his subjects as productive as possible high taxes ultimately decrease the state s long term capital value because when people produce things of value they expect to profit from their work however if taxes are high they have little incentive to keep producing as the fruits of their labor will only go to the state therefore as taxes increase productivity decreases high taxes then reduce the state s long term capital value and therefore the monarch s future tax revenue as a result monarchs tend to have low time preferences and thus keep taxes low to maintain the capital value of their taxation monopoly in fact monarchs frequently ran their own normal businesses so that they did not have to support themselves exclusively with tax revenue in a democracy by contrast the executive is usually a president or prime minister elected for a specified time usually four years he does not pass ownership of the state to his heirs and in fact does not own it himself instead presidents are best described as temporary caretakers or trustees the state is not owned by a private family but by the public therefore a democracy can be described as a publicly owned government since the president only controls the monopoly of taxation and jurisdiction for a short time his incentive is to exploit the state and its subjects as much as possible during his time in power a democratically elected president will have a high time preference thus in a democracy there is a high incentive for rulers to utilize high taxes to maximize their power while in office to support this theory hoppe notes that monarchs did not levy income taxes which punish productivity the income tax is a creation of democracy for the same reason monarchies accumulate less debt than democracies a king is less likely to borrow in excess because he is constrained in this natural inclination by the fact that as the government s private owner he and his heirs are considered personally liable for the payment of all government debts a monarch can become bankrupt and his creditors can force him to liquidate his assets to pay debt presidents by contrast tend to accumulate excessive debt the debts they amass are considered public not private a president unlike a monarch cannot be held personally liable this creates an increased incentive to accumulate massive debt to pass on to future generations a monarch as private owner of the state tends to favor preserving existing private property law and has little incentive to redistribute income and property he has little motivation to redistribute wealth through mechanisms such as tariffs welfare programs or subsidies to industry because the ultimate effect of any redistribution is to reward nonproductivity rewarding nonproductivity only encourages future nonproductivity therefore redistribution decreases a state s capital value by contrast a president and elected legislature will increasingly prefer to create positive public law in order to gain new constituencies of voters they do not own the state and therefore have no incentive to maintain its value thus under a democracy tariffs welfare programs and state aid to industry will become prevalent the redistribution of wealth that accompanies democracy has two effects both of which are negative first law becomes increasingly flexible and unpredictable this increases time preferences because there is little incentive to save if you know your property could be taken at any time businesses invest less and people save less furthermore it increases crime rates because law is constantly changing and there are no immutable standards second redistribution leads to an infantilization of society in which virtually all businesses and individuals depend on the government transferring income to someone who has done nothing to earn it rewards them for being unproductive thus redistribution encourages the problems it is designed to fix businesses who benefit from subsidies and tariffs become less efficient and ask for more tariffs and subsidies welfare recipients do not find work and instead demand more welfare as a result most western governments dedicate more than 50 percent of total expenditures to public welfare compared to almost nothing during the monarchical age this produces what hoppe calls a process of decivilization in which time preferences of rulers and ruled perpetually decline and government intrudes upon nearly all aspects of everyday life while all governments are expansive by nature monarchical governments prefer the least expensive and least violent means of acquiring new holdings a monarch who raises taxes to build an army risks decreasing the capital value of his state therefore he will expand his dominions through less expensive means such as political marriages and purchases when monarchs cannot expand through these methods and must go to war they fight on the cheap hiring mercenaries and discharging them at the end of the campaign a democratic ruler has an incentive to increase his state s territorial holdings through the quickest means available in order to either maximize his gains before leaving office or impress the voters to get reelected therefore rather than utilizing marriages and purchases a president will take territory by quicker means namely military conquest in fact the marriage and purchase options are unavailable to democratic rulers because a president does not own the state and therefore cannot convey any of it a second factor limits governmental power under a monarch a class consciousness among the subjects since a monarch privately owns the state he will distribute governmental jobs to his family friends and courtiers he has little incentive to give jobs to the general population as that would allow them to encroach upon his family s profits therefore under a monarchy a class consciousness develops in the general population the people see a clear distinction between themselves and the ruling class and therefore fiercely protect their liberties they resist heavy taxation and view wars as the monarch s problem not theirs thus the monarch lacks the power to conscript his subjects into the army and is relegated to hiring mercenaries the people also expect the monarch to finance wars himself in the old monarchies the rulers either financed wars themselves or with minimal taxation in democracies by contrast nationalism becomes the rule as the public seeing no distinction between rulers and ruled forms an emotional identification with the nation as a whole thus the public tolerates mass conscription and heavy taxation the personal characteristics of rulers decline under democracy as well monarchs receive their positions from accidents of birth therefore it is possible for a prince to be a harmless dilettante or even a good and moral person an elected president by contrast will almost certainly be a demagogue because democracy politicizes all aspects of life nothing is outside the realm of politics this state of affairs prevails under democracy because as mentioned above the distinction between rulers and ruled disappears since everyone can now join in the plunder the public will offer little resistance to governmental innovation this encourages politicians to stoke the masses envy by offering them handouts through social welfare programs under such a system the most successful politician will be merely the best demagogue a successful democratic politician has almost invariably been required to in the words of h l mencken 1926 p 118 abase himself before swine furthermore monarchy promotes a cosmopolitan outlook among princes because unlike democracy it discourages nationalism princes who lack a nationalistic outlook will learn the languages and customs of other territories and therefore be more adept at diplomacy thus monarchy leaves open the possibility of a benign ruler democracy guarantees that only the worst will rise to the top finally monarchical government gives libertarians an option of reform from above that is not available under democracy a monarch as mentioned above inherits his position by birth and therefore may well be a decent person democratic politicians by contrast are selected nowadays according to their demagogic talents and proven record as habitual immoralists and thus it is unlikely they could be converted to libertarian ideas application to liechtenstein formation of the state liechtenstein s formation conforms to hoppe s theory of private government the state was formed through the peaceful political purchases of two territories the house of liechtenstein began accumulating the territories that now comprise modern liechtenstein in 1699 when prince johann adam andreas von liechtenstein purchased the lordship of schellenberg the prince secured a first option on the territory of vaduz as well which he exercised in 1712 the previous owner had considered the territories revenues insufficient due to among other reasons social and financial instability and a lack of natural resources and wanted to find a buyer who was rich enough not to need the revenues from the two territories austrian emperor charles vi allowed hans adam s successor prince anton florian to combine the territories under the house of liechtenstein s name in 1719 making it the 343rd state of the holy roman empire the principality remained within the empire until it achieved full sovereignty in 1806 foreign policy time preference and class consciousness have restrained liechtenstein s foreign policy with the abolition of the army providing perhaps the best example when the austro prussian war began in 1866 liechtenstein favored its neighbor austria as the house of liechtenstein and the house of habsburg had enjoyed a long relationship prince johann ii led an army of eighty liechtensteiners into the war in the italian theater as hoppe s theory would predict johann ii financed the campaign himself indeed he had been maintaining the army entirely with his own funds at the war s end the german confederation dissolved and as a member of the confederation liechtenstein had been obligated to maintain an army with this obligation gone according to raton 1970 pp 45 46 johann ii saw the army as an unnecessary expense and dissolved it in 1868 it should be noted that raton and beattie disagree about the abolition of the army as mentioned above raton characterizes it as a unilateral cost cutting decision by johann ii beattie 2004a p 30 by contrast claims that when the war ended parliament seized its chance to refuse approval of further military expenditure johann ii in beattie s account opposed parliament but ultimately conceded under either scenario however liechtenstein s private government played a key role in the elimination of the army if raton is correct then johann ii s low time preference caused him to view the army as an unnecessary drain on his capital class consciousness plays the key role in beattie s account as parliament is the governmental branch closest to the people if parliament forced johann to disband the army they were likely reflecting the class consciousness of their constituents who saw a standing army as a threat to liberty liechtenstein continued its policy of not maintaining a standing army throughout both world wars johann ii even resisted some popular pressure to revive the army to help austria during world war i beattie 2004a pp 39 40 writes that given the strongly pro austrian mood in the principality and the house of liechtenstein s historical connections with austria it is perhaps surprising that johann ii should have taken as firm and far sighted a position as he did it would be difficult to find a better historical example of a ruler s farsightedness saving his people from disaster economic policies time preference and class consciousness have kept business and personal taxes low throughout liechtenstein s history the tax code unlike that in the united states is not excessively detailed the tax system is progressive and the maximum personal income tax rate combined national and local is only 17 01 percent there is a progressive wealth or assets tax as well but the maximum rate is only 8 5 percent since the 1920s liechtenstein s business tax policies have focused more on existing capital than on created wealth income and profits although there have been changes to adjust to the economic climate and they have always remained low this policy reflects a low time preference because it allows business and industry to increase the state s long term capital value they retain a large portion of the wealth they generate and utilize it to conduct research and development this has led to advances in research and development that would not be expected given liechtenstein s small size for example in 2000 industrial firms in liechtenstein spent about 5 percent of their export turnover on research and development with 11 percent of their personnel devoted to that area liechtenstein has instituted some social welfare programs such as social security health disability and unemployment insurance this should not be a surprise given the country s location on a continent of welfare states however liechtenstein s welfare spending is considerably lower than democratic welfare states where as mentioned above welfare spending usually consumes more than 50 of government expenditures in 2001 liechtenstein spent only 20 of its budget on social welfare beattie 2004a p 347 notes that liechtenstein lacks a benefits culture and its welfare programs are based on reciprocity obliging recipients to find work as soon as possible to avoid dependency on the state class consciousness has played an important role in restraining state intervention in the economy in liechtenstein in describing the attitude of the people of liechtenstein for example beattie 2004a pp 275 76 notes that the state s demands have been limited by the traditional sometimes excessive vigilance of the voters who have a strong prejudice against big government liechtenstein s policy on tax evasion provides a striking example of the country s prejudice against big government in liechtenstein unlike in most western democracies tax evasion is not a crime though it is a civil offense the reason for this according to beattie 2004a p 322 is that the citizen is to be regarded as a trustworthy and informed person rather than an administered unit any american who has endured an irs audit knows that the opposite mindset prevails under mass democracy liechtenstein s people exhibit low time preferences and a healthy skepticism of taxation the result is a state where according to beattie 2004a p 323 tax policy is long term stable and predictable the intention is to leave as much freedom as possible to the citizens to decide on the best use for their own money tax decisions are taken close to the citizens and sometimes by them central and local government expenditure is transparent and closely monitored the administration is not plagued by fraud there are no large and wasteful bureaucracies and no speculative grand projects whose budgetary outcome is uncertain these qualities have restricted the government in other areas of the economy as well borrowing has never been a problem and there is literally no national debt nor is excessive spending a problem there has not even been a budget deficit for years business and industry have never received any state subsidies beattie 2004a p 140 notes that liechtenstein s industrial firms were left to sink or swim however as hoppe would predict they swam without government aid the monarchy today as mentioned above liechtenstein retains many characteristics of the old regime the monarchy has extensive powers including the right to appoint judges veto legislation and dissolve parliament furthermore as hoppe s theory would predict the monarchy maintains numerous businesses such as liechtenstein s lgt bank and a rice technology company so that it does not have to support itself with tax revenues the monarchy in fact is entirely self supported receiving no tax revenue the monarchy has also proven receptive to libertarian ideas prince hans adam ii who reigned as sovereign prince from 1989 until 2004 when he turned power over to his son he remains head of state eloquently defended his country s low taxes in a dispute with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd in 1996 the oecd began a project on harmful tax competition after a series of reports the oecd designated liechtenstein along with monaco andorra and other small states an uncooperative tax haven the oecd despite the fact that liechtenstein was not a member called for sanctions against liechtenstein unless it harmonized its tax policies and banking secrecy laws with those of the larger more centralized democracies low taxes and liberal banking secrecy the oecd contended encouraged international businesses to move capital into smaller jurisdictions prince hans adam ii in an effort to get liechtenstein removed from the list began negotiations with the oecd however when the oecd refused to give liechtenstein the same treatment it would give a member state he ended the negotiations hans adam offered prescient criticisms of economic centralization during the debate with the oecd he argued that despite the good intentions of oecd members the ultimate result of their proposals would be a world wide tax cartel the prince noted that centralized taxation and limited financial privacy would treat ordinary citizens like criminals forcing them to prove their innocence even when they had not been accused of a crime even criminals he pointed out are considered innocent until proven guilty beattie 2004a p 331 explains this position in his account of hans adam s 29 march 2001 speech from the throne a comprehensive and world wide exchange of information would leave citizens completely transparent before the state in all their financial affairs obliged permanently unlike the common criminal to prove their innocence to the authorities the intentions might be good but the logical consequence would be a world government called the oecd responsible to nobody except a few politicians pulling the strings in the background hans adam succeeded in a libertarian reform from above when liechtensteiners approved his package of constitutional amendments in 2003 beattie 2004a p 176 notes that article i was amended to read the purpose of the principality of liechtenstein is to enable the people living within its borders to live in freedom and peace with each other this sentence beattie 2004a p 176 says was inserted to emphasise that membership of the state is based on free will and that the state is not an end in itself under democracy however the state tends to indeed become an end in itself democracies are prone to an emotional nationalistic collectivism in which no dissent is tolerated and individuals are depersonalized in favor of a glorified abstract nation state erik von kuehnelt leddihn 1943 devoted an entire book appropriately titled the menace of the herd to this troubling feature of democracy referring to modern democracy as ochlocracy mob rule kuehnelt leddihn 1943 p 116 emphasis in original writes he only liberty compatible with the true spirit of ochlocracy is the collective liberty the liberty of a class or a nation state the us government s restrictions on civil liberties during world war i the war america entered to make the world safe for democracy provide perhaps the best evidence of this tendency of all the countries in the war america was arguably the most democratic yet as historian niall ferguson 1999 pp 222 23 has noted the most severe measures against dissent occurred in america he describes them as draconian and says they made a mockery of the allied powers claim to be fighting for freedom the prince s package of amendments contained another libertarian proposal a guaranteed right of communes to secede from the state some of his critics argued that the measure would encourage division and in any case was not necessary because the communes had a right to secede under existing provisions hans adam ii however wanted the right to secede explicitly stated for two reasons first he is a firm believer in the right of self determination and wanted to set an example internationally second in a particularly far sighted observation he noted that at some point switzerland might join the european union and if it did liechtenstein might well follow because of the close economic and political connections between the countries some communes however may not want to join the european union and codifying a right to secede would guarantee them a way to opt out interestingly hans adam s initial proposals on secession were not limited to communes he wanted to give districts and even individuals the right to secede his critics however considered these aspects unworkable beattie spends little time on the debate over hans adam s proposal to allow individuals to secede only noting that some critics argued that individuals could already secede by leaving the country however since individuals could already leave the country it would have made little sense to constitutionalize that right thus the prince likely wanted to guarantee individuals the right to declare themselves independent of the state in a manner similar to that suggested by libertarians such as herbert spencer 1851 hoppe 2001 and murray rothbard 1982 p 182 this proposal considered in light of the amendment to article i that emphasizes that membership in the principality is based on free will suggests that hans adam has been influenced by libertarian views on secession and the state as andrei kreptul 2003 notes even liberal democratic thinkers who recognize a right to secede consider the modern compulsory state absolutely necessary for a just society and do not favor secession by individuals however while liechtenstein resembles the old regime in many ways it is no longer a private government in form the monarchy no longer owns the state raton 1970 p 106 notes that the principality is no longer the personal property of the prince liechtenstein s constitution incorporates many elements of direct democracy and the people can even vote to abolish the monarchy thus the democratic idea that the public owns the state has taken hold even in liechtenstein the above discussion however strongly suggests that liechtenstein remains a private government in substance we must now address the question of why liechtenstein has retained the libertarian aspects of private government ownership when it is no longer a private government in form why liechtenstein maintains its freedom the answer to the question posed above is twofold first liechtenstein has been relatively insulated from the political ideas and violent upheavals associated with the french revolution while some democratic ideas have taken hold it would be impossible for them not to liechtenstein has not experienced any sudden violent changes in its political culture second while some democratic ideas have taken hold the state s small size discourages democratic politicians from pursuing any radical changes insulation from the french revolution the french revolution and its aftermath extending up to the present day caused most of the west s current problems and liechtenstein s relative insulation from these events explains its prosperity as erik von kuehnelt leddihn 1990 p 319 famously wrote for the average person all problems date to world war ii for the more informed to world war i for the genuine historian to the french revolution thus our inquiry begins with the french revolution the french revolution marked the rebirth of mass democracy in the west before that time nearly all western governments had been relatively decentralized monarchies or aristocratic elitist republics though they did centralize the process was slow and certain restrictions on liberty were never tolerated for example no monarch not even the most despotic could institute mass conscription kuehneltleddihn 1990 p 22 emphasis in original illustrates this point t seems that monarchs such as louis xiv joseph ii or george iii were genuine liberals by modern standards none of them could have issued a decree drafting male subjects into his army nor a decree regulating the diet of his citizens nor one demanding a general confession of all economic activities from the head of each household not until the democratic age were conscription prohibition and income tax declarations made into law by the people s representatives who have far greater power than absolute monarchs ever dreamed of the french revolution led to the rise of nationalism monarchy being an international institution was not conducive to the rise of nationalism as most monarchs were foreign to the people they ruled married to a foreigner or both furthermore as mentioned above the subjects of a monarchy are less inclined to link their interests with the state as a whole the monarchies managed to temporarily stem the tide of nationalism and democracy after waterloo but the seed had been sown democracy gained ground until it finally destroyed europe s monarchies at the end of world war i by the end of that war most of europe s monarchs had either been overthrown as in france germany and austria or reduced to figurehead status as in the united kingdom thus hoppe s process of decivilization began with the french revolution liechtenstein however managed to avoid becoming entangled in these tumults for example raton 1970 pp 29 30 103 notes that the revolutions of 1848 had little effect in liechtenstein there was some initial unrest but it quickly subsided without causing any significant political changes several factors combined to insulate liechtenstein from experiencing any wholesale change in its political culture some of the reasons are fairly obvious liechtenstein has no natural resources and is located in relatively remote mountainous terrain although it became one of the wealthiest countries in europe after world war ii liechtenstein was poor throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries these facts combined with liechtenstein s small size to make it an unattractive target for potential conquerors hitler for example contemptuously dismissed the country as insignificant geography was not the only thing that insulated liechtenstein while the rest of europe went to war however its monarchs played a leading role as well in fact liechtenstein probably would not have survived the napoleonic wars and world war i without the efforts of its respective princes during those troubled times during the napoleonic wars beattie 2004a p 21 notes liechtenstein ought logically to have vanished from the map of europe when napoleon defeated austria he dispossessed many smaller german rulers and liechtenstein would have been an ideal territory with which to compensate them napoleon forced the holy roman emperor franz to abdicate and started the confederation of the rhine a collection of sixteen german states including liechtenstein under his protection it made little sense for napoleon to include liechtenstein in the confederation as it was incongruous among these much bigger fish this was all the more surprising given prince johann i s refusal to renounce his loyalty to vienna and place himself directly under napoleon uncharacteristically napoleon went out of his way to accommodate johann including a clause in the act that formed the confederation that allowed any ruler who wished to remain loyal to a foreign power to abdicate in favor of one of his sons this clause apparently designed for johann s situation let him abdicate in favor of his three year old son who was obviously in no position to rule napoleon maintained this stance even when german rulers requested that he give them liechtenstein the reasons for napoleon s partiality toward johann are unclear johann clearly made every effort to retain his principality because he knew that if the house of liechtenstein lost it they would lose their princely status and become mere members of the upper aristocracy napoleon apparently liked and admired johann on a personal level and might have believed johann could be useful as a contact in vienna or a replacement for uncooperative german rulers what is clear is that liechtenstein would not have survived the napoleonic wars without johann i s diplomatic skill independence of mind and determination to retain his principality thanks to the efforts of another johann johann ii liechtenstein survived world war i the war that destroyed the old order throughout the rest of europe as mentioned above johann despite some popular pressure to enter the war alongside austria liechtenstein s close ally at the time austria represented liechtenstein s interests abroad maintained a policy of strict neutrality had he fought with the allies his country would likely have fallen victim to woodrow wilson s efforts to make the world safe for democracy after the war the allies dissolved the austrian empire this prompted johann ii to realign liechtenstein away from austria and toward neutral switzerland for representation abroad johann ii s farsighted policies his dissolving of the army policy of neutrality during world war i and realignment with switzerland laid the foundation for his country to remain neutral during world war ii under franz josef ii and thus avoid another great disaster of the twentieth century the clever diplomacy of johann i and foresight of johann ii reflect two aforementioned traits common to monarchical rulers but usually altogether missing in democratic leaders cosmopolitanism and farsightedness johann i s cosmopolitanism and diplomatic skill earned the respect and admiration of one of history s greatest most ruthless conquerors who then displayed his admiration by preserving johann i s principality when it may have been in his best interest to confiscate it johann ii s foresight saved it from world war i and laid the foundation for its neutrality in world war ii it is doubtful that a democratic ruler could have saved liechtenstein from either the napoleonic wars or the world wars liechtenstein s insulation from the french revolution helps explain its libertarian tendencies changes in the country s conception of the relationship between government and people have been slow and piecemeal rather than quick and violent the monarchy s extensive powers exert a moderating influence on liechtenstein s politicians they avoid proposing any drastic changes for fear of a royal veto and under franz josef ii they would even discuss potential laws with the prince before proposing them hans adam ii has utilized less conventional methods such as his speeches and the media to get his message across therefore while the country is no longer a private government in form in today s day and age it would be virtually impossible for a monarch to claim a state as his property it remains a private government in substance the old monarchical policies of minimal taxation and intervention in the economy remain in place the result is a degree of liberty and prosperity not found in any other western state the continued primacy of the monarchy beattie 2004a p 225 notes that hans adam ii has sometimes been described as a party in his own right discourages the worst demagogues from even entering politics power hungry demagogues are unlikely to try to rise to power when they know they will always remain below the monarchy in influence jaime balmes 1850 p 143 eloquently describes this advantage of monarchy regarding things in the abstract there is nothing more strikingly absurd than hereditary monarchy the succession secured to a family which may at any time place on the throne a child a fool or a wretch and yet in practice there is nothing more wise prudent and provident this has been taught by the long experience of ages it has been shown by reason and proved by the sad warnings of those nations who have tried elective monarchy now what is the cause of this it is what we are endeavoring to explain hereditary monarchy precludes all the hopes of irregular ambition without that society always contains a germ of trouble a principle of revolt which is nourished by those who conceive a hope of one day obtaining the command in quiet times and under an hereditary monarchy a subject however rich however distinguished he may be for his talent or his valour cannot without madness hope to be king and such a thought never enters his head but change the circumstances admit i will not say the probability but the possibility of such an event and you will see that there will immediately be ardent candidates the size of the state another factor has helped restrain the growth of government in liechtenstein the principality s small size liechtenstein covers a small territorial area and the population was only 33 525 in 2001 small states have little incentive to interfere in the economy for several reasons first all areas of the state are in close proximity to neighboring states making it easy for citizens to learn about other states and if necessary vote with their feet by moving citizens of small states can emigrate easily because they are invariably close to a neighboring state this gives small states an incentive to keep taxes low and generally maximize prosperity by intervening as little in the economy as possible unlike large states who can for the most part tax and spend as they please because it is difficult for their citizens to leave small states must compete with other governments hans adam ii has observed this and views it positively he has argued that states must compete with each other peacefully to offer their customers service at the lowest price large states by contrast dislike competition the united states has taken this to extreme lengths recently increasing taxes on americans who live abroad and thereby prompting many to renounce their citizenship the united states is the only developed country that taxes it citizens while they live overseas this policy is particularly egregious given that americans who do not live in america receive none of the supposed benefits of american citizenship second protectionism can be disastrous in a small state in a large state such as the united states people can remain prosperous despite excessive tariffs as long as the government does not restrict internal trade as most goods can be obtained within the borders in a small state by contrast the internal economy is far less diverse and people must trade with neighboring states to subsist therefore as legal philosopher carlo lottieri 2002 pp 35 36 writes swiss cantons liechtenstein san marino andorra or monaco never dreamed of obtaining advantages by refusing international trade these small political communities the true and only heirs of the great european spirit are interested in the diffusion of libertarian and freemarket principles they want to export their specialties and buy all the goods they can t or won t produce in fact these small political entities are in the best position to teach an important lesson the international division of labor is useful for individuals families communities and companies finally as lottieri 2002 pp 34 35 notes citizens of a small state are less likely to tolerate redistributive programs than their large state counterparts in a large state the costs of redistribution programs can be spread out among millions of taxpayers thus the economic consequences are not so immediately apparent as to cause a revolt in a small state by contrast the impact from tax increases would be felt instantaneously and would provoke either revolt or mass emigration liechtenstein s insulation from the french revolution and its small size have made it the one of the freest if not the freest states in the west the uninterrupted strength of the monarchy has left the old policies of limited intervention and low taxes largely intact furthermore while the state has democratized it has not been overrun by demagogues because the monarchy s preeminent place discourages them from entering the political arena finally elected politicians are unlikely to pursue any radical interventionist policies because liechtenstein s small size precludes them conclusion liechtenstein is important for students of liberty throughout its history the low time preferences of its rulers and high degree of class consciousness among its people have combined to minimize the growth of government accidents of geography and highly competent leadership have insulated the principality from the upheavals accompanied by the rise of democracy hoppe s theory of private government helps explain the principality s continued success and in turn liechtenstein s development provides ample evidence of his theory s validity however it should be noted that liechtenstein has adopted policies some libertarians may find objectionable for example there is an official religion catholicism and religious instruction is mandatory in public schools catholic churches receive taxpayer funds however the constitution guarantees freedom of conscience so liechtensteiners are still free to choose their own religion drugs and prostitution are illegal but this is slowly changing at least regarding drugs according to beattie 2004a p 347 liechtenstein s philosophy is to give support to everyone in their personal responsibility for looking after their own health rather than to prosecute them for behavior that endangers it thus liechtenstein is gradually decriminalizing drug consumption the principality is taking a slow approach in order not to compromise its neighbours interests send out wrong signals to the rest of the world or provoke an uncontrollable expansion of dealing and consumption liechtenstein s freedom and prosperity also gives libertarians an idea of what may be the most tolerable form of state in existence today this study suggests that if there must be a state in its modern democratic form a return to the old regime in which the state is the monarch s property seems impossible then the most tolerable form is a constitutional monarchy with the monarch retaining extensive powers to discourage demagoguery the state should also be restricted to a small area in both population and territory giving politicians little incentive to expand the state under such a situation as liechtenstein shows us monarchy is in the words of charles maurras the least evil and the possibility of something good skeptics may point to switzerland as a conflicting example of a free and prosperous democracy switzerland however is not the counterexample it appears to be at first glance democracy in switzerland differs from democracy in other western states as jonathan steinberg 1996 chap 3 and thomas fleiner 2002 point out switzerland is much less centralized than its neighbors cantonal and local governments enjoy considerable autonomy switzerland like liechtenstein has not adopted mass democracy in the style of the french revolution thus the source of swiss liberty is not modern mass democracy but a combination of localized direct democracy and genuine federalism not found in other western states in fact fleiner 2002 pp 108 112 argues that democracy could not function in switzerland without federalism and vice versa most importantly we should remember prince hans adam ii s desire to set an international example by constitutionalizing secession a return to monarchical rule in large states is likely impossible and in any case when considering modern nation states monarchy is only a lesser evil than democracy our goal should be to create through secessions tens of thousands of distinct countries regions and cantons and hundreds of thousands of independent free cities such as the present day

there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally advertisement the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debts but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments advertisement debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countriescape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratio averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation program s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates advertisement african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raise for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and nonproductive expenditures advertisement third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticized according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated into better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data show that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies advertisement senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating some of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and nonproductive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway sgr which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms advertisement governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks the oversubscription of recent eurobond issues eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed governments should bargain for competitive interest rates and accept only favorable bids governments should borrow for productive expenditure and manage proceeds from international bonds more prudently with integrity and transparency african countries should establish a continental position adopt international standards and guidelines to establish lines of accountability in rating agencies this will create a platform to enforce adherence to scientific rating methodology rating appeals regulating rating agencies and sufficient involvement of rated countries in the rating process misheck mutize

the plan to take out president donald trump why we may not seen the last of hillary clinton how globalism is a bad thing when we re dealing with a pandemic and why we shouldn t sleep on the middle east despite the apparent mutual stand down between the u s and iran all of that and more during my interview with michael rivero coming up after this week s market update gold and silver markets are advancing strongly this week perhaps they got a bit of a safe haven boost from the fear generated by wednesday s democrat presidential debate mike bloomberg s shaky performance made bernie sanders and his brand of socialism the de facto winner the rising threat of socialism as the dominant ideology of a major political party puts the stock market on shakier ground with joe biden sinking mayor bloomberg was supposed to be the moderate who could stop bernie s socialist insurgence but he was humiliated by elizabeth warren who went on the warpath against the billionaire while trying to out flank bernie on the left with identity group grievance mongering democrats hostility to wealth creators and their enthusiasm for higher taxes and massive new redistribution programs has wall street concerned investors aren t yet panicking though perhaps because they believe a socialist can t win a general election but economic risks and monetary risks loom regardless of who wins in november the federal reserve s furious efforts to keep the expansion going will likely fail at some point but our monetary planners are currently defining success as achieving higher rates of price inflation in the economy so by their own definition success suggests that hard asset prices will rise well gold closed thursday at a fresh multi year high as of this friday recording it s on the move again and gold prices currently trade at 1 643 an ounce and are up 3 6 for the week silver meanwhile is putting together a weekly gain of 4 1 to bring spot prices to 18 54 per ounce the white metal has broken out of a near term consolidation to reach multi week highs prices closed thursday just a few cents shy of a new high mark for the year as of this friday recording it currently sits above that mark and a strong weekly close above 18 50 should clear the way for an upside push toward the 20 level turning to platinum it s up 1 1 for the week to trade at 980 and palladium is spiking to new records again packing on more than 250 and another 10 4 this week prices for the chronically under supplied metal now come in at a whopping 2 703 an ounce but everything else pales in comparison to what has been

fair number of those fortunate investors who picked up some rhodium bars over the years and almost all of these folks are now selling rhodium and locking in some truly phenomenal gains all in all interest in precious metals is on the rise albeit still mostly under of the radar of wall street interest in digital alternative currencies also continues to percolate although bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remain priced well below their december 2017 peaks it s clear that they aren t going away rather than fight them some large corporations and even central banks are looking to co opt

is planning to launch a digital dollar that would trade outside the banking system however china s central bank is actively pursuing the concept china has invested heavily in cryptocurrency infrastructure and has reportedly filed 84 patents in pursuit of a new electronic currency payments system concerns about the legal and tax status of privately traded crypto coins represent a major impediment to more widespread adoption and use as of now it s difficult to spend cryptocurrencies in ordinary real world transactions security risks and the proliferation of cryptocurrency scams are also scaring some people away from buying into them this week a california man pleaded guilty to bilking nearly 150 million out of thousands of people worldwide through a digital currency scheme the scheme centered around a phony digital currency called gemcoin it was pitched as being backed by precious gemstones but the so called gemcoins were ultimately backed by nothing but fraudulent promises some digital coins out there claim to be backed by gold or silver some of these coin issuers mean well and actually have the metal in vaults but these types of vehicles should still be regarded as very risky no digital or exchange traded metals product can serve as a true proxy for owning physical bullion gold and silver coins bars and rounds you can actually hold in your hand carry no counter

have him on with us michael thanks for joining us again how are you michael rivero i m doing fine and thank you very much for having me on your show mike gleason yeah it s been quite a while since we last talked and i m super excited to have you back on and hear your thoughts on a number of topics here now for starters this is shaping up to be a tumultuous year though you would never guess it by looking at financial markets the coronavirus story is getting more dire by the day i ll ask you more about that in a moment it s also an election year but despite the massive disruptions to the supply chain in and out of china stocks are near all time highs still overshadowing safe haven assets like gold what do you make of the apparent lack of concern by equity investors considering the geopolitical backdrop here michael michael rivero well we know that the stock markets and equity markets are being propped up by the federal reserve money printing and a lot of that has to do with the fact that trump is running his 2020 campaign on the basis of the strong economy which obama tried to take credit for the other day which provoked a bit of a backlash looking at the economy more at the grassroots i m not sure that we re feeling the impact from the coronavirus just yet although we re hearing dire warnings about supply chain problems over in great britain jaguar land rover are saying they re going to run out of parts to build cars with in a matter of a few weeks because those parts are all made in china and regardless of how serious or not serious the actual virus is people are taking it seriously and it is having an impact on china s economy and sooner or later that is going to have a negative effect on our economy mike gleason how about the coronavirus michael obviously we re having to take information from the chinese government when it comes to the severity of all of this give us your thoughts on how big of an issue this may really be michael rivero well the problem is we don t really know because we don t have any sources of information we can trust to be telling us the truth i mean there are extreme views on both directions one side saying it s no big deal and the other side saying this is a slate wiper and part of the problem is that in the past we have seen like sars was overblown in the media to sell vaccines mers was overblown in the media to sell vaccines back in 2009 the when pigs fly flu was being oversold to push various vaccines and cures and because we know that past history a lot of people are looking at covid 19 and saying well this is just more of the same thing but as i mentioned before companies are taking this seriously they re shutting their doors apple just announced they re moving their production from china to taiwan because of fears about the virus and we are getting a lot of stories where a lot of people are being exposed so far interestingly enough only ethnic chinese are dying from it everybody else is basically the level of a small flu and a lot of people are starting to wonder if in fact this was something that was accidentally released from the wuhan bsl biological lab which is located very very close to the fish market where they re claiming the disease originated mike gleason yeah when a zerohedge talked about that idea i think they got banned from twitter so that s obviously not the party line it sounds like we ll have to continue to follow that story very interesting now the year started out with some serious concerns over world war iii breaking out after the u s assassinated and iranian general which prompted a military response from iran causing gold to spike on safe haven buying but that story lost steam quickly as calmer heads prevailed for the time being now it s hard to imagine that things are now hunky dory in the middle east but what say you here will we be talking about tensions with iran and the u s again anytime soon michael rivero yes i think that we will it s been no secret that the u s government wants to invade iran they want control of iran s oil more importantly what currency that oil is going to be sold for they want to impose private central banking on iran which is one of the last holdouts to refuse western style private central banking and as far as the calmer heads you re absolutely correct on that issue we had rohani the other day came on out and said that we were dangerously close to outright war because of that assassination and because the united states continues to blame iran for an attack on a saudi arabia facility even though the people on the ground are saying that it was actually carried out by isis and so i think the united states is going to continue to provoke iran any way that they can until iran does something that can be basically claimed to be the initiating event oh look what the iranians have done and we re all supposed to forget about all the things the united states has done to iran going all the way back to 1953 and the overthrow of mohammad mossadegh and the imposition of the shah and what happened in 1979 of course was the iranian people basically took their country back and the united states has not forgiven them for that because the attitude is once you re part of the american empire you stay part of the american empire mike gleason switching gears here a little bit michael i wanted to ask you about deep state operations here in the u s because that has been a major theme of the trump presidency to this point the russia gate investigations and then the impeachment attempt over the ukrainian situation was this all just a coup by the intelligence community or is trump overstating that and if it was a coup will these people pay the price i m talking about the likes of james comey strzok the so called whistleblower and others so was this a deep state coup and if it was should these people go to jail and will they go to jail michael rivero well it was an attempted coup basically an attempt to oust donald trump which began even before he took office as soon as he won the election in 2016 you were hearing all this talk about oh he must be impeached we know from the text messages between lisa page and peter strzok that they were talking about an emergency plan to get rid of trump and if you really look at all that they ve done since then this russia gate situation lying to the court this bogus dossier that was cooked up by christopher steele yeah it was an attempted coup d etat should they go to jail yes will they go to jail i seriously seriously doubt it we re hearing rumblings that william barr is launching some doj investigations which is why all of a sudden we re hearing this huge cry that barr should step down in fact the news was even saying he was considering stepping down the department of justice spokesman has said that s absolutely fake news barr has no intention of resigning at this time mike gleason now we re into the primary season we should get your thoughts on the election there s plenty of contention in the democratic party with the establishment there attempting to cheat bernie sanders and install a more favored candidate once again we heard that same kind of story from four years ago but what are your thoughts as to how the democrat primary might play out do you expect bernie to get the nomination or will bloomberg surge here or are we headed for chaos and a brokered convention let s get your thoughts there michael how do you assess the field of challengers from the left michael rivero well we know the democratic core does not want bernie sanders to win the nomination because they don t think the socialist president is going to be able to win against donald trump they were pushing joe biden but he s kind of self disrupting with all the wacky things that he s saying there bloomberg is in third place in the polls right now but he s being accused of literally using his fortune to buy his way into the presidency and a lot of people aren t comfortable with that buttigieg is facing an uphill battle against the more conservatives because of his being gay so yes i think we re headed to a brokered convention and i am still convinced that hillary clinton is trying to find some way she can insert herself back into the race mike gleason we ve heard some rumors about her maybe being on a ticket with bloomberg do you give any credence to those rumors and might that be something that actually lifts bloomberg to the nomination michael rivero well it certainly would be a very powerful combination and the bloomberg campaign will neither confirm or deny the rumors that came out from the judge report hillary clinton issued a statement saying that she s just standing on the sidelines and waving and will support whoever the nominee is which is neither a confirmation or denial so i think yeah it s definitely something that hillary is working to do and if she can t come out of the brokered convention as the nominee she may agree to be bloomberg s vice president at which point my advice to bloomberg is to hire a professional food taster wear your kevlar and stay out of small airplanes mike gleason getting back to the economy here where do you think you see things going economically i mean do you see it rolling over at some point or is it just going to keep chugging along here because in our view a strong economy here in the u s is likely to guarantee at a trump reelection do we have that about right what do you think michael rivero yeah absolutely if the economy continues to look good then trump is going to be reelected and so that means you have a lot of democrats who are out there hoping the economy takes a major upset between now and november because if the economy does go downhill yes they ll blame donald trump for it i mean this situation the other day where obama came out trying to take credit for the economic boom i mean that s nonsense even obama before he stepped out of the white house admitted that his laws that he passed here were a failure that they d spent all this money and they d lost four million jobs in the process i mean obama s not going to run for office ever again and so i think that this was sort of setting the stage for saying that trump really isn t to be given credit for the economic situation and that if it does go south the democratic talking point is going to be well we left the economy poised for this recovery and it was going to be really good and trump went and wrecked it and i think that s what they re kind of hoping for how actively they will try and derail the economy remains to be seen but at this point nothing is beyond possibility mike gleason sticking with the economic theme here is this a new era of unending bull markets under a federal reserve that will never stop stimulating or will they lose control at some point and what are the ramifications of all this stimulus and money printing that keeps these markets propped up seemingly forever michael rivero well the problem is that ordinary investors are being shut out they literally can t afford a lot of these key stocks that s one aspect of it the other one is that it s increasing the amount of debt that the nation is in because the federal reserve isn t giving this money away they re loaning it out at really low interest rates yes but still it s a loan and has to be repaid somewhere down the road and all this extra cash floating around of course devalues the individual dollar so those of us who work for a living we ve got money in our pocket that we already traded our labor for and all of this money printing by the federal reserve is causing that money in our pocket to lose buying power day by day it s almost like lord baltimore waved his wand and said your money is now worth less than it was yesterday we re already seeing signs of a recession about to start here japan s slipping a recession apple s earnings are way way off and we re seeing indicators that the iconic companies in the united states are in serious serious trouble macy s has just been downgraded to junk status by the rating agency their stock took a major fall today as well mike gleason talking more about inflation you alluded to that a moment ago the fed talks about wanting a 2 price inflation and you have to think at some point not only are they going to get that but they re probably going to see it go higher and they may lose control of it which often happens throughout history talk about that if you would do you think we re going to see an inflationary environment really take hold michael rivero well we re already in an inflationary environment i mean that s what all this excess money printing is all about they re inflating the money supply and of course prices will rise to absorb the available surplus cash when you have too much money chasing too few goods and services yeah the prices are going to go up so i think we re actually on the doorstep of a recession right now and i really have to question the mindset of the bankers over at the federal reserve where they want prices for ordinary americans to start going up mike gleason yeah it certainly seems pretty perverse to have the american consumer have less purchasing power with the dollars that they have in their pocket by 2 or whatever their arbitrary number is every year it s quite amazing that this is now the prevailing economic and monetary thought of the day that our money is supposed to be worth less and less on an ongoing basis and really inflation it s a tax on the wage earner i mean we ve got obviously the elites just raking it in based on all the cheap money that they re able to borrow and reinvest but the average american is really getting squeezed aren t they michael rivero they absolutely are i mean we re seeing prices go up rents are going up right now one in four renters are spending more of their paycheck on rent than on any other cost of living so as wages and salaries go down prices go up there s going to be a point where it s going to be a crossover and we re finding more and more people are sort of living between the rock and the hard place and we re seeing a lot of retail vacancies people don t have money to go out and spend on things so that s why we re seeing these iconic retailers who are going out of business now mike gleason is one of the reasons that you do see a recession coming also have to do with china i mean obviously that s a very big economy at this point we saw in i believe it was august of 2015 when the chinese stock market really showed some serious signs of stress we nearly had the next global financial crisis it was averted but that s a big economy and if the coronavirus continues to hurt them eventually the rest of the world going to feel that right michael rivero absolutely no question about it and now we re seeing the downside of globalism because the problem in any one country becomes a problem for the entire world we saw that back in 2008 with the collapse of the mortgage backed security fraud which should have been confined to the united states banking system and instead it almost wrecked several banks over in europe mike gleason how about gold michael we ve seen it reach a seven year high recently as we re talking here on wednesday afternoon it s back near where it was back in early january when bombs were flying in the middle east and we re now above 1 600 again any comments on what you ve seen from gold which continues to hold up quite well despite the fact that the dollar has done very well this year at least up through the end of last week give us your thoughts on metals and what kind of year you think we ll see in 2020 michael rivero well i m not an expert on valuing the metals but generally at least have part of your portfolio in silver and in gold because it s a great way of preserving your wealth it s always going to be there it s always going to hold its value there s never been such a thing as silver or gold crashing down to zero or being rated at junk status it s very stable i can t recommend enough having silver and gold in your portfolio mike gleason well michael as we begin to wrap up politics and the coronavirus are dominating the news in the u s are there any other stories that you think people should be watching maybe that we haven t touched on yet talk about anything else or other topics as we begin to close michael rivero well while we re all distracted with impeachment and politics and covid 19 the fact is the wars in the mid east are still going on people are still being killed vast sums of money are being spent dropping bombs on countries that have done absolutely nothing wrong to the united states of america other than be sitting over resources that are coveted by american corporations mike gleason well we ll leave it there always good to have you on michael it s great to have you back thanks for the time today and for your enlightening insights it s going to be quite an interesting year and i look forward to having you on again before long to dissect it as it unfolds now before we let you go please tell people more about how they can get your

who wins and who loses because of negative interest rates the snb s monetary policy is geared to counteracting upward pressure on the swiss franc against the euro keystone ti press alessandro crinari the swiss national bank s negative interest rates introduced five years ago are having an increasingly significant economic and social impact but despite criticism the snb does not want to remove them it considers the measure necessary to stop the swiss franc appreciating too much 5 minutes following the financial crisis of 2008 many central banks took an unprecedented series of measures to keep the banking sector afloat and to avert a possible economic depression these included historic interest rate cuts in the united states and the eurozone interest rates fell to almost zero a few years ago because the swiss franc is regularly used as a safe haven currency in times of crisis the snb was forced to go below zero five years ago the snb lowered its key interest rate to 0 75 in order to avoid a further appreciation of the swiss franc the primary purpose of low or negative interest rates is to encourage banks and other investors to invest their available capital in the economy rather than parking it with central banks at the same time because the cost of money is low companies can borrow from banks to finance new projects more easily in the case of the snb the main purpose of negative interest rates is to make the franc less attractive the snb has also used its currency reserves which total chf800 billion 815 billion to intervene in the foreign exchange market with the same objective businesses because negative interest rates keep the value of the swiss franc within limits they benefit primarily the export industry and the tourism sector companies active in the domestic market also benefit from low interest rates as they can get cheap loans the state with a total debt of almost chf200 billion the government cantons and municipalities have largely benefited from the low cost of money low interest rates have helped the government generate billions in surpluses over the past decade which can be used to reduce debt healthy public finances have also benefited taxpayers to some extent external content property owners because mortgage interest rates have been at unprecedentedly low levels for several years property owners also benefit from negative interest rates at the same time the prices of houses and apartments in many regions of switzerland have practically doubled within a decade banks financial institutions had to spend around chf2 billion in 2019 to pay the negative interest on the money they deposit with the snb seeing their margins reduced some banks also began to charge negative interest on their own customers accounts so far however this practice has applied only to assets over chf100 000 banks have also compensated for the losses by charging clients more account management fees more more swiss national bank expects profit of chf49 billion for 2019 this content was published on the swiss national bank snb expects to post an annual profit of chf49 billion 50 29 billion for 2019 read more swiss national bank expects profit of chf49 billion for 2019 savers for some years now savings have been earning interest at rates just above zero at the beginning of the 1990s people who had chf10 000 in a bank account still received up to chf500 in interest per year today at best one has to be content with a few dozen francs which are often used up again by the costs of keeping the account pension funds until about ten years ago pension funds were able to pay substantial interest to their policyholders thereby making a significant contribution to the growth of their old age assets this is no longer the case obliged to deposit at least part of their funds in secure investments such as bonds pension funds now earn much lower incomes which are only partially offset by investments in shares and real estate banks have also started to apply negative rates on funds deposited by pension funds the state pension scheme also faces similar problems although to a lesser extent the snb still sees no alternative it is obliged to adapt to the monetary policy pursued by other central banks starting with the european central bank the situation in the eurozone remains rather fragile and uncertain last autumn a number of major central banks eased their monetary policy signalling that they were likely to leave their reference rates at a low level for a prolonged period in recent years the snb has faced severe criticism with regard to negative interest rates the unions are urging the bank to use part of its profits for the state pension scheme and pension funds which have been penalised by the negative interest rate strategy snb president thomas jordan says the task of the central bank is not to pursue a social policy but to pursue the general interest of the country in recent years the swiss economy has grown slightly compared with many other european countries while unemployment had fallen to 2 3 at the end of 2019

service companies to show another month of growth much of the drop off was due to a weaker services sector where output fell for the first time in four years but manufacturing also ground almost to a halt due to a near stalling of orders ihs chief business economist chris williamson said in a statement he attributed some of the month s deterioration to the viral outbreak which weakened demand for travel and tourism one encouraging sign in the report was that businesses seem optimistic the slowdown will be only short lived for now companies like coca cola continue to grapple with the economic

by tomoyuki tachikawa kyodo news feb 21 2020 19 20 world all japan s yen may lose its long standing status as a safe haven asset with criticism mounting that prime minister shinzo abe has failed to take effective measures to curb the spread of a new pneumonia causing coronavirus raging in china after the 2008 global financial crisis emerging from the united states and european debt woes in early 2010s foreign investors have been inclined to boost their yen holdings when economic uncertainties push down share and other risk asset prices the japanese currency however has been recently on a downward trend although the outbreak of the new virus which has so far infected more than 75 000 people and killed over 2 000 has blurred the economic outlook and rattled asian stock markets as the new coronavirus has been spreading in japan many market participants have become reluctant to continue buying the yen as a safe haven asset said yuzo sakai chief manager of foreign exchange business promotion at ueda totan forex ltd local media including tv and internet news have reported daily about the situation on the diamond princess a coronavirus hit cruise ship docked in yokohama on wednesday the government said two elderly japanese cruise passengers have died abe is under scrutiny over his decision to keep thousands of passengers and crew confined on the ship which critics say increased the risk of group infections and led to over 600 confirmed cases the largest outside china where the virus originated fears may be growing in other countries that prime minister abe s poor handling has expanded infection of the new coronavirus sakai said adding under such circumstances many foreigners have apparently accelerated a sell off of japanese assets earlier this week while the benchmark 225 issue nikkei stock average briefly hit a fresh three month low the yen fell to its lowest level in 10 months against the u s dollar even after a magnitude 9 0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami triggered the fukushima nuclear disaster in march 2011 taking a heavy toll on the japanese economy demand for the yen did not recede as the dollar and euro were regarded as relatively risky assets but now there is little reason for investors to actively buy the yen by selling the u s and european currencies sooner or later the yen may lose its status as a safe haven asset sakai said other analysts say rising expectations that the latest epidemic would deal a further blow to japan s economy have also fueled yen selling the world s third biggest economy has been hit hard by the negative impact of a consumption tax hike in october japan s economy shrank an annualized real 6 3 percent in the october december quarter its sharpest drop in more than five years against a backdrop of the tax increase and a devastating typhoon government data showed earlier this month china is japan s largest trade partner if the chinese economy falls into a severe downturn japanese business activities are likely to become more sluggish there is a strong concern that japan s economy will continue slowing down in the aftermath of the spread of the new coronavirus the popularity of the yen has clearly declined said takeshi minami chief economist at the norinchukin research institute if the nation s economy languishes meanwhile the bank of japan may implement additional easing steps in an attempt to drive down the value of the yen and to prop up the country s exports a major engine of economic growth the depreciation of the yen usually bolsters exports by making japanese products cheaper abroad and increasing the value of overseas revenues in yen terms some observers say the yen has been sold amid speculation of further easing by the japanese central bank but minami rejected such a view saying boj s possible action has been already factored in by foreign exchange markets

financial measures in our earnings release which has been posted to our website it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to simon simon turner president and chief executive officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone let s begin on slide 3 2019 was a challenging year as macroeconomic uncertainty led to limited visibility notwithstanding these headwinds venator delivered 194 million of adjusted ebitda and 0 24 of adjusted diluted earnings per share we made significant progress on our strategic priorities in 2019 and delivered on those items within our control including improving our cost base strengthening our position in specialty and differentiated tio2 and advancing our customer tailored approach to reduce our tio2 price and margin volatility turning to slide 4 on our titanium dioxide segment in the fourth quarter our titanium dioxide segment generated 30 million of adjusted ebitda compared to 52 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the average tio2 selling price declined 4 in local currency compared to the prior year but remained stable on a sequential basis for the third consecutive quarter this reflects our ongoing approach of matching our supply network to customer commitments to reduce price and margin volatility prices for functional tio2 products were most impacted in europe on a year over year basis we exited the fourth quarter of 2019 with average prices in europe and asia below that of the more stable north american region on a u s dollar basis sequentially prices in local currency were relatively stable in our three main regions despite the historically softest quarter for demand titanium dioxide volumes increased 5 compared to the prior year period the increase which was in europe and north america was primarily a result of increased sales of new differentiated products improved availability of certain products and higher demand compared to the same period last year which was impacted by customer inventory reductions on a sequential basis tio2 volumes declined in line with normal seasonality before i highlight the regional trends impacting the tio2 industry i d like to update you on recent trends in specialty tio2 in the fourth quarter we experienced soft demand in certain specialty applications namely for textiles this was primarily a result of destocking within the textile supply chain in china and elsewhere in asia and was precipitated in part by the u s china trade disputes we estimate more than three quarters of global industry demand for these products in asia including china notwithstanding soft demand in textiles prices for our specialty tio2 products remained relatively stable adjusting for the impact of mix prices and demand for our specialty tio2 products tend to be more resilient across the cycle due to the applications into which we sell these dynamics underscore the investment in our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio to strengthen our position in these higher value applications we expect demand for our specialty and differentiated products to progressively improve throughout 2020 that said we continue to monitor the impact that coronavirus is having on demand and the supply chain it remains too early for us to provide an assessment of the ultimate impact as the situation is still evolving looking at our business regionally in north america demand increased in the fourth quarter compared to a weaker prior year quarter and was flat sequentially our average tio2 selling price in north america was stable both on a year over year and sequential basis reflecting our more stable customer mix and our customer tailored approach demand and pricing in asia stabilized in the fourth quarter however as i previously mentioned it is too early to opine on the impact of the coronavirus on growth in asia europe is our largest market for tio2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 volumes in europe increased modestly benefiting from higher sales of new differentiated products and improved demand compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 when customers reduce their inventory levels our average tio2 price in europe declined modestly in local currency compared to the prior year quarter and was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter raw material costs moved higher primarily from high grade ores these headwinds which were in line with our expectations were partially offset by a 3 million benefit from our business improvement program turning to the tio2 outlook for 2020 macroeconomic challenges are expected to remain in 2020 in the near term we expect volumes to improve sequentially and follow normal seasonal patterns specialty volumes are expected to progressively improve throughout the year subject to my comments earlier on china we expect more modest raw material cost inflation in 2020 and are actively engaged with customers to implement price increases in all regions to the inflationary pressures on our business longer term tio2 industry fundamentals remain favorable we remain focused on our customer tailored approach enhancing our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio and improving our cost competitiveness throughout the tio2 cycle turning to slide 5 on performance additives revenues declined 7 compared to the prior year period driven by a 5 decline in volumes and a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation our average selling price was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 i will provide some additional comments on the three main businesses within performance additives compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 color pigments volumes were primarily impacted by lower demand for products into construction related applications in north america and portfolio optimization as we exited some low margin business the impact from lower volumes was partially offset by lower raw material costs and the benefits of our cost and operational improvement initiatives timber treatment volumes declined compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower construction activity the average selling price and margins were impacted by an adverse mix of sales however it was offset by lower raw material and other costs functional additive volumes were impacted by weaker than expected demand for automotive coatings and plastics we are taking meaningful steps as part of our business improvement program to offset these market challenges and improve the profitability of this business the performance additives segment generated 4 million of adjusted ebitda in the quarter up 1 million compared to prior year quarter in 2019 performance of this segment is impacted by significant market forces especially in the automotive coatings plastics and construction applications in 2020 we expect to capture additional benefits from our self help initiatives we continue to explore a potential sale of the color pigments business this process is ongoing and we have set an aggressive time line the color pigments business generated 17 million of adjusted ebitda in 2019 and we expect to benefit from our targeted cost initiatives in 2020 but because we are actively involved in a process to explore the potential sale of our color pigments business we will not be providing additional commentary or taking questions on the matter turning to slide 6 we continue to be intensely focused on strengthening our business and improving our cash flow we accelerated our 2019 business improvement program and delivered 20 million of benefits in 2019 including 5 million in the fourth quarter double our original full year target we expect to complete all the actions necessary to deliver on our full 40 million target by the end of 2020 exiting the year at the full run rate level on an absolute basis this program is expected to deliver 12 million of benefit in 2020 this does not include the benefits which i highlighted as part of the color pigments review we are pleased with the execution to date and are confident in our ability to deliver the target benefits as promised i will now pass the call over to kurt to discuss our financials i will then return to provide some additional comments kurt kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks simon let s turn to slide 7 in the fourth quarter total adjusted ebitda declined 22 million compared to the prior year the decline is primarily attributable to the adverse price mix in our tio2 business and partially offset by higher volumes and the benefit of our business improvement program compared to the third quarter of 2019 total adjusted ebitda declined by 27 million seasonally lower sales volumes in tio2 and performance additives were the largest contributor to the sequential decline price mix was also a headwind due to a lower contribution of specialty tio2 we benefited in the quarter from improved fixed cost absorption in performance additives and our tio2 business as we built inventories in certain specialty and differentiated tio2 products to assist in the transfer of the business from pori turning to slide 8 and our capital resources at the end of the fourth quarter net debt totaled 695 million and our net leverage ratio was approximately 3 6 times our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda total liquidity was approximately 307 million at the end of the year consisting of 55 million in cash and 252 million of undrawn availability under our asset based revolving lending facility we do not have any significant debt maturities until 2024 we continue to enjoy relatively low cash taxes this is primarily a function of the countries where income is generated and the net operating losses from which we benefit in the quarter we recorded a 157 million tax expense in connection with recognizing a full valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets importantly this does not prevent us from being able to utilize the associated nols in future periods and enjoying a low cash tax rate which we expect to be 10 to 15 our outlook for capital expenditures in 2020 is 80 million to 90 million including business transfer capex from pori we will remain vigilant with our capex budget and could reduce this outflow further should market conditions warrant we expect cash interest in 2020 to be between 40 million to 45 million in 2020 we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 35 consistent with 2019 as we apply a normalized adjusted rate to better reflect the current weighted average tax rate applicable under the various jurisdictions in which we operate we continue to expect a long term adjusted effective tax rate to be 15 to 20 cash restructuring payments in 2020 are expected to total 15 million to 20 million this primarily includes our ongoing business improvement program calais and the cost savings related to our color pigments business other cash uses in 2020 are expected to be approximately 75 million primarily consisting of pension obligations joint venture capital expenditures and legal fees we preliminarily expect the net change in working capital to be a modest source of cash in 2020 this is subject to market conditions and other factors finally our pori related expenses are expected to total 15 million to 20 million in 2020 down from an outflow of 64 million in 2019 we recognize the importance of returning to positive free cash flow and remain intensely focused on reducing our cash uses including capex to transfer business from pori we continue to make considerable progress on the transfer of many of our specialty and differentiated products into the existing network as a result of the current economic environment and our financial resources we are exploring ways to optimize the remaining transfer of business from pori we believe this will include a lower total expected capital outlay and a lower associated ebitda benefit than originally estimated with a similar if not higher economic return we expect to update all material elements of our 2020 cash uses as necessary on our quarterly earnings calls with that i ll turn it back over to simon simon turner president and chief executive officer thank you kurt 2019 was a challenging year but we remain focused on executing on those items within our control in the near term we expect volumes to follow a more normal seasonal pattern in both tio2 and performance additives we expect an improvement in tio2 pricing and the benefits of our cost and operational improvement initiatives to partially offset inflationary pressures additionally we expect to continue to manage our manufacturing network aligning production with customer commitments we are focused on maximizing value to shareholders through the following we re committed to our customer tailored approach by which we actively manage our production network and inventories along with the implementation of a more diverse range of customer agreements the net effect reduces our price volatility evidence can be seen in our more stable 2019 pricing profile we are focused on strengthening our leadership position in specialty and differentiated tio2 made possible by our unique mix of assets our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio provides venator the ability to partner with customers in higher growth and higher value applications we continue to invest in strengthening and diversifying our product slate and it is these applications which contributed most of our 7 volume growth in 2019 we remain focused on enhancing our competitive position in all our businesses we accelerated the delivery of our business improvement program and delivered 20 million of ebitda improvements in 2019 versus the original target of 10 million we expect to deliver the remaining cost and operational efficiencies as promised including the incremental benefits related to our color pigments business additionally we are actively evaluating opportunities to optimize our manufacturing capabilities and cost base to further improve our profitability we remain intensely focused on reducing our cash uses and improving our free cash flow and are taking meaningful steps in 2020 as kurt mentioned we expect to reduce our capex spend by approximately 30 million and our spend related to pori closure is expected to decrease by approximately 45 million compared to 2019 we are fully committed to maximizing shareholder value through active portfolio optimization in the near term this includes exploring the potential sale of our color pigments business which is ongoing longer term tio2 industry fundamentals remain favorable we believe tio2 industry inventory levels improved in 2019 and are lower than they were this time last year capacity additions are well understood and in line with normalized industry growth rates we believe executing on our strategic priorities will enhance our competitiveness and create long term value for shareholders with that we thank you for your continued interest in venator i would now like to open the call for questions questions answers operator yes thank you and the first question comes from duffy fischer with barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning guys first question is you were talking about the changes that you re thinking about for the pori capex maybe i missed it but can you quantify how much different do you think the new plan will be from the old plan as far as end game ebitda drive and then the capex that we would need to spend for that simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so let me help you on that jeff it s simon here look i think september 2018 in which we announced our program for pori that was about 18 months back i think we can all see those 18 months have been pretty challenging we had a pretty significant destock in the second half of 2018 very modest growth in 2019 at the industry level and now of course as we enter the year we see further uncertainty with coronavirus and so forth so the circumstances have changed i would like to point out here that by far and away the largest part of the cash spend here at pori is in the closure and wind down costs and we have got most of that spend behind us of the 280 million we announced we spent 180 million that would leave us 100 million to run in full year 20 we d expect that to be around 20 million as kurt said so that s sort of like the lion s share of the cash on the capex side of the ledger which is to your question here we ve been exploring ways to optimize the remaining transfer of the business again and we expect that to come in at a higher economic return so look we are looking at a lower capex for the remaining portion that would entail a lower ebitda but of course as i said hopefully with a similar or higher economic return we re still working through that duffy we don t have a number yet that we re prepared to share in that regard we still got a little bit of a ways to run but i would point out that for many of our products the transfer is complete and behind us we spent 15 million in 19 with some more to spend in 2020 duffy fischer barclays analyst ok thank you and then if you could maybe just walk through your large end markets and how fast do you think consumption growth was for those end markets of tio2 in 2019 and then what would you anticipate for 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer ok so look as i said earlier 2018 was a terrible second half from a demand point of view i think our view is that 2018 the industry contracted by about 6 there was some more positive year on year growth in 2019 at the industry level nominal positive growth for us thanks mainly to our new products and we sort of outpaced that overall but if i think about it from a 2019 what sort of like advanced faster or slower i think in effect there s probably two tiers in that answer at the applications level rather than at the geographic level so let s think about the applications first i don t think that what we saw in 2019 between coatings and plastics at the aggregate level was dissimilar around the world but of course we would take out automotive coatings and parts of industrial which definitely were in that second tier of lower growth and from what we can see why we re not big on that in tio2 we re exposed to it in our additives business that is still persisting so that would be an example of the second tier predominantly i think we saw demand for our inks and other specialties coming through in 2019 in the way we expect it to which was at or even slightly above larger functional markets we would call out as a second tier a sort of textiles application and we had a very soft end to the year we called out on our previous call i think we called it again on this call so that again would be sort of like lower rate so if the question is by application where did we notice the difference i think we d have to center in on automotive coatings and textiles in the tio2 world and similarly in additives we would have seen that in autos and electronics to some extent and plastics and coating depending on which market you re in so that explains it by applications point of view and of course i think that obviously if we put the geography lens on that of course it was the chinese softness in the second half that stood out for us on a geographic base i hope that is responsive to the question of what we saw in 2019 2020 look absent coronavirus as we closed last year and coming off the back of a net contracted industry these past two years of let s call it 5 we would ordinarily expect the gdp plus rebound in 2020 the question is to what degree does coronavirus affect that or delay that and we don t have the answer to that i m not going to represent to you that we do but that would be our thinking hitherto we can t really say too much on coronavirus other than the year it started off the first six seven weeks of the year it started off our sales in the aggregate in line with our expectations for the first start of the year the only notable comment i could make was that i do think in the broader asia region there is some heightened concern around supply ability out of china for tio2 as a result of the coronavirus and that we have felt that a bit and heard that and received that a little more in this first start to the year i hope that helps duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys simon turner president and chief executive officer thanks duffy operator thank you and the next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you simon that was my focus as well the supply issue in china and how that might impact your operations in europe are you seeing yet any constraints on chinese imports into europe and could that support do you think some of these price initiatives that have been announced simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so there s a number of themes in that question i m going to break it out a little bit there let s focus a little bit about the chinese point reminder of course to everyone i think people are well aware that we are not seeking to be the largest importer of product into china we take technical specialty and differentiated products into china one of the smaller importers so we don t see the kind of direct head to head competition within china although what we have noted in the second half of last year was softness within china we ve noticed the gap in pricing kind of develop wider between local chinese prices and more western producer prices we ve noted that the majority of chinese producers have announced price increases in fact and i would point out that the smaller producers in china were already under pressure and this latest development with coronavirus will put them under even more pressure so while we might be hearing sort of like concerns around the ability of china s export we re certainly hearing that from our customers as i said we sort of yet to put any tangible evidence there that s why we ve been very cautious on calling it regarding the broader exports point what i would say to you is what we saw in 2019 was this sort of like repeat performance of 1 million tons of export out of china we continue to see that the lion s share of those exports went to emerging economies and that was second half loaded notably because of the trade disputes and so forth importantly though exports from china into the combined markets of north america and europe declined on aggregate by around 15 so hopefully those calibration points going to help answer your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very helpful and just lastly on feedstock or costs why were they up in 2019 simon and what s your expectation for 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer so i think if we took a overall raws and feedstock we said pretty early on in 2019 where we have some clarity there that we d expect to onboard around 40 million of inflationary pressure in 2019 three quarters of which would be in the feedstock area and that s basically how it played out in 2019 you may recall on our previous call we said that we didn t see the same kind of justification in case for similar type inflationary pressures in 2020 of course that s our view i think it s fair to say that we still expect more modest inflationary pressures in 2020 without giving a number i think we can say that the pattern remains from feedstock and within that predominantly high grade feedstock so the patents are quite clear it s fair to say also we continue to negotiate hard with our suppliers around the eventual inflation costs david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst good morning this is dylan campbell on for bob i was hoping you can provide some background on your recent price increase announcement i guess on the back of kind of raw material inflation one does that price increase cover that raw material inflation and then i guess the second is with lower inventory levels now and if we get into a situation where demand starts to improve again what is kind of the tio2 s sensitivity to tightening conditions considering the value stabilization efforts done by some of your peers simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah look let s be clear about stabilization we continue to be through our customer tailored approach advocates and proponents of stabilization we have stabilized our price over the last three quarters unfortunately we have onboarded some raw material costs so as we go out to customers we are looking at what has happened to date and what is yet to happen in 2020 as reasons why we will be adjusting prices upwards to restore margins of course as we saw in the stabilization process the rate of adjustment and movement quarter on quarter with prices was relatively small so we are prepared to go into what degree we cover raws because of course we re still negotiating with our consumers and if you could dylan remind me the last part of the question i would be grateful dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst yeah i guess the price increase and whether that s kind of recovering the raw material inflation that you expected to see simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah look i mean as i said earlier to my earlier answer we would ordinarily expect to see growth in this tio2 industry above gdp and a year after we d had two years after we had net contraction and where we progressively lowered year end inventories so i think we re well set there we ve taken the decision to go out because we want to tackle the margin pressures of course and as part of stabilization initiatives it remains to be seen what will happen with the tightness on the go forward basis for the rest of 2020 because we ve got this near term lack of clarity around the coronavirus but ordinarily we would expect it to outpace gdp and that of course would provide better conditions for price increase in 2020 dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and i guess on sales mix looks like that was down 2 on a year over year basis can you provide some color there and whether we can expect similar trends into 2020 for tio2 specifically simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i think that relates predominantly dylan to the specialty segment and i think as you re aware we closed last year with a soft specialty segment predominantly in our asia centered and china centered textiles application dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from p j juvekar with citi eric petrie citi analyst good morning simon it s eric petrie on for p j simon turner president and chief executive officer hey eric eric petrie citi analyst do you think we re at a trough with fourth quarter ebitda margins in tio2 or do you think there s still risks in first half at least attributed to coronavirus and the like simon turner president and chief executive officer well certainly the risk yes i think there s risk but of course that could play out in unexpected ways and that s quite hard to predict here i ve heard various people advance various reasons why it could be sort of like a net positive but from our point of view what we would say is of course it was a seasonal soft quarter in fourth quarter so of course you have absorption issues typically there we had some softness in specialty but we expect to see some stability of pricing as we cross the year from 2019 into 2020 and of course you ve heard our earlier comments about price increases eric petrie citi analyst thanks and secondly a competitor announced that they could close eu sulfate capacity at the end of this year or next could you do the same or talk about the competitive dynamics at duisburg and uerdingen simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean look of course could you go down the path of closing out yes you could and i think over this past many years we have faced up to those difficult decisions when plants have become older and subeconomic so yes you could of course our view though is you have to look at both the competitiveness of the plant and the net revenue stream that is included in each of those plants and i think as we alluded to in our call earlier in our prepared remarks in tio2 we will continue to further look for optimization and efficiency opportunities within our broader circuit reflecting the fact that 2019 will see the end of our currently running bip we found 10 million of color based improvement and it s a way of life in this business we expect to go back look for further opportunities and as we identify those we will share those with you eric petrie citi analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks for taking my question can you give us a little bit of color at least as to what insights you have as to the customer inventory levels and kind of where they stand relative to kind of the normal seasonal time for this simon turner president and chief executive officer if i go through it by region i don t think we d see anything out of the ordinary in the united states i d characterize those inventories at this time of year as normal similarly in europe we do not see any evidence and as i said to you earlier we have seen lower chinese exports on a net basis into europe and the united states combined in 2019 but i think that it s fair to say at the industry level that our calculations and estimates in venator suggest that the closing year end inventories at the industry level we re at least 10 lower than where they stood at the back end of 2018 so i think that s about as good as a metric we can give you john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great that s helpful and then just with regard to the color pigments business i know you can t comment on the asset sale can you give us some color as to the cost cutting program is working there and then kind of what you ve pulled out at this point and how that s progressing as you re kind of looking through 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean look we ve identified 10 it s not a front end loaded program similar to the tio2 area it s a mixture of projects a smaller running projects some of which don t require capex around a multiple instance of sites so it s not dissimilar in terms by way of phasing and fragmentation to its larger kind of tio2 cousin if you want to think about it that way john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color operator thank you and the next question comes from josh spector with ubs josh spector ubs analyst yeah hey guys just in terms of thinking about potential china impacts in 1q can you help us understand how much of your sales go directly into china and how much of europe and kind of rest of asia goes into products that you think ultimately end up in demand in china simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean that second one is pretty tough because if you think about ourselves into europe and north america into the larger established sort of like applications like coatings and plastics well a coatings that of course particularly generally don t travel very well having lots of liquids associated with the final product so the answer there is minimal i guess there s probably some special product coatings that does make it is so plastics in the sense that you tend to see a more specialty plastics aside you tend to see the more commoditized plastics flowing out of china into the rest of the world so i think that the second part of the question is really from our point of view there s not that much we sell into western markets that ends up being sold to consumers in china there will be some but not much in terms of the first part of the question the way i think about it is that we are one of the smaller exporters into china and i will be surprised if our sales of the fraction of the imports is greater than 10 of all imports so again they go to specialized and differentiated applications predominantly josh spector ubs analyst ok thanks and just in terms of your volume growth year over year you talked about that being led by new products so i assume volume loss last year you re not filling those same volumes i guess i m trying to think about that dynamic of maybe where you re selling those new products into and what are the kind of end markets where you re getting some additional traction simon turner president and chief executive officer well i m certainly happy to talk a little bit about that 7 year on year increase the bulk of that came from new products and the way to think about that i think is in three buckets it s about new type functional products and grades that we ve launched which have been extremely well taken up in plastics and industrial coatings types of segments and another way to think about that is from a diversification play point of view you ll recall that we took on the laminate s business which is a diversification play for us but again it was absent from prior year sales so that s the way we think about those new product sales josh spector ubs analyst ok thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america unknown speaker on for steve thanks for taking my question i wanted to talk about the middle east debottleneck projects do you see any product coming from the middle east and hitting europe from these projects simon turner president and chief executive officer we are not in a position to comment on that but we haven t seen anything of that type unknown speaker ok sure and just a little bit more high level are you seeing any further reductions of tio2 content by global paint manufacturers and conversely are there any new developments in r d regarding new applications or products that you think could benefit from increased tio2 simon turner president and chief executive officer i think fundamentally the answer to your first part of your question is no we re not seeing any it s quite stable prices have been stable and we have some turbulence in that regard some 10 years back almost now but no we don t see that as a fundamental driver and the second part of your question there s nothing near term that we see that would lead to any sort of even material radical improvements in overall tio2 consumption i wouldn t want to never say never of course there can be some embryonic applications that could lead to that in out years but that s really not a near term issue unknown speaker sure thank you operator thank you and the last question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies laurence alexander jefferies analyst hi could you benchmark what the current sales run rate is for the assets under a potential divestiture and as you ve seen sort of the mix of your business change has there been any significant change in seasonality first half versus back half compared to what was the run rate before the most recent downturn simon turner president and chief executive officer laurence this is simon can i just clarify the point of your question both of those parts of the question relates to the performance additives business laurence alexander jefferies analyst no sort of second one is just across the entire portfolio and then you referred earlier to sort of normal seasonality just want to be clear that that has not changed in any structural ways you ve shifted your portfolio mix simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so to be clear then the second part of your question is seasonality we do not see any fundamental shift in seasonality across tio2 or the performance additives business that s not to say necessarily though of course the sales would mimic that at all cases because as we ve seen over the past couple of years we ve had soft spots automotive i talked about earlier and our textiles segment at the back end of 2019 so of course there can be reasons that is apparently look like seasonality but we don t think the base seasonality has changed that s the second part of the question sorry could you repeat the first part about color laurence alexander jefferies analyst on just on the sales run rate that you re looking to divest you mentioned the ebitda i just want to double check if what the sales run rate is looking like kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer laurence this is kurt we ll follow up with you on the sales number we did want to provide greater transparency around the ebitda so you had a sense for what the contribution was from that color pigments business but because we haven t broken out the sales i don t have that with me right now happy to follow up with you later laurence alexander jefferies analyst ok thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks good morning i just wanted to go back to the china issue is there a way you could kind of share what you generated in sales and ebitda in china in 2019 simon turner president and chief executive officer broadly no i don t think we d be prepared to share that information arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst ok then and then also you commented on the export situation out of china and into europe as being potentially more benign could you share more details on that simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i didn t actually say it s potentially more benign well i may have inferred that let me back up and be as clear as i can be about it what i said is if we look back over these past period last year for instance or even prior to that what we have been saying about china is the trajectory of supply and build rate in china has been slowing of course we saw inspection environmental issues there s been a number of setbacks faced predominantly by but not exclusive by smaller chinese producers and the net effect of that coupled with the fact that western customers are extremely concerned to get supply reliability and quality consistency has meant that chinese exports to western markets of north america and europe while they have grown in last year specifically were actually lower than the prior year so there has been this notion that chinese products would go onwards and upwards into europe and north america and that has not happened i believe that fundamentally relates to the two factors i mentioned supply reliability for whatever reason and quality consistency arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and then just lastly if i may just on the price increase announcements i guess what would you characterize as your chances of success for these increased announcements and what would drive kind of success there maybe you can just contextualize that with your raw material outlook as well simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so look at a high level basis we are convicted to these price increases we have worked very closely to listen to our customers around managing their pricing and they have predictability for us our margins got compressed it looks like there s going to be a bit more of it so we re going to move our prices and we re aiming to offset our raw material inflationary pressures it remains to be seen as to how that plays out but i think that we are certainly convicted to support those in all major regions arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator thank you and the next comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley steve haynes morgan stanley analyst hi this is steve on for vincent just wanted to come back to the segment margin discussion in tio2 so if you guys did about 12 this year and if that s kind of what we re going to call trough then in 2017 and 2018 you were more in the mid 20 clearly you re probably not getting back to that level but can you kind of help us frame kind of what the expectation is this year kind of with that being in the bottom and the top kind of ends of the range kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is kurt i m happy to take that i think that our success in 2020 will largely be predicated on how successful we are with the sales price initiatives that we have we think that it was the prudent thing to do to pass along the raw material inflation that we ve seen in 2019 and as you have heard us outline we are aggressively tackling our costs which would also serve to improve our margins but difficult to put a number or even a range out there for you where we re still early in those price negotiations and so i think we ll wait and see how those come in steve haynes morgan stanley analyst ok thanks kurt operator thank you and the next question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst morning simon and kurt i just want to go back to the tio2 pricing also some of the dynamics going on on the ore side of things obviously you guys talked about wanting to offset higher ore costs from what i ve been hearing it seems high grade ore the availability of high grade ore seems to be questionable meaning high grade ore seems to be very tight supply demand wise so my question really is could we sort of enter 2020 with a situation where high grade ore is tighter than titanium dioxide and the industry actually struggles to pass through those higher ore costs and maybe you guys being far more sort of leveraged to ilmenite benefit from those dynamics simon turner president and chief executive officer well thanks for the question hassan i mean i think that this point about higher grade lower grade ores is a continuation of a theme that has developed over multiple years and of course you re right to point out the high grade markets are more sort of less sort of like vendor choices in those markets and it s true that we have seen in the higher grade buckets particularly in rutiles and to some extent some of the sort of operational ups and downs in chloride slags that that has become tighter i think we can see us sort of way through this near part of 2020 typically as we ve said before we would sort of like try to bolt down requirements and prices in the front half and then come back with second half typically six month type negotiation so i m not sure we re at the stage yet which you imply i would also say on the low grade that despite the fact that there are still inflationary pressures at the low grade level it s just they have not eventuated in a pattern that we ve seen on the high grade hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst understood understood helpful and as a follow up completely appreciate the fact that coronavirus ongoing tough to sort of figure out what demand impact it may have but obviously the supply side tends to be a bit more visible what are you guys seeing in terms of supply curtailments for tio2 in china on the back of the coronavirus simon turner president and chief executive officer i think as i said i take our comments here appropriately hassan in the sense that we re not the big window on the world for china in the world of tio2 because of the limited amount part we take in so we have seen and heard of the type of dynamics over the lunar new year where holidays were extended and whether that affected the workforce logistics infrastructure chem park and geography of course there were broader impacts that meant that supply got interrupted the question is does that rumble on and continue and that s the part we do not know the part we ve seen is curtailments and disruption over so like limited time window at and somewhat beyond the lunar new year we ve yet to see anything more fundamentally different from that hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst very helpful simon thanks so much operator thank you and the next question comes from jim sheehan with suntrust jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst morning simon what is your ultimate plans for the pori site is there any opportunity to monetize the remaining assets there and how would your exploring of options for capex and so forth affect that decision making simon turner president and chief executive officer well look i think an important point here to note is as we ve already transferred several of those specialty products we re still committed to further transfer of specialty business let s be very clear about that that is a strategic imperative for us within venator so of course what we re doing here is we have to be prudent with cash for well understood reasons and that forces us to examine each and every part of our cash usage including all parts of the current and anticipated capex build and that s what we re doing it s about prudency with cash it s no reflection on our commitment to specialty i want to be very very clear about that that s something we still deeply believe in are there opportunities to potentially sell the sites or part the sites yes there are are we exploring yes we are so we will leave no stone unturned there to see if there s alternative usage for that site we have been successful on several occasions in our past as we ve closed various sites and turn those into opportunities rather so i think that s a path we ll continue we ll give you a lot of focus on that in 2020 and of course we re going to work through our best option for being prudent with the cash and optimizing our return from other specialty business transfers and we ll update you when we get to that point we don t have that number here today jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok thank you and on your tio2 business what level of volume growth is realistic in 2020 given the improvements you ve made in your specialty production network and also new products do you expect to outgrow the market again in 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer i think it goes back jim to my earlier comment about coronavirus i think that there are times when this industry on the demand profile where things are more or less clear unfortunately we are in one of those latter periods where the demand is less clear near term so it really does heavily depend on how that evolves and it is evolving day to day week by week and all we can point you to is we would expect industry rebound at gdp plus in 2020 ordinarily and we d like to think that still happens and of course you have to factor in the fact that we are broadening diversifying and strengthening our product slate and of course that also plays into our ability to manage our volumes jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from roger spitz with bank of america roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you good morning your tio2 price was down 7 for the full year 2019 versus 18 but can you comment on what the 2019 price movement was bifurcated between chloride process tio2 and sulfite process for instance another large tio2 producer who has only chloride process tio2 reported its price was only down 1 for the full year of 19 simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i think look this is not a chloride sulfate situation per se at all this is first and foremost a regional footprint discussion because in 2018 with us having a 50 of our revenues in europe and the european dollar selling price being some 300 plus greater than north america that is what plays into a year on year price decline that is the driver not the application what i would say is that generally speaking our specialty tio2 which just happened to be exclusively sulfate of course those prices are more stable so they did not drop in that period in any material sense what i would say about the remainder of our business our functional sales we ve got a mixture of chloride and sulfate into those businesses and the way pricing evolved was more a function of customer size than it was of technology roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst i see i believe you said that global tio2 demand declined for the industry by 6 early in the call if i heard that correctly your volumes were up 7 in 2019 would that imply that you took market share simon turner president and chief executive officer so what i m saying is that let me back track again i said that in 2019 we estimate that the industry shrunk by 6 over sorry 18 shrunk over 17 by 6 and 19 grew by a modest amount let s call it 1 and so over that period that s 6 is related to the prior year but coming back to your 7 number it s a very straightforward assessment here if you pro forma out the extra diversified laminate acquisition and the introductions of specific new products we grew in line with the market roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you very much operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference to simon turner for any closing comments simon turner president and chief executive officer thank you thank you for your interest in venator and we look forward to speaking to and meeting with many of you throughout the quarter in the interim if you do have any issues please reach out to jeff with additional questions thanks again for joining the call and have a great weekend operator duration 61 minutes call participants jeffrey schnell chief executive officer simon turner president and chief executive

by graham peebles the new india is racing towards the altar of materialism and market fundamentalism abandoning its hallmark of spirituality its philosophical treasures and any notion of unity justice and service under the careful guidance of the world bank and the international monetary fund the indian government has for the last 20 years or so during which time inequality has doubled embraced market liberalization and the global market garlanded corporations with all manner of subsidies and damned the poor to greater poverty destitution suffering and suicide in a country of 1 2 billion people and counting all the numbers are mega seen through corporate tinted spectacles india is a marketplace unlike any other and provided business doors stay open 24 7 the international community meaning the usa and its bedmates will allow india to occupy kashmir murder rape and displace the needy and further marginalize the already marginalized have nots and billionaires there are according to arundhati roy around 450 million indians living in dire poverty the equivalent of the combined poor of all the countries of africa dire poverty means surviving on just 12 rupees 30 us cents a day or less and does not allow for anything other than bare survival is it possible to be healthy on such a sum to eat nutritiously or to eat at all to drink clean water sleep in clean clothes on a clean bed brush your teeth with toothpaste wear shoes while working or retain ones dignity all normal recognizable requirements of living are regarded as luxuries the divine seen as a fresh loaf of bread and men women and children shrouded in anxiety and despair condemned to a life of drudgery and exploitation but among the ugliness and agony of such widespread poverty there is good news billions of it the fabulous forbes list of money men places india fourth in the world league table of the largest number of billionaires 61 at the last count with a combined wealth of 250 billion us dollars these are incidentally rich billionaires unlike the german or japanese ones who are poor by comparison in addition to these billionaires there are around 200 000 dollar millionaires and between them they run the massive indian corporations that in turn run india middlemen and women while half a billion men women and children crawl through life on their 30 cents a day a river of rupees flows ceaselessly into the judiciary the body politic and the corporate lakes as arandhati roy says wealth is concentrated onto the tip of a shinning pin on which our billionaires pirouette indeed in a nation of 1 2 billion india s 100 richest people own assets equivalent to a quarter of the gdp power and rupees move unceasingly into the pockets of the wealthy and mega rich who are boosted by an economic system that ensures the flow of wealth goes upwards via what academic david harvey calls accumulation by dispossession this flow feeds a new middle class estimated to be between 30 and 50 million people professionals and semi professionals who have adapted to hallowed capitalist values to the delight of western corporations there is a huge market being created for the white goods and automobile makers huge demand for the products rajesh shukla of the centre for macro consumer research excitedly proclaims mention of such demand sends tremors of excitement and anticipation through businesses small and large while the people of orissa and kashmir jharkhand and west bengal starve and are displaced raped and persecuted in an economic world that sees everything through the simplistic prism of markets and profits nation states are recognized as vast department stores markets to be exploited until exhausted and returns maximized the natural environment stripped of all that is of value as for the ordinary people the rural poor who make up 70 per cent of the population and those who crowd into the glowing overcrowded filthy cities it s survival for the fittest growing inequality deepening poverty hailed as an economic miracle india is ranked by the united nations development programme undp 129th out of 146 countries on the human development index the number of poor people in the country has barely fallen over a 30 year period according to india today the poor in rural india were better fed 30 years ago by the government s own figures 50 per cent of the rural population 836 million people live in poverty surviving somehow on less than 50 us cents a day that is 20 cents more than those in dire poverty but still not what one would call comfortable furthermore according to indian government figures child malnutrition stands at 46 per cent the highest in the world in fact india comes 73rd out of 88 countries in the annual global hunger index six places lower than the previous year the 2010 multidimensional poverty index showed that bihar chhattisgarh jharkhand madhya pradesh orissa rajasthan uttar pradesh and west bengal have 421 million poor people according to the organization for economic cooperation and development india has the the highest number of poor in the world with the top 10 per cent earning 12 times that of the bottom 10 per cent compared to six times 20 years ago i e inequality under the economic miracle is growing apace there are sub divisions within the divisions as inequality stalks the land for example with the urban wealthy spending 221 per cent more than their rural rich cousins a chasm between the city comfortable and the rural desperate that is approaching cosmic proportions such are the contradictions and we have barely scratched the surface in a country where a mere 1 3 per cent according to palagummi sainath have enjoyed unprecedented success due to economic reforms the big growth story he maintains is inequality which has grown faster than any time in the last 50 years promising to cause the eath of democracy still it s not all bad news the richest billionaires in the world are indian and the world s most expensive house antilla a 27 story residential abomination is in mumbai it is built for india s richest man mukesh ambani whose personal wealth is said to be 20 billion dollars he holds a controlling share in reliance industries ltd which has interests in businesses ranging from oil to stem cell storage supermarkets to schools and of course the media everything everyone everywhere throughout india there is systematic movement towards the commercialization of the countryside the raping of the land for its bounty and the commoditization of each and every part of human existence all of this is impelled by the government which is happy to channel corporate propaganda and instil it in every mind and in every village in india the inevitable and unfortunate consequence is the death and destitution of obstacles to market fundamentalism mainly the adivasi and dalit people who are demonized as maoist terrorists by a government waging war not on terror but on its own marginalized and disadvantaged citizens in this situation to talk of human rights social justice or environmental concerns is to talk humbug in the face of a capitalist crusade that has might on its side to its advocates this is a model that is unchallengeable and beyond alternatives ideas of sharing and justice it is a model that is bathed in a misty glow of polished yet polluted uniformity one where the individual is absorbed into the consumer collective and told where to shop what to buy how to love and in which colour what to think and when to think it and if in doubt tune into your local

published sunday 23 february 2020 print disqus the decade of living dangerously what s the appeal affordability crisis social contract rigged system as i write this a self proclaimed democratic socialist is leading the race for one of our major parties presidential nomination the fact that so many americans especially young americans support bernie sanders ought to tell us something a quinnipiac poll out this week showed senator sanders with 54 support among democrats age 18 34 meanwhile 50 of adults under 38 told the harris poll last year that they would prefer living in a socialist country i don t believe they really want socialism few even understand what it is what they want is change they see little hope for improvement in their situations no matter how hard they work and sacrifice they don t see anyone in authority trying to help them so when someone offers what sound like easy answers they jump aboard as harvard professor ed glaeser says my paraphrase people think of socialism as hyperredistribution they are not looking to control the means of production per se just redistributing the fruits of that production in one regard sanders is similar to trump in 2016 an outsider whose message activates previously neglected voters trump went on to win if sanders gets the nomination it s easy to imagine scenarios where he wins too that the us could plausibly swing from someone like trump to someone like sanders in the space of four years says to me at least that something bigger is happening until we fix it desperate people will keep making desperate choices this week s letter will be a little bit different in that i want to focus on why so many of our fellow citizens find socialist ideas attractive and why even in the face of that i am a long term optimist for those paying attention there has never been a time so potentially dangerous but still offering so many incredible opportunities but first because of the frustrations of so many both left and right i think volatile swings between radically different political choices could become de rigeur for at least the next three election cycles if not longer the simple fact is that no political solution can deliver economic nirvana but until something happens like the great reset to force unwelcome change the cycle will continue and that is a reality we as investors have to face that theme of the decade of living dangerously is my focus for the 16th annual strategic investment conference may 11 14 in scottsdale it is a thinking investor s conference we will be looking at the entire investment landscape technological political geo political private and public investments from seemingly prosaic real estate to the latest new inventions casting our eyes around the globe looking for what the smartest investors in the world are doing to avoid danger and find opportunity every year for the last 15 years sic attendees have walked away saying how could you ever top this and last year was special with record breaking attendance and over the top presentations the closing day was amazing the sic is my art form i craft the experience to fit the needs of the time each sic is different because we are looking at different overarching questions i can honestly say it will be simply the best conference of the year for addressing the problems we face along with the potential the lineup of speakers many of whom are provocative thought leaders is designed to make us evaluate how our current portfolios will meet the challenges of the next few years and indeed the decade among the already confirmed faculty are investment legends sam zell leon cooperman and felix zulauf joining them are some of the smartest people i know in market analytics in investment strategy geopolitics fixed income hard assets evolving technologies and more including ben hunt of epsilon theory political pollster michael barone market analyst jim bianco venture capitalist david blumberg bain s head of macro trends karen harris dc insider bruce mehlman economist samuel rines longtime friend barry ritholtz china expert jonathan ward technology wizard cathie wood plus heavyweight real estate analysts ivy zelman and barry habib then there are sic favorites louis gave of gavekal economist david rosenberg bond expert lacy hunt geopolitical expert george friedman and the always popular money manager mark yusko as you may have heard this year we are reducing the number of attendees by 40 at the request of long time attendees over half of our attendees have been to five sics or more we believe it will make for a more collegial and intimate conference experience one you will not want to miss so please do yourself a favor and join us for one of the most exciting sics ever don t procrastinate i am very sure we will sell out and you know you want to be there so click the link and prepare to experience the most fulfilling three days of your investment life and now to our regular program to my generation socialism is the second s in ussr we grew up being taught the soviet union was a mortal foe bent on world domination we didn t have to wonder if this adversary had nuclear weapons we knew it could drop them on us any time remember duck and cover drills thankfully the threat of imminent nuclear war receded and attitudes changed in those who didn t grow up with it a 1974 poll showed 75 of americans aged 25 to 34 thought the us had moved dangerously close to socialism now 50 of young americans want to embrace what they think of as socialism its meaning isn t entirely clear to older generations either this mises institute article does a good job outlining the ideologies we call socialism broadly speaking they involve various degrees of collectivizing property and redistributing wealth those can sound pretty attractive if you have no property or wealth and threatening if you do this raises a question if the us economy is performing so well and the rising tide is lifting all boats why is socialism getting any traction at all public opinion data says this shouldn t be happening polls from gallup and others find solid majorities saying their financial condition improved in recent years or at least got no worse i see two answers to that one is in the question itself your financial condition can be better than it was but still not where you think it should be if you are no longer drowning and are instead treading water with no lifeboat in sight then yes your condition has improved but you re still looking for answers the broad better or worse responses are heavily weighted by political affiliation republicans say both their own condition and the economy are better democrats say both are worse they can t all be right source quartz polls that ask more specific questions find a considerably less rosy scenario for instance a december 2019 bankrate com survey found half of us workers didn t get any kind of pay raise in the last year gains in average hourly earnings may have been heavily weighted toward a smaller number of workers who got much larger raises another survey by salary finance of 2 700 us adults working at companies with 500 employees found 32 saying they ran out of money between paychecks that s consistent with the federal reserve s annual shed survey which last year found almost 40 of us adults would need to borrow money to cover a 400 emergency expense it also found an additional 18 of americans considered themselves just getting by and 7 finding it difficult to get by perhaps not coincidentally the fed reported this month that household debt balances hit 14 trillion an all time high this was actually low as a percentage of disposable income but disposable income is again highly weighted toward the top many at the bottom are in debt up to their eyeballs and we re not even in recession yet hence the dark humor like this source twitter from what i see it may be true that most americans are in better financial condition but i think ray dalio is right when he divides the country into a bottom 60 and top 40 more than half the country is in various degrees of trouble and they are open to anything they think might help them including what they think of as socialism last week i quoted from an article by annie lowrey in the atlantic the great affordability crisis breaking america we who watch macroeconomics tend to focus on aggregate numbers unemployment rate gdp growth and so on we can overlook the micro world hiding inside those numbers let me quote ms lowrey at length because she says this well in the 2010s the national unemployment rate dropped from a high of 9 9 percent to its current rate of just 3 5 percent the economy expanded each and every year wages picked up for high income workers as soon as the great recession ended and picked up for lower income workers in the second half of the decade americans confidence in the economy hit its highest point since 2000 right before the dot com bubble burst the headline economic numbers looked good if not great but beyond the headline economic numbers a multifarious and strangely invisible economic crisis metastasized let s call it the great affordability crisis this crisis involved not just what families earned but the other half of the ledger too how they spent their earnings in one of the best decades the american economy has ever recorded families were bled dry by landlords hospital administrators university bursars and child care centers for millions a roaring economy felt precarious or downright terrible viewing the economy through a cost of living paradigm helps explain why roughly two in five american adults would struggle to come up with 400 in an emergency so many years after the great recession ended it helps explain why one in five adults is unable to pay the current month s bills in full it demonstrates why a surprise furnace repair bill parking ticket court fee or medical expense remains ruinous for so many american families despite all the wealth this country has generated fully one in three households is classified as financially fragile along with the rise of inequality the slowdown in productivity growth and the shrinking of the middle class the spiraling cost of living has become a central facet of american economic life it is a crisis amenable to policy solutions at the state local and federal levels with all of the 2020 candidates president donald trump included teasing or pushing sweeping solutions for the problem but absent those solutions it looks certain to get worse for the foreseeable future leaving households fragile exacerbating the country s inequality slowing down growth smothering productivity and putting families dreams of security out of reach for many and maybe most americans life is a constant struggle to make ends meet they see prices rising for the things they need to survive even as the president says there s no inflation the central bank that supposedly works for them actually wants more inflation not less this hasn t always been the case not so long ago you could work your way through college with a part time job afford a small home or apartment in a city or suburb where jobs were available see a doctor if you got sick and send your kids to decent public schools those are now out of reach for millions and while some certainly made poor choices it is not entirely or even primarily their fault many people perceive with some justification that the economy is rigged against them correct or not that perception opened the door for trump in 2016 we have seen significant improvement since then but clearly not enough the door is still open for anyone who can present a convincing argument their way is better if their way is somewhere on the socialist spectrum millions will be receptive to trying it there is a way to close that door and it s pretty simple solve the problems that are making socialism seem attractive and capitalism seem evil unfortunately i don t see much interest from the people who would need to do it what i do see is a belief not entirely wrong that more economic growth will fix everything the problem is it will take time and people are hurting now and for reasons i have outlined in previous letters our debt burdened society has borrowed growth from the future that pied piper of current growth is getting ready to be repaid take healthcare it is not the case that everything was fine before obamacare there were serious problems for one people under 65 with preexisting conditions were effectively uninsurable unless they had employer coverage now health insurance is available to all but only at staggering cost bernie sanders elizabeth warren and others keep talking about a wealth tax to fund national health care student loan forgiveness and other benefits others talk about much higher income taxes or a return to higher corporate taxes these are terrible ideas but i get why people want them it is gallows humor to note that the impulse to pay for the redistribution of income and wealth with higher taxes seemingly comes from the desire to balance the budget we can pick death by higher taxes or bigger deficits there are no other choices humans may be social creatures but today s societies didn t come easy it took millennia of precarious survival of the fittest to arrive at the social contract that defines human relations the norms of how we treat each other and how the state treats people are incredibly important and they are breaking down that s not a pleasant thought but it is growing harder to deny the mckinsey global institute has a new report the social contract in the 21st century outcomes so far for workers consumers and savers in advanced economies it is bleak reading mckinsey s findings in summary my emphasis in bold hile opportunities for work have expanded and employment rates have risen to record levels in many countries work polarization and income stagnation are real and widespread the cost of many discretionary goods and services has fallen sharply but basic necessities such as housing healthcare and education are absorbing an ever larger proportion of incomes coupled with wage stagnation effects this is eroding the welfare of the bottom three quintiles of the population by income level roughly 500 million people in 22 countries public pensions are being scaled back and roughly the same three quintiles of the population do not or cannot save enough to make up the difference these shifts point to an evolution in the social contract the arrangements and expectations often implicit that govern the exchanges between individuals and institutions broadly individuals have had to assume greater responsibility for their economic outcomes while many have benefited from this evolution for a significant number of individuals the changes are spurring uncertainty pessimism and a general loss of trust in institutions this isn t imaginary and it is not solely about individual responsibility society really has changed in important structural ways achieving stability much less success is far more difficult for younger generations than it was for me and my boomer peers we can and should discuss how to ease those challenges without causing even greater harm in the process but pretending they don t exist or telling people to pull themselves up by bootstraps they don t have isn t the answer urging people who live paycheck to paycheck to save more is not realistic they have no money left after those fast growing expenses almost all saving occurs in the top 20 and certainly in the top 40 the lowest quintiles have negative savings i e are going into debt source wsj if you work for minimum wage or even 20 an hour with a family to support and someone comes along and promises you 1000 a month or to cover your student debt or medical services or child care that solves a problem you have right now the fact that giving even 40 million people 1000 a month would be a 480 billion additional tax and spend which would significantly impact the economy is just not in your personal equation for many it s already an easy choice after a recession and deeper economic malaise the financialization of the american economy has led to increasing income and wealth disparity as much as it pains me to say it the system really is rigged whatever the good intentions of the federal reserve in particular and the us government in general have been it has distorted the economic feedback loops that balance a true market based economic system the fact is we already have socialism today it s not the socialism we feared in 1974 we have socialized the risks of capitalism to the benefit of a small portion of the country while a larger portion struggles that s why bernie sanders may be on your ballot this november and why he could win if the economy worsens and there s a chance it will i long ago said japan was a bug in search of a windshield maybe i should have said china in either case it s beginning to look like virus covid 19 could be the windshield against which the global economy meets its maker i am not being gloom and doom i really believe the world is getting better and i see opportunity everywhere however if there is a recession and thus more people in pain if we haven t given people better answers they may choose socialism by default coupled with socialism by central banking and bureaucracy it s late and time to hit the send button let me close quickly by saying that these questions will be on the sic agenda have a great week your swear i am an optimist analyst

pull out all stops to keep the economy going elsewhere central banks in the philippines malaysia thailand and indonesia have cut interest rates while some countries are planning a fiscal stimulus in the us the markets now expect a rate cut by the us fed in june or july and as the bank of america survey of global fund managers for february said we now have full capitulation into a qe forever theme no wonder asset markets have remained buoyant the bank of america survey found that emerging markets are the most favoured destination for global fund managers and india continues to benefit from that trend nevertheless the indian markets have been cautious recently the macro situation has not improved much and there s now the uncertainty over the telecom dues to be paid to the government loan growth will at best see a dead cat bounce power sector stress has spread to new areas recoveries at the bankruptcy courts have fallen corporate india s december quarter results were poor and the current quarter could be worse the reserve bank of india monetary policy committee s ravindra dholakia a noted dove said that the long term growth revival depends critically on the fiscal policy and structural reforms when the long run revival is not seriously attempted any substantial recovery in the short run is also likely to be elusive and the monetary policy stimulus that works only indirectly and with lags is also likely to be less effective and if that isn t enough india s ex chief economic advisor just threw a bucket of cold water on the long term india growth story the rare bit of good news is that all analyses indicate that india will be one of the least affected countries from the coronavirus provided of course it doesn t show up here it s difficult to keep your chin up against all that negativity but our independent research analysts nevertheless made a heroic attempt we explored what makes a stock a winner despite encountering adverse situations here and here we looked for nuggets available at attractive valuations in a beaten down sector we recommended stocks with superior earnings quality and pointed out an exception in a tough sector we also did an examination of which sectors in india are at risk of being affected by the virus epidemic and how if played right relocating production to india could become the industrial world s plan b and for next

fashion and entertainment hub discover scene as venezuela s beleaguered economy falls deeper into trouble interest in bitcoin rises says anibal garrido who teaches crypto trading at the university of carabobo venezuela and offers courses on his website but does the data support the notion that crypto acts as a safe haven in times of strife the idea that bitcoin is beneficial for troubled economies because it s uncorrelated with major events that could tank an economy like war or economic sanctions and doesn t depend on third parties such as banks to operate when it comes to venezuela garrido says yes venezuela has one of the most distorted economies on the globe showing inflation variations up to three digits in a month garrido told decrypt in an interview citing data produced by the country s central bank ad ad the international monetary fund estimates that consumer prices in venezuela will inflate by 500 000 percent and garrido said that the amount of money the central bank of venezuela pumps into the economy hugely varies making it difficult to predict the value of the country s currency the bolivar therefore both the private sector and the average citizen have chosen to protect themselves in other international currencies to take shelter over their purchasing power he told decrypt because it s so easy to acquire cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin venezuelans have increased the trading volumes in the mother cryptocurrency more than any country in the region he said but does the evidence support garrido s argument some of it does ad ad interest in crypto in the country could be related in part to venezuela s own state backed cryptocurrency the petro which it disbursed last month to 3 million citizens dependent on the state such as the retired and public sector workers over 1 000 merchants in venezuela such as local retail giant traki and fast food restaurant burger king have started accepting crypto and trading on localcryptos a peer to peer cryptocurrency marketplace also reports big business in venezuela in 2019 venezuelans accounted for 26 of cryptocurrency transactions and 86 in all of latin america active venezuelan users on dash wallets increased by over 400 from may november that s enough for ernesto contreras business development manager for latin america at dash core group to conclude that the country is the leading market for crypto adoption in the world today this is a level of adoption and usage not seen anywhere else he told decrypt which solve some of the need for solutions caused by the financial problems the country is facing but trading data from localbitcoins com a popular peer to peer bitcoin trading site is inconclusive in early 2019 bitcoin transaction spiked in volume in venezuela on localbitcoins com a popular peer to peer bitcoin trading site and has been rising steadily for years according to data on coindance in the second half of 2019 however bitcoin trading for the venezuelan bolivar tanked to less than half of all trading volume in the first half of the year a drop from 35 659 bitcoins to 14 944 bitcoins a trend that contradicts the safe haven argument since venezuela s economy only worsened during that period it s worth noting however that trading volumes on localbitcoins decreased across the board last year not just in venezuela following the introduction of know your customer kyc requirements on the exchange meanwhile other peer to peer exchanges such as paxful and hodl hodl have picked up the slack indeed according to the venezuelan economist any drop in local bitcoin trading within the country may have had much more to do with the broader crypto market garrido said that the decline in transactions on localbitcoins isn t a sign that venezuela s losing interest in crypto it s a cyclical market problem related to the eternal bullish and bearish struggle he said in the second half of 2019 bitcoin s price dropped meaning it didn t seem like a safe asset anymore it wasn t only venezuela it was the whole btc market ad ad still it s difficult to maintain that bitcoin behaves like a true safe haven asset if local trading tanks along with the market and crypto suddenly doesn t seem like a safer alternative to even the inflation riddled bolivar and it s even more difficult to conclude from this that bitcoin is a safe haven asset for the wider world for starters bitcoin is still a volatile currency compared to other more stable alternatives in 2019 alone it hit highs of 13 860 and lows of 3 441 by comparison the value of the dollar against the euro in 2019 two fairly stable currencies deviated by only a few cents and bitcoin s price isn t immune from swings due to global events as diverse as us iran tension and the chinese new year so for those looking to conclude that troubled economies are bullish for bitcoin it might be best to look beyond venezuela

been posted to our website it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to simon simon turner president and chief executive officer thanks jeff and good morning everyone let s begin on slide 3 2019 was a challenging year as macroeconomic uncertainty led to limited visibility notwithstanding these headwinds venator delivered 194 million of adjusted ebitda and 0 24 of adjusted diluted earnings per share we made significant progress on our strategic priorities in 2019 and delivered on those items within our control including improving our cost base strengthening our position in specialty and differentiated tio2 and advancing our customer tailored approach to reduce our tio2 price and margin volatility turning to slide 4 on our titanium dioxide segment in the fourth quarter our titanium dioxide segment generated 30 million of adjusted ebitda compared to 52 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the average tio2 selling price declined 4 in local currency compared to the prior year but remained stable on a sequential basis for the third consecutive quarter this reflects our ongoing approach of matching our supply network to customer commitments to reduce price and margin volatility prices for functional tio2 products were most impacted in europe on a year over year basis we exited the fourth quarter of 2019 with average prices in europe and asia below that of the more stable north american region on a u s dollar basis sequentially prices in local currency were relatively stable in our three main regions despite the historically softest quarter for demand titanium dioxide volumes increased 5 compared to the prior year period the increase which was in europe and north america was primarily a result of increased sales of new differentiated products improved availability of certain products and higher demand compared to the same period last year which was impacted by customer inventory reductions on a sequential basis tio2 volumes declined in line with normal seasonality before i highlight the regional trends impacting the tio2 industry i d like to update you on recent trends in specialty tio2 in the fourth quarter we experienced soft demand in certain specialty applications namely for textiles this was primarily a result of destocking within the textile supply chain in china and elsewhere in asia and was precipitated in part by the u s china trade disputes we estimate more than three quarters of global industry demand for these products in asia including china notwithstanding soft demand in textiles prices for our specialty tio2 products remained relatively stable adjusting for the impact of mix prices and demand for our specialty tio2 products tend to be more resilient across the cycle due to the applications into which we sell these dynamics underscore the investment in our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio to strengthen our position in these higher value applications we expect demand for our specialty and differentiated products to progressively improve throughout 2020 that said we continue to monitor the impact that coronavirus is having on demand and the supply chain it remains too early for us to provide an assessment of the ultimate impact as the situation is still evolving looking at our business regionally in north america demand increased in the fourth quarter compared to a weaker prior year quarter and was flat sequentially our average tio2 selling price in north america was stable both on a year over year and sequential basis reflecting our more stable customer mix and our customer tailored approach demand and pricing in asia stabilized in the fourth quarter however as i previously mentioned it is too early to opine on the impact of the coronavirus on growth in asia europe is our largest market for tio2 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 volumes in europe increased modestly benefiting from higher sales of new differentiated products and improved demand compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 when customers reduce their inventory levels our average tio2 price in europe declined modestly in local currency compared to the prior year quarter and was stable on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter raw material costs moved higher primarily from high grade ores these headwinds which were in line with our expectations were partially offset by a 3 million benefit from our business improvement program turning to the tio2 outlook for 2020 macroeconomic challenges are expected to remain in 2020 in the near term we expect volumes to improve sequentially and follow normal seasonal patterns specialty volumes are expected to progressively improve throughout the year subject to my comments earlier on china we expect more modest raw material cost inflation in 2020 and are actively engaged with customers to implement price increases in all regions to the inflationary pressures on our business longer term tio2 industry fundamentals remain favorable we remain focused on our customer tailored approach enhancing our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio and improving our cost competitiveness throughout the tio2 cycle turning to slide 5 on performance additives revenues declined 7 compared to the prior year period driven by a 5 decline in volumes and a 2 unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation our average selling price was flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 i will provide some additional comments on the three main businesses within performance additives compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 color pigments volumes were primarily impacted by lower demand for products into construction related applications in north america and portfolio optimization as we exited some low margin business the impact from lower volumes was partially offset by lower raw material costs and the benefits of our cost and operational improvement initiatives timber treatment volumes declined compared to the prior year period primarily due to lower construction activity the average selling price and margins were impacted by an adverse mix of sales however it was offset by lower raw material and other costs functional additive volumes were impacted by weaker than expected demand for automotive coatings and plastics we are taking meaningful steps as part of our business improvement program to offset these market challenges and improve the profitability of this business the performance additives segment generated 4 million of adjusted ebitda in the quarter up 1 million compared to prior year quarter in 2019 performance of this segment is impacted by significant market forces especially in the automotive coatings plastics and construction applications in 2020 we expect to capture additional benefits from our self help initiatives we continue to explore a potential sale of the color pigments business this process is ongoing and we have set an aggressive time line the color pigments business generated 17 million of adjusted ebitda in 2019 and we expect to benefit from our targeted cost initiatives in 2020 but because we are actively involved in a process to explore the potential sale of our color pigments business we will not be providing additional commentary or taking questions on the matter turning to slide 6 we continue to be intensely focused on strengthening our business and improving our cash flow we accelerated our 2019 business improvement program and delivered 20 million of benefits in 2019 including 5 million in the fourth quarter double our original full year target we expect to complete all the actions necessary to deliver on our full 40 million target by the end of 2020 exiting the year at the full run rate level on an absolute basis this program is expected to deliver 12 million of benefit in 2020 this does not include the benefits which i highlighted as part of the color pigments review we are pleased with the execution to date and are confident in our ability to deliver the target benefits as promised i will now pass the call over to kurt to discuss our financials i will then return to provide some additional comments kurt kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks simon let s turn to slide 7 in the fourth quarter total adjusted ebitda declined 22 million compared to the prior year the decline is primarily attributable to the adverse price mix in our tio2 business and partially offset by higher volumes and the benefit of our business improvement program compared to the third quarter of 2019 total adjusted ebitda declined by 27 million seasonally lower sales volumes in tio2 and performance additives were the largest contributor to the sequential decline price mix was also a headwind due to a lower contribution of specialty tio2 we benefited in the quarter from improved fixed cost absorption in performance additives and our tio2 business as we built inventories in certain specialty and differentiated tio2 products to assist in the transfer of the business from pori turning to slide 8 and our capital resources at the end of the fourth quarter net debt totaled 695 million and our net leverage ratio was approximately 3 6 times our trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda total liquidity was approximately 307 million at the end of the year consisting of 55 million in cash and 252 million of undrawn availability under our asset based revolving lending facility we do not have any significant debt maturities until 2024 we continue to enjoy relatively low cash taxes this is primarily a function of the countries where income is generated and the net operating losses from which we benefit in the quarter we recorded a 157 million tax expense in connection with recognizing a full valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets importantly this does not prevent us from being able to utilize the associated nols in future periods and enjoying a low cash tax rate which we expect to be 10 to 15 our outlook for capital expenditures in 2020 is 80 million to 90 million including business transfer capex from pori we will remain vigilant with our capex budget and could reduce this outflow further should market conditions warrant we expect cash interest in 2020 to be between 40 million to 45 million in 2020 we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 35 consistent with 2019 as we apply a normalized adjusted rate to better reflect the current weighted average tax rate applicable under the various jurisdictions in which we operate we continue to expect a long term adjusted effective tax rate to be 15 to 20 cash restructuring payments in 2020 are expected to total 15 million to 20 million this primarily includes our ongoing business improvement program calais and the cost savings related to our color pigments business other cash uses in 2020 are expected to be approximately 75 million primarily consisting of pension obligations joint venture capital expenditures and legal fees we preliminarily expect the net change in working capital to be a modest source of cash in 2020 this is subject to market conditions and other factors finally our pori related expenses are expected to total 15 million to 20 million in 2020 down from an outflow of 64 million in 2019 we recognize the importance of returning to positive free cash flow and remain intensely focused on reducing our cash uses including capex to transfer business from pori we continue to make considerable progress on the transfer of many of our specialty and differentiated products into the existing network as a result of the current economic environment and our financial resources we are exploring ways to optimize the remaining transfer of business from pori we believe this will include a lower total expected capital outlay and a lower associated ebitda benefit than originally estimated with a similar if not higher economic return we expect to update all material elements of our 2020 cash uses as necessary on our quarterly earnings calls with that i ll turn it back over to simon simon turner president and chief executive officer thank you kurt 2019 was a challenging year but we remain focused on executing on those items within our control in the near term we expect volumes to follow a more normal seasonal pattern in both tio2 and performance additives we expect an improvement in tio2 pricing and the benefits of our cost and operational improvement initiatives to partially offset inflationary pressures additionally we expect to continue to manage our manufacturing network aligning production with customer commitments we are focused on maximizing value to shareholders through the following we re committed to our customer tailored approach by which we actively manage our production network and inventories along with the implementation of a more diverse range of customer agreements the net effect reduces our price volatility evidence can be seen in our more stable 2019 pricing profile we are focused on strengthening our leadership position in specialty and differentiated tio2 made possible by our unique mix of assets our specialty and differentiated tio2 portfolio provides venator the ability to partner with customers in higher growth and higher value applications we continue to invest in strengthening and diversifying our product slate and it is these applications which contributed most of our 7 volume growth in 2019 we remain focused on enhancing our competitive position in all our businesses we accelerated the delivery of our business improvement program and delivered 20 million of ebitda improvements in 2019 versus the original target of 10 million we expect to deliver the remaining cost and operational efficiencies as promised including the incremental benefits related to our color pigments business additionally we are actively evaluating opportunities to optimize our manufacturing capabilities and cost base to further improve our profitability we remain intensely focused on reducing our cash uses and improving our free cash flow and are taking meaningful steps in 2020 as kurt mentioned we expect to reduce our capex spend by approximately 30 million and our spend related to pori closure is expected to decrease by approximately 45 million compared to 2019 we are fully committed to maximizing shareholder value through active portfolio optimization in the near term this includes exploring the potential sale of our color pigments business which is ongoing longer term tio2 industry fundamentals remain favorable we believe tio2 industry inventory levels improved in 2019 and are lower than they were this time last year capacity additions are well understood and in line with normalized industry growth rates we believe executing on our strategic priorities will enhance our competitiveness and create long term value for shareholders with that we thank you for your continued interest in venator i would now like to open the call for questions questions answers operator yes thank you and the first question comes from duffy fischer with barclays duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning guys first question is you were talking about the changes that you re thinking about for the pori capex maybe i missed it but can you quantify how much different do you think the new plan will be from the old plan as far as end game ebitda drive and then the capex that we would need to spend for that simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so let me help you on that jeff it s simon here look i think september 2018 in which we announced our program for pori that was about 18 months back i think we can all see those 18 months have been pretty challenging we had a pretty significant destock in the second half of 2018 very modest growth in 2019 at the industry level and now of course as we enter the year we see further uncertainty with coronavirus and so forth so the circumstances have changed i would like to point out here that by far and away the largest part of the cash spend here at pori is in the closure and wind down costs and we have got most of that spend behind us of the 280 million we announced we spent 180 million that would leave us 100 million to run in full year 20 we d expect that to be around 20 million as kurt said so that s sort of like the lion s share of the cash on the capex side of the ledger which is to your question here we ve been exploring ways to optimize the remaining transfer of the business again and we expect that to come in at a higher economic return so look we are looking at a lower capex for the remaining portion that would entail a lower ebitda but of course as i said hopefully with a similar or higher economic return we re still working through that duffy we don t have a number yet that we re prepared to share in that regard we still got a little bit of a ways to run but i would point out that for many of our products the transfer is complete and behind us we spent 15 million in 19 with some more to spend in 2020 duffy fischer barclays analyst ok thank you and then if you could maybe just walk through your large end markets and how fast do you think consumption growth was for those end markets of tio2 in 2019 and then what would you anticipate for 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer ok so look as i said earlier 2018 was a terrible second half from a demand point of view i think our view is that 2018 the industry contracted by about 6 there was some more positive year on year growth in 2019 at the industry level nominal positive growth for us thanks mainly to our new products and we sort of outpaced that overall but if i think about it from a 2019 what sort of like advanced faster or slower i think in effect there s probably two tiers in that answer at the applications level rather than at the geographic level so let s think about the applications first i don t think that what we saw in 2019 between coatings and plastics at the aggregate level was dissimilar around the world but of course we would take out automotive coatings and parts of industrial which definitely were in that second tier of lower growth and from what we can see why we re not big on that in tio2 we re exposed to it in our additives business that is still persisting so that would be an example of the second tier predominantly i think we saw demand for our inks and other specialties coming through in 2019 in the way we expect it to which was at or even slightly above larger functional markets we would call out as a second tier a sort of textiles application and we had a very soft end to the year we called out on our previous call i think we called it again on this call so that again would be sort of like lower rate so if the question is by application where did we notice the difference i think we d have to center in on automotive coatings and textiles in the tio2 world and similarly in additives we would have seen that in autos and electronics to some extent and plastics and coating depending on which market you re in so that explains it by applications point of view and of course i think that obviously if we put the geography lens on that of course it was the chinese softness in the second half that stood out for us on a geographic base i hope that is responsive to the question of what we saw in 2019 2020 look absent coronavirus as we closed last year and coming off the back of a net contracted industry these past two years of let s call it 5 we would ordinarily expect the gdp plus rebound in 2020 the question is to what degree does coronavirus affect that or delay that and we don t have the answer to that i m not going to represent to you that we do but that would be our thinking hitherto we can t really say too much on coronavirus other than the year it started off the first six seven weeks of the year it started off our sales in the aggregate in line with our expectations for the first start of the year the only notable comment i could make was that i do think in the broader asia region there is some heightened concern around supply ability out of china for tio2 as a result of the coronavirus and that we have felt that a bit and heard that and received that a little more in this first start to the year i hope that helps duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys simon turner president and chief executive officer thanks duffy operator thank you and the next question comes from david begleiter with deutsche bank david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you simon that was my focus as well the supply issue in china and how that might impact your operations in europe are you seeing yet any constraints on chinese imports into europe and could that support do you think some of these price initiatives that have been announced simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so there s a number of themes in that question i m going to break it out a little bit there let s focus a little bit about the chinese point reminder of course to everyone i think people are well aware that we are not seeking to be the largest importer of product into china we take technical specialty and differentiated products into china one of the smaller importers so we don t see the kind of direct head to head competition within china although what we have noted in the second half of last year was softness within china we ve noticed the gap in pricing kind of develop wider between local chinese prices and more western producer prices we ve noted that the majority of chinese producers have announced price increases in fact and i would point out that the smaller producers in china were already under pressure and this latest development with coronavirus will put them under even more pressure so while we might be hearing sort of like concerns around the ability of china s export we re certainly hearing that from our customers as i said we sort of yet to put any tangible evidence there that s why we ve been very cautious on calling it regarding the broader exports point what i would say to you is what we saw in 2019 was this sort of like repeat performance of 1 million tons of export out of china we continue to see that the lion s share of those exports went to emerging economies and that was second half loaded notably because of the trade disputes and so forth importantly though exports from china into the combined markets of north america and europe declined on aggregate by around 15 so hopefully those calibration points going to help answer your question david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very helpful and just lastly on feedstock or costs why were they up in 2019 simon and what s your expectation for 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer so i think if we took a overall raws and feedstock we said pretty early on in 2019 where we have some clarity there that we d expect to onboard around 40 million of inflationary pressure in 2019 three quarters of which would be in the feedstock area and that s basically how it played out in 2019 you may recall on our previous call we said that we didn t see the same kind of justification in case for similar type inflationary pressures in 2020 of course that s our view i think it s fair to say that we still expect more modest inflationary pressures in 2020 without giving a number i think we can say that the pattern remains from feedstock and within that predominantly high grade feedstock so the patents are quite clear it s fair to say also we continue to negotiate hard with our suppliers around the eventual inflation costs david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst good morning this is dylan campbell on for bob i was hoping you can provide some background on your recent price increase announcement i guess on the back of kind of raw material inflation one does that price increase cover that raw material inflation and then i guess the second is with lower inventory levels now and if we get into a situation where demand starts to improve again what is kind of the tio2 s sensitivity to tightening conditions considering the value stabilization efforts done by some of your peers simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah look let s be clear about stabilization we continue to be through our customer tailored approach advocates and proponents of stabilization we have stabilized our price over the last three quarters unfortunately we have onboarded some raw material costs so as we go out to customers we are looking at what has happened to date and what is yet to happen in 2020 as reasons why we will be adjusting prices upwards to restore margins of course as we saw in the stabilization process the rate of adjustment and movement quarter on quarter with prices was relatively small so we are prepared to go into what degree we cover raws because of course we re still negotiating with our consumers and if you could dylan remind me the last part of the question i would be grateful dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst yeah i guess the price increase and whether that s kind of recovering the raw material inflation that you expected to see simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah look i mean as i said earlier to my earlier answer we would ordinarily expect to see growth in this tio2 industry above gdp and a year after we d had two years after we had net contraction and where we progressively lowered year end inventories so i think we re well set there we ve taken the decision to go out because we want to tackle the margin pressures of course and as part of stabilization initiatives it remains to be seen what will happen with the tightness on the go forward basis for the rest of 2020 because we ve got this near term lack of clarity around the coronavirus but ordinarily we would expect it to outpace gdp and that of course would provide better conditions for price increase in 2020 dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it that s helpful and i guess on sales mix looks like that was down 2 on a year over year basis can you provide some color there and whether we can expect similar trends into 2020 for tio2 specifically simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i think that relates predominantly dylan to the specialty segment and i think as you re aware we closed last year with a soft specialty segment predominantly in our asia centered and china centered textiles application dylan campbell goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from p j juvekar with citi eric petrie citi analyst good morning simon it s eric petrie on for p j simon turner president and chief executive officer hey eric eric petrie citi analyst do you think we re at a trough with fourth quarter ebitda margins in tio2 or do you think there s still risks in first half at least attributed to coronavirus and the like simon turner president and chief executive officer well certainly the risk yes i think there s risk but of course that could play out in unexpected ways and that s quite hard to predict here i ve heard various people advance various reasons why it could be sort of like a net positive but from our point of view what we would say is of course it was a seasonal soft quarter in fourth quarter so of course you have absorption issues typically there we had some softness in specialty but we expect to see some stability of pricing as we cross the year from 2019 into 2020 and of course you ve heard our earlier comments about price increases eric petrie citi analyst thanks and secondly a competitor announced that they could close eu sulfate capacity at the end of this year or next could you do the same or talk about the competitive dynamics at duisburg and uerdingen simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean look of course could you go down the path of closing out yes you could and i think over this past many years we have faced up to those difficult decisions when plants have become older and subeconomic so yes you could of course our view though is you have to look at both the competitiveness of the plant and the net revenue stream that is included in each of those plants and i think as we alluded to in our call earlier in our prepared remarks in tio2 we will continue to further look for optimization and efficiency opportunities within our broader circuit reflecting the fact that 2019 will see the end of our currently running bip we found 10 million of color based improvement and it s a way of life in this business we expect to go back look for further opportunities and as we identify those we will share those with you eric petrie citi analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from john mcnulty with bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks for taking my question can you give us a little bit of color at least as to what insights you have as to the customer inventory levels and kind of where they stand relative to kind of the normal seasonal time for this simon turner president and chief executive officer if i go through it by region i don t think we d see anything out of the ordinary in the united states i d characterize those inventories at this time of year as normal similarly in europe we do not see any evidence and as i said to you earlier we have seen lower chinese exports on a net basis into europe and the united states combined in 2019 but i think that it s fair to say at the industry level that our calculations and estimates in venator suggest that the closing year end inventories at the industry level we re at least 10 lower than where they stood at the back end of 2018 so i think that s about as good as a metric we can give you john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great that s helpful and then just with regard to the color pigments business i know you can t comment on the asset sale can you give us some color as to the cost cutting program is working there and then kind of what you ve pulled out at this point and how that s progressing as you re kind of looking through 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean look we ve identified 10 it s not a front end loaded program similar to the tio2 area it s a mixture of projects a smaller running projects some of which don t require capex around a multiple instance of sites so it s not dissimilar in terms by way of phasing and fragmentation to its larger kind of tio2 cousin if you want to think about it that way john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst great thanks very much for the color operator thank you and the next question comes from josh spector with ubs josh spector ubs analyst yeah hey guys just in terms of thinking about potential china impacts in 1q can you help us understand how much of your sales go directly into china and how much of europe and kind of rest of asia goes into products that you think ultimately end up in demand in china simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i mean that second one is pretty tough because if you think about ourselves into europe and north america into the larger established sort of like applications like coatings and plastics well a coatings that of course particularly generally don t travel very well having lots of liquids associated with the final product so the answer there is minimal i guess there s probably some special product coatings that does make it is so plastics in the sense that you tend to see a more specialty plastics aside you tend to see the more commoditized plastics flowing out of china into the rest of the world so i think that the second part of the question is really from our point of view there s not that much we sell into western markets that ends up being sold to consumers in china there will be some but not much in terms of the first part of the question the way i think about it is that we are one of the smaller exporters into china and i will be surprised if our sales of the fraction of the imports is greater than 10 of all imports so again they go to specialized and differentiated applications predominantly josh spector ubs analyst ok thanks and just in terms of your volume growth year over year you talked about that being led by new products so i assume volume loss last year you re not filling those same volumes i guess i m trying to think about that dynamic of maybe where you re selling those new products into and what are the kind of end markets where you re getting some additional traction simon turner president and chief executive officer well i m certainly happy to talk a little bit about that 7 year on year increase the bulk of that came from new products and the way to think about that i think is in three buckets it s about new type functional products and grades that we ve launched which have been extremely well taken up in plastics and industrial coatings types of segments and another way to think about that is from a diversification play point of view you ll recall that we took on the laminate s business which is a diversification play for us but again it was absent from prior year sales so that s the way we think about those new product sales josh spector ubs analyst ok thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from steve byrne with bank of america unknown speaker on for steve thanks for taking my question i wanted to talk about the middle east debottleneck projects do you see any product coming from the middle east and hitting europe from these projects simon turner president and chief executive officer we are not in a position to comment on that but we haven t seen anything of that type unknown speaker ok sure and just a little bit more high level are you seeing any further reductions of tio2 content by global paint manufacturers and conversely are there any new developments in r d regarding new applications or products that you think could benefit from increased tio2 simon turner president and chief executive officer i think fundamentally the answer to your first part of your question is no we re not seeing any it s quite stable prices have been stable and we have some turbulence in that regard some 10 years back almost now but no we don t see that as a fundamental driver and the second part of your question there s nothing near term that we see that would lead to any sort of even material radical improvements in overall tio2 consumption i wouldn t want to never say never of course there can be some embryonic applications that could lead to that in out years but that s really not a near term issue unknown speaker sure thank you operator thank you and the last question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies laurence alexander jefferies analyst hi could you benchmark what the current sales run rate is for the assets under a potential divestiture and as you ve seen sort of the mix of your business change has there been any significant change in seasonality first half versus back half compared to what was the run rate before the most recent downturn simon turner president and chief executive officer laurence this is simon can i just clarify the point of your question both of those parts of the question relates to the performance additives business laurence alexander jefferies analyst no sort of second one is just across the entire portfolio and then you referred earlier to sort of normal seasonality just want to be clear that that has not changed in any structural ways you ve shifted your portfolio mix simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so to be clear then the second part of your question is seasonality we do not see any fundamental shift in seasonality across tio2 or the performance additives business that s not to say necessarily though of course the sales would mimic that at all cases because as we ve seen over the past couple of years we ve had soft spots automotive i talked about earlier and our textiles segment at the back end of 2019 so of course there can be reasons that is apparently look like seasonality but we don t think the base seasonality has changed that s the second part of the question sorry could you repeat the first part about color laurence alexander jefferies analyst on just on the sales run rate that you re looking to divest you mentioned the ebitda i just want to double check if what the sales run rate is looking like kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer laurence this is kurt we ll follow up with you on the sales number we did want to provide greater transparency around the ebitda so you had a sense for what the contribution was from that color pigments business but because we haven t broken out the sales i don t have that with me right now happy to follow up with you later laurence alexander jefferies analyst ok thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst hey thanks good morning i just wanted to go back to the china issue is there a way you could kind of share what you generated in sales and ebitda in china in 2019 simon turner president and chief executive officer broadly no i don t think we d be prepared to share that information arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst ok then and then also you commented on the export situation out of china and into europe as being potentially more benign could you share more details on that simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i didn t actually say it s potentially more benign well i may have inferred that let me back up and be as clear as i can be about it what i said is if we look back over these past period last year for instance or even prior to that what we have been saying about china is the trajectory of supply and build rate in china has been slowing of course we saw inspection environmental issues there s been a number of setbacks faced predominantly by but not exclusive by smaller chinese producers and the net effect of that coupled with the fact that western customers are extremely concerned to get supply reliability and quality consistency has meant that chinese exports to western markets of north america and europe while they have grown in last year specifically were actually lower than the prior year so there has been this notion that chinese products would go onwards and upwards into europe and north america and that has not happened i believe that fundamentally relates to the two factors i mentioned supply reliability for whatever reason and quality consistency arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst and then just lastly if i may just on the price increase announcements i guess what would you characterize as your chances of success for these increased announcements and what would drive kind of success there maybe you can just contextualize that with your raw material outlook as well simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah so look at a high level basis we are convicted to these price increases we have worked very closely to listen to our customers around managing their pricing and they have predictability for us our margins got compressed it looks like there s going to be a bit more of it so we re going to move our prices and we re aiming to offset our raw material inflationary pressures it remains to be seen as to how that plays out but i think that we are certainly convicted to support those in all major regions arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator thank you and the next comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley steve haynes morgan stanley analyst hi this is steve on for vincent just wanted to come back to the segment margin discussion in tio2 so if you guys did about 12 this year and if that s kind of what we re going to call trough then in 2017 and 2018 you were more in the mid 20 clearly you re probably not getting back to that level but can you kind of help us frame kind of what the expectation is this year kind of with that being in the bottom and the top kind of ends of the range kurt ogden executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is kurt i m happy to take that i think that our success in 2020 will largely be predicated on how successful we are with the sales price initiatives that we have we think that it was the prudent thing to do to pass along the raw material inflation that we ve seen in 2019 and as you have heard us outline we are aggressively tackling our costs which would also serve to improve our margins but difficult to put a number or even a range out there for you where we re still early in those price negotiations and so i think we ll wait and see how those come in steve haynes morgan stanley analyst ok thanks kurt operator thank you and the next question comes from hassan ahmed with alembic global hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst morning simon and kurt i just want to go back to the tio2 pricing also some of the dynamics going on on the ore side of things obviously you guys talked about wanting to offset higher ore costs from what i ve been hearing it seems high grade ore the availability of high grade ore seems to be questionable meaning high grade ore seems to be very tight supply demand wise so my question really is could we sort of enter 2020 with a situation where high grade ore is tighter than titanium dioxide and the industry actually struggles to pass through those higher ore costs and maybe you guys being far more sort of leveraged to ilmenite benefit from those dynamics simon turner president and chief executive officer well thanks for the question hassan i mean i think that this point about higher grade lower grade ores is a continuation of a theme that has developed over multiple years and of course you re right to point out the high grade markets are more sort of less sort of like vendor choices in those markets and it s true that we have seen in the higher grade buckets particularly in rutiles and to some extent some of the sort of operational ups and downs in chloride slags that that has become tighter i think we can see us sort of way through this near part of 2020 typically as we ve said before we would sort of like try to bolt down requirements and prices in the front half and then come back with second half typically six month type negotiation so i m not sure we re at the stage yet which you imply i would also say on the low grade that despite the fact that there are still inflationary pressures at the low grade level it s just they have not eventuated in a pattern that we ve seen on the high grade hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst understood understood helpful and as a follow up completely appreciate the fact that coronavirus ongoing tough to sort of figure out what demand impact it may have but obviously the supply side tends to be a bit more visible what are you guys seeing in terms of supply curtailments for tio2 in china on the back of the coronavirus simon turner president and chief executive officer i think as i said i take our comments here appropriately hassan in the sense that we re not the big window on the world for china in the world of tio2 because of the limited amount part we take in so we have seen and heard of the type of dynamics over the lunar new year where holidays were extended and whether that affected the workforce logistics infrastructure chem park and geography of course there were broader impacts that meant that supply got interrupted the question is does that rumble on and continue and that s the part we do not know the part we ve seen is curtailments and disruption over so like limited time window at and somewhat beyond the lunar new year we ve yet to see anything more fundamentally different from that hassan ahmed alembic global advisors analyst very helpful simon thanks so much operator thank you and the next question comes from jim sheehan with suntrust jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst morning simon what is your ultimate plans for the pori site is there any opportunity to monetize the remaining assets there and how would your exploring of options for capex and so forth affect that decision making simon turner president and chief executive officer well look i think an important point here to note is as we ve already transferred several of those specialty products we re still committed to further transfer of specialty business let s be very clear about that that is a strategic imperative for us within venator so of course what we re doing here is we have to be prudent with cash for well understood reasons and that forces us to examine each and every part of our cash usage including all parts of the current and anticipated capex build and that s what we re doing it s about prudency with cash it s no reflection on our commitment to specialty i want to be very very clear about that that s something we still deeply believe in are there opportunities to potentially sell the sites or part the sites yes there are are we exploring yes we are so we will leave no stone unturned there to see if there s alternative usage for that site we have been successful on several occasions in our past as we ve closed various sites and turn those into opportunities rather so i think that s a path we ll continue we ll give you a lot of focus on that in 2020 and of course we re going to work through our best option for being prudent with the cash and optimizing our return from other specialty business transfers and we ll update you when we get to that point we don t have that number here today jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst ok thank you and on your tio2 business what level of volume growth is realistic in 2020 given the improvements you ve made in your specialty production network and also new products do you expect to outgrow the market again in 2020 simon turner president and chief executive officer i think it goes back jim to my earlier comment about coronavirus i think that there are times when this industry on the demand profile where things are more or less clear unfortunately we are in one of those latter periods where the demand is less clear near term so it really does heavily depend on how that evolves and it is evolving day to day week by week and all we can point you to is we would expect industry rebound at gdp plus in 2020 ordinarily and we d like to think that still happens and of course you have to factor in the fact that we are broadening diversifying and strengthening our product slate and of course that also plays into our ability to manage our volumes jim sheehan suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from roger spitz with bank of america roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you good morning your tio2 price was down 7 for the full year 2019 versus 18 but can you comment on what the 2019 price movement was bifurcated between chloride process tio2 and sulfite process for instance another large tio2 producer who has only chloride process tio2 reported its price was only down 1 for the full year of 19 simon turner president and chief executive officer yeah i think look this is not a chloride sulfate situation per se at all this is first and foremost a regional footprint discussion because in 2018 with us having a 50 of our revenues in europe and the european dollar selling price being some 300 plus greater than north america that is what plays into a year on year price decline that is the driver not the application what i would say is that generally speaking our specialty tio2 which just happened to be exclusively sulfate of course those prices are more stable so they did not drop in that period in any material sense what i would say about the remainder of our business our functional sales we ve got a mixture of chloride and sulfate into those businesses and the way pricing evolved was more a function of customer size than it was of technology roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst i see i believe you said that global tio2 demand declined for the industry by 6 early in the call if i heard that correctly your volumes were up 7 in 2019 would that imply that you took market share simon turner president and chief executive officer so what i m saying is that let me back track again i said that in 2019 we estimate that the industry shrunk by 6 over sorry 18 shrunk over 17 by 6 and 19 grew by a modest amount let s call it 1 and so over that period that s 6 is related to the prior year but coming back to your 7 number it s a very straightforward assessment here if you pro forma out the extra diversified laminate acquisition and the introductions of specific new products we grew in line with the market roger spitz bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you very much operator and this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference to simon turner for any closing comments simon turner president and chief executive officer thank you thank you for your interest in venator and we look forward to speaking to and meeting with many of you throughout the quarter in the interim if you do have any issues please reach out to jeff with additional questions thanks again for joining the call and have a great weekend

in an all caps tweet trump pledged to further increase the size of the bailout program that has already cost taxpayers 28 billion if our formally targeted farmers need additional aid until such time as the trade deals with mexico canada china and others fully kick in that aid will be provided by the federal government trump said his comments appeared to surprise a number of administration officials and come amid growing signs that last month s partial trade deal with china is falling far short of the levels initially promised by the white house on thursday a senior u s department of agriculture official said china might end up buying just 14 billion in u s farm products through the end of september meaning the total amount of sales for the year was likely to fall far short of the 40 billion trump had promised trump s political support among many farmers appears to be strong but white house officials have long been worried about a backlash if prices remain low and bankruptcies continue democrats have been encouraged by electoral inroads they made during the 2018 midterm elections when they defeated numerous republican candidates in farm districts usda said on thursday that total farm debt was expected to breach 425 billion this year an all time high in 2019 there were 595 chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies in the u s almost 100 more than were filed in 2018 there has not been a bump in commodity prices since trump signed the china trade deal or a separate pact with canada and mexico trump had recently promised a huge farming renaissance telling farmers to buy a bigger tractor and more land we are frustrated with the situation we understand the broader trade implications but feel we have been targeted in a bigger political battle we did not sign up for said jamie beyer a soybean farmer in wheaton minnesota and president of the minnesota soybean association we are all very excited about the usmca and the trade deal with china but we are all waiting for that to be reflected in commodity prices and orders it s disheartening a third multibillion dollar bailout could cast a shadow over trump s boasts about the big beautiful trade deal he reached with china last month an agreement expected to form a key part of his 2020 reelection message on the economy the outbreak of the coronavirus has wreaked havoc on the chinese economy making it more difficult to forecast how many farm purchases china will ultimately make this year the farm bailout program began in 2018 as a way to address fury from farmers who alleged chinese tariffs on their exports had pushed many to the brink of collapse the program continued in 2019 but white house officials had suggested it would not be renewed in 2020 until trump reversed course friday farmers are no dummies they ve seen this get rolled out the past two years programs invented out of whole cloth said robert johnson president of the national farmers union the president is going to do whatever he can to appease the farmers because it s an election year the political stakes for the president are enormous amid growing economic pain for america s farmers under his administration trade wars weather disasters and low commodity prices have created a farm environment that has dramatically increased bankruptcies the need for what would amount to a third round of bailout funding highlights the immense challenges trump has faced in his international trade war in his second year in office trump imposed tariffs on a range of chinese imports including steel as a way to ramp up pressure on the chinese government to boost u s imports but china retaliated by targeting agricultural producers in the politically critically midwestern states trump has repeatedly said the bailout would be paid for by the tariffs imposed on foreign nations a claim rejected by multiple nonpartisan and conservative budget experts tariffs are paid by u s importers and then often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices the president has wanted to act from the beginning that the trade war is nothing by rainbows and unicorns the reality is that it s not just us being tough on china china and other countries are being tough on us said rory cooper a former republican aide at purple strategies a political consulting firm trump is trying to spend now north of 30 billion to paper over those issues zippy duvall president of the american farm bureau federation said he was optimistic china will purchase more than 14 billion in agricultural products based on conversations with china s minister of agriculture but that the final outcome was uncertain the difficult time farmers are having today are not getting any better because of slow implementation duvall said the president s pledge of additional bailout money may be meant as a signal to china that the white house would not wait patiently for beijing to comply with the new trade deal sen kevin cramer r n d a farm state ally of the president said in an interview he called trump s pledge of additional bailouts a sort of a shot across the bow at our trading partner due to the slow uptick in purchases by the chinese cramer said china s pledged purchases of agricultural commodities a crucial part of the trade deal while defending the bailout funding as potentially necessary to keeping farmers afloat cramer acknowledged the frustration among farmers eager to sell their product to market rather than rely on a federal subsidy what happens with subsidies is it distorts market price cramer said if there s no market then having the certainty of an income is better than not but it s still not the preferred outcome numerous congressional republicans also express frustrations in private meetings with both the trade war with china and the growing size of the bailout for farmers according to jason pye vice president for legislative affairs at freedomworks a conservative organization gop lawmakers believe trump s trade war weakened the impact of their 2017 tax law slowing economic growth in america to 2 3 percent last year the bailout s price tag is also now more than twice the cost of the auto bailout criticized by conservative lawmakers unlike many other government bailout programs farmers are not required to pay any of the money back the problem is few are willing to do or say anything about this pye said at what point are they going to fight back do we need a recession before they do anything about this how big is this bailout going to get nobody is willing to ask these questions democrats may be in a difficult position to exploit the intra gop rift on the issue congressional democrats backed off an opportunity last year to force trump to scale back the program amid pressure from lawmakers in their own caucus representing farm states and party leaders such as senate minority leader charles schumer d n y have argued the administration has not been tough enough on china pushing for an even more adversarial approach the bailout was created by the trump administration as a way to try to calm outrage from farmers who complained they were caught in the middle of the white house s trade war with china in an attempt to pacify farmers the agriculture department created an expansive new program without precedent that makes direct payments to farmers senior administration officials previously expressed alarm about the administration s legal justification for the maneuver which they have based on a new deal era program the program was modified from its initial form to be expanded to include additional crops among other changes we all thought it was political especially the changes for the second program said theodore covey a former agricultural economist at the department of agriculture who left midway through the implementation of the second bailout

a recent piece in jacobin revisited the battle of seattle 20 years later it argues that the blockade of the world trade organization round at the homeland of grunge and starbucks was a turning point for the left after the 1990s shortcomings as global elites got a rude awakening from social movements and civil society a new global grammar of political action seemed available for the downtrodden in a new millennium 10 years after the arab spring 20 years after seattle 30 years after the berlin wall we contemplate neither the end of history nor raptured left internationalisms the global economy still deals with scars from its deepest crisis since 1929 populism rages on with democracy locked down in a downward spiral all around from the ashes of a wto meeting that never was donald trump emerged as an unlikely force for global transformation from trade patterns through the state of democracy to the resilience of civil liberties the potus was associated with broad strokes of social transformation in a brief spam of time this scenario seems puzzling we should be able to provide tentative answers or at least a potential roadmap by the late 1980s several complex processes seemed to lead to improbable yet expected outcomes the berlin wall s fall plus ussr s implosion provided massive pushes for european integration maastricht 1992 and nato enlargement with prominent former members of warsaw pact at the helm of 1991 s visegrad group five decades of gatt culminated with the successful completion of the uruguay round in 1994 and the creation of the world trade organization wto making justice to robert krasner s prototypical definition of international regimes sets of implicit or explicit principles norms rules and decision making processes around which actors expectations converge in a given area of international relations the world trade organization swiftly succeeded the long standing gatt in 1995 with 76 founding members as robert keohane famously stated talks about cooperation after hegemony reserved several prominent roles for international institutions the wto as a multilateral institution was born with teeth an enforcement mechanism for dispute settlement among a broad constituency now with a membership of 164 countries it contemplates chronicles of a death long foretold in the course of 25 years a partially globalized international economy endured a series of global crises the tequila crisis of 1994 opened gates for whirlwinds of turmoil in emerging states mexico argentina thailand indonesia russia brazil all still in the 20th century the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s was the first of its kind in the new millennium however most of us were deeply surprised apart from nouriel roubini by the scope and depth of the us 2008 real estate debacle which pulled the trigger for a global crash notwithstanding those massive retreats for global economy trade in goods and services grew far above the world s gross domestic product between 1995 and 2010 from the wto s birth to the sluggish aftermath of the crisis part of this can be associated with current international framework in spite of its limitations the dismal outcomes of the doha round in 2006 sent early signs of discomfort in multilateral trade as emerging economies and oecd members clashed in a number of issue areas on matters that proved to be pervasive such as agriculture and property rights after the crisis global trade became the staple of a new wave of populist assault on globalism not restricted to inflamed rhetoric protectionist policies were adopted in a number of countries roberto de azevêdo s focus on small packages of reforms may have proved a prudent policy route for a contested institution like the wto but they feel short in face of the breadth of new challenges with disquieting global effects in that respect president trump s inauguration may be considered a tipping point twenty five years after its inception the wto reached paralysis in late 2019 as the us president trump refused to appoint two representatives to replace retired members of the appellation body after seattle another kind of blockage damages the workings of multilateralism only that this time with a full blown knockout in a world already battered by trade wars between us and china dispute settlement in a toothless wto may be reduced to bilateral maneuvering at the edge of the art of the deal by depriving the wto of a defining feature trump brought the state back in as a force to be reckoned in international political economy something the prophecies of 1989 could not contemplate in full his was an approach that countered post cold war forecasts it still has appeal for disenfranchised audiences as jose bove drove a bulldozer to a mcdonalds in defense of french agriculture on the ropes of the integrated markets in a partially globalized economy globalism was vilified as the root of economic shortcomings this was one of the key seattle motifs a widening gulf between global elites and the rest something that returned a decade later in occupy wall st under the guise of 99 versus 1 slogans another defining trend was the late arrival of trade unions at the scene of the seattle clashes the latest losers of globalized capitalism reared their heads for rust belts became pockets of disaffection in developed economies of course demoted industrial areas looking for greatness again looked at the wto suspiciously an anathema as early as 2011 trump emerged as unlikely champion of definitely unlike groups the 1 and the rest for liberals and tycoons his residual charm at the lost art of the deal meant an uncompromising stance for american corporations after the brief spell of obama keynesianism lost its appeal not to be missed was the threat of a rising china one that surprisingly at least in retrospect quickly adopted multilateral trappings and free trade rhetoric across international forums in campaign trump promised an end to chinese violence a host of protective trade measures followed suit at the expense of global trade if he delivered the goods up to a point for the 1 what would be left for the rest in a baffling reversal of attitudes trump emerged from his 2016 campaign as a working class hero against an elitist democratic party his victory was dully consolidated in rust belts as the former reality show presenter rode america promising advantageous bilateral trade deals and made in usa brands prevailing at global arenas his appreciation for fake news on social networks seemed to conflict with economic statistics which saw employment rates bouncing back to the days of hillary s husband bill clinton as well as sustained gdp increase so did the us eventually become great again in terms in the decade following 2008 the eurozone gdp grew on average only 0 78 yearly though this lays some credibility on trumpist rhetoric india grew on a 7 12 average that means indian gdp doubled in the space of an otherwise for many lost decade under xi jinping china experienced a slowdown of growth rates at the tail end of its transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial powerhouse across 40 odd years halfway across this decade it lost the primacy in being the fastest growing economy in the world to india still it relied on an average gdp rate of 7 95 additionally the belt and road initiative made chinese diplomacy more prominent than ever since the 1949 revolution what about the agonizing wto even though world trade indicators roughly accompanied the world s gdp growth patterns after the crisis the acrimony between the institution and us was not ushered by trump indeed it was obama who played the contestation card since 2011 unseating south korean judge seung wha chang by willful neglect trump the american president who seated with kim jong un has just finished his predecessor s job who also refused to bow down to the appellation body during his term ironically it may be there are structural features at play the us seems at the losing end of trade disputes it is not only a matter of american slow decadence as the rest of the world did not stand still as communities carefully attempt to foster incentives for uncertain ecologic transitions trump mobilized the haunts of structural unemployment opening the gates for oil and mining industries at reserve areas making america great again often meant taking steps back from international commitments apart from undermining nafta and leaving the paris agreement trump trended allies out of the water take it by brazil s jair bolsonaro during his administration the us also fell at odds with nato allies and the european union on issues ranging from russia to iran s denuclearization this pattern left him with very few friends he could not muster support during venezuela s crisis the aftermath of the syrian civil war or the north korean talks international regimes and institutions highly depend on expectations convergence many of them shattered after 2008 something enhanced after trump the overlapping of issue areas at urgent conjunctures for instance preserving what is left of the earth s environment versus economic recovery after a brutal crisis allowed few virtuous synergies so far additionally international institutions face recurring contestations regarding capacity to bring trans issue governance to fruition with efficiency and representativeness unintended consequences of integration processes become part of the stock of learning and adaptation thirty years after the wall europe is sponsoring a handful of them across the continent as well as in partnerships with neighboring states in middle east and north africa in a global context trump s hypothetic border wall with

in the electoral year of 2020 he may well have found additional sustenance for claiming reelection after surviving an impeachment trial however this does not assure the upper hand on ongoing conflicts for framing globalization of which trumpism contributes just one piece in a million piece puzzle even though similar moves are still on the run making america once again great no longer seems a matter reserved for domestic nostalgia after underestimating trump s political muscle for long multilateralism and its institutions suffer accordingly the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy seems

gross external public debt inflows surged to 6 billion in first seven months of the current fiscal year higher by 138 on the back of major inflows from the asian development bank adb and china the two creditors that are not toeing washington s line inflows from china and the adb have helped pakistan meet its external financing needs amid the world bank president s criticism of the manila based lending agency for bailing out islamabad bilateral and multilateral creditors and commercial banks disbursed 6 01 billion in loans in july january of fiscal year 2019 20 according to figures compiled by the ministry of economic affairs the figures did not include the repayments which were only available for the six month period the ministry of finance last month said pakistan paid back 3 8 billion to its international creditors in six months in addition to the 6 billion in gross public debt inflows pakistan also received 3 32 billion as investment in the government s debt securities known as hot foreign money loans of 6 billion were equal to 47 7 of the projected 12 6 billion worth of borrowing the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government has targeted to secure in the current fiscal year in a bid to bridge the current account deficit and meet the debt repayment requirement the international monetary fund imf has estimated pakistan s gross financing requirement at 27 3 billion for the current fiscal year and expects that the country will receive 18 8 billion through official channels the seven month disbursements were higher by 3 5 billion or 138 compared with gross loans of 2 5 billion in the same period of previous fiscal year breakdown of the 6 billion worth of loans indicates that pakistan s external debt woes will not ease in the near future and it will keep taking new loans to repay the old ones out of the 6 billion pakistan received 5 2 billion or 86 3 in non project aid which has been used to either finance the budget build foreign currency reserves or buy oil out of this the direct budget and balance of payments support stood at 4 billion or 66 of the total loans manila based adb has so far provided 2 12 billion exceeding the annual target of 1 7 billion however out of the 2 12 billion the adb s budgetary support amounted to 1 8 billion including a billion dollars in crisis response facility last week world bank president david malpass chided other development banks for lending too quickly to heavily indebted countries saying some were helping worsen the already challenging debt situation malpass said the adb was pushing billions of dollars into a fiscally challenging situation in pakistan as compared to the adb lending the world bank has not come forward in a major way to help pakistan meet its financing needs in challenging times historically the world bank and the imf has acted in unison the world bank has released just 244 million so far against the annual estimate of close to 1 2 billion the world bank s disbursements were hardly 22 of the annual projection the world bank is expected to approve policy loans next month but after its president s statement it remains to be seen whether the lender will still approve the scheduled loans or not the borrowing of 6 billion in july january of current fiscal year included 1 8 billion in commercial loans which was equal to 90 of the annual borrowing target of 2 billion disbursements by bilateral lenders stood at 567 million which was higher than the annual target of 480 million china disbursed 433 4 million in project financing in the first seven months of the current fiscal year in addition to that a chinese commercial bank disbursed 700 million in commercial loan taking its contribution to 1 1 billion or 19 of the total disbursements the islamic development bank disbursed 638 million under the oil credit facility out of the total of 1 1 billion saudi arabia has so far given 581 million worth of oil against the annual credit facility of 3 2 billion the imf has barred pakistan from returning chinese loans during its programme period the 700 million in the commercial loan was in essence the rollover of a similar facility that islamabad paid back in september last year during the inconclusive second review talks the imf had objected to repaying the chinese loans according to sources the government has not yet floated global bonds against the annual borrowing target of 3 billion the ministry of finance had planned to float bonds in november last year but it has not yet given the reason for delay the government is also relying on hot foreign money which has so far been amounted to 3 3 billion but this money is coming at the expense of growth in local industries in order to attract hot foreign money the central bank has kept the key interest rate at 13 25 published in the express tribune february 22 2020 like business on facebook follow tribunebiz on twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation
a recent piece in jacobin revisited the battle of seattle 20 years later it argues that the blockade of the world trade organization round at the homeland of grunge and starbucks was a turning point for the left after the 1990s shortcomings as global elites got a rude awakening from social movements and civil society a new global grammar of political action seemed available for the downtrodden in a new millennium 10 years after the arab spring 20 years after seattle 30 years after the berlin wall we contemplate neither the end of history nor raptured left internationalisms the global economy still deals with scars from its deepest crisis since 1929 populism rages on with democracy locked down in a downward spiral all around from the ashes of a wto meeting that never was donald trump emerged as an unlikely force for global transformation from trade patterns through the state of democracy to the resilience of civil liberties the potus was associated with broad strokes of social transformation in a brief spam of time this scenario seems puzzling we should be able to provide tentative answers or at least a potential roadmap by the late 1980s several complex processes seemed to lead to improbable yet expected outcomes the berlin wall s fall plus ussr s implosion provided massive pushes for european integration maastricht 1992 and nato enlargement with prominent former members of warsaw pact at the helm of 1991 s visegrad group five decades of gatt culminated with the successful completion of the uruguay round in 1994 and the creation of the world trade organization wto making justice to robert krasner s prototypical definition of international regimes sets of implicit or explicit principles norms rules and decision making processes around which actors expectations converge in a given area of international relations the world trade organization swiftly succeeded the long standing gatt in 1995 with 76 founding members as robert keohane famously stated talks about cooperation after hegemony reserved several prominent roles for international institutions the wto as a multilateral institution was born with teeth an enforcement mechanism for dispute settlement among a broad constituency now with a membership of 164 countries it contemplates chronicles of a death long foretold in the course of 25 years a partially globalized international economy endured a series of global crises the tequila crisis of 1994 opened gates for whirlwinds of turmoil in emerging states mexico argentina thailand indonesia russia brazil all still in the 20th century the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s was the first of its kind in the new millennium however most of us were deeply surprised apart from nouriel roubini by the scope and depth of the us 2008 real estate debacle which pulled the trigger for a global crash notwithstanding those massive retreats for global economy trade in goods and services grew far above the world s gross domestic product between 1995 and 2010 from the wto s birth to the sluggish aftermath of the crisis part of this can be associated with current international framework in spite of its limitations the dismal outcomes of the doha round in 2006 sent early signs of discomfort in multilateral trade as emerging economies and oecd members clashed in a number of issue areas on matters that proved to be pervasive such as agriculture and property rights after the crisis global trade became the staple of a new wave of populist assault on globalism not restricted to inflamed rhetoric protectionist policies were adopted in a number of countries roberto de azevêdo s focus on small packages of reforms may have proved a prudent policy route for a contested institution like the wto but they feel short in face of the breadth of new challenges with disquieting global effects in that respect president trump s inauguration may be considered a tipping point twenty five years after its inception the wto reached paralysis in late 2019 as the us president trump refused to appoint two representatives to replace retired members of the appellation body after seattle another kind of blockage damages the workings of multilateralism only that this time with a full blown knockout in a world already battered by trade wars between us and china dispute settlement in a toothless wto may be reduced to bilateral maneuvering at the edge of the art of the deal by depriving the wto of a defining feature trump brought the state back in as a force to be reckoned in international political economy something the prophecies of 1989 could not contemplate in full his was an approach that countered post cold war forecasts it still has appeal for disenfranchised audiences as jose bove drove a bulldozer to a mcdonalds in defense of french agriculture on the ropes of the integrated markets in a partially globalized economy globalism was vilified as the root of economic shortcomings this was one of the key seattle motifs a widening gulf between global elites and the rest something that returned a decade later in occupy wall st under the guise of 99 versus 1 slogans another defining trend was the late arrival of trade unions at the scene of the seattle clashes the latest losers of globalized capitalism reared their heads for rust belts became pockets of disaffection in developed economies of course demoted industrial areas looking for greatness again looked at the wto suspiciously an anathema as early as 2011 trump emerged as unlikely champion of definitely unlike groups the 1 and the rest for liberals and tycoons his residual charm at the lost art of the deal meant an uncompromising stance for american corporations after the brief spell of obama keynesianism lost its appeal not to be missed was the threat of a rising china one that surprisingly at least in retrospect quickly adopted multilateral trappings and free trade rhetoric across international forums in campaign trump promised an end to chinese violence a host of protective trade measures followed suit at the expense of global trade if he delivered the goods up to a point for the 1 what would be left for the rest in a baffling reversal of attitudes trump emerged from his 2016 campaign as a working class hero against an elitist democratic party his victory was dully consolidated in rust belts as the former reality show presenter rode america promising advantageous bilateral trade deals and made in usa brands prevailing at global arenas his appreciation for fake news on social networks seemed to conflict with economic statistics which saw employment rates bouncing back to the days of hillary s husband bill clinton as well as sustained gdp increase so did the us eventually become great again in terms in the decade following 2008 the eurozone gdp grew on average only 0 78 yearly though this lays some credibility on trumpist rhetoric india grew on a 7 12 average that means indian gdp doubled in the space of an otherwise for many lost decade under xi jinping china experienced a slowdown of growth rates at the tail end of its transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial powerhouse

washington the democratic primary race remains highly unpredictable but there is one thing we already know for sure about the party s next presidential nominee she or he has big plans to tax the very rich every leading candidate in the party s 2020 field from relative moderates like joseph r biden jr michael r bloomberg pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar to liberals like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren has proposed trillions of dollars in new taxes on businesses and wealthy americans in each case and to wildly varying degrees the money would fund new government spending in areas like health care education housing and climate change and a range of other programs meant to help the poor and the middle class democratic candidates have long campaigned on higher taxes for the rich but this year s set of plans represents a striking escalation from past party nominees they are a product of what longtime democratic policy hands describe as a confluence of inequality trends grass roots pressure the severing of some candidates ties with the wealthy liberal donor class and a democratic voter backlash against the 2017 tax cuts signed by president trump which delivered their largest benefits to corporations and high earners in a campaign where the leading candidates have sparred over electability and progressivity the democrats tax and spending plans provide one of the most vivid illustrations of how widely their ambitions for the size of government diverge and how far their party has moved in the last four years toward taxing the small slice of americans who reap the economy s largest rewards
wall street s risk off mood appears to be continuing this morning as rising coronavirus tallies seem to have investors on edge even as this earnings season continues to be generally better than expected investors and traders seem to be focusing instead on the outbreak s potential impact on corporate earnings as the number of cases jumped in china overnight and south korea and japan are also reporting substantial numbers of infections from a corporate standpoint investors were particularly worried after coca cola nyse ko said the outbreak would reduce its earnings as fears mounted market participants flocked to the relative safety of u s government debt pushing the yield on the 10 year treasury note below 1 5 and that of the 30 year bond to an all time low below 1 92 other corporate news was brighter however as deere company nyse de reported solid earnings of 1 54 per share well above the 1 25 third party consensus revenue also came in ahead of consensus the cautious tone for 2020 struck by ceo john may didn t seem to dampen enthusiasm for the stock de was up 6 in premarket trading keep in mind that we re heading into a weekend which means the selling might be stronger than it otherwise would be as investors and traders may want to not carry as much risk over the two day break when no one knows what the headlines will hold a head scratcher yesterday the main three u s indices ended the day lower after recovering some ground from a sharp intraday drop meanwhile there was an uptick in demand for u s government debt which pressured yields gold prices rose the cboe volatility index indexcboe vxs moved up and the u s dollar jumped the general pressure on stocks and rise in safe haven investments indicated that investors were in a risk off mood because of worries about the coronavirus outbreak but the magnitude of sharp intraday downturn was a bit of a head scratcher defying ready explanation story continues there s always the chance someone made a large trading mistake but if this had been a fat finger situation where by one big desk sold more shares than it meant to then it seems likely that the market would have bounced back more than it did perhaps a combination of virus fears and pre election uncertainty plus a stock market that has run out of near term catalysts to move higher has stoked a bit of hair trigger volatility in the market whatever the selling catalyst it seems that investors wanted to book some profits from the market s recent strength but it was encouraging to see that investors also wanted to buy the dip another mini mystery while the financials sector did end the day slightly lower on pressure from falling treasury yields bank stocks didn t do that badly in general and regional banks were actually up for the day often banks will do worse when treasury yields fall because it can squeeze the margin between what they can charge on loans and what they earn on deposits but it seems that the traditional inverse relationship between yields and bank shares wasn t entirely in place yesterday sometimes when traditional relationships seem to be out of whack and you re not sure of the cause it could be best to use caution not stuck in a rut it was notable that although the russell 2000 index indexrussell rut also took a downturn during the session it managed to recover into positive territory perhaps investors were rotating some money from large names that have done well recently and into small cap stocks but the rut was also helped as regional banks had a pretty good day because they make up a good chunk of the index it may also be a case of investors having an increased appetite for smaller domestic companies that have less exposure to china than some large multinationals chart of the day hot oil cooling despite the risk off mood among investors on thursday oil which is generally considered a riskier asset and often falls when traders flock to safe haven investments gained ground cme crude oil

joining the risk off parade amid fresh coronavirus fears data source cme group chart source the thinkorswim platform from td ameritrade for illustrative purposes only past performance does not guarantee future results manufacturing recovery continues this week has been relatively good for manufacturing data a good sign considering the sector has been beaten up and has only recently begun showing signs of a recovery on tuesday the general business conditions index of the fed s february empire state manufacturing survey rose to 12 9 when only a 6 3 reading had been expected in a briefing com consensus then yesterday a key index in the philadelphia fed s february manufacturing business outlook survey jumped to 36 7 when 10 7 had been expected all this is on the heels of the closely watched institute for supply management s manufacturing index earlier this month surprisingly returning to expansionary territory after five straight months of contraction but will virus infect factory recovery the coronavirus outbreak is casting a shadow of uncertainty over the domestic factory sector as the outbreak wears on chinese manufacturing is hamstrung by employees who can t get to work and the global air and sea freight system has also taken a big hit that means u s manufacturers may have trouble getting parts they need which could crimp the recovering sector while weakness in manufacturing appears to show signs of softening the covid 19 outbreak may impact manufacturing supply chains in the u s in the coming months conference board senior director of economic research ataman ozyildirim said in a statement accompanying the release of the think tank s january leading indicators report yesterday shelter from the storm while domestic manufacturing might take a ding from the outbreak of covid 19 the u s housing market might be one place that s better able to weather the fallout from the epidemic low interest rates have been one thing helping demand for housing and the coronavirus spurred flight to u s government debt could help keep rates low further it seems likely that if the outbreak begins to truly dent economic growth around the globe and in

finance ministers and central bankers from the group of 20 nations will meet on saturday and sunday in the saudi capital of riyadh for the first time since the virus forced much of china to be quarantined and then began to spread the consensus of economists remains for a short term hit to demand in china and then globally followed by a rebound the international monetary fund reiterated this week that the worldwide expansion is set to moderately strengthen this year after being hurt in 2019 by the u s china trade war that could prove too optimistic a view given chinese factories are still operating around half their capacity and many workers remain housebound the partial shutdown of the world s second biggest economy is having an effect elsewhere by weakening trade fraying manufacturing supply chains reducing tourism and fanning investor uncertainty we re watching the impact with grave concern and keeping a close eye on downside risks bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda told lawmakers in tokyo before heading to saudi arabia other topics set to be discussed by the g 20 include the use of digital currencies the imposition of taxes on technology companies and money laundering a statement will be released by the hosts on sunday but the virus will dominate the debate already on course for its worst expansion in three decades some analysts now reckon the chinese economy will contract this quarter from the previous three months france italy and japan already did so at the end of last year fresh data on friday underscored the reason for concern at the g 20 meeting as u s business activity shrank for the first time since 2013 while manufacturing gauges in australia and japan weakened and early export orders for south korea showed a slump in chinese demand china reported car sales sank 92 in the first half of february the euro area went against the trend though with activity accelerating at the fastest pace in six months in february economists at standard chartered said in a report on friday that the virus could end up affecting 42 of china s economy as they also cut their forecast for global growth this year to 3 from 3 2 even worse would be an international pandemic defined as a disease spreading across multiple continents oxford economics ltd calculates such an event could slash world output by more than 1 trillion if growth continues to slide a key question for the g 20 will be whether its members can coordinate a response said tom orlik chief economist at bloomberg economics in washington against a backdrop of resurgent nationalism fractious trade disputes and limited policy space common purpose might be difficult to achieve some g 20 policymakers are already responding china has led the way by cutting market interest rates and could take the bolder step of reducing reserve requirements central banks in indonesia mexico turkey and south africa have also cut rates this year governments in more than half of the g 20 economies are easing budgets with south korean president moon jae in this week calling for an emergency prescription others are adopting a wait and see stance while federal reserve and european central bank officials are on the alert to the risks posed by the virus they have so far not signaled any intention to loosen monetary policy a dilemma for policy makers is that although imf managing director kristalina georgieva has suggested there may be a need for synchronized or even better coordinated measures central banks and governments lack ammunition given the low level of interest rates and high level of budget deficits one reason for confidence is that stock investors still seem to be betting on a v shaped recovery the standard poor s 500 index is up 4 this year and 22 from a year ago and the broader msci world index has also climbed over the same timeframes such gains however are a concern to economists at citigroup inc in the advanced economies alone they say easy financial conditions point to growth of 2 6 this year twice the pace they predict financial markets could be overconfident in expecting an economic recovery said pernille henneberg an economist at citigroup the global economy and financial markets have not seen the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak yet

are available in the appendix to our investor slide presentation which is available in the investors section of our website at ir casella com and with that i ll turn it over to john casella who ll begin today s discussion john john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thanks joe and good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and our results for 2019 this was another strong and exciting year as we continue to execute well against the key strategies of our 2021 plan we meaningfully grew the business with nine acquisitions in the year with approximately 53 million of annualized revenues and as we announced yesterday we ve closed on two acquisitions thus far in 2020 with an estimated 6 million of annualized revenues making a strong start to the year in terms of our continued execution against our acquisition strategy our success in 2019 is reflected within our numbers for the year as we grew revenues by over 12 increased adjusted ebitda by over 13 and improved normalized free cash flow by nearly 18 notably our 2019 revenue adjusted ebitda normalized free cash flow results met or exceeded our guidance ranges that were raised in october these accomplishments for our team are perhaps even more impressive given that during fiscal year 2019 we experienced an 8 million adjusted ebitda headwind related to the november 2018 closure of our southbridge landfill so the rest of the business improved by over 26 million in the year which emphasizes the strength within our solid waste recycling organics and our customer solutions businesses coupled with the success of our acquisition strategy in 2020 we will remain focused on executing against our 2021 plan the five key strategies are consistent with that plan as announced in august of 2017 which includes increasing landfill returns driving additional profitability in the collection operations creating incremental value through resource solutions using technology to drive profitable growth and efficiently allocating capital to balance delivering with smart growth our first strategy in our 2021 plan is increasing landfill returns as a vertically integrated resource management company we are highly focused on providing services to our customers that meet their needs and future environmental service needs we continuously strive to help our customers meet their sustainability goals through increased resource recovery and diversion programs we ve developed leading recycling programs and we are one of the most prominent organics companies in the northeast that said landfills also play a critical role within today s suitability infrastructure these necessary highly regulated sites not only provide safe environmentally sound destinations for products and materials at the end of the consumption lifecycle but they also service outlets for various special ways and other time sensitive material such as debris and cleanup from natural disasters we are proud of our long track record of developing and operating safe landfills that meet the needs of our customers while creating tremendous value for our host communities and other community stakeholders while we continue to work to find higher and better uses for all of the materials in the waste stream there s not a silver bullet solution that magically transforms waste into new products or resources landfill remained the safest lowest greenhouse gas footprint and the most reliable means to dispose of waste today in 2019 our teams achieved two important landfill expansions that will allow us to continue to meet the needs of our customers in 2019 we received a 2 7 million cubic yard expansion at our hakes facility which will provide roughly five years of additional capacity as we look to bridge through the next site next phase and in september 2019 we received a 13 7 million cubic yard expansion at our waste usa facility in vermont we started to work though the initial excavation phase and will continue to do so in 2020 this expansion extends the life of the site by an estimated 20 years despite these great successes we ve faced an unexpected setback at our north country landfill located in new hampshire two weeks ago when we learned from the new hampshire department of environmental services that it decided to interpret the state s public benefit statute in the manner that we believe was different than how it had consistently interpreted in the past given this we have withdrawn our airspace expansion permit and we are working diligently to resubmit it to meet the requirements of this new interpretation of the long established statute this will result in us having to ramp down volumes to the site in 2020 as we have incorporated and we have incorporated this impact into our guidance our second strategy in 2021 plan is driving further profitability within our hauling business ed will provide further details on our performance key metrics and various initiatives but we continue to execute well our pricing and operational strategies we again advanced strong pricing 4 8 in the quarter as we are focused on offsetting continued labor disposal and recycling cost inflation operational excellence is an important initiative as we aim to ensure that we have the highest levels of service compliance reduce safety incidence and operating efficiency our teams also continue to work diligently in integrating acquisitions we continue to recognize such follow through as an important element in driving high free cash flow and additional shareholder value the third strategy in our 2021 plan has been creating incremental value through resource solutions we improved recycling adjusted ebitda by 4 6 million year over year in 2019 even with commodity prices down roughly 20 over the same period this exemplifies the strength and success of our risk off taking programs which greatly mitigate our exposure to volatility and declines in the global recycling markets 2019 was an exceptional year for the team as we reset two major recycling processing contracts including the city of boston on july 1 as well as two completed equipment upgrade projects that target reducing operating costs through increased automation as well as and probably most importantly improving the quality of our outbound materials as we look to 2020 and beyond we plan to continue to focus on partnering to build modernized economically sustainable recycling programs we plan to continue to make investments in recycling equipment operating initiatives and customer education programs we also plan to target further refinements to our contamination fee program along with resetting our remaining legacy third party contracts over time underlying all of this we remain focused on generating an appropriate return on our recycling assets the customer solutions and organics team also performed very well during the year with combined adjusted ebitda growth of over 700 000 in 2019 the fourth strategy in the 2021 plan is using technology to drive profitable and efficient growth we continue to make great progress in leveraging our 2018 implementation of netsuite while we have grown the business considerably through acquisitions we are realizing better scale through more streamlined purchasing processes we plan to focus our efforts in 2020 to further digitizing and modernizing our procurement process as we drive better scale and work toward further reducing costs of existing processes we also aim to continuously enhance our customer experience and our proactiveness and responsiveness to their needs the recent upgrades to our crm and early success related to our new case management system are meaningful in our ability to achieve these goals through better integration of our sales and customer care teams moving to our final strategy in our 2021 plan which is allocating capital to balance delevering with smart growth we executed very well against this strategy in 2019 as part of our 2021 plan we outlined a goal to acquire 20 million to 40 million per year of annualized revenue in 2019 we again outpaced this target acquiring 53 million of annualized revenue through our disciplined approach overall we remain pleased with the performance of the acquisitions thus far our focus remains high on operational integration and achieving performer returns as i have mentioned we have completed two acquisitions so far in 2020 with approximately 6 million of annualized revenues this is a strong start to the year as part of our growth strategy and we re excited to welcome these new employees to our team and to provide a high level of service to our new customers in january we acquired an industrial recycling processing facility in albany new york which is a great complement to our september 19 market entry with the acquisition of select solid waste assets from republic services in february we acquired daily and sun which is a great strategic fit to our massachusetts collection operations our near term pipeline remains robust and we are positioned well to continue to opportunistically growth the business and further drive free cash flow we believe that there is over 400 million of acquisition opportunity in the midterm across our market areas and we ll continue to selectively look at opportunities in adjacent markets one area that is not specifically outlined in our 2021 plan but is very important to our continued long term success underlies all of our initiatives is the focus on further building our team over the past year we ve made significant progress and enhancements to our human resource programs our ongoing goals include being the preferred employer within the markets that we operate one of our key programs career path career development we found early success by way of providing greater transparency of advancement opportunities within key roles such as drivers technicians and operators such line of sight bolsters our ability to attract and retain quality employees which would result in lower turnover lower safety incidents while simultaneously improving operational efficiencies and employee morale further strengthening our efforts is the continued investment and dedication to improving and recruiting more rigorous and timely onboarding employee engagement along with training and development as an example we ve developed and trained hubs across our operations that enable us to recruit and train our own cdl drivers and apprentice level technicians ultimately although our programs are early on they are yielding benefits including improved applicants for higher job candidates across key operational roles a positive indicator that our programs are really beginning to work well wrapping up as reflected in our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance we are tracking well against our 2021 plan which displays continued execution of our key strategies with a goal of driving additional shareholder value and with that i ll turn it over to ned ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thanks john revenues in the fourth quarter were 193 6 million up 18 9 million or 10 8 year over year with 7 4 of the increase driven by acquisition activity solid waste revenues were up 18 4 million year over year with price up 5 volumes down 0 9 and 9 9 growth from acquisitions revenues in the collection line of business were up 15 2 million year over year with price up 4 8 across all lines of business volume is slightly down risk recovery fees up 2 2 and acquisitions up 10 9 million revenues in the disposal line of business were up 2 3 million year over year despite the closure of the southbridge landfill in november of 18 which resulted in a 1 2 million negative year over year variance the landfill pricing environment remains strong and we increased reported landfill pricing by 7 6 year over year and in addition we increased average price per ton at the landfills by 7 8 as we improved our mix of customers and volumes excluding the southbridge landfill closure landfill tons were up 3 1 year over year recycling revenues were down 700 000 year over year with 2 7 million lower commodity pricing and 300 000 lower volumes partially offset by 2 2 million higher third party tipping fees in addition we also have higher intercompany processing fees commodity prices were down 38 year over year this is mainly on lower occ lower mix paper plastics and metals pricing pricing was also down 28 from the first quarter through the fourth quarter of 2019 organics revenues were down 300 000 year over year on lower volumes as we continue to shed sledges that do not meet our lower tolerance for orders and management at our landfill sites and processing sites customer solutions revenues were up 2 2 million year over year due to several new multi site retail customers and strong growth in our industrial services business adjusted ebitda was 41 1 million in the quarter up 7 3 million or up 21 year over year adjusted ebitda margins were 21 2 for the quarter up 185 basis points year over year we saw margin improvement across almost all lines of business during the fourth quarter we anniversaried the margin headwind from the closure of the southbridge landfill and began to recognize each air comps on disposal and labor inflation that we faced over the last few years solid waste adjusted ebitda was 39 3 million in the quarter up 7 4 million year over year mainly driven by strong pricing higher landfill volumes and acquisition activity recycling adjusted ebitda was flat year over year with 2 7 million lower commodity prices mainly offset by higher third party tipping fees and also intercompany tipping fees adjusted ebitda was 0 5 million in the other segment this is down slightly year over year this is mainly driving by lower project work though customer solutions the organic script was up slightly year over year they did a great job during the period optimizing disposal outlets and driving pricing in this tough sludge environment as we work to reduce these volumes into our landfills and other sites cost of operations was up 9 2 million year over year and down a 195 basis points as a percentage of revenues roughly 8 7 million of the increase was driven by acquisition activity and most of the remainder was driven by inflation across direct labor third party disposal and vehicle maintenance general and administrative costs were up 2 9 million year over year and up 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue roughly 1 7 million of the increase was driven by acquisition activity however for fiscal 2019 g a costs were 12 5 of revenues and this down roughly 80 basis points from fiscal 2017 as a direct result of our efforts to drive back office efficiencies through our technology plant combined with the scale we continue to gain as we grow our revenues depreciation and amortization costs were up 2 7 million year over year mainly due to higher depreciation on trucks and equipment related to our fleet and yellow iron plant and acquisition activity the fourth quarter includes several unique items on the income statement we had 600 000 of legal and transaction costs related to our ongoing efforts to cap and close the southbridge landfill and we incurred 450 000 of expense in acquisition activities as of december 31 2019 our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3 07 times this is down from september 30 as we generate significant cash during the quarter and continue to grow ebitda our consolidated funded debt net was 521 3 million with liquidity of 152 1 million in addition we have fixed our interest rate on roughly 68 of our debt during the fourth quarter we completed the remarketing of two of our existing solid waste industrial revenue bonds on october 1 we remarketed our 11 million new hampshire bfa senior unsecured bonds at a 2 950 fixed rate through the 2029 maturity date and then on december 3 we remarketed 25 million of new york efc senior unsecured bonds at 2 78 fixed rate for 10 years both excellent rates for us going forward net cash provided by operating activities was down 4 million year over year for the full year with higher operating results offset mainly by the reduction in short term liabilities this negative change in working capital was mainly driven by 5 3 million negative through the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 we ve talked about this in the last several quarters this shifted payments on landfill operating lease contracts from an investing activity to an operating activity under statement of cash flows this change only impacted the financial statement positioning of the outflow we also had a 8 5 million negative impact associated with the reduction of accrued liabilities due to cash outflows from the southbridge landfill closure and the remediation project at a former scrap yard owned by one of our subsidiaries in potsdam new york there was also a 9 5 million negative impact due to timing differences in cash outflows and inflows from accounts receivable accounts payable and prepaids and other liabilities overall normalized free cash flow is 55 5 million for fiscal 2019 this is up 8 4 million or 17 4 year over year as stated in our press release yesterday afternoon we announced guidance for fiscal 2020 by estimating results in the following ranges revenues between 800 million and 815 million are up 8 6 at the midpoint adjusted ebitda between 170 million and 174 million or up 9 9 at the midpoint and normalized free cash flow between 60 million and 64 million were up 11 8 million at the midpoint the 2020 guidance includes 4 7 revenue growth from the rollover impact of applications completed in 2019 and those already completed in early 2020 however our 2020 guidance does not include the impact from any acquisitions that has not yet been completed we expect adjusted ebitda growth to be driven by the following factors in 2020 we expect our collection line of business to be up 5 million to 7 million of ebitda driven by robust pricing and partially offset by wage and disposal cost inflation we expect all of our disposal sites excluding north country to be up 7 million to 8 million driven by robust pricing and some very limited volume growth as john discussed we expect our north country landfill to be down 4 5 million as we are slowing tonnages into the site our resource solutions group recycling organics and customer solutions we expect to be 2 million to 3 million as we continue to improve our revenue model off take risk and improve operational efficiencies we expect roughly 6 million to 8 million of rollover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2019 in early 2020 and we expect a slight headwind of 2 million to 4 million mainly from g a growth and a few other factors in the business overall we expect about 30 basis points of ebitda margin expansion during the year working capital and net cash provided by operating activities will be negatively impacted in 2020 as we plan to spend roughly 14 million on the final capping and closure at the southbridge landfill we expect to substantially complete this work during 2020 one other quick note we have changed our segment reporting for 2020 with the recycling organics and customer solutions groups now rolling up into the resource solutions segment so we ll have the eastern region western region resource solutions and corporate entities and with that i ll turn it over ed thank you edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thanks ned and good morning everyone we finished the year strong we continued to be a price leader in our markets our legacy businesses are performing well and we made considerable progress integrating our acquisitions during the quarter consolidated cost of ops as a percentage of revenue improved by almost 200 basis points over q4 last year driven both by price and by improved operating costs at the landfills and better performance at our recycling organics and resource solutions businesses our collection operations which generate about 50 of our revenue grew 18 over the same quarter last year primarily through acquisitions i have mentioned in the past that acquisitions tend to dilute our margins in the first year as it takes time to get pricing where it should be and to increase the level of automation appropriate to the operation given that margin headwind we are really happy with the overall performance in the quarter on a same store basis excluding the acquisitions we grew collection pricing by 4 8 we re slightly negative on volume and improved our overall variable margin contribution per driver hour which is our key productivity metric by 1 5 recycling is a hot subject and i know that many industry participants are struggling in this low commodity price market so i think it s worth repeating some of our comments from before we along with our customers in the northeast believe recycling is an integral part of a long term sustainable economy and it s our obligation to provide our customers with the best possible outcome and keep the recycling model economically and environmentally sustainable we continue to make investments to increase throughput and operating efficiency as well as to produce cleaner products that will demand a higher relative price in the commodity markets but we provide a service we do not take on the commodity risk and we look for an acceptable return on our investment we have spent several years educating the market and transitioning our business model accordingly and although there remain a few minor legacy contracts yet to roll off we have effectively insulated ourselves from commodity risk and our recycling operations are a positive contributor to our financial performance a quick update on our progress with integrating our acquisitions in the rochester market where we acquired four collection operations in a transfer station in late 2018 we have completed the first three phases of our integration process management integration and back office system conversions were completed first initial operational integration followed including route optimization and service changes where appropriate and more recently the careful elevation of pricing to market rates we are now entering phase 4 increasing the level of automation and we see some significant opportunities our team in rochester has worked very hard to get these things done and i thank them for their exceptional effort we re also making progress with our more recent albany western mass southern vermont acquisitions and integrating them with our ford edward and existing southern vermont operations phase 1 is complete and we are well into phase 2 with a good management structure and a solid market area plan in place last quarter i mentioned the enhancements we ve been making to our operational management capabilities adding foundational elements to both run our existing businesses well and to integrate newly acquired businesses smoothly we re making significant progress on further developing our operational processes and systems and are continuing to add resources where needed to excavate the integration of future acquisitions we ve learned over the past year and a half where the pinch points are and as we improve our processes we will be able to realize synergies faster and increase our capacity to take on more in the future we finished the year strong and we re excited about the opportunities in front of us and look forward to your questions with that i d like to turn it back to the operator now to start the q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of tyler brown with raymond james tyler brown raymond james analyst good morning guys john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary good morning tyler edwin d johnson president chief operating officer good morning tyler tyler brown raymond james analyst hey so i m little unclear on the north country update so to be clear the decision to pull the permit expansion was based on a governmental interpretation issue it wasn t related to a vote is that right john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary no that s exactly right tyler the agency interpreted the statute differently than they had in the past and we will take that into account and reapply based on the information that we ve given it s a deviation from how they view that statute for my view probably over 20 years so we will reapply with in fairly short order tyler brown raymond james analyst okay so do you plan to resubmit and then in conjunction with i guess governmental approval north country does require a local vote john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary no it does not we have approval for this permit we have approval this is a permit that will give us probably four or five years of capacity we have local approval for that if we go on beyond that we would need the local vote but not for the permit that s in front of that will go back in front of the ec shortly tyler brown raymond james analyst okay okay and so maybe at the 2020 tonnage levels how many years does that side have does it have a handful maybe four or five john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah i would say it s four or five years tyler brown raymond james analyst okay and then obviously it s a pretty big drag but where are those tons going are you going to try to internalize them elsewhere in the fleet john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary some of them certainly will be internalized to other facilities some of them will go to third some of the funds will go to third party facilities but we will internalize as much as we can within our system edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah we service roughly 150 towns and cities in the state of new hampshire and having to move tonnages out of the state of new hampshire is not easy because you can take a state waste into maine you can t take it into vermont massachusetts doesn t have capacities so you ll have to try to move it out to new york which could be as much as a 50 increase tyler brown raymond james analyst wow okay ok that s helpful and then ned so you mentioned that it s a 4 5 million ebitda drag from north country specifically but then you also mentioned that there s a plus seven to eight from everything else but i was wondering if you could parse that seven to eight between maybe hakes chemung and pricing or just any flavor would be helpful ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer it s overall most of its just price and there s some extra tons in new york as you know last year chemung ran a little bit late so we ll ramp some tonnages to get that up to level the rest of the sites are looking to have a pretty good year normal pricing operating efficiencies tyler brown raymond james analyst and there is no fundamental change in the north eastern pricing dynamic i mean it still feels very scarce capacity john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah i mean i think the supply and demand equation really hasn t changed tyler for sure it s exactly right tyler brown raymond james analyst and then maybe ned on the capex side so i appreciate that you got a number of one i m going to call it one tiny capex items this year waste usa build out southbridge capping and you have some other non recurring items but to maybe a little bit more clear will the waste usa in the southbridge spend basically be done in 2020 or does that also linger into 21 or 22 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer so southbridge it s a combination of capping closure the majority of it s they are some short term liabilities that will be worked down about 14 million and we expect the majority of that to be done in the year what we need is a good construction season to get all of the work done that there s quite a few acres so we ll be cap and waste usa the major part of the excavation will be done in 2020 and then we ll construct the south in 2021 and then we ll be into the new expansion area tyler brown raymond james analyst okay and then so if i was to sum up those three call it non recurring items i mean it is 40 million some out the door in cash does that restrict your ability to do m a or do you still feel like you have plenty of financial flexibility for good deals out there john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that way we would characterize it with significant availability from an acquisition standpoint in terms of the existing credit facility tyler brown raymond james analyst okay so not a limiting factor and then maybe my last one this is kind of in the same vein but and maybe that s a question for all three of you but how do you feel from a bandwidth perspective be it it be it human capital financial capital i mean all of the different limiting factors how do you guys feel from a bandwidth perspective for future m a john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that you saw us take a little bit of a pause in the third to fourth quarter tyler in terms of acquisition we did a lot of work in terms of really taking a look at the success that we ve had from an acquisition standpoint we ve added people to hr we ve added people to it a few not a lot of overhead but certainly reflective on the work that we ve done to integrate the businesses that we bought over the last 18 months or so so i think that we re feeling good about where we are we ve got a few more resources that we re going to put in place from a development standpoint but we think that back office customer care payables the work that we did that ned did with the finance team to implement netsuite is really paying dividends to us in terms of the back office and we ve added a few people both from an it as well as from an hr standpoint because we ve added about 600 employees in the last year year and a half or so tyler brown raymond james analyst and maybe ed from an operational bandwith perspective do you feel you have enough integration call it manpower if you will edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah if you remember the last quarter i talked about our expansion of our structure so we now have a regional vp of ops in the east and in the west plus we ve added resources at the home office to support the transitions and we as john mentioned we have one or two additions coming on in the near future tyler brown raymond james analyst okay okay good ned i really appreciate the bridge i feel like maybe you ve been asked that question before thank you john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thanks tyler edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thanks tyler operator your next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with jefferies john jefferies analyst hi this is john filling in for hamzah john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary hey john john jefferies analyst hey could you just comment on whether you think landfill pricing is at peak right now in your system and how much run away do you think is out there john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that we ll continue to see you know a reflection of the supply and demand equation so i think we re likely to continue to see fairly robust pricing because of the supply and demand equation so i think it s fair to say that it will you know i don t know that we would anticipate it being exactly as strong as it was in 19 on the go forward maybe a little bit more modest but still relatively in the same zip code john jefferies analyst great so i have one more question and then i ll turn it over can you also comment on your margin target of 29 in the solid waste and how quickly you think you can get there also any execution risks we should be thinking about as well edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so that s the one target in the 2021 plan that we re probably tracking a little light against we ended the year in solid waste at sorry i said it without the number at around 26 and as you know we ve had a couple of headwinds there for the last year whether it be wage inflation or the south bridge closure some of the long haul transportation we got back to improving margins in the fourth quarter we had a great overall quarter of improving margins but in solid waste our margins were up over 200 basis points 210 basis points in the fourth quarter and we re looking at a year next year where we believe we d anniversaried a lot of the fundamental changes we made from wage reset transportation third party disposals we ll get back to the cadence of 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin enhancement in solid waste the north country will weigh on that a little bit in the year so we re probably there s no reason we shouldn t get to that destination but we are tracking a little behind i think we end 2021 closer to 27 ish 27 5 john jefferies analyst got it thank you that s very helpful john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah operator your next question comes from the line of sean eastman with keybanc markets sean eastman keybanc markets analyst gentlemen thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to go back to the north country landfill setback i just want to understand better the timeline of the resubmission process and just based on that is it likely that this becomes a tailwind as we look into 2021 john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i wouldn t anticipate it would be the tailwind through 2021 at this point but we obviously we ve got to go through the process we re in the process of doing that now we ll get the resubmission in as soon as we can but i would not anticipate at this point it being an issue in 2021 sean eastman keybanc markets analyst okay got it and on the volume shedding i just wanted to get some color on whether this was this has been contemplated for some time based on you know the strategic initiatives or whether there s been any shifts of late in terms of competitive dynamics and you know any particular pieces of business john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary we started a process early in 19 of reevaluating our customers on a profitability basis particularly in the roll off line of business but also the rest of the business and simply readdressing customers that over time had eroding margins and so we started pushing price selectively to those customers or talking to them about how to change their operations so that they could you know keep their costs the same but not hurt our margins and in that process there are customers that simply go to a competitor and that s ok as long as we re keeping our price disciplined and we re keeping our profitability in place sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it so no fully sort of expected kind of john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah exactly no surprises not at all sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it and then just in trying to understand you know in the fourth quarter you know again price growth ahead of internal budgeted expectations you know just understanding the dynamic there you know is it that the underlying inflationary environment was also higher than budgeted or john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that it s fair to say that you know the entire industry is feeling pressure from a wage standpoint which you know in one sense is a positive for you know drivers mechanics but you know the entire industry and the transportation industry is feeling a lot of wage inflation currently seeing inflation from a recycling standpoint inflation from a disposal perspective so there s a lot of inflation you know inherent in the business model at this point in time edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah and if you look at the year we ended up solid waste at 5 1 overall price and we had budgeted around 4 but we also ended up with you know about 75 basis points more inflation and it was on third party transportation third party disposal and direct labor lines sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it okay that makes sense edwin d johnson president chief operating officer as we talked about in the fourth quarter we started to really comp a lot of that and start to drop more to the bottom line again sean eastman keybanc markets analyst yeah ok that makes sense and then lastly from me you know just given the bolstering of the hr and back office staffing you know the leadership role additions that s a pretty material sort of ebitda drag i guess from a year over year perspective in 2020 so i m just wondering considering those elements and then some of the efficiencies around the crm and the erp have yet to be harvested you know how we re tracking over the next couple years relative to that 12 sg a margin target edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so we ve made quite a bit of headway already as i talked about 80 basis points and it s a combination of lots of different things we re gaining some scale on key roles but we re also gaining efficiency in the back office in 2020 we re focused on a couple of key technology initiatives one is on the procurement side as you know we ve put a new erp in place a year and a half ago and we are focused on digitizing taking paper out automating processes in 2020 and we hope to start to drive even more efficiency there and modernization of our systems we haven t announced the target to the street but this will be a self funding initiative and we ll generate margin benefit over the next two years our other major initiative is really looking at enhancing what we call our order to cash cycle from how customers interact with us to how we dispatch route trucks onboard computing and we re in a pilot phase looking at some new technology there and this could have a really meaningful impact over time to make us easier to do business with and also enhance our ability to service our customers safely and efficiently so it s exciting a little early in that one to lay out a lot of dynamics but from our standpoint we will continue to gain scale as john was talking about there s some interesting growing pains when you grow as much as we have we have grown 35 of our employees in the last two plus years and here is like the funny example our payroll and benefits team a very small reports stuff through my team and we added 35 new employees we hadn t added a single hand in that group so it s almost like a step function we need to add someone there to help support our employees and then you kind of grow into that role so a little bit of that coming into 2020 where we re adding key people to help us to continue to grow effectively sean eastman keybanc markets analyst really helpful thanks for the time everyone john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael hoffman with stifel michael hoffman stifel analyst thank you john and ned how are you doing you re ok ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah i m on crutches but i m michael hoffman stifel analyst and so we understand i think there s congratulations for you john don t you have another grandchild john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i do i do absolutely good question michael hoffman stifel analyst congratulations so to the business of trash if we follow up on the underlying inflation could you actually quantify it as a percentage for some understanding of this because you are getting terrific pricing so what it sounds like is you re doing 5 in landfill solid waste pricing but you re sitting here at 5 5 inflation is that what i heard edwin d johnson president chief operating officer no no no the opposite way yeah well earlier in the year you know there were a few margin headwinds that were a little unfortunate so at ontario and the southbridge comp there are a few things like that that weighed on margins also as they brought in acquired businesses they weighed on margins so you know our direct programs are pricing programs are outpacing inflation if you just look at year to date you know acquisitions alone in our first year are a little bit margin dilutive they weighed on margin 60 basis points ontario weighed on 20 basis points and southbridge 80 basis points so you ve got 160 basis points there and our margins were slightly backwards year over year so all of our other pricing programs are outpacing inflation and markets but we had a few of those you know unfortunate headwinds through the year but i think you know we re setting up nicely for 2020 to outpace inflation michael hoffman stifel analyst okay so to that end i m thinking about cadence the first half of the year gets pretty good margin comparison second half it s a little tougher to net out for up 30 basis points to 50 basis points is what you re trying to get to edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah we were going to guide a little bit stronger than that but with the north country slow down to volume just high margin business that weighs on margins a little bit through the year michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then john just some clear understanding your answer to the north country question are you expecting it to be permitted and therefore online in 21 or we should assume on carrying this headwind factoring it worse just that i still have 5 million of headwind into 20 it stays in 21 and then it comes off john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary you know i think that we re i will hopefully to get through the process and you know have the facility operational by 2021 michael hoffman stifel analyst okay alright so this is 5 million and maybe a little john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary the reason why we you know pushed back on tonnage is because i want to make sure it s obviously there s we re going to get through the process michael but we think that we will get through the process and be able to you know minimize any impact to 2021 michael hoffman stifel analyst perfect okay that helps and then you have done a terrific job in price on the collection side it feels like it s kind of settled into you can sustain middle three s landfill you re in this still exploring sort of you know the market corrections given the disposal reduction where do you think it settles it s obviously 7 8 is not sustainable but where do you think it s settled if we re taking out and trying to model out five or six years will you think about landfill being able to do it forward consistently once you kind of work through all of the market corrections edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah that s what we had in our internal models moving out the next several years as you know we ve been working through if you look at our landfill book of business about a third a little more than a third of the tons going in are from around trucks about a third are from long term municipal contracts and about a third are from independent third parties and everything on our own stocks we push through the intercompany pricing each year and we re pushing it through that 6 to 8 range third parties we ve moved more to shorter term contracts so we can more perfectly reflect the constraints in the market and as we ve been working through some of the longer term municipal contracts you see some larger step ups so some of those larger step up s are also probably shading it above 5 a little bit right now and i think we believe as we look forward to the next couple of years that that 4 to 5 range is sustainable michael hoffman stifel analyst okay that s very helpful and then when do you think the market rate gets to a level where far distant assets become attractive and volume can move away from the market through trains and what have you is there a risk to that that it causes a shifting in this pricing environment because railing gets it was accessible john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary you know i think we still have ways to go mike well i don t think that we re at the level where you know the capital intensity of rail and you know what those numbers look like in terms of the intensity the amount of capital that has to be deployed to move that same thousand ton a day that you can move by truck so i think that we ve got a ways to go before that s going to be effective at some point in time you know it may very well be but i think we re years away from you know it really being effective in terms of moving waste you know from a rail perspective we ve got ways to go edwin d johnson president chief operating officer it also depends on what state you re in so if you re in new jersey or pennsylvania where you can t get overweight permits for tractor trailer trucks it s a little different story so you d see more rail transfer stations set up if you re in new york state and you can get over overweight permit it s pretty effective to move the waste via truck and our sites are well positioned for major population centers and we believe many of the moves are sustainable long term michael hoffman stifel analyst okay great and then all the deal sites so the pipeline is full and you re still active and theoretically you could absorb similar levels like you did a year ago is there any sense that the current election environment is spooking people to get things done in 20 to have certainty on their tax position or are we just seeing the john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think it depends on the level of sophistication and the size of the company michael but for the most part i think that the drivers there are the inflation that all of the independents are feeling from a labor standpoint you know from a disposal perspective as well as from recycling standpoint the value disruption from a recycling standpoint is a big big driver for a lot of the smaller companies as is the labor if they can find the other thing that we ve done is we ve changed our system we ve put training programs in place now we re trying to hire people trying to attract as many people coming out of high school that are not going on to college and give them a career we are doing an awful lot of work there and as we ve said before we beefed up hr to really and we ve been successful we are filling we filled the slots from a driver s standpoint at one point in time we had 40 openings for drivers across the system and so i think there s a tremendous amount of pressure on the independence because of wage inflation recycling inflation and disposal inflation michael hoffman stifel analyst so would you say that your retention has going up or your current drivers is going down whichever way you want to refer to it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah retention is going up i mean one of the things that we did was with kelly robinson come in as our new vp of hr about two years ago now but the first year he spent just doing career development so if you come to work for casella as a real load driver we ll train you is a rear load if you do a good job and your safe we ll train you as a rollout driver we ll train you as a front load driver we ll train you as a swing driver and then you can become a trainer and there you can see how you can go from 18 to 35 an hour in a five year period of time and really have a clear understanding of what your career could be at casella and it s really paying dividends because what we found was the majority of our turnover was in the first year and a lot of are accidents and safety issues are in the first year so we re doing additional training and we re doing a lot of work to really impact the turnover so it s the programs are really beginning to work and take hold and the first thing that we were able to do with those programs was to fill a seat and now it s about retention and bringing people skill sets up and allowing them to progress along that career path so they can do a better job of taking care of their family michael hoffman stifel analyst okay thank you very much i appreciate it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you michael operator your next question comes from the line of tyler brown with raymond james tyler brown raymond james analyst hey guys just a couple of quick follow ups if i could first off there was no c g tax credit benefit in q4 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer there is a very small one so we use about 400 i m sorry about 200 000 gallons per year and so we had about 200 000 of benefit in q4 tyler brown raymond james analyst okay that s helpful i just wanted to make sure there wasn t something there secondly the so ned when you talk about resource solutions being a positive two to three i m assuming that s now including the recycling piece because i would assume that there s some recycling benefits rolling into 20 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah and i kind of quickly made that comment we ve reorganized our internal teams to be more active where our recycling our customer solutions and our organics groups are now under one leader and they have very common business plans and goals so next year when you see our segment recording you ll see the east and the west the solid waste groups the resource solutions group and then other corporate entities and the 2 million to 3 million is mainly driven by recycling with a little bit of growth in organics and customer solutions tyler brown raymond james analyst okay that s what i thought and then just lastly i do want to come back to the seven to eight again on the disposal the positive seven to eight which excludes north country but isn t there a couple of million benefit from ontario presumably not reoccurring again we talked about chemung but it doesn t feel that there is a huge assumption in there from a price perspective i could be wrong but are you kind of thinking about landfill pricing moderating in 20 edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah in our model we had it monitoring we had it around 4 to 4 5 and you re right ontario we had this little easier year over year comp we ran some higher costs operating costs in the first half of the year as we are addressing some gas issues at the site and that s around 2 million of tailwind per say coming into 2020 chemung as we mentioned earlier we got a permit increase several years ago but we hadn t exercised our option to get into that additional annual capacity and we started to ramp it late in 2019 so we ll fully ramp that this next year so that ll be about 2 million to 3 million of benefit and the rest is just at various sites good pricing good operating discipline tyler brown raymond james analyst okay i appreciate it edwin d johnson president chief operating officer good thanks tyler operator we do have a follow up question from the line of michael hoffman with stifel michael hoffman stifel analyst sorry i forgot to ask this interest rate question rates basically the banks are practically giving money away to the garbage industry do you have an opportunity to meaningful lower your rates edwin d johnson president chief operating officer i m not sure if we have an opportunity to meaningful lower rates we did a great job in 2018 we refinanced our senior secured credit facility a term loan b into a new revolver and a term loan a and we put our pricing grid in place so as we get leverage out of business our rates drop and we are currently paying on that libor plus 175 and we can step down in that grade all the way to l plus 125 we ll look at that we re also looking at whether there is an opportunity to do a blend and extend their and improve our position we ve been active with tax exempt bonds and we expected to have some more in 2020 that will help fund growth and we think getting you know very low fixed rate there they are extremely effective so i don t think there is a big step down there michael because we ve done such a nice job taking interest costs down but we ll look at it michael hoffman stifel analyst i mean you are over five at this point and while then get the multi billion revenue companies and again money at 2 5 can t you get this below five edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so our revolver is still lbior plus 175 so i think that like 3 5 we got some fixed swaps that puts it more like 4 25 as part of that money our tax exempt debt everything we re doing today is sub 3 fixed some of that historic stock is more like 4 5 to 5 so as those roll over but they have non call provisions in them so generally we ll look to work it down but there is there is not a big step down unexpected michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then lastly what tax rate am i supposed to be using edwin d johnson president chief operating officer 26 is our effective tax rate in 2020 though we ll essentially jason we ll have very little income state taxes how much do we have in the model jason mead director of finance correct we are anticipating you know close to nothing john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary close to nothing jason mead director of finance yes we got a million dollar tax provision john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary million dollar tax provision in 2020 and then cash taxes should be around the same michael hoffman stifel analyst okay thanks i appreciate it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you michael michael hoffman stifel analyst yes thank you guys operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr john i m sorry we did just have a question to come into queue john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary we are done operator operator i ll turn the call over back over to mr john casella john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you operator and thank you all for attending this morning we look forward to discussing our first quarter 2020 earnings with all of you in early may thanks everyone have a great day operator duration 62 minutes call participants joe fusco vice president of

a recent piece in jacobin revisited the battle of seattle 20 years later it argues that the blockade of the world trade organization round at the homeland of grunge and starbucks was a turning point

emerged as an unlikely force for global transformation from trade patterns through the state of democracy to the resilience of civil liberties the potus was associated with broad strokes of social transformation in a brief spam of time this scenario seems puzzling we should be able to provide tentative answers or at least a potential roadmap by the late 1980s several complex processes seemed to

real estate debacle which pulled the trigger for a global crash notwithstanding those massive retreats for global economy trade in goods and services grew far above the world s gross domestic product between 1995 and 2010 from the wto s birth to the sluggish aftermath of the crisis part of this can be associated with current international framework in spite of its limitations the dismal outcomes of the doha round in 2006 sent early signs of discomfort in multilateral trade as emerging economies and oecd members clashed in a number of issue areas on matters that proved to be pervasive such as agriculture and property rights after the crisis global trade became the staple of a new wave of populist assault on globalism not restricted to inflamed rhetoric protectionist policies were adopted in a number of countries roberto de azevêdo s focus on small packages of reforms may have proved a prudent policy route for a contested institution like the wto but they feel short in face of the

paralysis in late 2019 as the us president trump refused to appoint two representatives to replace retired members of the appellation body after seattle another kind of blockage damages the workings of multilateralism only that this time with a full blown knockout in a world already battered by trade wars between us and china dispute settlement in a toothless wto may be reduced to bilateral maneuvering at the edge of the art of the deal by depriving the wto of a defining feature trump brought the state back in as a force to be reckoned in international political economy something the

promised an end to chinese violence a host of protective trade measures followed suit at the expense of global trade if he delivered the goods up to a point for the 1 what would be left for the rest in a baffling reversal of attitudes trump emerged from his 2016 campaign as a working class hero against an elitist democratic party his victory was dully consolidated in rust belts as the former reality show presenter rode america promising advantageous bilateral trade deals and made in usa brands prevailing at global arenas his appreciation for fake news on social networks seemed to conflict with economic statistics which saw employment rates bouncing back to the days of hillary s husband bill clinton as well as sustained gdp increase so did the us eventually become great again in terms in the decade following 2008 the eurozone gdp grew on average only 0 78 yearly though this lays some credibility on trumpist rhetoric india grew on a 7 12 average that means indian gdp doubled in the space of an otherwise for many lost decade under xi jinping china experienced a slowdown of growth rates at the tail end of its transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial powerhouse across 40 odd years halfway across this decade it lost the primacy in being the fastest growing economy in the world to india still it relied on an average gdp rate of 7 95 additionally the belt and road initiative made chinese diplomacy more prominent than ever since the 1949 revolution what about the agonizing wto even though world trade indicators roughly accompanied the world s gdp growth patterns after the crisis the acrimony between the institution and us was not ushered by trump indeed it was obama who played the contestation card since 2011 unseating south korean judge seung wha chang by willful neglect trump the american president who seated with kim jong un has just finished his predecessor s job who also refused to bow down to the appellation body during his term ironically it may be there are structural features at play the us seems at the losing end of trade disputes it is not only a matter of american slow decadence as the rest of the world did not stand still as communities carefully attempt to foster incentives for uncertain ecologic transitions trump mobilized the haunts of structural unemployment opening the gates for oil and mining industries at reserve areas making america great again often meant taking steps back from international commitments apart from undermining nafta and leaving the paris agreement trump trended allies out of the water take it by brazil s jair bolsonaro during his administration the us also fell at odds with nato allies and the european union on issues ranging from russia to iran s denuclearization this pattern left him with very few friends he could not muster support during venezuela s crisis the aftermath of the syrian civil war or the north korean talks international regimes and institutions highly depend on expectations convergence many of them shattered after 2008 something enhanced after trump the overlapping of issue areas at urgent conjunctures for instance preserving what is left of the earth s

as the rail blockades arising from the coastal gaslink protests drag on there s no doubt that they will have an impact on the economy economists spent this week whittling down their first quarter growth forecasts citing severe snarls in supply shipments have hampered business activity and exports but the economy will bounce back once the blockades are inevitably cleared and this will appear as only a minor blip in the economic record what will linger is the lasting image both within canada and without that we are a country that five years after the collapse of its oil market is wrestling harder than ever with how to transition to an economy more driven by its knowledge than its geography the economy is still struggling to establish a clear path amid the decline of oil and the rise of the climate debate oil and gas will be a source of jobs and activity for many years to come but there s a large hole to fill in investment in the next phase of growth and filling it will be an ongoing challenge of the new decade in the five years since prices for oil and other commodities crashed something that looks increasingly to be a long term decline especially for oil the canadian economy has drifted away from energy investment in part due to weakened returns for investors and in part due to the federal government s climate agenda statistics canada estimates that capital spending in oil and gas extraction last year was less than half of what it was at its peak in 2014 a loss of nearly 40 billion in annual investment that story has largely overshadowed the signs that investment in non resource sectors has begun to fill the void capital spending in the real estate services rental and leasing sector is up nearly 60 per cent since 2012 investment in education infrastructure is up 33 per cent investment in telecommunications technology has more than doubled spending on public transit and rail transportation has also doubled in fact even with the dramatic decline in capital investment in the oil and gas sector since the oil crash of 2014 2015 canada s total capital spending is up 31 per cent in the past decade on the surface then it does look like investment has been quite successfully rotating from oil economy resources to new economy services and the knowledge economy a success story amid the resources tumult but consider those sources of investment growth and what they indicate statscan s gross domestic product gdp data show that the country s capital spending growth in the past several years has not come from business but rather from government particularly ottawa s dramatically increased infrastructure program and to a lesser extent residential real estate non residential business gross fixed capital formation indicative of what the private sector is investing has recovered little after its oil shock slump and remains nearly 20 per cent below its pre oil shock peak there really isn t anything else picking up the slack for the loss of oil and gas investment said bill robson president and ceo of the c d howe institute a toronto based economic think tank mr robson noted that in past cycles slowdowns in the oil and gas sector were typically accompanied by pick ups in manufacturing investment as the benefits of cheaper energy costs made that sector more attractive but that traditional investment rotation has been largely absent this time around it is striking that the adjustment has been as painful and incomplete as it has been there really just hasn t been that kind of shift of resources into other productive uses mr robson said it does speak to the idea that there s something else going on that has prevented us from switching over it hasn t helped that all of this has come during an extended period of weak business investment globally amid tepid growth rising trade protectionism and geopolitical uncertainties in canada the three year drama surrounding the north american trade pact had a serious chilling effect on investment commitments weighing particularly hard on the export intensive manufacturing sector but canada s business investment problem may go deeper than that a weakness that for years was masked by the lure of booming energy prices in a study published by c d howe last august mr robson reported that on a per worker basis canadian business invests nearly 30 per cent less than the average among organization for economic co operation and development oecd countries critics say the boom of the oil and gas sector masked canada s competitive weaknesses in attracting investment in general because the returns for investors were so glaringly apparent in the oil patch with that advantage in the rear view mirror the country is going to need to rethink some things in areas like regulatory red tape corporate tax structure innovation policy to attract new kinds of investors you have to compete to get those investment dollars said economist paul boothe deputy director of the trillium network for advanced manufacturing an ontario based non profit what governments need to turn their minds to is what s the next big thing patterns in foreign direct investing into canada may already provide some direction to that while foreign direct investment fdi in canada s oil and gas industry has been essentially flat since the oil crash total fdi excluding the oil and gas extraction sector grew a healthy 14 per cent from 2015 to 2018 sectors that have seen strong fdi growth include chemicals manufacturing transportation equipment communication technology and key service industries such as scientific and technical services and management consulting that suggests that foreign investors are already seeking out ways to tap into the parts of the economy that have been supplanting natural resources as sources of growth something that predates the oil shock employment in resource sectors has been slowly declining as an overall share of canada s labour markets for decades with the exception of the oil boom resources share of gdp has also generally trended lower as the services sector long ago supplanted goods as the largest part of the canadian economy bank of canada governor stephen poloz pointed out in a recent public address that canada s fastest growing source of both exports and employment today is the information technology it services sector it now makes up about 5 per cent of gdp about the same as oil and gas extraction there is one critical area of the economy in which natural resources remain a dominant component they account for nearly 40 per cent of canada s goods exports on a value basis the need for what it is that we are endowed with is determined by the stage of development of countries around the world we have to remind ourselves that 50 per cent of the world is still growing at a much faster pace than we developed economies are and at that stage of development they need a lot of resources said peter hall chief economist at export development canada a federal export credit agency it s maybe not fashionable to talk about it in that way but that s exactly where we are at while that suggests a continued role for resource extraction and exports even as the country s knowledge based economy continues its emergence economist mel watkins worries that the country will continue to pursue policies focused on resource extraction at the expense of promoting investment elsewhere it s something he has been arguing about since he popularized the phrase staples trap to describe this canadian phenomenon in 1963 a business class a business culture had been implanted that was satisfied with exporting resources as the leading sector of the economy mr watkins said arguing that the boom of the energy sector in the early part of this century re entrenched this economic bias there was an insistence that resource export must be encouraged as the best way to create jobs your time is valuable have the top business headlines newsletter

casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thanks joe and good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and our results for 2019 this was another strong and exciting year as we continue to execute well against the key strategies of our 2021 plan we meaningfully grew the business with nine acquisitions in the year with approximately 53 million of annualized revenues and as we announced yesterday we ve closed on two acquisitions thus far in 2020 with an estimated 6 million of annualized revenues making a strong start to the year in terms of our continued execution against our acquisition strategy our success in 2019 is reflected within our numbers for the year as we grew revenues by over 12 increased adjusted ebitda by over 13 and improved normalized free cash flow by nearly 18 notably our 2019 revenue adjusted ebitda normalized free cash flow results met or exceeded our guidance ranges that were raised in october these accomplishments for our team are perhaps even more impressive given that during fiscal year 2019 we experienced an 8 million adjusted ebitda headwind related to the november 2018 closure of our southbridge landfill so the rest of the business improved by over 26 million in the year which emphasizes the strength within our solid waste recycling organics and our customer solutions businesses coupled with the success of our acquisition strategy in 2020 we will remain focused on executing against our 2021 plan the five key strategies are consistent with that plan as announced in august of 2017 which includes increasing landfill returns driving additional profitability in the collection operations creating incremental value through resource solutions using technology to drive profitable growth and efficiently allocating capital to balance delivering with smart growth our first strategy in our 2021 plan is increasing landfill returns as a vertically integrated resource management company we are highly focused on providing services to our customers that meet their needs and future environmental service needs we continuously strive to help our customers meet their sustainability goals through increased resource recovery and diversion programs we ve developed leading recycling programs and we are one of the most prominent organics companies in the northeast that said landfills also play a critical role within today s suitability infrastructure these necessary highly regulated sites not only provide safe environmentally sound destinations for products and materials at the end of the consumption lifecycle but they also service outlets for various special ways and other time sensitive material such as debris and cleanup from natural disasters we are proud of our long track record of developing and operating safe landfills that meet the needs of our customers while creating tremendous value for our host communities and other community stakeholders while we continue to work to find higher and better uses for all of the materials in the waste stream there s not a silver bullet solution that magically transforms waste into new products or resources landfill remained the safest lowest greenhouse gas footprint and the most reliable means to dispose of waste today in 2019 our teams achieved two important landfill expansions that will allow us to continue to meet the needs of our customers in 2019 we received a 2 7 million cubic yard expansion at our hakes facility which will provide roughly five years of additional capacity as we look to bridge through the next site next phase and in september 2019 we received a 13 7 million cubic yard expansion at our waste usa facility in vermont we started to work though the initial excavation phase and will continue to do so in 2020 this expansion extends the life of the site by an estimated 20 years despite these great successes we ve faced an unexpected setback at our north country landfill located in new hampshire two weeks ago when we learned from the new hampshire department of environmental services that it decided to interpret the state s public benefit statute in the manner that we believe was different than how it had consistently interpreted in the past given this we have withdrawn our airspace expansion permit and we are working diligently to resubmit it to meet the requirements of this new interpretation of the long established statute this will result in us having to ramp down volumes to the site in 2020 as we have incorporated and we have incorporated this impact into our guidance our second strategy in 2021 plan is driving further profitability within our hauling business ed will provide further details on our performance key metrics and various initiatives but we continue to execute well our pricing and operational strategies we again advanced strong pricing 4 8 in the quarter as we are focused on offsetting continued labor disposal and recycling cost inflation operational excellence is an important initiative as we aim to ensure that we have the highest levels of service compliance reduce safety incidence and operating efficiency our teams also continue to work diligently in integrating acquisitions we continue to recognize such follow through as an important element in driving high free cash flow and additional shareholder value the third strategy in our 2021 plan has been creating incremental value through resource solutions we improved recycling adjusted ebitda by 4 6 million year over year in 2019 even with commodity prices down roughly 20 over the same period this exemplifies the strength and success of our risk off taking programs which greatly mitigate our exposure to volatility and declines in the global recycling markets 2019 was an exceptional year for the team as we reset two major recycling processing contracts including the city of boston on july 1 as well as two completed equipment upgrade projects that target reducing operating costs through increased automation as well as and probably most importantly improving the quality of our outbound materials as we look to 2020 and beyond we plan to continue to focus on partnering to build modernized economically sustainable recycling programs we plan to continue to make investments in recycling equipment operating initiatives and customer education programs we also plan to target further refinements to our contamination fee program along with resetting our remaining legacy third party contracts over time underlying all of this we remain focused on generating an appropriate return on our recycling assets the customer solutions and organics team also performed very well during the year with combined adjusted ebitda growth of over 700 000 in 2019 the fourth strategy in the 2021 plan is using technology to drive profitable and efficient growth we continue to make great progress in leveraging our 2018 implementation of netsuite while we have grown the business considerably through acquisitions we are realizing better scale through more streamlined purchasing processes we plan to focus our efforts in 2020 to further digitizing and modernizing our procurement process as we drive better scale and work toward further reducing costs of existing processes we also aim to continuously enhance our customer experience and our proactiveness and responsiveness to their needs the recent upgrades to our crm and early success related to our new case management system are meaningful in our ability to achieve these goals through better integration of our sales and customer care teams moving to our final strategy in our 2021 plan which is allocating capital to balance delevering with smart growth we executed very well against this strategy in 2019 as part of our 2021 plan we outlined a goal to acquire 20 million to 40 million per year of annualized revenue in 2019 we again outpaced this target acquiring 53 million of annualized revenue through our disciplined approach overall we remain pleased with the performance of the acquisitions thus far our focus remains high on operational integration and achieving performer returns as i have mentioned we have completed two acquisitions so far in 2020 with approximately 6 million of annualized revenues this is a strong start to the year as part of our growth strategy and we re excited to welcome these new employees to our team and to provide a high level of service to our new customers in january we acquired an industrial recycling processing facility in albany new york which is a great complement to our september 19 market entry with the acquisition of select solid waste assets from republic services in february we acquired daily and sun which is a great strategic fit to our massachusetts collection operations our near term pipeline remains robust and we are positioned well to continue to opportunistically growth the business and further drive free cash flow we believe that there is over 400 million of acquisition opportunity in the midterm across our market areas and we ll continue to selectively look at opportunities in adjacent markets one area that is not specifically outlined in our 2021 plan but is very important to our continued long term success underlies all of our initiatives is the focus on further building our team over the past year we ve made significant progress and enhancements to our human resource programs our ongoing goals include being the preferred employer within the markets that we operate one of our key programs career path career development we found early success by way of providing greater transparency of advancement opportunities within key roles such as drivers technicians and operators such line of sight bolsters our ability to attract and retain quality employees which would result in lower turnover lower safety incidents while simultaneously improving operational efficiencies and employee morale further strengthening our efforts is the continued investment and dedication to improving and recruiting more rigorous and timely onboarding employee engagement along with training and development as an example we ve developed and trained hubs across our operations that enable us to recruit and train our own cdl drivers and apprentice level technicians ultimately although our programs are early on they are yielding benefits including improved applicants for higher job candidates across key operational roles a positive indicator that our programs are really beginning to work well wrapping up as reflected in our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance we are tracking well against our 2021 plan which displays continued execution of our key strategies with a goal of driving additional shareholder value and with that i ll turn it over to ned ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer thanks john revenues in the fourth quarter were 193 6 million up 18 9 million or 10 8 year over year with 7 4 of the increase driven by acquisition activity solid waste revenues were up 18 4 million year over year with price up 5 volumes down 0 9 and 9 9 growth from acquisitions revenues in the collection line of business were up 15 2 million year over year with price up 4 8 across all lines of business volume is slightly down risk recovery fees up 2 2 and acquisitions up 10 9 million revenues in the disposal line of business were up 2 3 million year over year despite the closure of the southbridge landfill in november of 18 which resulted in a 1 2 million negative year over year variance the landfill pricing environment remains strong and we increased reported landfill pricing by 7 6 year over year and in addition we increased average price per ton at the landfills by 7 8 as we improved our mix of customers and volumes excluding the southbridge landfill closure landfill tons were up 3 1 year over year recycling revenues were down 700 000 year over year with 2 7 million lower commodity pricing and 300 000 lower volumes partially offset by 2 2 million higher third party tipping fees in addition we also have higher intercompany processing fees commodity prices were down 38 year over year this is mainly on lower occ lower mix paper plastics and metals pricing pricing was also down 28 from the first quarter through the fourth quarter of 2019 organics revenues were down 300 000 year over year on lower volumes as we continue to shed sledges that do not meet our lower tolerance for orders and management at our landfill sites and processing sites customer solutions revenues were up 2 2 million year over year due to several new multi site retail customers and strong growth in our industrial services business adjusted ebitda was 41 1 million in the quarter up 7 3 million or up 21 year over year adjusted ebitda margins were 21 2 for the quarter up 185 basis points year over year we saw margin improvement across almost all lines of business during the fourth quarter we anniversaried the margin headwind from the closure of the southbridge landfill and began to recognize each air comps on disposal and labor inflation that we faced over the last few years solid waste adjusted ebitda was 39 3 million in the quarter up 7 4 million year over year mainly driven by strong pricing higher landfill volumes and acquisition activity recycling adjusted ebitda was flat year over year with 2 7 million lower commodity prices mainly offset by higher third party tipping fees and also intercompany tipping fees adjusted ebitda was 0 5 million in the other segment this is down slightly year over year this is mainly driving by lower project work though customer solutions the organic script was up slightly year over year they did a great job during the period optimizing disposal outlets and driving pricing in this tough sludge environment as we work to reduce these volumes into our landfills and other sites cost of operations was up 9 2 million year over year and down a 195 basis points as a percentage of revenues roughly 8 7 million of the increase was driven by acquisition activity and most of the remainder was driven by inflation across direct labor third party disposal and vehicle maintenance general and administrative costs were up 2 9 million year over year and up 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue roughly 1 7 million of the increase was driven by acquisition activity however for fiscal 2019 g a costs were 12 5 of revenues and this down roughly 80 basis points from fiscal 2017 as a direct result of our efforts to drive back office efficiencies through our technology plant combined with the scale we continue to gain as we grow our revenues depreciation and amortization costs were up 2 7 million year over year mainly due to higher depreciation on trucks and equipment related to our fleet and yellow iron plant and acquisition activity the fourth quarter includes several unique items on the income statement we had 600 000 of legal and transaction costs related to our ongoing efforts to cap and close the southbridge landfill and we incurred 450 000 of expense in acquisition activities as of december 31 2019 our consolidated net leverage ratio was 3 07 times this is down from september 30 as we generate significant cash during the quarter and continue to grow ebitda our consolidated funded debt net was 521 3 million with liquidity of 152 1 million in addition we have fixed our interest rate on roughly 68 of our debt during the fourth quarter we completed the remarketing of two of our existing solid waste industrial revenue bonds on october 1 we remarketed our 11 million new hampshire bfa senior unsecured bonds at a 2 950 fixed rate through the 2029 maturity date and then on december 3 we remarketed 25 million of new york efc senior unsecured bonds at 2 78 fixed rate for 10 years both excellent rates for us going forward net cash provided by operating activities was down 4 million year over year for the full year with higher operating results offset mainly by the reduction in short term liabilities this negative change in working capital was mainly driven by 5 3 million negative through the adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 we ve talked about this in the last several quarters this shifted payments on landfill operating lease contracts from an investing activity to an operating activity under statement of cash flows this change only impacted the financial statement positioning of the outflow we also had a 8 5 million negative impact associated with the reduction of accrued liabilities due to cash outflows from the southbridge landfill closure and the remediation project at a former scrap yard owned by one of our subsidiaries in potsdam new york there was also a 9 5 million negative impact due to timing differences in cash outflows and inflows from accounts receivable accounts payable and prepaids and other liabilities overall normalized free cash flow is 55 5 million for fiscal 2019 this is up 8 4 million or 17 4 year over year as stated in our press release yesterday afternoon we announced guidance for fiscal 2020 by estimating results in the following ranges revenues between 800 million and 815 million are up 8 6 at the midpoint adjusted ebitda between 170 million and 174 million or up 9 9 at the midpoint and normalized free cash flow between 60 million and 64 million were up 11 8 million at the midpoint the 2020 guidance includes 4 7 revenue growth from the rollover impact of applications completed in 2019 and those already completed in early 2020 however our 2020 guidance does not include the impact from any acquisitions that has not yet been completed we expect adjusted ebitda growth to be driven by the following factors in 2020 we expect our collection line of business to be up 5 million to 7 million of ebitda driven by robust pricing and partially offset by wage and disposal cost inflation we expect all of our disposal sites excluding north country to be up 7 million to 8 million driven by robust pricing and some very limited volume growth as john discussed we expect our north country landfill to be down 4 5 million as we are slowing tonnages into the site our resource solutions group recycling organics and customer solutions we expect to be 2 million to 3 million as we continue to improve our revenue model off take risk and improve operational efficiencies we expect roughly 6 million to 8 million of rollover benefit from acquisitions completed in 2019 in early 2020 and we expect a slight headwind of 2 million to 4 million mainly from g a growth and a few other factors in the business overall we expect about 30 basis points of ebitda margin expansion during the year working capital and net cash provided by operating activities will be negatively impacted in 2020 as we plan to spend roughly 14 million on the final capping and closure at the southbridge landfill we expect to substantially complete this work during 2020 one other quick note we have changed our segment reporting for 2020 with the recycling organics and customer solutions groups now rolling up into the resource solutions segment so we ll have the eastern region western region resource solutions and corporate entities and with that i ll turn it over ed thank you edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thanks ned and good morning everyone we finished the year strong we continued to be a price leader in our markets our legacy businesses are performing well and we made considerable progress integrating our acquisitions during the quarter consolidated cost of ops as a percentage of revenue improved by almost 200 basis points over q4 last year driven both by price and by improved operating costs at the landfills and better performance at our recycling organics and resource solutions businesses our collection operations which generate about 50 of our revenue grew 18 over the same quarter last year primarily through acquisitions i have mentioned in the past that acquisitions tend to dilute our margins in the first year as it takes time to get pricing where it should be and to increase the level of automation appropriate to the operation given that margin headwind we are really happy with the overall performance in the quarter on a same store basis excluding the acquisitions we grew collection pricing by 4 8 we re slightly negative on volume and improved our overall variable margin contribution per driver hour which is our key productivity metric by 1 5 recycling is a hot subject and i know that many industry participants are struggling in this low commodity price market so i think it s worth repeating some of our comments from before we along with our customers in the northeast believe recycling is an integral part of a long term sustainable economy and it s our obligation to provide our customers with the best possible outcome and keep the recycling model economically and environmentally sustainable we continue to make investments to increase throughput and operating efficiency as well as to produce cleaner products that will demand a higher relative price in the commodity markets but we provide a service we do not take on the commodity risk and we look for an acceptable return on our investment we have spent several years educating the market and transitioning our business model accordingly and although there remain a few minor legacy contracts yet to roll off we have effectively insulated ourselves from commodity risk and our recycling operations are a positive contributor to our financial performance a quick update on our progress with integrating our acquisitions in the rochester market where we acquired four collection operations in a transfer station in late 2018 we have completed the first three phases of our integration process management integration and back office system conversions were completed first initial operational integration followed including route optimization and service changes where appropriate and more recently the careful elevation of pricing to market rates we are now entering phase 4 increasing the level of automation and we see some significant opportunities our team in rochester has worked very hard to get these things done and i thank them for their exceptional effort we re also making progress with our more recent albany western mass southern vermont acquisitions and integrating them with our ford edward and existing southern vermont operations phase 1 is complete and we are well into phase 2 with a good management structure and a solid market area plan in place last quarter i mentioned the enhancements we ve been making to our operational management capabilities adding foundational elements to both run our existing businesses well and to integrate newly acquired businesses smoothly we re making significant progress on further developing our operational processes and systems and are continuing to add resources where needed to excavate the integration of future acquisitions we ve learned over the past year and a half where the pinch points are and as we improve our processes we will be able to realize synergies faster and increase our capacity to take on more in the future we finished the year strong and we re excited about the opportunities in front of us and look forward to your questions with that i d like to turn it back to the operator now to start the q a questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of tyler brown with raymond james tyler brown raymond james analyst good morning guys john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary good morning tyler edwin d johnson president chief operating officer good morning tyler tyler brown raymond james analyst hey so i m little unclear on the north country update so to be clear the decision to pull the permit expansion was based on a governmental interpretation issue it wasn t related to a vote is that right john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary no that s exactly right tyler the agency interpreted the statute differently than they had in the past and we will take that into account and reapply based on the information that we ve given it s a deviation from how they view that statute for my view probably over 20 years so we will reapply with in fairly short order tyler brown raymond james analyst okay so do you plan to resubmit and then in conjunction with i guess governmental approval north country does require a local vote john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary no it does not we have approval for this permit we have approval this is a permit that will give us probably four or five years of capacity we have local approval for that if we go on beyond that we would need the local vote but not for the permit that s in front of that will go back in front of the ec shortly tyler brown raymond james analyst okay okay and so maybe at the 2020 tonnage levels how many years does that side have does it have a handful maybe four or five john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah i would say it s four or five years tyler brown raymond james analyst okay and then obviously it s a pretty big drag but where are those tons going are you going to try to internalize them elsewhere in the fleet john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary some of them certainly will be internalized to other facilities some of them will go to third some of the funds will go to third party facilities but we will internalize as much as we can within our system edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah we service roughly 150 towns and cities in the state of new hampshire and having to move tonnages out of the state of new hampshire is not easy because you can take a state waste into maine you can t take it into vermont massachusetts doesn t have capacities so you ll have to try to move it out to new york which could be as much as a 50 increase tyler brown raymond james analyst wow okay ok that s helpful and then ned so you mentioned that it s a 4 5 million ebitda drag from north country specifically but then you also mentioned that there s a plus seven to eight from everything else but i was wondering if you could parse that seven to eight between maybe hakes chemung and pricing or just any flavor would be helpful ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer it s overall most of its just price and there s some extra tons in new york as you know last year chemung ran a little bit late so we ll ramp some tonnages to get that up to level the rest of the sites are looking to have a pretty good year normal pricing operating efficiencies tyler brown raymond james analyst and there is no fundamental change in the north eastern pricing dynamic i mean it still feels very scarce capacity john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah i mean i think the supply and demand equation really hasn t changed tyler for sure it s exactly right tyler brown raymond james analyst and then maybe ned on the capex side so i appreciate that you got a number of one i m going to call it one tiny capex items this year waste usa build out southbridge capping and you have some other non recurring items but to maybe a little bit more clear will the waste usa in the southbridge spend basically be done in 2020 or does that also linger into 21 or 22 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer so southbridge it s a combination of capping closure the majority of it s they are some short term liabilities that will be worked down about 14 million and we expect the majority of that to be done in the year what we need is a good construction season to get all of the work done that there s quite a few acres so we ll be cap and waste usa the major part of the excavation will be done in 2020 and then we ll construct the south in 2021 and then we ll be into the new expansion area tyler brown raymond james analyst okay and then so if i was to sum up those three call it non recurring items i mean it is 40 million some out the door in cash does that restrict your ability to do m a or do you still feel like you have plenty of financial flexibility for good deals out there john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that way we would characterize it with significant availability from an acquisition standpoint in terms of the existing credit facility tyler brown raymond james analyst okay so not a limiting factor and then maybe my last one this is kind of in the same vein but and maybe that s a question for all three of you but how do you feel from a bandwidth perspective be it it be it human capital financial capital i mean all of the different limiting factors how do you guys feel from a bandwidth perspective for future m a john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that you saw us take a little bit of a pause in the third to fourth quarter tyler in terms of acquisition we did a lot of work in terms of really taking a look at the success that we ve had from an acquisition standpoint we ve added people to hr we ve added people to it a few not a lot of overhead but certainly reflective on the work that we ve done to integrate the businesses that we bought over the last 18 months or so so i think that we re feeling good about where we are we ve got a few more resources that we re going to put in place from a development standpoint but we think that back office customer care payables the work that we did that ned did with the finance team to implement netsuite is really paying dividends to us in terms of the back office and we ve added a few people both from an it as well as from an hr standpoint because we ve added about 600 employees in the last year year and a half or so tyler brown raymond james analyst and maybe ed from an operational bandwith perspective do you feel you have enough integration call it manpower if you will edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah if you remember the last quarter i talked about our expansion of our structure so we now have a regional vp of ops in the east and in the west plus we ve added resources at the home office to support the transitions and we as john mentioned we have one or two additions coming on in the near future tyler brown raymond james analyst okay okay good ned i really appreciate the bridge i feel like maybe you ve been asked that question before thank you john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thanks tyler edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thanks tyler operator your next question comes from the line of hamzah mazari with jefferies john jefferies analyst hi this is john filling in for hamzah john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary hey john john jefferies analyst hey could you just comment on whether you think landfill pricing is at peak right now in your system and how much run away do you think is out there john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that we ll continue to see you know a reflection of the supply and demand equation so i think we re likely to continue to see fairly robust pricing because of the supply and demand equation so i think it s fair to say that it will you know i don t know that we would anticipate it being exactly as strong as it was in 19 on the go forward maybe a little bit more modest but still relatively in the same zip code john jefferies analyst great so i have one more question and then i ll turn it over can you also comment on your margin target of 29 in the solid waste and how quickly you think you can get there also any execution risks we should be thinking about as well edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so that s the one target in the 2021 plan that we re probably tracking a little light against we ended the year in solid waste at sorry i said it without the number at around 26 and as you know we ve had a couple of headwinds there for the last year whether it be wage inflation or the south bridge closure some of the long haul transportation we got back to improving margins in the fourth quarter we had a great overall quarter of improving margins but in solid waste our margins were up over 200 basis points 210 basis points in the fourth quarter and we re looking at a year next year where we believe we d anniversaried a lot of the fundamental changes we made from wage reset transportation third party disposals we ll get back to the cadence of 30 basis points to 50 basis points of margin enhancement in solid waste the north country will weigh on that a little bit in the year so we re probably there s no reason we shouldn t get to that destination but we are tracking a little behind i think we end 2021 closer to 27 ish 27 5 john jefferies analyst got it thank you that s very helpful john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah operator your next question comes from the line of sean eastman with keybanc markets sean eastman keybanc markets analyst gentlemen thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to go back to the north country landfill setback i just want to understand better the timeline of the resubmission process and just based on that is it likely that this becomes a tailwind as we look into 2021 john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i wouldn t anticipate it would be the tailwind through 2021 at this point but we obviously we ve got to go through the process we re in the process of doing that now we ll get the resubmission in as soon as we can but i would not anticipate at this point it being an issue in 2021 sean eastman keybanc markets analyst okay got it and on the volume shedding i just wanted to get some color on whether this was this has been contemplated for some time based on you know the strategic initiatives or whether there s been any shifts of late in terms of competitive dynamics and you know any particular pieces of business john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary we started a process early in 19 of reevaluating our customers on a profitability basis particularly in the roll off line of business but also the rest of the business and simply readdressing customers that over time had eroding margins and so we started pushing price selectively to those customers or talking to them about how to change their operations so that they could you know keep their costs the same but not hurt our margins and in that process there are customers that simply go to a competitor and that s ok as long as we re keeping our price disciplined and we re keeping our profitability in place sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it so no fully sort of expected kind of john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah exactly no surprises not at all sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it and then just in trying to understand you know in the fourth quarter you know again price growth ahead of internal budgeted expectations you know just understanding the dynamic there you know is it that the underlying inflationary environment was also higher than budgeted or john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think that it s fair to say that you know the entire industry is feeling pressure from a wage standpoint which you know in one sense is a positive for you know drivers mechanics but you know the entire industry and the transportation industry is feeling a lot of wage inflation currently seeing inflation from a recycling standpoint inflation from a disposal perspective so there s a lot of inflation you know inherent in the business model at this point in time edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah and if you look at the year we ended up solid waste at 5 1 overall price and we had budgeted around 4 but we also ended up with you know about 75 basis points more inflation and it was on third party transportation third party disposal and direct labor lines sean eastman keybanc markets analyst got it okay that makes sense edwin d johnson president chief operating officer as we talked about in the fourth quarter we started to really comp a lot of that and start to drop more to the bottom line again sean eastman keybanc markets analyst yeah ok that makes sense and then lastly from me you know just given the bolstering of the hr and back office staffing you know the leadership role additions that s a pretty material sort of ebitda drag i guess from a year over year perspective in 2020 so i m just wondering considering those elements and then some of the efficiencies around the crm and the erp have yet to be harvested you know how we re tracking over the next couple years relative to that 12 sg a margin target edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so we ve made quite a bit of headway already as i talked about 80 basis points and it s a combination of lots of different things we re gaining some scale on key roles but we re also gaining efficiency in the back office in 2020 we re focused on a couple of key technology initiatives one is on the procurement side as you know we ve put a new erp in place a year and a half ago and we are focused on digitizing taking paper out automating processes in 2020 and we hope to start to drive even more efficiency there and modernization of our systems we haven t announced the target to the street but this will be a self funding initiative and we ll generate margin benefit over the next two years our other major initiative is really looking at enhancing what we call our order to cash cycle from how customers interact with us to how we dispatch route trucks onboard computing and we re in a pilot phase looking at some new technology there and this could have a really meaningful impact over time to make us easier to do business with and also enhance our ability to service our customers safely and efficiently so it s exciting a little early in that one to lay out a lot of dynamics but from our standpoint we will continue to gain scale as john was talking about there s some interesting growing pains when you grow as much as we have we have grown 35 of our employees in the last two plus years and here is like the funny example our payroll and benefits team a very small reports stuff through my team and we added 35 new employees we hadn t added a single hand in that group so it s almost like a step function we need to add someone there to help support our employees and then you kind of grow into that role so a little bit of that coming into 2020 where we re adding key people to help us to continue to grow effectively sean eastman keybanc markets analyst really helpful thanks for the time everyone john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you edwin d johnson president chief operating officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael hoffman with stifel michael hoffman stifel analyst thank you john and ned how are you doing you re ok ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah i m on crutches but i m michael hoffman stifel analyst and so we understand i think there s congratulations for you john don t you have another grandchild john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i do i do absolutely good question michael hoffman stifel analyst congratulations so to the business of trash if we follow up on the underlying inflation could you actually quantify it as a percentage for some understanding of this because you are getting terrific pricing so what it sounds like is you re doing 5 in landfill solid waste pricing but you re sitting here at 5 5 inflation is that what i heard edwin d johnson president chief operating officer no no no the opposite way yeah well earlier in the year you know there were a few margin headwinds that were a little unfortunate so at ontario and the southbridge comp there are a few things like that that weighed on margins also as they brought in acquired businesses they weighed on margins so you know our direct programs are pricing programs are outpacing inflation if you just look at year to date you know acquisitions alone in our first year are a little bit margin dilutive they weighed on margin 60 basis points ontario weighed on 20 basis points and southbridge 80 basis points so you ve got 160 basis points there and our margins were slightly backwards year over year so all of our other pricing programs are outpacing inflation and markets but we had a few of those you know unfortunate headwinds through the year but i think you know we re setting up nicely for 2020 to outpace inflation michael hoffman stifel analyst okay so to that end i m thinking about cadence the first half of the year gets pretty good margin comparison second half it s a little tougher to net out for up 30 basis points to 50 basis points is what you re trying to get to edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah we were going to guide a little bit stronger than that but with the north country slow down to volume just high margin business that weighs on margins a little bit through the year michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then john just some clear understanding your answer to the north country question are you expecting it to be permitted and therefore online in 21 or we should assume on carrying this headwind factoring it worse just that i still have 5 million of headwind into 20 it stays in 21 and then it comes off john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary you know i think that we re i will hopefully to get through the process and you know have the facility operational by 2021 michael hoffman stifel analyst okay alright so this is 5 million and maybe a little john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary the reason why we you know pushed back on tonnage is because i want to make sure it s obviously there s we re going to get through the process michael but we think that we will get through the process and be able to you know minimize any impact to 2021 michael hoffman stifel analyst perfect okay that helps and then you have done a terrific job in price on the collection side it feels like it s kind of settled into you can sustain middle three s landfill you re in this still exploring sort of you know the market corrections given the disposal reduction where do you think it settles it s obviously 7 8 is not sustainable but where do you think it s settled if we re taking out and trying to model out five or six years will you think about landfill being able to do it forward consistently once you kind of work through all of the market corrections edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah that s what we had in our internal models moving out the next several years as you know we ve been working through if you look at our landfill book of business about a third a little more than a third of the tons going in are from around trucks about a third are from long term municipal contracts and about a third are from independent third parties and everything on our own stocks we push through the intercompany pricing each year and we re pushing it through that 6 to 8 range third parties we ve moved more to shorter term contracts so we can more perfectly reflect the constraints in the market and as we ve been working through some of the longer term municipal contracts you see some larger step ups so some of those larger step up s are also probably shading it above 5 a little bit right now and i think we believe as we look forward to the next couple of years that that 4 to 5 range is sustainable michael hoffman stifel analyst okay that s very helpful and then when do you think the market rate gets to a level where far distant assets become attractive and volume can move away from the market through trains and what have you is there a risk to that that it causes a shifting in this pricing environment because railing gets it was accessible john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary you know i think we still have ways to go mike well i don t think that we re at the level where you know the capital intensity of rail and you know what those numbers look like in terms of the intensity the amount of capital that has to be deployed to move that same thousand ton a day that you can move by truck so i think that we ve got a ways to go before that s going to be effective at some point in time you know it may very well be but i think we re years away from you know it really being effective in terms of moving waste you know from a rail perspective we ve got ways to go edwin d johnson president chief operating officer it also depends on what state you re in so if you re in new jersey or pennsylvania where you can t get overweight permits for tractor trailer trucks it s a little different story so you d see more rail transfer stations set up if you re in new york state and you can get over overweight permit it s pretty effective to move the waste via truck and our sites are well positioned for major population centers and we believe many of the moves are sustainable long term michael hoffman stifel analyst okay great and then all the deal sites so the pipeline is full and you re still active and theoretically you could absorb similar levels like you did a year ago is there any sense that the current election environment is spooking people to get things done in 20 to have certainty on their tax position or are we just seeing the john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary i think it depends on the level of sophistication and the size of the company michael but for the most part i think that the drivers there are the inflation that all of the independents are feeling from a labor standpoint you know from a disposal perspective as well as from recycling standpoint the value disruption from a recycling standpoint is a big big driver for a lot of the smaller companies as is the labor if they can find the other thing that we ve done is we ve changed our system we ve put training programs in place now we re trying to hire people trying to attract as many people coming out of high school that are not going on to college and give them a career we are doing an awful lot of work there and as we ve said before we beefed up hr to really and we ve been successful we are filling we filled the slots from a driver s standpoint at one point in time we had 40 openings for drivers across the system and so i think there s a tremendous amount of pressure on the independence because of wage inflation recycling inflation and disposal inflation michael hoffman stifel analyst so would you say that your retention has going up or your current drivers is going down whichever way you want to refer to it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary yeah retention is going up i mean one of the things that we did was with kelly robinson come in as our new vp of hr about two years ago now but the first year he spent just doing career development so if you come to work for casella as a real load driver we ll train you is a rear load if you do a good job and your safe we ll train you as a rollout driver we ll train you as a front load driver we ll train you as a swing driver and then you can become a trainer and there you can see how you can go from 18 to 35 an hour in a five year period of time and really have a clear understanding of what your career could be at casella and it s really paying dividends because what we found was the majority of our turnover was in the first year and a lot of are accidents and safety issues are in the first year so we re doing additional training and we re doing a lot of work to really impact the turnover so it s the programs are really beginning to work and take hold and the first thing that we were able to do with those programs was to fill a seat and now it s about retention and bringing people skill sets up and allowing them to progress along that career path so they can do a better job of taking care of their family michael hoffman stifel analyst okay thank you very much i appreciate it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you michael operator your next question comes from the line of tyler brown with raymond james tyler brown raymond james analyst hey guys just a couple of quick follow ups if i could first off there was no c g tax credit benefit in q4 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer there is a very small one so we use about 400 i m sorry about 200 000 gallons per year and so we had about 200 000 of benefit in q4 tyler brown raymond james analyst okay that s helpful i just wanted to make sure there wasn t something there secondly the so ned when you talk about resource solutions being a positive two to three i m assuming that s now including the recycling piece because i would assume that there s some recycling benefits rolling into 20 ned r coletta senior vice president chief financial officer treasurer yeah and i kind of quickly made that comment we ve reorganized our internal teams to be more active where our recycling our customer solutions and our organics groups are now under one leader and they have very common business plans and goals so next year when you see our segment recording you ll see the east and the west the solid waste groups the resource solutions group and then other corporate entities and the 2 million to 3 million is mainly driven by recycling with a little bit of growth in organics and customer solutions tyler brown raymond james analyst okay that s what i thought and then just lastly i do want to come back to the seven to eight again on the disposal the positive seven to eight which excludes north country but isn t there a couple of million benefit from ontario presumably not reoccurring again we talked about chemung but it doesn t feel that there is a huge assumption in there from a price perspective i could be wrong but are you kind of thinking about landfill pricing moderating in 20 edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah in our model we had it monitoring we had it around 4 to 4 5 and you re right ontario we had this little easier year over year comp we ran some higher costs operating costs in the first half of the year as we are addressing some gas issues at the site and that s around 2 million of tailwind per say coming into 2020 chemung as we mentioned earlier we got a permit increase several years ago but we hadn t exercised our option to get into that additional annual capacity and we started to ramp it late in 2019 so we ll fully ramp that this next year so that ll be about 2 million to 3 million of benefit and the rest is just at various sites good pricing good operating discipline tyler brown raymond james analyst okay i appreciate it edwin d johnson president chief operating officer good thanks tyler operator we do have a follow up question from the line of michael hoffman with stifel michael hoffman stifel analyst sorry i forgot to ask this interest rate question rates basically the banks are practically giving money away to the garbage industry do you have an opportunity to meaningful lower your rates edwin d johnson president chief operating officer i m not sure if we have an opportunity to meaningful lower rates we did a great job in 2018 we refinanced our senior secured credit facility a term loan b into a new revolver and a term loan a and we put our pricing grid in place so as we get leverage out of business our rates drop and we are currently paying on that libor plus 175 and we can step down in that grade all the way to l plus 125 we ll look at that we re also looking at whether there is an opportunity to do a blend and extend their and improve our position we ve been active with tax exempt bonds and we expected to have some more in 2020 that will help fund growth and we think getting you know very low fixed rate there they are extremely effective so i don t think there is a big step down there michael because we ve done such a nice job taking interest costs down but we ll look at it michael hoffman stifel analyst i mean you are over five at this point and while then get the multi billion revenue companies and again money at 2 5 can t you get this below five edwin d johnson president chief operating officer yeah so our revolver is still lbior plus 175 so i think that like 3 5 we got some fixed swaps that puts it more like 4 25 as part of that money our tax exempt debt everything we re doing today is sub 3 fixed some of that historic stock is more like 4 5 to 5 so as those roll over but they have non call provisions in them so generally we ll look to work it down but there is there is not a big step down unexpected michael hoffman stifel analyst okay and then lastly what tax rate am i supposed to be using edwin d johnson president chief operating officer 26 is our effective tax rate in 2020 though we ll essentially jason we ll have very little income state taxes how much do we have in the model jason mead director of finance correct we are anticipating you know close to nothing john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary close to nothing jason mead director of finance yes we got a million dollar tax provision john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary million dollar tax provision in 2020 and then cash taxes should be around the same michael hoffman stifel analyst okay thanks i appreciate it john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you michael michael hoffman stifel analyst yes thank you guys operator i m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back over to mr john i m sorry we did just have a question to come into queue john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary we are done operator operator i ll turn the call over back over to mr john casella john w casella chairman chief executive officer secretary thank you operator and thank you all for attending this morning we look

a recent piece in jacobin revisited the battle of seattle 20 years later it argues that the blockade of the world trade organization round at the homeland of grunge and starbucks was a turning point for the left after the 1990s shortcomings as global elites got a rude awakening from social movements and civil society a new global grammar of political action seemed available for the downtrodden in a new millennium 10 years after the arab spring 20 years after seattle 30 years after the berlin wall we contemplate neither the end of history nor raptured left internationalisms the global economy still deals with scars from its deepest crisis since 1929 populism rages on with democracy locked down in a downward spiral all around from the ashes of a wto meeting that never was donald trump emerged as an unlikely force for global transformation from trade patterns through the state of democracy to the resilience of civil liberties the potus was associated with broad strokes of social transformation in a brief spam of time this scenario seems puzzling we should be able to provide tentative answers or at least a potential roadmap by the late 1980s several complex processes seemed to lead to improbable yet expected outcomes the berlin wall s fall plus ussr s implosion provided massive pushes for european integration maastricht 1992 and nato enlargement with prominent former members of warsaw pact at the helm of 1991 s visegrad group five decades of gatt culminated with the successful completion of the uruguay round in 1994 and the creation of the world trade organization wto making justice to robert krasner s prototypical definition of international regimes sets of implicit or explicit principles norms rules and decision making processes around which actors expectations converge in a given area of international relations the world trade organization swiftly succeeded the long standing gatt in 1995 with 76 founding members as robert keohane famously stated talks about cooperation after hegemony reserved several prominent roles for international institutions the wto as a multilateral institution was born with teeth an enforcement mechanism for dispute settlement among a broad constituency now with a membership of 164 countries it contemplates chronicles of a death long foretold in the course of 25 years a partially globalized international economy endured a series of global crises the tequila crisis of 1994 opened gates for whirlwinds of turmoil in emerging states mexico argentina thailand indonesia russia brazil all still in the 20th century the dotcom bubble of the early 2000s was the first of its kind in the new millennium however most of us were deeply surprised apart from nouriel roubini by the scope and depth of the us 2008 real estate debacle which pulled the trigger for a global crash notwithstanding those massive retreats for global economy trade in goods and services grew far above the world s gross domestic product between 1995 and 2010 from the wto s birth to the sluggish aftermath of the crisis part of this can be associated with current international framework in spite of its limitations the dismal outcomes of the doha round in 2006 sent early signs of discomfort in multilateral trade as emerging economies and oecd members clashed in a number of issue areas on matters that proved to be pervasive such as agriculture and property rights after the crisis global trade became the staple of a new wave of populist assault on globalism not restricted to inflamed rhetoric protectionist policies were adopted in a number of countries roberto de azevêdo s focus on small packages of reforms may have proved a prudent policy route for a contested institution like the wto but they feel short in face of the breadth of new challenges with disquieting global effects in that respect president trump s inauguration may be considered a tipping point twenty five years after its inception the wto reached paralysis in late 2019 as the us president trump refused to appoint two representatives to replace retired members of the appellation body after seattle another kind of blockage damages the workings of multilateralism only that this time with a full blown knockout in a world already battered by trade wars between us and china dispute settlement in a toothless wto may be reduced to bilateral maneuvering at the edge of the art of the deal by depriving the wto of a defining feature trump brought the state back in as a force to be reckoned in international political economy something the prophecies of 1989 could not contemplate in full his was an approach that countered post cold war forecasts it still has appeal for disenfranchised audiences as jose bove drove a bulldozer to a mcdonalds in defense of french agriculture on the ropes of the integrated markets in a partially globalized economy globalism was vilified as the root of economic shortcomings this was one of the key seattle motifs a widening gulf between global elites and the rest something that returned a decade later in occupy wall st under the guise of 99 versus 1 slogans another defining trend was the late arrival of trade unions at the scene of the seattle clashes the latest losers of globalized capitalism reared their heads for rust belts became pockets of disaffection in developed economies of course demoted industrial areas looking for greatness again looked at the wto suspiciously an anathema as early as 2011 trump emerged as unlikely champion of definitely unlike groups the 1 and the rest for liberals and tycoons his residual charm at the lost art of the deal meant an uncompromising stance for american corporations after the brief spell of obama keynesianism lost its appeal not to be missed was the threat of a rising china one that surprisingly at least in retrospect quickly adopted multilateral trappings and free trade rhetoric across international forums in campaign trump promised an end to chinese violence a host of protective trade measures followed suit at the expense of global trade if he delivered the goods up to a point for the 1 what would be left for the rest in a baffling reversal of attitudes trump emerged from his 2016 campaign as a working class hero against an elitist democratic party his victory was dully consolidated in rust belts as the former reality show presenter rode america promising advantageous bilateral trade deals and made in usa brands prevailing at global arenas his appreciation for fake news on social networks seemed to conflict with economic statistics which saw employment rates bouncing back to the days of hillary s husband bill clinton as well as sustained gdp increase so did the us eventually become great again in terms in the decade following 2008 the eurozone gdp grew on average only 0 78 yearly though this lays some credibility on trumpist rhetoric india grew on a 7 12 average that means indian gdp doubled in the space of an otherwise for many lost decade under xi jinping china experienced a slowdown of growth rates at the tail end of its transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial powerhouse across 40 odd years halfway across this decade it lost the primacy in being the fastest growing economy in the world to india still it relied on an average gdp rate of 7 95 additionally the belt and road initiative made chinese diplomacy more prominent than ever since the 1949 revolution what about the agonizing wto even though world trade indicators roughly accompanied the world s gdp growth patterns after the crisis the acrimony between the institution and us was not ushered by trump indeed it was obama who played the contestation card since 2011 unseating south korean judge seung wha chang by willful neglect trump the american president who seated with kim jong un has just finished his predecessor s job who also refused to bow down to the appellation body during his term ironically it may be there are structural features at play the us seems at the losing end of trade disputes it is not only a matter of american slow decadence as the rest of the world did not stand still as communities carefully attempt to foster incentives for uncertain ecologic transitions trump mobilized the haunts of structural unemployment opening the gates for oil and mining industries at reserve areas making america great again often meant taking steps back from international commitments apart from undermining nafta and leaving the paris agreement trump trended allies out of the water take it by brazil s jair bolsonaro during his administration the us also fell at odds with nato allies and the european union on issues ranging from russia to iran s denuclearization this pattern left him with very few friends he could not muster support during venezuela s crisis the aftermath of the syrian civil war or the north korean talks international regimes and institutions highly depend on expectations convergence many of them shattered after 2008 something enhanced after trump the overlapping of issue areas at urgent conjunctures for instance preserving what is left of the earth s environment versus economic recovery after a brutal crisis allowed few virtuous synergies so far additionally international institutions face recurring contestations regarding capacity to bring trans issue governance to fruition with efficiency and representativeness unintended consequences of integration processes become part of the stock of learning and adaptation thirty years after the wall europe is sponsoring a handful of them across the continent as well as in partnerships with neighboring states in middle east and north africa in a global context trump s hypothetic border wall with mexico hardly constitutes an exception with us trade deficit falling significantly for the first time since 2013 donald trump emerged as the unlikely victor of the battle of seattle by halting the wto in the electoral year of 2020 he may well have found additional sustenance for claiming reelection after surviving an impeachment trial however this does not assure the upper hand on ongoing conflicts for framing globalization of which trumpism contributes just one piece in a million piece puzzle even though similar moves are still on the run making america once again great no longer seems a matter reserved for domestic nostalgia after underestimating trump s political muscle for long multilateralism and its institutions suffer accordingly the inevitable triumph of liberal democracy seems deferred not from abroad but exhausted from within experienced among post cold war frustrations battles for a world more prosperous fair and inclusive can no longer cast a blind eye to such challenges

scotland does not want indyref2 says jackson carlaw boris johnson has continued to reject the possibility of a repeat vote on independence five and a half years after the scottish people voted to remain part of britain by a margin of 55 percent to 45 percent but the snp leader nicola sturgeon has continued her independence calls especially following brexit which she claims happened against the wishes of the scottish people who largely voted to remain part of the european union in 2016 last month a poll from yougov which quizzed 1 039 uk adults in scotland from january 22 27 revealed support for independence led supporting for remaining in the uk by 51 percent to 49 percent the pollster s first independence lead since early 2015 but speaking to express co uk eliot wilson who was clerk of the house of commons scottish affairs committee in the run up to the independence referendum in 2014 has destroyed scottish independence hopes by outlining 10 huge stumbling blocks economic policy the snp s line for years has been that economic policy is decided in westminster remote from the people of scotland and indifferent to their particular needs but leaving the uk re joining the eu and signing up to the single currency a requirement of the application process would surely transfer the levers of economic power yet further away to the commission in brussels and to the european central bank if the circumstances and cycles of scotland don t coincide with those of london they will do so even less with a bloc of 27 other countries equally scotland would be leaving a tariff free single market with the rest of the uk its biggest trading partner currency the scottish government simply hasn t delivered a convincing policy on this if it joined the queue for the eu it would need to pledge to use the single currency but scotland does not yet fulfil the requirements for membership the snp sometimes says it would simply remain in a sterling zone but to do so purely as a customer the way some central american countries use the us dollar would be to place yourself yet further at the mercy of outside economic factors the residual united kingdom would be under no obligation to consider scotland and its needs when deciding interest rates and other levers of economic policy nicola sturgeon s plans for scottish independence has been torn apart nicola sturgeon has continued her demands for a second referendum on scottish independence employment scotland is already much more dependent than england on employment in the public sector which is therefore paid for directly by taxation a contraction in public spending after independence which has to be at least a strong possibility would have a direct effect on the jobs market the deficit the uk is not going to tolerate scotland simply walking away from the shared deficit and other liabilities how these are calculated and divided is anyone s guess but they represent a serious burden for the economy of a small country as scotland with a population of six million would be again the new independent state would have far less control over the economic weather with no central bank no independent currency uncertain international alliances and a structurally outdated economic system dependent on public spending you would be creating a small state with a pre existing heavy debt burden read more nicola sturgeon s

small countries can go it alone austria albania belgium north macedonia but they are generally unable to maintain a full spectrum response military establishment and big ticket items like fast jets

miss nicola sturgeon admits scottish independence panic why sturgeon is really pushing for scottish independence snp is a cult nicola sturgeon savaged as new scottish tory leader boris johnson has continued to reject cals from the snp for a second independence referendum the prime minister will not grant the relevant powers to the scottish parliament for a referendum accession to the eu the commission has been projecting mood music that scotland would be eagerly welcomed back into the fold but accession to the eu requires unanimity of all remaining 27 countries each with different concerns and some facing separatist crises of their own like spain belgium and italy other states are already in the queue and there are some financial tests which scotland would probably not currently pass it may end up as a collision between head and heart in any event scotland rejoining the eu after independence cannot be taken for granted fisheries it is generally felt that the common fisheries policy cfp did not represent a fair deal for scottish fisherman yet this is exactly what scotland would be buying back into if it sought to rejoin the eu after independence tell that to leave voters in peterhead and fraserburgh scottish people are still largely divided over independence trending
democrats myself included enjoy ridiculing republicans who deny the scientific consensus behind climate change but we then deny the inconvenient truth behind our own preferred climate policies they will have regressive impacts on the poor and middle class the energy information agency eia projected in may that president obama s new clean power plan cpp will lead to retail electricity prices 3 7 higher for the nation as a whole in 2020 25 before falling to near baseline levels in 2030 yet speaking in the white house on august 3 the president denied the cpp would cost you more money region by region according to the eia report the cpp will cost some ratepayers quite a bit more money electricity prices in 2030 are expected to be 10 higher in florida the southeast the southern plains and the southwest obscuring this fact the white house says the average american family will save on their energy bills by 2030 democrats should be wary of this denial strategy because higher electricity costs burden the poor far more than the rich the national bureau of economic research an independent research firm has shown that higher energy prices create a burden relative to income that is six times greater for those in the bottom income quintile compared to the top income quintile speaking at the white house obama specifically dodged the issue of higher short run energy costs for the poor and minorities and for some regions higher long run costs as well instead he changed the subject to talk about reduced asthma risks obama does not have to run for office again but democrats who support his cpp like hillary clinton will need to find a better explanation for its regressive impacts on minorities and the poor the issue is already giving republicans an undeserved opportunity to pose as populists marco rubio uses this line to rip the cpp if you re a single mom in tampa florida and your electric bill goes up by 30 a month that s catastrophic renewables to the rescue progressive democrats have been tripped up by this issue once before in the 2009 cap and trade debate in congress warren buffett who was an early supporter of barack obama said cap and trade was pretty regressive obama s press secretary at the time did not deny the assertion and said the president looked forward to working with congress to put a solution together but a solution was never found and cap and trade which republicans rebranded as cap and tax failed in congress the fear that climate policy would lead to higher energy costs contributed to democrats losing control of the house in the 2010 midterm election so obama decided to avoid the issue completely when seeking his own reelection in 2012 are there ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without placing a disproportionate burden on the poor using federal subsidies and tax breaks to speed the deployment of solar panels and wind turbines seemed like the answer several years ago yet despite billions of dollars in wind and solar subsidies since 2009 including us 16 billion in guaranteed loans over four years through the department of energy s 1705 program the share of america s energy consumption satisfied by non hydro renewables increased just slightly from 4 7 up to 6 5 from 2008 to 2012 our installed capacity or potential power from renewables has increased thanks to the subsidies but actual energy production not so much america s net energy generation from solar and wind grew from 1 8 in 2009 to 4 9 in 2014 in 2013 obama s own eia projected the impact of extending tax credits and subsidies for renewables out to the year 2040 and found that doing so would slow the increase in america s energy related co2 emissions only slightly and not result in an actual decline tepid r d progressives not afraid of more radical change have championed an alternative approach called fee and dividend which limits the burning of fossil fuels either with direct taxes or auctioned permits and then delivers some or all of the revenue back to households or individuals in a progressive manner ensuring that the poor get back more than they had to pay presidential candidate bernie sanders progressive to a fault has favored this approach yet the fee and dividend approach fails to gain much political traction because it implies a vast and unpopular expansion of internal revenue service intrusion into the nation s economy and because it requires a controversial new overlay of tariffs and export subsidies at the border to preserve america s competitiveness abroad over the long run the only way to make climate policies both effective and less regressive is to lower the present high cost of non fossil energy forcing out coal to scale up today s wind and solar technologies will be regressive so we should be working harder to speed the discovery of tomorrow s low carbon technologies one way to do this is with larger federal r d investments it is a scandal that the department of energy doe today is spending less than half as much on energy r d as it did in the 1970s before our climate crisis emerged in constant dollars discounted for inflation the doe spent only 3 7 billion on energy r d in 2013 compared to 8 billion in 1979 even more scandalous only 19 of today s doe research spending goes for renewables versus 24 still going for fossil fuels investment in innovation one forward looking non regressive federal climate policy would be the creation of a low carbon energy research trust fund modeled on the interstate highway trust fund this fund could be built and replenished through a carbon fee small enough to have no impact on the poor yet large enough to fund the needed public research as improved low carbon technologies emerge from the research pipeline they could be deployed without the energy cost penalties implied in the cpp this research led approach could also help secure adequate international climate cooperation with today s technologies coal dependent rising powers such as china and india will restrain carbon emissions only at the margin where they can capture direct benefits in the form of less soot in the air or less energy waste they will not sacrifice their own economic growth to solve the collective problem of climate change driven by growing atmospheric co2 accumulations if america s r d investments can deliver alternatives to coal that are cheap enough to operate without any sacrifice of economic growth prospects for international burden sharing with these countries will improve hillary clinton s vision for renewable power energy plan does include a bit as an afterthought a call for more investment in innovation she should enlarge this part of her program by setting specific spending targets for federal r d outlays and by pledging to create a self sustaining federal low carbon research fund we cannot decarbonize our economy and also protect the poor and middle class if we attempt a forced pace scale up of the wind and solar technologies available today progressive democrats should lead in demanding more public money to speed the arrival of tomorrow s improved low carbon alternatives robert paarlberg is adjunct professor of public

out warren s wealth tax proposal for being extreme the hill reported we re being offered a false choice you either go all the way to the extreme or it s business as usual he said yes taxes on individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up we can also be smart about the promises we re making make sure they re promises we can keep without the kind of taxation economists tell us would hurt the economy buttigieg s campaign told the indystar that he plans to raise 2 1 trillion by reforming the capital gains tax on the top 1 of earnings and an additional 2 2 trillion by

credits to help retrain workers who lose their jobs to automation ap reported bernie sanders at the debate on feb 7 sanders said the way you bring people together is to make it clear that we re not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations they re going to start paying their fair share of taxes sanders has outlined a tax plan to help ease income inequality he would increase corporate taxes based on the company s compensation ratio between the ceo and the median worker under this plan corporate taxes on every private and publicly held corporation with annual revenue of

college borrow more money while they re in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out that one law is going to help close the black white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points warren proposes implementing an ultra millionaire tax that would apply to households with a net worth of 50 million or more the new tax would require households to pay an annual 2 tax on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 6 tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion she also proposes an excessive lobbying tax that will apply to corporations and trade

just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served 900 a bottle wine she said during the december 2019 democratic debate think about who comes to that we made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke filled rooms should not pick the next president of the united states billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the united states in response to the criticism buttigieg received from warren and others his campaign announced that it would allow the press to attend all future fundraisers as well as identify the individuals who were raising funds for him despite this sanders doubled down on criticisms of buttigieg s billionaire donors during the feb 19 debate what we are saying pete is maybe it s a time for the working

monticelllo getty images global investors are being overly complacent about downside economic risks aggravated but not limited to the growing impact of coronavirus they are underestimating the forces that are changing the very nature of the world economy a growing degree of deglobalization in the face of u s chinese decoupling at the same time they are overestimating the power of monetary and fiscal stimulus to keep the global economic party going when g 20 finance ministers meet this weekend in riyadh they ll do so at a time when all of the world s ten major economies are slowing and several confront recession next week beijing is likely to announce a delay in the meeting of its national people s congress due to the coronavirus outbreak this week apple raised fears of more global corporate troubles to come with a coronavirus caused revenue warning the full ripple effects of the virus and of the economic impact of humans scared to be with other humans will show up in first quarter results in particular in tourism travel and on all chinese and global companies that depend on chinese supply chains and markets despite all that investor complacency persists in no small part due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how rapidly the world has changed economically and politically we are only in the opening pages of this new era of major power competition and technological change and there s no model to price in its impact within democracies the public s faith has been shaken in capitalism and globalization to produce results that deliver greater prosperity most recently that has driven everything from the recent irish election victory of sinn fein to the uk s departure from the european union to the erosion of the german political center markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst however what if they re wrong most dramatic is the growing possibility that u s presidential elections this year could produce a showdown between two populists of different stripes but similar decibels donald trump and bernie sanders both are septuagenarian insurgents who appeal to hard core unconventional constituencies and that s prompted global concern that the new u s normal may be abnormal all of that is unfolding against a backdrop of a major power test that at its heart is a systemic struggle between democratic and authoritarian capitalist models though traditional security analysts continue to worry about how u s chinese u s russian or u s iranian tensions could unravel into armed conflict the more likely outcome is a resource sapping continual competition that stops short of kinetics but involves information warfare cyber assaults and economic clashes ranging from trade wars to targeted sanctions but let s get back to investors and their complacency which is as easy to explain as it is increasingly hard to justify every time the global economy approached the brink in the decade since the great financial crisis of 2008 2009 some intervening force pulled us back the latest came last year when it looked as though the global economy might slow to below 2 percent gdp growth generally considered a way to measure the onset of a global recession central banks stepped up as the international monetary fund has pointed out 49 central banks cut interest rates 71 times last year the result was a 0 5 percent global gdp boost according to the imf monetary policy saved the day investors understand that coronavirus could be a major 2020 shock but they are wagering again that something will prevent this from becoming an economic disaster they realize the u s fed and other central banks may have fewer monetary tools to deploy so they are counting on increased fiscal stimulus from governments for example chinese lenders on thursday cut their one year loan prime rate which is used across the financial system by 0 1 percent to 4 05 percent the result was a rallying of chinese stocks that day of 2 2 percent of the benchmark csi 300 index that followed the chinese central bank s cut to its medium term lending rate this week as well as dozens of other measures beijing has introduced in recent days to support businesses hit by the epidemic the financial times reports that china s central bank thus far has made 300 billion rmb available to large lenders and local banks in hard hit areas particularly hubei province wishful thinking even so the s p global ratings forecast that china s 2020 growth could fall to 4 4 percent from its 6 percent level last year if the coronavirus hit continues through april most predictions of that sort probably err on the optimistic side and it may be wishful thinking that china s economy will make up most of what is being lost once coronavirus recedes at the same time the eurozone economy barely grew in the fourth quarter of 2019 up only 0 1 percent from the previous quarter the slowest rate since 2013 germany had zero growth real gdp in the eurozone was up just 0 9 percent in 2019 the slowest rate since 2013 with the uk now leaving the eu its leaders failed to agree on their budget on friday due to insoluble differences governments across the world see these storm clouds and a bloomberg survey of economic forecasts shows that budgets are loosening in more than half of the world s 20 biggest economies providing some of the fiscal stimulus that central bankers have been seeking from their government counterparts markets are wagering that the combination of fiscal and monetary measures will again prevent the worst however what if they re wrong other than the united states major central banks are tapped out some of them experimenting with negative interest rates some experts argue that our low interest rate environment allows greater borrowing for fiscal stimulus that s risky business near the end

london cnn business a growing number of companies are warning that the coronavirus will prevent them from meeting sales or profit targets for the first three months of the year some are even getting specific and putting a number on the financial damage yet the situation remains highly uncertain and many of the financial projections assume the coronavirus will be contained in china over the coming weeks and months and that there won t be a major outbreak in another country if the chinese economy doesn t come roaring back as quickly as expected investors could be caught off guard investors have largely taken the view that the impact will be temporary hopefully short lived and that most of the weakness should be reversed with a strong rebound in the quarters that follow peter oppenheimer chief global equity strategist at goldman sachs wrote this week the international air transport association which represents major airlines warned this week that coronavirus could cost global carriers nearly 30 billion in lost revenue global demand would drop by 4 7 the first overall decline since the financial crisis the group s financial estimate is based however on the disruption caused by sars when it ripped through china in 2003 that virus caused real damage over a period of months including for airlines but the sharp decline in activity was followed by an equally quick recovery according to iata we don t yet know exactly how the outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as sars or not the group warned maersk the world s largest container shipping company said thursday that it was having a very weak start to the year with factories in china which make the goods it transports running at around 50 to 60 of capacity ceo søren skou said he expects production to

who spend big on luxury products tourism and cars china s economy accounted for roughly 4 of world gdp in 2003 it now makes up 16 of global output damage done the coronavirus has already caused significant damage china s approach to containing the spread of the virus has kept cities under lockdown and factories shuttered causing widespread disruption to businesses across the globe which rely on china as a manufacturing powerhouse and a market for their goods qantas airways qabsy said this week that the virus could shave up to 100 million off profit from the second half of its fiscal year air france klm estimated the virus could slash its earnings by as much as 216 million between february and april jaguar land rover which has resorted to flying parts out of china to keep production going in europe expects to take a hit from the collapse in demand for cars in the country where passenger car sales plunged by 92 in the first two weeks of february according to an industry association other companies with significant ties to china have also issued financial warnings including apple aapl wynn resorts wynn and qualcomm qcom what comes next much depends on whether the coronavirus continues to spread tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the director general of the world health organization told reporters friday that there s great concern about the potential for the coronavirus to spread beyond china there s still time to contain the virus ghebreyesus cautioned but the window of opportunity is narrowing coronavirus cases in south korea a major producer of the memory chips used in smartphones have jumped from about 28 a week ago to more than 200 singapore has reported 86 cases while iran said friday that the virus has spread to several cities the international monetary fund s managing director kristalina georgieva said in a blog post this week that the organization expects a severe drop in china s first quarter economic growth but only a small reduction for the entire year if the spread of the virus is quickly contained a longer lasting and more severe outbreak will result in a sharper slowdown with more substantial supply chain disruptions and a more persistent drop in investor confidence she warned if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a global pandemic 1 trillion could be wiped off the world economy with recessions in the united states and the eurozone according to economists at oxford economics a pandemic limited to asia would knock some 400 billion off global gdp in 2020 for now demand around the world is holding up quite well while measures to contain the virus in china appear to be working giving companies reason to be optimistic said john stopford head of multi asset income at investec asset management the consensus view is that these kinds of shocks tend to have a short term impact but then most of that is recovered he told cnn business at the same time prolonged shutdowns in china or an increase in cases outside the country could cause longer term disruption stopford said the longer it goes on the incrementally worse the consequences become if chinese production is out for two quarters rather than one the impact on businesses will be much more material the response of the chinese government is another unknown it has already stepped in to cushion the blow to the domestic economy through fiscal stimulus and subsidies and may step up measures to contain the fallout stocks at risk while stock markets are starting to price in the impact of measures to contain the virus they are not accounting for the considerable uncertainty that still surrounds the outbreak said alastair george investment strategist at edison investment research we believe that markets are underplaying the risk of a rise in coronavirus related pneumonia in nations outside china and the impact of resulting control measures he added there is the risk of a correction if measures to contain the virus spread outside china that risk is exacerbated by the fact that equity market valuations in the united states and continental europe are on the expensive side george told cnn business goldman sachs s oppenheimer also cautioned that stock prices may not be reflecting the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings notably a dash for government bonds which remain at their yield lows for the year and precious metals suggest at least some investors are seeking protection from a decline in global growth expectations george said
over half of monetary transactions in venezuela take place using dollars and nearly two thirds use any type of foreign currency according to data obtained by the caracas based research firm ecoanalitica the analysis which studied around 16 000 transactions carried out from february 9th to 14th across ten cities in venezuela found that 55 7 percent of all transactions now took place in dollars while over 64 percent of sales in foreign currency the most popular currency after the dollar is the colombian peso as the neighboring country is experiencing relative economic prosperity compared to the shattered economy of venezuela credit card readers accepting venezuela s bolívar currency are regularly rendered useless by repeated power cuts the most affected cities such as san cristobal and maracaibo reported usage of foreign currency as high as 94 and 92 percent respectively the figures mean that despite the fierce opposition of nicolás maduro s socialist regime to all things american the u s dollar has effectively become the country s unofficial currency as well as the total collapse in value of the bolivar which has lost well over 99 99999 percent of its value in the past decade a major reason for this change is because four million people have fled venezuela s economic and humanitarian crisis over the past five years many of these exiles send foreign currency back to their friends and relatives in venezuela ecoanalitica estimated around 4 billion in annual remittances that figure is highly likely to rise given the thousands of venezuelans who continue to flee the country each day in search of economic refuge currency inflation in venezuela began to soar as early as 2007 under the rule of socialist dictator hugo chávez and in recent years has reached levels similar to germany s weimar republic or robert mugabe s zimbabwe where some people were seen using a wheelbarrow to buy products and the government introduced a 100 trillion dollar banknote the study also found that 81 percent of sales now take place in cash creating problems for local businesses unable to store their money in venezuelan bank accounts i do not believe that the economy will be completely dollarized but it is showing a growing trend that is difficult to reverse asdrubal oliveros director of ecoanalitica said we will continue to have a dual economy in which the dollar has an increasing weight another popular trend in venezuela is the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash litecoin and ethereum increasing numbers of businesses are accepting payments based on various blockchain technologies although these can be problematic due to their rapidly fluctuating value in a bid to interfere in this market often touted by free marketeers as the key towards a stateless libertarian future the socialist regime has introduced its own scam cryptocurrency known as the petro supposedly backed by the country s extensive natural resources and oil reserves maduro has previously claimed that the currency has received over a billion dollars worth of investment although this figure is highly disputed by cryptoanalysts many of whom question whether it has any value whatsoever you can follow ben kew on facebook on twitter at ben_kew or email him at bkew breitbart com

it now makes up 16 of global output damage done the coronavirus has already caused significant damage china s approach to containing the spread of the virus has kept cities under lockdown and factories shuttered causing widespread disruption to businesses across the globe which rely on china as a manufacturing powerhouse and a market for their goods qantas airways said this week that the virus could shave up to 100 million off profit from the second half of its fiscal year air france klm estimated the virus could slash its earnings by as much as 216 million between february and april jaguar land rover which has resorted to flying parts out of china to keep production going in europe expects to take a hit from the collapse in demand for cars in the country where passenger car sales plunged by 92 in the first two weeks of february according to an industry association other companies with significant ties to china have also issued financial warnings including apple wynn resorts and qualcomm what comes next much depends on whether the coronavirus continues to spread tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the director general of the world health organization told reporters friday that there s great concern about the potential for the coronavirus to spread beyond china there s still time to contain the virus ghebreyesus cautioned but the window of opportunity is narrowing coronavirus cases in south korea a major producer of the memory chips used in smartphones have jumped from about 28 a week ago to more than 200 singapore has reported 86 cases while iran said friday that the virus has spread to several cities the international monetary fund s managing director kristalina georgieva said in a blog post this week that the organization expects a severe drop in china s first quarter economic growth but only a small reduction for the entire year if the spread of the virus is quickly contained a longer lasting and more severe outbreak will result in a sharper slowdown with more substantial supply chain disruptions and a more persistent drop in investor confidence she warned if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a global pandemic 1 trillion could be wiped off the world economy with recessions in the united states and the eurozone according to economists at oxford economics a pandemic limited to asia would knock some 400 billion off global gdp in 2020 for now demand around the world is holding up quite well while measures to contain the virus in china appear to be working giving companies reason to be optimistic said john stopford head of multi asset income at investec asset management the consensus view is that these kinds of shocks tend to have a short term impact but then most of that is recovered he told cnn business at the same time prolonged shutdowns in china or an increase in cases outside the country could cause longer term disruption stopford said the longer it goes on the incrementally worse the consequences become if chinese production is out for two quarters rather than one the impact on businesses will be much more material the response of the chinese government is another unknown it has already stepped in to cushion the blow to the domestic economy through fiscal stimulus and subsidies and may step up measures to contain the fallout stocks at risk while stock markets are starting to price in the impact of measures to contain the virus they are not accounting for the considerable uncertainty that still surrounds the outbreak said alastair george investment strategist at edison investment research we believe that markets are underplaying the risk of a rise in coronavirus related pneumonia in nations outside china and the impact of resulting control measures he added there is the risk of a correction if measures to contain the virus spread outside china that risk is exacerbated by the fact that equity market valuations in the united states and continental europe are on the expensive side george told cnn business goldman sachs s oppenheimer also cautioned that stock prices may not be reflecting the potential impact of the coronavirus on earnings notably a dash for government bonds which remain at their yield lows for the year and precious metals suggest at least some investors are seeking protection from a decline in global growth expectations george said
the question that was posed earlier this week at the release of montek s book was why aren t people like them coming back today bag and baggage to set down roots here in india the ones who came more recently were clutching the green cards that gave them an escape hatch through which to return to green pastures arvind panagariya raghuram rajan arvind subramanian and other perfectly honourable gentlemen like them other economists too came back around the same time some earlier and some later manmohan singh bimal jalan vijay kelkar shankar acharya rakesh mohan and so on they returned after studying at the best universities and working in plum jobs at international organisations they and others like them became the leading makers or influencers of economic policy for the next three or four decades rising like montek to high offices and enjoying good reputations plus of course the bungalows of lutyens delhi and social cachets that would not be available to them elsewhere montek singh ahluwalia in his non memoir backstage the story behind india s high growth years recounts how he and wife isher decided to return to india from washington 40 years ago giving up attractive careers at the world bank and international monetary fund imf montek joined government as an economic adviser in the finance ministry and isher joined a think tank they would have had modest salaries and below par government housing but they felt they were contributing to india s development process along the way they became the capital s power couple so life had its compensations one answer is that india has always had economic refugees and they went where they could find jobs in west asia and singapore or a better education that would underwrite good careers many have done brilliantly heading global tech giants and winning nobel prizes but there is a darker side to the story although india is no longer the desperately poor country of the 1980s and 1990s having risen a few years ago to lower middle income status has ceased to be an economic prison like cuba and offers more career options with higher salaries vastly superior cars and consumer goods modern hospitals and new liberal arts colleges and the simple freedom to travel without signing p forms and getting eight dollars to take with you it seems to have become a less attractive country in which to live and work also read sitharaman should first let people know what state of economy is montek singh ahluwalia businessmen including some with recognisable names and faces are becoming overseas citizens they are investing more in other markets where life is simpler wealthy professionals with internationally marketable skills and degrees are also taking their money with them prompting the finance minister in her budget to introduce a tax on such money transfers they may be fleeing tax terrorism prodded by more limited economic opportunities than they had imagined or simply keeping one foot in india and another overseas because public discourse here has acquired a nasty edge and who knows what s coming next or perhaps it is just the air quality in our cities which is a deterrent whatever the reason the economic refugees of old have been replaced by well placed people leaving or staying away from india s unattractive political economy diplomats from under populated countries like australia and canada report a sudden increase in the number of indians seeking to emigrate the other question is should our economists look back with satisfaction or in anger to be sure there were high points like the reforms of 1991 the years of rapid growth a decade ago and transformation in sectors like telecom but we should not have waited till 1991 to launch the reforms as montek writes rajiv gandhi was warned by the imf chief in early 1988 that a crisis was building up but he did nothing the telecom revolution here was not special to india other countries too engineered dramatic improvements in tele density nor were india s years of rapid growth unique emerging markets as a whole grew at 7 9 per cent in 2004 08 forget china today india is being bettered in trade by bangladesh and vietnam and the thai baht is worth rs 2 25 it was half that in 1991 by special arrangement with business standard also read modi hasn t done so badly on the economy but more needs to be done on many fronts
the competition for the democratic presidential nomination has become a focus of political life in the united states for revolutionaries debating how to view this campaign we must answer the following questions what is the class character of the sanders movement what is the potential impact of the sanders movement on the worldwide interests of the working class and the oppressed how can this development lead to a broader revolutionary upsurge in the heart of the u s empire from there we must chart a plan of action character and context of sanders movement the rejuvenation of social democracy and liberal reformism most notably in the rise of the left in the democratic party comes as a response to the decline of the u s empire and the inability of the u s capitalist economy to provide decent well paying jobs to a majority of the working class on one hand the people s republic of china has risen as a clear economic and geopolitical challenge to u s imperialist world domination on the other the u s remains plagued by endless imperialist war mass incarceration low wages enormous debt underemployment sexual and gender based violence and outbursts of racist fascist terror a major financial collapse looms threatening to finally reveal the weaknesses of the real economy and then unleash a deeper ruling class assault on workers quality of life in struggle against neoliberal economic terrorism by u s banks and corporations and their client states our class has taken to the streets across the world tens of millions have fought against austerity and the capitalist ruling class in chile ecuador haiti france colombia and elsewhere hundreds of millions if india is included the desperate attempts of the u s empire to maintain its stranglehold on the world economy have caused anti imperialist reactions in iraq iran venezuela and palestine the unifying issue of this global struggle is the declining prospects for working class youth who live in capitalist societies a multinational youth movement has identified neoliberal capitalism as its primary enemy in some ways the second presidential campaign of vermont senator bernie sanders gets its popular energy from and provides a voice for part of the u s wing of this working class youth movement the viability of any reformist movement like the sanders campaign in the face of a weakening global capitalist system can be debated can social democracy and progressive reformism be revived insecure about maintaining its profits in a capitalist economy that is declining relative to other world powers the u s ruling class has increased its exploitation of the working class taking an ever larger proportion of the wealth the workers produce without the material basis provided by the expansion of u s imperialism and its reaping of superprofits any rebirth of social democracy would find it difficult to deliver meaningful benefits to the workers even should it win an election what is needed instead is a movement that seeks nothing short of the end of capitalism ruling class attacks sanders earlier this month sanders said in many respects we are a socialist society today donald trump before he was president as a private businessperson he received 800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing in new york the difference between my socialism and trump s socialism is i believe the government should help working families not billionaires axios feb 9 as communists we are well aware that sanders holds political positions we can t support his lack of solidarity with international anti imperialist struggles his lack of support for reparations for slavery along with black lives matter his vitriolic attack on pro socialist leaders like hugo chávez and nicolás maduro in venezuela his support for laws criminalizing sex workers and much more sanders program is more like lyndon johnson s war on poverty in the mid 1960s or franklin roosevelt s new deal in the 1930s sanders social democracy is only seen as a radical socialist project because the u s ruling class has imposed such right wing pro capitalist ideology and programs on the population the u s ruling class may own finance capital oil pharmaceutical giants and the health profit industry be landlords or real estate investors own big data agriculture and or other sectors their slightly different specific interests are reflected by the two parties the democrats and the republicans most big capitalists however are overjoyed with trump s transfer of wealth to their pockets others may see trump as a loose cannon and consider joe biden michael bloomberg or another politician as more competent to protect and expand their interests yet they all unite against sanders not just because of the potential impact on their profits but because they fear a greater social movement could develop that will call into question the elites plunder and profit thus we can expect anti communist attacks against sanders to continue to escalate if his campaign continues to gain steam this red baiting must be met with an active campaign to popularize real socialism one that goes beyond sanders deflective statement in the axios quote about how socialism already exists for the rich our movement must unequivocally defend the necessity of socialism and the obvious documented superiority of workers ownership of the means of production paired with planning that prioritizes human needs and the life of the earth over profits internationalism is a necessity not an inconvenience along with the red baiting the attacks on sanders from pro israeli forces similar to the outrageous attacks on former labor party leader jeremy corbyn by the british media will continue this is even though sanders limits his statements on palestine to support for basic human rights sanders himself is jewish yet this will not stop the attacks on him for alleged anti semitism simply because he doesn t give full backing to israel s murderous campaign to annihilate the palestinian people these attacks must be met by a strong anti racist movement in defense of the palestinian people s right to exist from the river to the sea sanders claims to be against u s wars in iraq and beyond yet his voting record doesn t reflect that sanders support for u s imperialism must be fought by those who wish to see his domestic program be successful the domestic and foreign policies of the empire are directly connected both policies are about the balance of power between the oppressed and the oppressor while liberal politicians may fear taking anti war positions socialists must expose the foreign policy of the empire as directed by the needs of capitalism ruthless sanctions and murder must be contested in the name of international solidarity and the survival of the more than 7 5 billion people in the world threatened by the most violent ruling elite ever based in wall street and washington our struggle that of the working class in the u s is primarily against the u s billionaires not against other countries the strategy of revolutionary defeatism to defeat our own ruling class as expressed by v i lenin during world war i should be elementary for revolutionaries and must be learned by a resurgent left that for too long has been infected by bourgeois pro war propaganda we must also learn how to resist the imperialist attacks on china venezuela iran cuba the democratic people s republic of korea and beyond working class internationalism and solidarity with the oppressed are central to our long term goal of socialist revolution allies of the u s working class abroad may view the election of sanders as a victory against the empire a sanders victory could open serious struggles over the need to dismantle the u s empire in order to save the planet to rebuild the global economy and to pay reparations to those dispossessed by the u s to the extent however that sanders gives public support for closed borders sanctions u s air strikes and other measures this would alienate his popular base a base he would have to rely upon to beat back the inevitable attacks from the right this contradiction could give rise to a greater level of struggle elections a barometer or an organizing tool as revolutionaries we know that socialist transformation is necessary for humanity and to sustain life on earth and we know this transformation cannot come about by using the master s tools described in the u s constitution rather we view capitalist elections as a limited survey of the attitudes of the multinational working class and the other classes in u s society every four years about 55 percent of the voting age population with a greater proportion of voters from the less oppressed and older sectors of the working class choose a president from either of the two major parties both of which are owned and operated by the capitalists sanders campaign has attempted to use the democratic party to raise issues in the interests of the working class many democratic socialists of america members view the sanders campaign and electoral politics more generally as the primary channel to engage and radicalize the working class this is unlike the period from the 1930s to the 1970s when the left looked toward the labor movement or other social movements as the centers of politicization and class identity development the argument of dsa and other left groups that have worked alongside the sanders campaign is that the campaign a shortcut to building mass consciousness many young activists have hit the streets in the name of the sanders campaign to promote classwide solidarity against the billionaire ruling class and to try to win supporters to their socialist organization ruling class ideology insists that the primary arena of politics is bourgeois elections particularly national elections for president thus when the left plans a political strategy the question of whether to run in elections is a question of what is the most effective type of mass organizing that can build revolutionary socialist consciousness the sanders campaign has prioritized the central tenet of the occupy movement from the last decade the struggle of the 99 versus the 1 sanders has put forth stronger positions on racial justice migrant rights and many other policies that reflect the hard work of organizers in people s movements sanders 2016 primary campaign took on the right wing establishment democratic party and had a major impact in winning thousands of new people to socialist organizations the dsa and others have joined this year s campaign with the goal of recruiting new members and pushing the campaign to the left riding the wave and seeing where they will end up what happens when or if the dnc steals the nomination from sanders will organizations to the left of the democratic party still insist on voting blue no matter who will there be a political fracture in which the sanders movement even despite the refusal of sanders himself decides to make a dirty break from the democratic party and form a new socialist electoral third party what if sanders were to get the nomination and then win the election against trump who will defend him from the wrath of the capitalists and a stock market that could be in free fall will a mass movement emerge and move in a more radical direction emboldened by the results will the mirage of capitalist democracy be revealed as a fraud will that demoralize the masses or radicalize them while the fate of the sanders movement is yet to unfold the most pressing question for revolutionary socialists may be what is the most effective way to agitate educate and organize this sanders movement into an anti imperialist anti capitalist revolutionary movement which road to socialism workers world party believes that the goal of revolutionary parties when entering capitalist electoral politics should be to advance a revolutionary program in order to shatter illusions of capitalist democracy and win broad working class support the democratic party in the past has been the graveyard of social movements still bourgeois political campaigns can reflect and show the significance of people s movements the question of critical support for or independence from the sanders movement is one we plan to answer through action we will attend sanders campaign rallies in order to meet this movement and push for revolutionary socialism we will be in the streets with this movement raising demands that speak to young people looking for revolutionary change we look at this development with revolutionary optimism and we will study it closely wwp is still considering how to intervene in the 2020 presidential campaign we will definitely run a major ideological campaign entitled which road to socialism with this effort we will put forth our revolutionary socialist perspective in a wide variety of ways we will organize regular discussion groups in our branches across the country to engage these questions all the while reaching out to the sanders movement and those to its left to discuss the contradictions of social democracy and attempt to win people to fight for revolutionary socialism we will challenge the weaknesses of sanders movement and push it in a revolutionary direction not by being sectarian or opportunist but by waging an honest ideological and mass struggle that speaks to the needs of the working class and the oppressed to go further even moderate social reforms can take place only under the pressure of mass movements in the streets and in our workplaces real revolutionary socialism including the seizure and liberation of private property in the means of production cannot occur by amending the u s constitution it must be the result of a worldwide mass movement that uses various tactics and strategies to defeat capitalist rule with this in mind we will launch a series of mobilizations to fight the racist anti worker policies of the trump administration that the democratic party has enabled these policies for example the u s sanctions that have terrorized hundreds of millions of people on the planet will expose the imperialist character of both parties currently we are working with hundreds of organizations to launch an international campaign against u s sanctions entitled sanctions kill campaigns like this allow us to connect with those directly impacted by u s sanctions passed by democrats and republicans we will mobilize on may day to unite the movements against capitalism imperialism racism and all the crimes of this system with a show of solidarity on this socialist inspired international day of struggle we will continue to mobilize against u s imperialism in all its manifestations as part of our devotion to our worldwide class we will continue to organize for the most oppressed of our class for incarcerated workers for political prisoners for low wage workers for people with disabilities for the homeless for those oppressed because of gender or gender expression or national origin and for migrants and refugees all with the goal of building a broadly popular communist party steeled in combat and the day to day struggles of our class finally we will use this election to push for real democracy while this election may be seen as a referendum on trump s social and economic policies we will push to make this election a referendum on the crimes of capitalism imagine a people s referendum in which we vote with our feet by withholding our labor and by fighting for a real future a socialist society

normalized earnings of 2 26 per share grew by 7 over 2018 s comparable number this was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5 earnings per share growth we continue to make great progress as we execute our customer focused strategy i ll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements and robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes first as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet we re proud to report we met our 2020 sox nox and mercury emission reduction goals one year early in addition we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40 and as of the end of 2019 we ve achieved a 35 reduction in co2 from 2005 levels our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves we look forward to highlighting our strong esg performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year we are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities one example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200 megawatt whispering willow north wind project we now have nearly 70 of our planned 1 000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our iowa customers producing clean efficient renewable energy we are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year an important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the west riverside energy center this highly efficient natural gas facility located in southern wisconsin is over 98 complete and expected to be in service producing low cost energy for our wisconsin customers in the coming weeks the expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly 80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments solid operational performance and lower commodity prices another example of our strategy in action an efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy in 2019 we completed our ami meter installations in iowa providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices we also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy an example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call my account once fully launched customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage this refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice convenience and control over their energy use i ll highlight one last area before i turn it over to robert last fall we announced the results of a year long voluntary resource planning process we call the wisconsin clean energy blueprint this plan balances many important goals including reliability affordability building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees the blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1 000 megawatts of solar in the coming months we ll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our wisconsin facilities i m excited about our accomplishments in 2019 our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020 i ll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy customer focused investments completed on time and on budget delivering solid returns for our investors balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values thank you for your interest in alliant energy i will now turn the call over to robert robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john good morning everyone i m pleased to report that 2019 gaap earnings were 2 33 per share compared to 2 19 per share in 2018 excluding non gaap adjustments and temperature impacts earnings were up 7 year over year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses we provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides the non gaap adjustment in 2019 is related to an atc equity earnings adjustments as a result of the november ferc decision regarding miso transmission owners return on equity complaints the 0 02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 1 in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers a few of our largest customers in iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019 and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production resulting in a lower industrial demand since industrial sales generate our lowest margins these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results turning to this year s earnings guidance we are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of 2 34 per share to 2 48 per share based on our current forecast we are trending to the upper half of the range we are also reaffirming our long term annual earnings growth guidance of 5 to 7 we have rebased our long term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non gaap temperature normalized eps of 2 26 per share our long term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return the key drivers of the 7 growth in 2020 eps are related to investments in our core utility business including wpl s west riverside generating facility and ipl s wind expansion program these investments were reflected in wpl s approved electric rates for 2020 and ipl s retail electric rate review order received last month a walk from our 2019 non gaap temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on slide 7 the 2020 guidance range assumes a 1 growth in retail electric sales which includes the impact of leap year we are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020 our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers in wisconsin we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments these investments include the highly efficient west riverside energy center which will be in service in the coming months in iowa we are forecasting average residential electric bills for iowa customers who will also remain relatively flat in 2020 as the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by 35 million of billing credits we will provide to iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019 also more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020 as we look to the future we have also added new low cost wind ppas and we ll be ending the duane arnold ppa later this year which will begin saving our iowa electric customers money in 2021 slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities in our consolidated group we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11 for 2020 the primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers the production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins thus the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral our 2020 financing plan summarized on slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last november including issuing up to 250 million of new common equity 225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in november 2019 we expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities we expect the remaining 25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our shareowner direct program lastly we have included our key regulatory initiatives on slide 10 we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation in december and january we received decisions regarding the first forward looking test year rate filings in the state of iowa in the electric rate review decision the iub approved a new renewable energy rider which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1 000 megawatts of new wind after they re placed in service with the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in iowa for at least the next few years in wisconsin we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20 in western wisconsin this request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve we expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020 in the second quarter wpl also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022 key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the kossuth wind farm we expect to place into service later this year we will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments lastly in wisconsin we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1 000 megawatts of new solar generation we announced last fall we continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost effective clean energy for our customers in wisconsin we very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences as always we will make our investor relations materials used at the conferences available on our website at this time i ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session questions answers operator thank you mr durian we ll take our first question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning to you can you hear me susan gille investor relations manager we can john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer we sure can good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst top of the morning to you guys thank you very much so i wanted to follow up in the same vein of many of your comments earlier and just ask you to elaborate a little bit first with respect to iowa and solar i m thinking more specifically on the legislative side there s been some development and i know there was a carryover bill i know there was perhaps a deal in the last day here at least in the local news teams can you talk about what any of it in iowa from a light city perspective may mean ultimately to you specifically knowing that not all of it is necessarily focused on alliant utility scale solar in terms of what was contemplated there and then separately i ll throw my second question out there at the same time coming back to wisconsin you alluded in your remarks to some development coming up ahead in the next months i wasn t quite sure if that pertained directly to the solar filing you re making or with respect to the voluntary filing you made earlier is there something else in parallel we should be anticipating here so again i just want more of a clarification from the earlier prepared remarks john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer i ll touch on the first couple and i might turn it over to robert as well as it relates to iowa and the build relating to solar it s very early in the process so as you can imagine this can change a bit we are evaluating that and certainly talking with stakeholders in midamerican so i would hesitate to go beyond identifying the direct impacts on that right now it s something we re keeping a close eye on and in wisconsin we do have our rate filing that we ll have in the second quarter and then we re putting together the application for our first tranche of the solar investment those would be two that we talked about and i ll ask robert here to add anything else to that robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so as a reminder last november we announced plans to build up to 1 000 megawatts of new solar by 2023 think of this filing that we re going to make here in the next couple of months as the first tranche and that will maybe think of roughly half of that will come out with a filing in early april time frame with many more details regarding the nature of the transactions and the sites and all the details that have to go along with that types of filings julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent thank you and then perhaps just if i can ask you to follow up on the solar filing coming up here in 2q or is there anything different that we should expect in this filing versus that of your peers in the state who also pursued a similar early let s call it a pilot effort on the forefront as well just trying to think about potentially a different set of issues or is it pretty comparable in your mind robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer i d say the one area where it may be different from what you ve seen in the state historically is we are contemplating doing some type of tax equity structure that is different from what some of the previous filings in the state event we re still in the early stages of kind of determining exactly what that s going to look like but expect when you see the filing come out in that early april time frame there will be some type of partnership with the third party to help us really try and monetize those tax benefits booked for our customers and we see this as a great opportunity to lower the cost for our customers with these new solar projects julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent thank you guys operator our next question comes from andrew weisel with scotiabank andrew weisel scotiabank analyst hey good morning everybody first question on the emissions front you made very impressive progress to date and i m glad to see you emphasizing that a bit more in the slide deck thanks for that too john i think you mentioned you ll update the corporate sustainability goal later this year do you have any sense of what that means for a longer term carbon reduction goal you got your 2030 target what might it take to get even bigger reduction say for carbon dioxide by 2040 or 50 would it be coal plant retirements more renewables energy efficiency i imagine it s all of that but where do you see the biggest opportunities john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer yes we are excited by being able to continue to update our sustainability report in a number of environmental improvements that we ve made we do have a current 80 reduction goal that we have in there in addition to our 2030 goal so what we d be looking at is as we update our resource planning efforts and we take a look at some of our continued fleet transition we ll review that and make further adjustments in our sustainability report in addition to that some of the areas for example water reduction with our west riverside plant our addition of wind and solar and some of the retirements we ve already had we ve made significant progress in reducing the amount of water usage then obviously we ve done some work with habitat meaning pollinator plant things in conjunction with solar installation so very excited about the story and i appreciate you asking about that andrew weisel scotiabank analyst ok great thank you for that next question in wisconsin you ll be filing the rate case in the coming months for wpl you ve been holding rates flat you mentioned some offsets but how do you think about the potential to either keep rates flat for two more years or have a minimal increase and then possibly related how do you think about the potential for yet another settlement and similarly are there any atypical issues that might come up in the filing robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew this is robert yes i think when we look forward to the 2021 2022 forward looking test periods we do believe that there will be a modest increase to our customers but given the ability for us to use excess deferred taxes and various other regulatory liabilities that we ve accumulated over the past few years and we ll see a pretty significant mitigation of any increase so i would think of those in the kind of single digits maybe low single digit percentage increases on an annual basis so nothing very significant and so we ll continue our strong track record of maintaining pretty low or relatively low rates for our customers in wisconsin and as far as settlement process we do have a long history of constructive settlements and outcomes we would continue to look forward to working with the stakeholders to try and reach a settlement with that after we make the initial filings sometime in that second or third quarter of this year andrew weisel scotiabank analyst sounds good then just to clarify i think in iowa you said you re planning to stay out for at least the next two years just to really be explicit does that mean that you d file in 21 for rates in 22 or file in 22 for rates in 23 robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer just as a reminder with the renewable energy rider that was approved with the last rate case we have a mechanism now to be able to get all of the rate base additions from the new wind generation that we re putting into service in 2020 in that rider which will become effective or get renewed i guess on january 1 2021 so with that mechanism we actually think that we can stay out of rate cases for probably over a couple of years out so at least probably into that 23 time frame if not beyond depending on how well we can control costs andrew weisel scotiabank analyst fantastic thank you very much operator we ll take our next question from michael sullivan with wolfe research michael sullivan wolfe research analyst good morning i just wanted to clarify and make sure i heard right i think you guys had said you were trending within the upper half of the range for 2020 guidance already was that right and what s driving that if so robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good question michael you are correct that we are trending to the upper half of the range we really have had some beneficial developments here probably in the last couple of months we saw favorable pension costs and we had a pretty strong year when it comes to the returns of our pension assets which translates into lower pension costs in 2020 we also are starting off the year very well when it comes to a fuel cost perspective as a reminder in wisconsin we ve got a fuel sharing mechanism where both the shareowners and the customers benefit from lower fuel costs and given how low natural gas prices are and how well our natural gas facilities are running we re able to generate some savings both for our shareowners as well as our customers and then we re also benefiting from lower interest expense given interest rate environments that are currently there so those are the primary drivers that we started out the year very well with michael sullivan wolfe research analyst ok great and then my other one was just i think you may have alluded to this a little bit but just wanted to clarify as far as the future of your coal fleet i think in iowa you re saying sort of by the end of this year you ll come up with a new plan but in wisconsin is that going to happen in conjunction with the solar filing where you laid that out or what s the avenue where that gets disclosed or discussed john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer yes michael this is john when we file as robert had noted in the second quarter as what we re expecting for the solar we will be informing a bit more about our plans for our wisconsin coal facilities at that time and you re right we are going through that process in iowa which would be think of that more toward the end of the year michael sullivan wolfe research analyst right thanks guys operator we ll take our next question from ashar khan with verition ashar khan verition fund management llc analyst my questions were answered by wolfe so

social harmony is critical to economic growth montek singh ahluwalia a conversation on the deepening crisis in the economy what s to be done and where the perils lie sankarshan thakur there is an interesting reference in your book to a meeting with the punjab delegation when you quoted machiavelli s comment that a disease is difficult to diagnose at an early stage but easy to cure and at a later stage it becomes easy to diagnose but difficult to cure as an economy where are we on that scale i am not sure the machiavelli quote is relevant for the present economic situation but let me offer my assessment we are in the middle of a very serious slowdown gdp growth for the last quarter for which we have data fell to 4 5 per cent some people say the economy has bottomed out but this only means that growth in the next year will not be lower than 4 5 per cent independent observers project that gdp growth in 2019 20 will be below 5 per cent and for 2020 21 it will at best go up to 5 5 per cent or so advertisement this may look like a green shoot of recovery but it is very far from the targets we have set my con cern is not just about gdp growth unemployment is a huge problem especially for the young it is a recipe for social unrest we cannot expect to generate the jobs we need if the economy does not grow more rapidly what should we be aiming at the government has established a target of getting to a five trillion dollar economy by 2024 25 it is a good aspirational target but it can only be achieved if the economy grows at an average rate of about 9 per cent per year from 2019 20 onwards we did grow at 8 4 per cent for the first seven years of the upa but if growth in 2019 20 is below 5 per cent and it moves up to only 5 5 per cent in 2020 21 the economy would have to grow much faster than 9 per cent in the next four years this is simply not feasible i wish the finance minister had admitted that we are off target she did not if the government thinks they are firmly on track for the five trillion dollar economy then of course they would be right to go on with business as usual but we are definitely not on track and that is why we need to take corrective steps what can we hope for and how do we get it we need to get the economy back to 8 per cent growth as quickly as possible this may take another three years and we must work hard to bring in structural reforms that are needed at this time what are the reforms you would recommend let me mention a few first we need to come clean on the size of the fiscal deficit the cag had pointed out that the accounting systems we are following end up understating the centre s fiscal deficit by as much as 2 percentage points of the gdp almost all financial commentators are aware of this and they would appreciate greater candour there is no point in pretending that the fiscal deficit is on the track envisaged by the fiscal responsibility and budget management act it is actually much higher a high deficit may not be a problem right now because there is a lack of demand and capacity is underutilised but continuing such a high deficit is a major drag on the economy in the medium term it leaves very little resources to support private investment we need a medium term plan to correct the fiscal deficit after measuring it correctly second we need to examine why private investment has been falling part of it is just a cyclical phenomenon of excess capacity but there are deeper problems holding back what are called animal spirits rahul bajaj in a public forum raised the issue of what he called the fear factor he did not elaborate but part of the problem is that businessmen believe that the tax authorities and other regulatory agencies can easily get into a harassment mode this dissuades businessmen from raising their problems frankly and in that environment the problems are unlikely to be solved the fear of tax terrorism needs to be ended third we need to fix the banking system there is no chance of getting 8 per cent growth if bank credit does not expand at a commensurate pace the banking sector is still reeling under its npa burden we have known about this problem since 2014 but six years later we are still looking around for a solution meanwhile bank credit growth in the public sector banks is very low there is talk of banking sector reforms but very little action i think fixing the banks must have top priority and we should look at innovative solutions if we are not willing to take the government equity in public sector banks below 51 per cent we should at least implement the p j nayak committee recommendations i have discussed this at length in my book finally i am deeply worried about exports indian export performance has been very poor with exports in dollar terms more or less stagnant over the past several years and you can t really blame the global economy because vietnam and bangladesh are doing very well we need to ask what we can do to make exports perform better in this context i must say that the decision of the government to raise import duties is exactly the wrong thing to do it hurts exports if you look at the economic survey it says that we should get into global value chains the way to do that is to either get into various free trade agreements or to lower import duties we seem to be going in the opposite direction the protectionist turn in policy reverses a 30 year trend of gradually reducing import duties this was initiated in the 1991 reforms and was continued by the united front government it was also continued by the vajpayee government yashwant sinha had said that our import duties should be brought down to the levels in asean countries the upa of course continued the process i thought the present government would maintain the same course because arvind panagariya who was the first vice chairman of the niti ayog published a three year policy agenda which envisaged lowering of duties and bringing duties to a common level of 7 per cent that would have been a welcome move but what we are seeing now is a marked reversal does the government talk to you on these matters what s wrong what should be done etcetera isn t it natural if there is a crisis that the government would talk to this person who has been involved with economic decision making for the last two decades let s see what he has to say isn t that normal there are a lot of people that the government could turn to but on these issues they could just look at what their own experts are saying i mentioned arvind panagariya s recommendation on import duties he is a distinguished trade economist and has brought out a report recommending a very sensible approach to lowering duties so the right advice is there with the government what s your sense of how decisions are being made now how policy is being formed how crises are being dealt with is there a governing eye a process or not i have no direct knowledge of the internal decision making process today but i can tell you something that i have also reported in my book when the big economic crisis of 2008 struck prime minister manmohan singh did two things rather than leave matters just to the finance ministry he set up an apex group which included several ministries it included the governor of the reserve bank it included me as deputy chairman of the planning commission to take a collegial view of the crisis more importantly he asked me to get in touch with raghuram rajan who had just left as chief economist of the imf to return to chicago and seek a note from him on what the government should do it is necessary sometimes to get advice even from outside rather than just say we know when you leave things just to ministries the tendency for them is to say we know recognition of a problem wide discussion of a problem rethinking of policy these are necessary we are dealing with many things today that are very complex and to think that the ministries themselves will take care of the problem is just not credible you need expert input and you need to involve the private sector the other thing about a good stable economy is a stable society isn t it i mean you can t have a stable economy on the shaky wheels of social strife i completely agree the social side cannot be viewed as different from the economy side not only is social harmony desirable in itself it is also necessary for investment to flourish and generate growth in an autocratic system dissent is more easily suppressed but in a democratic environment it cannot be suppressed and this means it is important for the political leadership to work hard to create harmony that partly describes the difference between china and india does it not right in china they are quite proud of not having democratic norms because they believe they merely lead to dissent and chaos and investors are also quite happy because they say look it is your country your society as long as you are keeping it calm we don t care that cannot be the case in india so governments have to look at keeping social harmony if there is a problem you must talk to the people and resolve it ignoring that is only risking more instability how do you see the caa npr nrc domino playing out here there are obviously apprehensions on what impact these initiatives will have on the muslim minority and these apprehensions must be addressed i personally do not think there is much to be gained from a national register of citizens the costs and benefits of doing that need to be carefully evaluated the real problem is that in a country like ours 30 per cent of the population will not be able to provide the kind of documentation needed and therefore runs the risk of being excluded only 30 per cent could be even more but remember that 30 per cent of the indian population is almost 400 million people even if the government is well intentioned at the lower levels such an exercise can become the source of immense harassment the apprehensions are not unreasonable and several states have also expressed reservations it is clearly an issue that needs to be carefully considered and calm restored restoration of social harmony is essential if we want to create an environment in which investors will want to invest
since debt repudiation in 2002 country has flourished imf foreign oil interests ousted by gonzalo baeza in a telling rebuke of the international bankers argentina has once again affirmed its economic independence by repudiating its debt and taking control of its domestic oil production for the benefit of its own people drawing the ire of the united states the european union and the world bank the argentine government nationalized its oil company yacimientos petrolíferos fiscales ypf in early may freeing the country s economy from the international oil cartels the decision is the latest run in between the populist government of argentina and globalist forces which seek to make it conform to a model of de industrialization and high indebtedness argentina became one of the bogeymen of the international financial media when in 2002 its government decided to default on its 95 billion foreign debt with the international monetary fund imf and other usurious creditors until then argentina had been hailed as the imf s model pupil in latin america dollarizing its economy selling strategic industries such as ypf to foreign multinationals and deregulating its financial industry the effects of these policies climaxed shortly before the country defaulted as dollarization made argentina s exports more expensive and less competitive created massive deficits and fostered a chronic dependency on foreign capital after argentina put an end to dollarization and other imf mandated structural reforms in 2002 financial analysts predicted ruin for the country s credit and the collapse of its economy nonetheless it took argentina only three years to pay its 10 billion debt to the imf in full while continuing to pay its other creditors as former argentine president nestor kirchner said in 2005 there is life after the imf and it s a very good life in spite of being effectively shunned from the international credit markets the argentine economy has grown 90 over the last decade one of the fastest gdp growths in the western hemisphere for this period in addition unemployment fell from 22 in 2002 to less than 6 7 in the q4 of 2011 if defying the imf s diktats and proving expert financial analysts wrong weren t enough the argentine government nationalized a 51 stake in ypf taking ownership away from spanish multinational firm repsol what prompted the decision on the part of argentine president cristina fernandez kirchner s widow and the heir apparent of his populist legacy to take over oil production was repsol s inability to produce enough oil to meet the needs of an expanding argentine economy over the last decade of populist rule oil rich argentina has subsidized its oil production selling the commodity at a lower price to consumers and local industries in order to spur the local economy this policy has been systematically questioned by both foreign oil cartels and repsol even as ypf made healthy profits and distributed hefty dividends among stockholders its officers claimed that the country s regulation prevented them from investing more in domestic oil exploration from 2004 to 2011 argentina s oil production fell by nearly 20 and gas by 13 ypf which accounts for one third of the country s oil production was at the center of this decline oil imports doubled in 2011 to 9 4 billion and for the first time in 17 years argentina became a net importer of oil and gas it s very clear that repsol was not fulfilling its obligations to argentina sociologist and veteran analyst of latin american affairs james petras told american free press the government s reaction to this was to try to get repsol to increase production repsol very arrogantly said you end price controls and we ll produce for the local market they actually were using low levels of production to force a change in government policy so far the internationalists have been less than amused with the move world bank president robert zoellick attacked it as giving in to populism and protectionism when asked about the nationalization of ypf during a recent tour of latin america secretary of state hillary clinton said having an open market is a preferable model models that include competition and market access have been the most successful around the world as part of its retaliatory efforts repsol and american financial advisory firm texas yale capital corp filed a lawsuit against the argentine government in u s district court in manhattan the plaintiffs argue argentina must launch a takeover bid for expropriated shares and should compensate repsol for damages the international community s response has been absolutely hysterical petras told afp when one looks at the general pattern of the argentine economy they ve been growing at a rate of 8 a year meanwhile the spanish government has been going backwards for the last five years petras said the european union and the u s government are favorable to repsol as well all the governments that favor repsol have terrible records who are they to advise the argentines gonzalo baeza is afp s south american bureau chief and a freelance journalist based in argentina
a visit by the united states president months before the american elections can be many things a farewell trip collecting paybacks for past favours or simply a low risk synchronised feel good ride amidst millions of adoring indians reliving thereby the past grandeur of america as a global beacon for developing world fantasies of equity justice and morality the one thing it cannot be is an occasion for the signing of a trade deal of any significance why would the host country bother to negotiate one especially if it involves as it does today extending favours to the us by either buying military equipment opening up domestic markets to us exports on a preferential basis going slow on imposing a quasi minimum alternative tax on the turnover in india of us tech giants which book no profits but record explosive growth using an endless inflow of equity support or indeed deprive domestic tech giants of the opportunity to store and massage data just as us tech giants do in their own home jurisdictions giving into each of these concessions means angering domestic interest groups who will remember the pain imposed in the next election in comparison the glow of an iou from potus could turn to dust come november this year should bernie sanders or michael bloomberg be the new president india has never been an aggressive internationalist we remain what mahatma gandhi wanted us to be in the 1930s a largely self sufficient village which minimises global trade links ironically even america once the great liberaliser is listening to the mahatma today and shutting down its borders via high tariffs and stricter immigration rules it is deliciously ironical that our citizens behave differently and look endlessly for opportunities abroad to escape low wages and bad public services at home it is no wonder then that that our wish list for external achievements remains firmly bounded by the middle class dream of more h 1b visas and a permanent seat at the un security council where grandstanding is the order of the day never mind that we simultaneously openly discredit the salience and effectiveness of the united nations system itself look no further than enjoying at ahmedabad a grander version of the narendra modi donald trump event in houston last year in september sadly president trump is an uninspiring speaker hopefully the cultural events would be grander and better than the lackluster stuff desi americans put together mr modi revels in the warmth of millions of gujaratis and can be relied upon to dominate the event with his practised rhetoric cutting to the chase the potus visit underlines our growing influence in america a country that had not so long ago barred narendra modi from visiting it his becoming prime minister in 2014 changed all that as it necessarily must to his credit mr modi has leveraged his energy to blitzkrieg the who s who of international politics with an outreach strategy unparalleled for indian pms friends in high places are useful diplomatic assets one of the purposes of determinedly cozying up to the us is to put china on notice that our influence extends way beyond our economic reach something china yearns for despite a treasury bulging with yuan and us dollars indian warships now patrol the indo pacific high seas alongside those of the us japan and australia a quad determined to keep the seas open meaning free of permanent chinese encroachments multi sector collaboration between government departments of the us and india should be pursued to build closer professional relationships which are the core of sustained effective collaboration to this end we should see more not less of the us executive branch in india for the us if it pulls out from afghanistan india presents an alternative channel to influence domestic affairs in afghanistan we have a good relationship with iran to the west and a long history of engagement with afghanistan all this will need deep restructuring of india s diplomatic priorities and working structures the only worry in reworking our relationship with the us in this manner is the hostility and suspicion it would arouse in china the more powerful china becomes the more skittish it gets about retaining face internationally coupled with their deepening economic woes and the more recent pandemic assault president xi is likely to be even more eager to be seen to remain the big man of china an india preening around in borrowed boots from the last departing gi in kabul is unlikely to be palatable to him not to say of the bile it would evoke in pakistan this is the real task before prime minister modi can he find a path to president xi s heart like he has found to president trump s ahmedabad 2014 and mahabalipuram 2019 were tentative steps which should be deepened some concessions can help particularly if made in the context of joint cross border infrastructure projects rolling back the recently increased copycat import tariffs is desirable global value chains do not function well in an environment of regulatory constraints nor are we good at picking and choosing winners east asian style far better to adopt generalised tax regimes which push value addition and exports via competitiveness these shall create a new set of domestic winners and losers but so long as the aggregate balance of payments impact is positive we can work out domestic arrangements to soothe the pain of the losers the 2019 20 economic survey has done yeoman service by explicitly establishing that india has not lost out from the 14 free trade agreements it has signed since 1997 our exports of manufactured goods increased by 13 4 per cent versus an increase of 12 7 per cent in imports similarly merchandise exports increased by 10 9 per cent versus an increase of 8 6 per cent in imports in both cases a net gain in exports we need an impossible mix of deeper commercial and trade relationships with china and a comprehensive strategic understanding of affinity with the us navigating this path will require us to abjure copying president trump s strategy of always winning at negotiations some deals are best lost opening our domestic market can provide china the growth boost it desperately needs to retain its domestic feel good quotient the us and the other rcep countries would also benefit the tiger economies of southeast asia grew during the three decades from 1960 to 1997 by following japan in a flying geese model of growth with the lead economy periodically vacating a growth sector for the ones following china can be our lead goose it has five times the economic heft of india it can generate the trade volumes needed to fulfill our 1 trillion export ambition india cannot realistically hope to outgrow either china or the united states before 2040 at the very earliest why let blind ambition or prejudice stop us in the meantime from getting a piece of the cake being carved up between the two global giants

weaken further into 2020 meanwhile american businesses have already started to sound the alarm bell apple inc aapl the biggest us company by market cap announced it sees its revenue at risk and not expected to hit its revenue guidance for the quarter owing to the coronavirus outbreak as previously mentioned the latest flash pmi report from ihs markit revealed that us economic output contracted for the first time since october 2013 the composite output index took a tumble to 49 6 for february and is down from a reading of 53 3 the month prior even more worrisome than the composite pmi figure was the nosedive in the services business activity index which fell at the fastest rate on record to a fresh 76 month low the latest markit pmi report has consequently brought the overall resilience of the us economy into question as business activity contracts at the same time recession odds seem set to rise seeing that the services sector is a primary component of us gdp us treasury yield curve inversion deepens due to investor demand for safety risk of recession permeating across the broader market can be observed by taking a look at the us treasury yield curve given its historical usefulness in predicting potential economic downturns a notable flattening of the us treasury yield curve has occurred since traders caught wind of the novel coronavirus outbreak earlier this year specifically the 3m10s and 2s10s yield curve spreads dropped from 30 bps and 34 bps respectively at the beginning of the year to the latest measurements of 0 06 and 0 13 this largely stems from the anticipated drag on global gdp growth as investors flock to safety provided by long dated government bonds such as 10 year or 30 year treasuries with the us treasury yield curve inverted once again

earlier housing starts decreased to 1 567 million annual rate in january total housing starts in january were well above expectations and revisions to prior months were positive the housing starts report showed starts were down 3 6 in january compared to december and starts were up 21 4 year over year compared to january 2019 these were blow out numbers starts in december were at the highest level for starts since december 2006 end of the bubble however the weather was very nice again in january just like in december and the weather probably had a significant impact on the seasonally adjusted housing starts number the winter months of december and january have the largest seasonal factors so nice weather can really have an impact single family starts were up 4 6 year over year and multi family starts were up 71 3 yoy this first graph shows the month to month comparison for total starts between 2019 blue and 2020 red click on graph for larger image starts were up 21 4 in january compared to january 2019 for the year starts were up 3 2 compared to 2018 last year in 2019 starts picked up in the 2nd half of the year so the comparisons are easy early in the year below is an update to the graph comparing multi family starts and completions since it usually takes over a year on average to complete a multi family project there is a lag between multi family starts and completions completions are important because that is new supply added to the market and starts are important because that is future new supply units under construction is also important for employment these graphs use a 12 month rolling total for nsa starts and completions the blue line is for multifamily starts and the red line is for multifamily completions the rolling 12 month total for starts blue line increased steadily for several years following the great recession but turned down and has moved sideways recently completions red line had lagged behind then completions caught up with starts although starts are picking up a little again the second graph shows single family starts and completions it usually only takes about 6 months between starting a single family home and completion so the lines are much closer the blue line is for single family starts and the red line is for single family completions note the relatively low level of single family starts and completions the wide bottom was what i was forecasting following the recession and now i expect some further increases in single family starts and completions

want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to safety and serving our customers and recognize our talented engineers as we celebrate national engineers week our employees work tirelessly delivering on our purpose to serve customers and build strong communities and we are delivering a strong return to our shareowners with a total shareowner return of more than 33 in 2019 in 2019 we raised our annual dividend by 0 08 per share which was the 16th straight year we increased our dividend our non gaap temperature normalized earnings of 2 26 per share grew by 7 over 2018 s comparable number this was the ninth year in a row we achieved at least 5 earnings per share growth we continue to make great progress as we execute our customer focused strategy i ll highlight a few of our many strategic and operational achievements and robert will provide more details on our solid financial and regulatory outcomes first as it relates to our transition to a cleaner and more efficient generation fleet we re proud to report we met our 2020 sox nox and mercury emission reduction goals one year early in addition we are well on our way to achieving our 2030 carbon reduction goal of 40 and as of the end of 2019 we ve achieved a 35 reduction in co2 from 2005 levels our progress on these goals are highlighted in the posted supplemental materials our strategy and investments are tightly linked to our commitment to the environment as well as the social and governance standards we have set for ourselves we look forward to highlighting our strong esg performance from the past year and share the vision for our future goals when we update our corporate sustainability report later this year we are continuing our track record of solid execution on renewable investments putting additional clean energy to work for our customers and communities one example of that progress is the recent completion of our 200 megawatt whispering willow north wind project we now have nearly 70 of our planned 1 000 megawatts of new wind placed into service for our iowa customers producing clean efficient renewable energy we are on track to complete the balance of this plan by the end of this year an important complement to our renewable resources will be the addition of the west riverside energy center this highly efficient natural gas facility located in southern wisconsin is over 98 complete and expected to be in service producing low cost energy for our wisconsin customers in the coming weeks the expansion of renewables and efficient natural gas generation will benefit our customers for decades our fuel cost in 2019 were lower than 2018 by nearly 80 million through a combination of expanded wind investments solid operational performance and lower commodity prices another example of our strategy in action an efficient and resilient energy grid remains an important focus of our strategy in 2019 we completed our ami meter installations in iowa providing us with the ability for early detection of outages and information that our customers can use to make smart energy choices we also plan to use these investments to improve how we operate the energy grid reducing the number of substations and helping us lower operating costs making investments that help us better serve customers and communities is core to our strategy an example is the upcoming launch of a new web application and matching mobile application we call my account once fully launched customers will be able to get more detailed information to help them understand and adjust their energy usage this refreshed customer portal is another example of how we are investing to enable our customers with more choice convenience and control over their energy use i ll highlight one last area before i turn it over to robert last fall we announced the results of a year long voluntary resource planning process we call the wisconsin clean energy blueprint this plan balances many important goals including reliability affordability building stronger communities and the impacts transitions have on our talented and dedicated employees the blueprint highlights the opportunity to capture customer benefits by expanding our renewable resource portfolio by building up to 1 000 megawatts of solar in the coming months we ll be sharing more details of how we will take the next steps in our fleet transition and the changes to our wisconsin facilities i m excited about our accomplishments in 2019 our team is committed to again deliver on our financial and operational goals for 2020 i ll summarize the key areas of our 2020 focus continuing as an industry leader in advancing renewable energy customer focused investments completed on time and on budget delivering solid returns for our investors balancing capital investments and cost impacts to customers and living our values thank you for your interest in alliant energy i will now turn the call over to robert robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks john good morning everyone i m pleased to report that 2019 gaap earnings were 2 33 per share compared to 2 19 per share in 2018 excluding non gaap adjustments and temperature impacts earnings were up 7 year over year driven by higher revenue requirements due to increasing rate base partially offset by higher depreciation and financing expenses we provided additional details on the earnings variance drivers on slides 5 and 6 of our supplemental slides the non gaap adjustment in 2019 is related to an atc equity earnings adjustments as a result of the november ferc decision regarding miso transmission owners return on equity complaints the 0 02 per share of nonrecurring earnings were largely due to a reversal of reserves previously recorded for the second complaint period our temperature normalized retail electric sales declined 1 in 2019 when compared to 2018 primarily driven by lower sales to our industrial customers a few of our largest customers in iowa experienced temporary operational issues in 2019 and economic conditions resulting from additional tariffs last year impacted certain manufacturing customers production resulting in a lower industrial demand since industrial sales generate our lowest margins these sales declines did not have a material impact on our 2019 results turning to this year s earnings guidance we are affirming our 2020 earnings guidance of 2 34 per share to 2 48 per share based on our current forecast we are trending to the upper half of the range we are also reaffirming our long term annual earnings growth guidance of 5 to 7 we have rebased our long term earnings growth guidance of 2019 non gaap temperature normalized eps of 2 26 per share our long term growth guidance is through 2023 and is supported by our capital expenditure plans modest sales growth and earning our allowed rates of return the key drivers of the 7 growth in 2020 eps are related to investments in our core utility business including wpl s west riverside generating facility and ipl s wind expansion program these investments were reflected in wpl s approved electric rates for 2020 and ipl s retail electric rate review order received last month a walk from our 2019 non gaap temperature normalized earnings to the midpoint of our 2020 earnings per share guidance is provided on slide 7 the 2020 guidance range assumes a 1 growth in retail electric sales which includes the impact of leap year we are forecasting most of the sales growth from commercial and industrial customers as they resume normal operations in 2020 our strategy includes continued focus on providing affordable energy to our customers in wisconsin we are holding electric and gas base rates flat through 2020 by using federal tax reform benefits and lower fuel costs to offset the cost of utility investments these investments include the highly efficient west riverside energy center which will be in service in the coming months in iowa we are forecasting average residential electric bills for iowa customers who will also remain relatively flat in 2020 as the impact of final base rates implemented in early 2020 will be offset by 35 million of billing credits we will provide to iowa electric customers related to federal tax reform benefits and interim rate refunds from 2019 also more production cash credits and significant fuel cost reductions are expected to flow back to customers as a result of further expansion of wind generation in 2020 as we look to the future we have also added new low cost wind ppas and we ll be ending the duane arnold ppa later this year which will begin saving our iowa electric customers money in 2021 slide 8 has been provided to assist you in modeling the effective tax rates for our two utilities in our consolidated group we estimate a consolidated effective tax rate of negative 11 for 2020 the primary drivers of the lower tax rates are the additional tax credits from new wind projects being placed in service and the return of excess deferred taxes from federal tax reform to our customers the production tax credits and excess deferred tax benefits will flow back to customers resulting in lower electric margins thus the decrease in effective tax rate is largely earnings neutral our 2020 financing plan summarized on slide 9 remains unchanged from the plan we shared last november including issuing up to 250 million of new common equity 225 million of this equity was priced through the equity forward agreements executed in november 2019 we expect to settle those equity forward agreements over the next 10 months to fund capital expenditures for our utilities we expect the remaining 25 million to be issued ratably during 2020 through our shareowner direct program lastly we have included our key regulatory initiatives on slide 10 we have the privilege of serving customers in states that have proven track records of constructive regulation in december and january we received decisions regarding the first forward looking test year rate filings in the state of iowa in the electric rate review decision the iub approved a new renewable energy rider which allowed us to earn a return of and return on the 1 000 megawatts of new wind after they re placed in service with the approval of the renewable energy rider and continued cost controls our plan is to stay at the rate reviews in iowa for at least the next few years in wisconsin we filed a certificate of authority request last year to expand natural gas capacity by 20 in western wisconsin this request is another tool we are using to support economic development in the communities we serve we expect a decision on that filing by the second quarter of 2020 in the second quarter wpl also expects to file a retail electric and gas rate review for test years 2021 and 2022 key drivers of the rate review will be our increased investments in the distribution grid and the kossuth wind farm we expect to place into service later this year we will be utilizing excess deferred tax benefits and regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of the revenue requirement for these utility investments lastly in wisconsin we anticipate filing a certificate of authority in the first half of 2020 for a portion of the 1 000 megawatts of new solar generation we announced last fall we continue to make good progress with advancing these solar projects including acquiring safe harbor equipment in 2019 and securing favorable sites in our service territory to provide additional cost effective clean energy for our customers in wisconsin we very much appreciate your continued support of our company and look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming weeks at upcoming conferences as always we will make our investor relations materials used at the conferences available on our website at this time i ll turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate the question and answer session questions answers operator thank you mr durian we ll take our first question from julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning to you can you hear me susan gille investor relations manager we can john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer we sure can good morning julien julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst top of the morning to you guys thank you very much so i wanted to follow up in the same vein of many of your comments earlier and just ask you to elaborate a little bit first with respect to iowa and solar i m thinking more specifically on the legislative side there s been some development and i know there was a carryover bill i know there was perhaps a deal in the last day here at least in the local news teams can you talk about what any of it in iowa from a light city perspective may mean ultimately to you specifically knowing that not all of it is necessarily focused on alliant utility scale solar in terms of what was contemplated there and then separately i ll throw my second question out there at the same time coming back to wisconsin you alluded in your remarks to some development coming up ahead in the next months i wasn t quite sure if that pertained directly to the solar filing you re making or with respect to the voluntary filing you made earlier is there something else in parallel we should be anticipating here so again i just want more of a clarification from the earlier prepared remarks john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer i ll touch on the first couple and i might turn it over to robert as well as it relates to iowa and the build relating to solar it s very early in the process so as you can imagine this can change a bit we are evaluating that and certainly talking with stakeholders in midamerican so i would hesitate to go beyond identifying the direct impacts on that right now it s something we re keeping a close eye on and in wisconsin we do have our rate filing that we ll have in the second quarter and then we re putting together the application for our first tranche of the solar investment those would be two that we talked about and i ll ask robert here to add anything else to that robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so as a reminder last november we announced plans to build up to 1 000 megawatts of new solar by 2023 think of this filing that we re going to make here in the next couple of months as the first tranche and that will maybe think of roughly half of that will come out with a filing in early april time frame with many more details regarding the nature of the transactions and the sites and all the details that have to go along with that types of filings julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it excellent thank you and then perhaps just if i can ask you to follow up on the solar filing coming up here in 2q or is there anything different that we should expect in this filing versus that of your peers in the state who also pursued a similar early let s call it a pilot effort on the forefront as well just trying to think about potentially a different set of issues or is it pretty comparable in your mind robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer i d say the one area where it may be different from what you ve seen in the state historically is we are contemplating doing some type of tax equity structure that is different from what some of the previous filings in the state event we re still in the early stages of kind of determining exactly what that s going to look like but expect when you see the filing come out in that early april time frame there will be some type of partnership with the third party to help us really try and monetize those tax benefits booked for our customers and we see this as a great opportunity to lower the cost for our customers with these new solar projects julien dumoulin smith bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent thank you guys operator our next question comes from andrew weisel with scotiabank andrew weisel scotiabank analyst hey good morning everybody first question on the emissions front you made very impressive progress to date and i m glad to see you emphasizing that a bit more in the slide deck thanks for that too john i think you mentioned you ll update the corporate sustainability goal later this year do you have any sense of what that means for a longer term carbon reduction goal you got your 2030 target what might it take to get even bigger reduction say for carbon dioxide by 2040 or 50 would it be coal plant retirements more renewables energy efficiency i imagine it s all of that but where do you see the biggest opportunities john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer yes we are excited by being able to continue to update our sustainability report in a number of environmental improvements that we ve made we do have a current 80 reduction goal that we have in there in addition to our 2030 goal so what we d be looking at is as we update our resource planning efforts and we take a look at some of our continued fleet transition we ll review that and make further adjustments in our sustainability report in addition to that some of the areas for example water reduction with our west riverside plant our addition of wind and solar and some of the retirements we ve already had we ve made significant progress in reducing the amount of water usage then obviously we ve done some work with habitat meaning pollinator plant things in conjunction with solar installation so very excited about the story and i appreciate you asking about that andrew weisel scotiabank analyst ok great thank you for that next question in wisconsin you ll be filing the rate case in the coming months for wpl you ve been holding rates flat you mentioned some offsets but how do you think about the potential to either keep rates flat for two more years or have a minimal increase and then possibly related how do you think about the potential for yet another settlement and similarly are there any atypical issues that might come up in the filing robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer andrew this is robert yes i think when we look forward to the 2021 2022 forward looking test periods we do believe that there will be a modest increase to our customers but given the ability for us to use excess deferred taxes and various other regulatory liabilities that we ve accumulated over the past few years and we ll see a pretty significant mitigation of any increase so i would think of those in the kind of single digits maybe low single digit percentage increases on an annual basis so nothing very significant and so we ll continue our strong track record of maintaining pretty low or relatively low rates for our customers in wisconsin and as far as settlement process we do have a long history of constructive settlements and outcomes we would continue to look forward to working with the stakeholders to try and reach a settlement with that after we make the initial filings sometime in that second or third quarter of this year andrew weisel scotiabank analyst sounds good then just to clarify i think in iowa you said you re planning to stay out for at least the next two years just to really be explicit does that mean that you d file in 21 for rates in 22 or file in 22 for rates in 23 robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer just as a reminder with the renewable energy rider that was approved with the last rate case we have a mechanism now to be able to get all of the rate base additions from the new wind generation that we re putting into service in 2020 in that rider which will become effective or get renewed i guess on january 1 2021 so with that mechanism we actually think that we can stay out of rate cases for probably over a couple of years out so at least probably into that 23 time frame if not beyond depending on how well we can control costs andrew weisel scotiabank analyst fantastic thank you very much operator we ll take our next question from michael sullivan with wolfe research michael sullivan wolfe research analyst good morning i just wanted to clarify and make sure i heard right i think you guys had said you were trending within the upper half of the range for 2020 guidance already was that right and what s driving that if so robert durian executive vice president and chief financial officer yes good question michael you are correct that we are trending to the upper half of the range we really have had some beneficial developments here probably in the last couple of months we saw favorable pension costs and we had a pretty strong year when it comes to the returns of our pension assets which translates into lower pension costs in 2020 we also are starting off the year very well when it comes to a fuel cost perspective as a reminder in wisconsin we ve got a fuel sharing mechanism where both the shareowners and the customers benefit from lower fuel costs and given how low natural gas prices are and how well our natural gas facilities are running we re able to generate some savings both for our shareowners as well as our customers and then we re also benefiting from lower interest expense given interest rate environments that are currently there so those are the primary drivers that we started out the year very well with michael sullivan wolfe research analyst ok great and then my other one was just i think you may have alluded to this a little bit but just wanted to clarify as far as the future of your coal fleet i think in iowa you re saying sort of by the end of this year you ll come up with a new plan but in wisconsin is that going to happen in conjunction with the solar filing where you laid that out or what s the avenue where that gets disclosed or discussed john larsen chairman president and chief executive officer yes michael this is john when we file as robert had noted in the second quarter as what we re expecting for the solar we will be informing a bit more about our plans for our wisconsin coal facilities at that time and you re right we are going through that process in iowa which would be think of that more toward the end of the year michael sullivan wolfe research analyst right thanks guys operator we ll take our next question from ashar khan with verition ashar khan

one hundred years ago the ford motor company began paying auto workers 5 per day declaring the move the greatest revolution in the matter of rewards for its workers ever known to the industrial world with the new wage announced on january 5 1914 a new era seemed to be dawning what marvels might not mr ford s example work if only other capitalists would do the same asked the new york times for some henry ford was hailed as a genius and the high priest of american industry for the wall street journal he was a class traitor ford s move which essentially doubled the wages of unskilled auto workers stunned contemporary observers because it seemed to represent such a departure from the modus operandi of american capitalism in 1913 industrialists paid workers as little as they could and not one penny more to pay workers above what the market determined and what violent repression ensured would corrupt the workforce and ruin prices among a litany of other supposed evils ford had not set out to redistribute wealth his primary aim was to create a loyal and stable workforce so that he could make full use of the moving assembly line introduced a year earlier in 1913 at his highland park plant where the model t was manufactured the assembly line the industrial miracle of the age in the words of john d rockefeller had led ford managers to another discovery the problem of labor turnover in 1913 american factories cycled through their workforces with astonishing speed it was worse for ford due to the monotony and brutality of the assembly line in one year investigators at highland park counted more than 200 severed fingers and 75 000 burns cuts and puncture wounds the chain system you have is a slave driver the wife of an autoworker implored ford in 1914 my god mr ford my husband has come home thrown himself down won t eat his supper so done out can t it be remedied in 1913 exhausted ford workers often walked off the job in the middle of their shifts thus bringing to a halt the entire assembly line and with it ford s profits in 1913 the highland park plant had a labor turnover rate of 370 percent in order to maintain a workforce of 14 000 ford had been compelled to hire 52 000 different workers ford calculated that by reducing turnover breaking the day into three eight hour shifts and thereby achieving constant production on his new assembly lines he would continue to expand his profits helping ford was the desperate situation among workers created by the recession of 1913 1914 which saw us industrial production decline by nearly 20 percent such were conditions in detroit that on january 12 1914 when ford s 5 plan went into effect 12 000 job seekers braved a blizzard and company fire hoses looking for work at highland park the 5 day was the best cost cutting measure ever undertaken ford is thought to have said in 1915 he hired only 6 508 workers mainly to fill new positions in two years the time it took to make a model t dropped from 12 hours and 28 minutes to 93 minutes prices dropped markets expanded and while he did not expect that the 5 per day would allow his own workforce to become a major new market for his cars the model t was designed for america s still vast farm population in a broader sense some did think ford s profit sharing scheme held the key to social harmony if capitalists imitated ford they would produce more sell more cheaply and generate immense profits through sheer volume of sales if a small portion of the profits were shared with the labor force this would promote loyalty to the company encourage workers to purchase more and thereby create new markets for commodities herein lay ford s bitter opposition to labor unions abundance is the remedy for scarcity wrote the times celebrating ford s philosophy restriction of production is labor s contribution to the problem which mr ford has attacked if not solved unions at that moment were primarily rooted in the skilled trades and as such were organically opposed to innovations in production such as the assembly line and scientific management that eliminated craft workers and their monopoly over the knowledge of production worse was the threat posed by the industrial workers of the world iww which advocated workers control of the factories and had won a sympathetic hearing from highland park workers in march 1913 after a few days of lunchtime speeches and arrests of iww agitators ford ruled that workers could no longer leave the factory for lunch banned from ford the iww would go on to lead a june 1913 strike by 6 000 unskilled workers at three studebaker factories in detroit the first important industrially organized strike in the industry ford s vision could not admit into discussion the existence of opposed class interests yet socialism and the russian revolution coming just four years after ford s 5 day breathed a new spirit into the american class struggle workers began to think that they might overcome the impotent and corrupt craft unions and build industrial unions that would organize all workers in a given industry regardless of skill or trade race or nationality and workers began to be attracted to what was then commonly called industrial democracy breaking the dictatorial control of capital over the workplace and the economy by 1919 the auto workers union whose leaders were socialists and which advocated industrial unionism had 40 000 members in detroit ford sought to stamp out these subversive thoughts as part of a broader drive to create a disciplined and submissive workforce this was overseen by his sociological department also launched in 1914 in order to earn the 5 day which was in fact not available to all employees including women young single men and the few black workers ford would begin to hire in 1914 workers had to meet a number of personal requirements ford s social investigators paid unannounced visits to workers on the job and in their homes inspecting the latter for cleanliness and signs of alcohol consumption the sociological department sought to americanize ford s multinational workforce by 1914 70 percent of ford s total workforce were foreign born and over half came from eastern and southern europe compelling workers to enroll in citizenship courses beginning during world war i the sociological department joined hands with federal authorities and the american protective league to finger and root out radical workers in 1921 it was merged into ford s infamous service department in 1919 ford launched into a notorious career as an anti semite using his own newspaper the dearborn independent to attribute to an international jewish conspiracy everything he found objectionable including the russian revolution and its influence on workers bolshevism is jewish one of ford s ghost writers declared the novelty of ford s 5 day did not last long inflation during world war i undermined the wage s purchasing power by half making ford s announcement of a 6 day in 1919 considerably less impressive meanwhile rival auto producers mimicked the assembly line cutting into ford s market share in 1920 during the postwar recession ford laid off 70 000 workers then in 1929 came the stock market crash followed by the great depression shattering any lingering assumption that capitalism might resolve its contradictions by simply producing more ford drove down wages to five 4 days in 1932 compared to six 5 days in 1914 and laid off workers by the thousands in the trough of the depression well over half of all detroit workers were without jobs while henry ford remained the world s richest man on the bitterly cold day of march 7 1932 the detroit unemployed council led a march of about 5 000 workers and youth from detroit to ford s massive river rouge factory complex in dearborn in what became known as the hunger march when the marchers reached dearborn police and ford s private goons attacked with tear gas fire hoses clubs and live fire five men and boys were killed five days later some 60 000 detroit workers marched down woodward avenue in memory of the fallen in 1937 auto workers launched the massive sit down strike campaign against general motors which had eclipsed ford as the nation s largest automaker the strike wave led by socialist minded workers was the high water mark of working class militancy in the great depression tens of thousands joined the united auto workers at gm plants yet henry ford signaled he was prepared for violence to keep the union out when service department thugs beat up uaw leader walter reuther and other unionists in the so called battle of the overpass on may 26 1937 ultimately what paved the way for the entrance of the uaw into the ford plants in 1940 and 1941 was the labor movement s embrace of the american war effort in world war two the uaw the congress of industrial organization cio and the american federation of labor afl promised the roosevelt administration to clamp down on strikes as us imperialism readied itself for its showdown with germany and japan in return in key industries such as auto and steel the labor bureaucracy was given a seat at the table to organize wartime production the stalinist communist party wielded its influence among militant workers to support the pact and enforce the ban on strikes after the war in 1945 1946 workers launched the largest strike wave in us history they were determined not to go back to the hungry 30s in this explosive situation reuther and other labor leaders sought to continue and deepen the collaboration with capitalism and the federal government begun during world war ii in exchange for the state sanctioning of the labor bureaucracy and regular pay and benefit improvements for autoworkers the unions would purge from their ranks ideas of socialism and industrial democracy and the workers who held them and would support us capitalism and its dominance of markets all over the world this collusion epitomized in the treaty of detroit between the uaw and general motors in 1950 set up conditions in the 1950s and 1960s that resembled henry ford s dream when he launched the 5 day a small share of the immense profits accrued to gm ford chrysler and the lesser automakers would find their way back to auto workers in the form of increased pay workers would in turn provide a growing market for consumer goods including for the first time in significant numbers the cars that they themselves made in the ensuing two decades of economic boom michigan s auto workers enjoyed arguably the highest standard of living that any section of the industrial working class has ever achieved workers tended to stay in the employ of one of the big three for many years if not their entire career at the end of which there awaited the expectation of a decent retirement reuther and other union officials justified their program of class collaboration with claims that the virtuous circle of increased productivity being rewarded with higher wages leading to greater consumption and higher profits would essentially last forever yet reuther s wager that tied the autoworkers to the global success of american capitalism was based on a temporary historical conjuncture the post war export of capital to war ravaged europe and japan aimed at preventing social revolution and financing the purchase of us goods had the effect of creating powerful economic competitors which adopted the methods of mass production in their rebuilt industries the reemergence of america s rivals especially japan and germany cut into the big three s market share profit rates declined and from the 1970s on capital flowed out of industrial production into speculative financial pursuits and the personal fortunes of the wealthy this gathering crisis came to a head in 1979 with the bankruptcy of chrysler its bailout orchestrated by the carter administration marked a watershed in american history the uaw cooperated with the federal government chrysler and financiers in enforcing major wage concessions on the workers it nominally represented from that moment on the uaw served as a tool of capital in rolling back wages and benefits fingering militant plants and workers for closure and dismissal and came to play a role analogous to ford s service department the uaw abandoned strikes victimized militant workers collaborated in the destruction of hundreds of thousands of jobs and joined with the companies to wipe out the eight hour day and virtually every other gain won by auto workers over generations of struggle reuther s prediction that wages would rise in tandem with productivity has not been true since 1972 as the capitalists with the assistance of the unions ruthlessly slashed labor costs while pumping every greater more output from the working class it is a fact of great historical significance that one hundred years later the starting wage for auto workers is less in real terms than it was in 1914 ford s 5 day adjusted for inflation and divided into an eight hour shift is today about 14 50 per hour in the obama administration s so called rescue of general motors and chrysler in 2009 the uaw agreed to lower by half the average starting wage for autoworkers down to 14 an hour once again workers cannot afford to buy the cars they build workers must draw out the conclusions the capitalists and their politicians are turning the clock back to a time when workers were little more than industrial slaves new organizations of struggle independent of the company controlled unions and the big business parties are needed above all the coming struggles of a new generation of workers must be guided by a new international and socialist strategy only in this way can the wealth created by the collective labor of the working class be used to raise the material and cultural level of all the people instead of being hoarded by the wealthy few

capital flight through illicit financial flows is a major challenge for our global economy money earned through corruption tax evasion smuggling endangered species as well as trafficking in humans drugs and precious gems are the main sources of illicit funds the united nations and multiple watch dog agencies play a role in eliminating this curse by working together on several platforms including the united nations office on drug and crimes the oecd global forum for taxation and the financial actions task fatf however the fatf s role in combating money laundering and terrorist financing is one of the most important the fatf is an inter governmental body that promulgates international standards to combat the profanity of money laundering and terrorist financing it is directly connected with every major developing and developed country in the world the fatf s regional bodies make sure that each signatory nation is complying with its standards if the fatf decides that a signatory nation is non cooperative in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing or has weak enforcement measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing it can declare that a nation is high risk and place it on a grey list for continuous monitoring grey listed nations suffer severe economic consequences such as reduced foreign direct investments imports and exports remittances and limited access to international financial institutions pakistan was grey listed in june 2018 because of its ties to islamist militant groups and its weak anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism aml cft regulations in my opinion pakistan was unfairly grey listed by the fatf because pakistan s efforts against terrorism and islamist militants were being loudly applauded by the world being an important ally in the war against terrorism pakistan had not only lost innocent citizens but also suffered a substantial financial loss despite these costs pakistan fought against militant organizations and restored peace in the country pakistan was the only non nato ally in the war against terrorism that facilitated the us and its allies by offering its own resources and infrastructure pakistan offered its most important supply route for us and isaf forces in afghanistan pakistan offered its airbase s and also facilitated the us and its allies in identifying and targeting the taliban on its own soil through drone attacks this cooperation resulted in a high cost to the pakistani people a physicians for social responsibility report states that from 2004 2013 more than 81 000 pakistani lost their lives in this war against terrorism the dead included 48 504 civilians 45 journalists and around 951 civilians killed in done attacks 5 498 law enforcement personnel and 26 862 others moreover this war badly impacted pakistan s economy by drastically affecting exports physical infrastructure tax collection and investment including social fabrics according to economic survey of pakistan the country lost more than 123 billion in the war against terrorism despite all this suffering pakistan s achievements against terrorism cannot be matched by any other country under the leadership of then prime minister nawaz sharif pakistan designed a comprehensive national action plan to counter terrorism this plan not only defined direct military actions against terrorists but also choked off terrorism financing to prevent the re emergence of targeted organizations this plan also facilitated coordination between authorities including federal and provincial governments to get rid of this curse moreover pakistan moved one step ahead by establishing special trial courts under the supervision of army to ensure speedy terrorist trials military tribunals in pakistan convicted more than 180 terrorists and had issued verdicts in more than 300 terrorism related cases by the end of 2015 the national counter terrorism authority nacta report on terrorism shows that pakistan has significantly reduced terrorism incidents since 2014 it highlighted that 1 816 terrorist incidents were reported in 2014 and 1 139 in 2015 reportable terrorist incidents were further reduced to 785 741 and 548 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the report further states that in islamabad and the punjab a reduction of 50 percent in terrorism related incidents occurred whereas in baluchistan and khyber pakhtunkhwa a 92 percent reduction was witnessed finally the report highlights an 80 percent decline in terrorist incidents in 2018 in sindh notably all victories were achieved through pakistan s own initiatives using its own resources and without external pressure or international dictates when it comes to combating money laundering pakistan s progress and performance is better than a majority of fatf member nations pakistan successfully implemented anti money laundering laws in 2007 which were further amended in 2010 in the light of fatf guidance pakistan introduced detailed aml cft regulations and then issued guidelines on a risk based approach in 2012 these regulations were further amended in 2015 under the guidance of the asia pacific group the regional body of the fatf below see a chronological list of pakistan s initiatives to combat money laundering and terrorist financing the state bank of pakistan tightened its policy against unlicensed alternative remittance systems which are hundi or hawala the state bank of pakistan made it compulsory for all hawaladars to get registered as authorized foreign exchange dealers and meet minimum capital requirements starting in june 2004 in 2008 the securities and exchange commission of pakistan issued anti money laundering regulations for all entities except financial institutions during former finance minster ishaq dar s tenure pakistan issued additional lists of predicate offenses and corresponding penalties then in 2014 pakistan issued guidelines for financial institutions on investment incentive scheme where it was clearly stated that a scheme will not receive any immunity from the application of the aml act 2010 the policy also provides guidelines for addressing and mitigating aml cft risks along with filing of suspicious transactions reports in january 2015 the ministry of finance announced minimum threshold limits for currency transaction reports ctrs subsequently the same year through statutory notification pakistan announced a financial monitoring unit an autonomous body that could work without political pressure against the curse of money laundering and terrorist financing in april 2015 pakistan further amended the sales tax act and federal excise duties to add predicate offences the sales tax act was further amended to make insider trading and market manipulation as predicate offences in the light of section 42 of money laundering act 2010 under the same section the government of pakistan amended its income tax ordinance 2001 and inserted sections 192 and 192a relating to prosecution for false statements in verification or concealment of income these provisions were added to deal with tax evasion in may 2019 the government notified provincial counter terrorism departments ctds as investigation and prosecuting agencies and in december 2019 pakistan established a supervisory authority for designated non financial business and professions dnfbps pakistan also issued aml and cft regulations together with guidelines on a risk based approach in 2012 which have subsequently been amended with revised regulations issued in 2015 these guidelines contain clear directions for verification of the identity of a customer and require this verification prior to opening an account these guidelines further require that financial institutions must obtain a copy of customer s computerized national identity card cnic from occasional or walk in customers who are conducting cash transactions above threshold limits whether carried out in a single transaction or in multiple transactions that appear to be linked for all currency transaction reports that in aggregate exceed the threshold the securities and exchange commission issued further amended regulations in 2018 based upon recommendations from the financial monitoring unit in consultation with the policy board these regulations contains comprehensive guidelines for risk assessment and applying risk based approaches to monitor the aml cft system cross border correspondent relationships on going monitoring of business relationships simplified due diligence including enhanced due diligence of high risk customers politically exposed persons peps record keeping including reporting of suspicious transactions and currency transactions despite pakistan s sufferings cooperation and achievements it was categorized as a non cooperative country and grey listed by the fatf in 2018 this is ironic since the fatf s 10 primary objectives were specifically designed to address terrorist related activities however once the fatf realised that militant organizations were already being addressed by the law enforcement agencies leas of pakistan the fatf started coaching pakistan on its implementation of money laundering laws when pakistan was grey listed it felt arbitrary and unfounded especially as other fatf member nations have faced severe challenges to combat the curse of money laundering in fact a review of money laundering vulnerabilities methodologies and incidents in england canada italy argentina belgium brazil india the list goes on reveals that each is facing similar issues due to weak controls criminals still use banks real estate financial assets remittances shell companies phantom accounts illegal gaming informal financial networks and the sale of cars cattle racehorses artwork and other luxury goods to transport their illegitimate earnings moreover large urban centres also facilitate drug trafficking organizations with money laundering techniques which involve foreign bank accounts shell companies and financial assets the incsr 2019 states that the most common methods used to transport funds in india includes buying gold and real estate opening multiple accounts intermingling criminal and legitimate proceeds purchasing bank checks with cash routing funds through employee accounts including the creation of complex legal structures apart from these methods the most common way is education programmes charities and election campaigns hawala systems operate on a large scale in india and facilitates criminals and terrorists and money launderers to transport their funds all these countries are influential members of the fatf but still struggle to implement aml regulations another important fact highlighted in a report from the un office on drugs and crime is that drug traffickers may have laundered around 1 6 trillion or 2 7 per cent of global gdp this report highlights that general criminal proceeds excluding tax evasion amounted to 2 1 trillion or 3 6 per cent of gdp in 2009 out of this total the proceeds of trans national organized crime such as drug trafficking counterfeiting human trafficking and small arms smuggling would amount to 1 5 per cent of global gdp and 70 per cent of that amount would likely have been laundered through the financial system the report also talks about the cocaine trade which stood at around 84 billion in 2009 a major portion of this income was generated in north america estimated at approximately 35 billion followed by west and central europe at 26 billion as per this report most profits from the cocaine trade are laundered in north america and in europe illicit income from other sub regions is likely laundered in the caribbean these examples include founding as well as other member nations of the fatf although these states have not fully implemented laws and regulations to successfully control money laundering the fatf has never issued warnings nor added their names to the grey list in contrast developing countries with weaker economies face similar compliance issues and struggle to fight against these crimes based on their limited resources often they are grey listed by the fatf which further impedes their revenue base and ability to fight these crimes once a developing country is placed on the fatf grey list they became victims of advisories and guidance issued by financial regulatory bodies from other countries this slows and raises the costs of international transactions because of the additional time and resources required to perform enhanced due diligence on each transaction made with a grey listed nation these advisories become burdensome even when transferring legitimate funds to support families due to additional requirements and interrogation by the financial institutions or money services businesses acting as transaction intermediaries for developing countries like pakistan it can be a financial disaster apart from fatf s unfair treatment of pakistan the current government has done a poor job of defending pakistan s national interests at a time when pakistan could least afford the punitive actions they failed to explain that pakistan was already complying with their ten point objective by implementing its national action plan they also failed to explain that progress was being achieved and if fatf member countries forced action against pakistan it would further weaken a deteriorating economy in the country we are witnessing the effects of this lost opportunity instead of defending pakistan s existing regulations and progress to date and by agreeing to fatf s ten point directive they have obligated pakistan to an unrealistic implementation schedule pakistan needs to present its case strongly at the fatf meeting pakistan s compliance levels are growing and our successes compare favorably to other fatf member states we need to strongly communicate that pakistan has won its war against terrorism and that we are now at the implementation and fine tuning stage of fatf s guidance and recommendations we have tremendous achievements in hunting down the militants and their organisations we have improved our laws and regulations and our system is far better than many fatf member states we are not a facilitator of the drug trade like west and central europe and caribbean countries highlighted in unodc report our border security is better than the inscr has reported about most other fatf member nations we have successfully overcome issues in alternative remittances system and the incsr s report highlighted our efforts the bottom line pakistan s name was placed on the grey list due to weak representation and it will continue to remain there until we fight back and ably defend our progress however our current leadership may not be up to the task recently their anemic foreign policy resulted in a failure to convince 16 nations to pass a resolution against india for obvious human rights violations in kashmir do we really expect that current pakistani leadership can convince the fatf to reserve our grey

from birch gold group earlier this week we covered the federal reserve s pursuit of a central bank digital currency cbdc based on the blockchain and dubbed fedcoin it turns out that china is also pursuing its own version of a cbdc and while the consequences of such a move for americans would be very different than those of a fedcoin they have the potential to be even more dire what s more beijing could be even closer to implementation than the fed is vila lehdonvirta a senior research fellow at oxford was quoted on quartz explaining a few advantages to china of its version a cbdc could have several advantages from a central bank s perspective one is winning back more direct control over money supply to use as a monetary policy lever in a cbdc system the central bank could bypass banks and influence consumers directly according to an article on ledger insights one key difference between fedcoin and china s cbdc is that the latter isn t likely to be based on blockchain technology therefore it wouldn t be a true cryptocurrency like the planned fedcoin instead it will have a two tier structure involving the central bank issuing the currency to banks or institutions with these banks circulating the currency amongst their customers and the digital cash will be 100 backed by central bank deposits from commercial banks and institutions the same article goes on to highlight that china has been pursuing their digital currency since 2014 and there are 996 staff at the digital money institute with that kind of manpower it s no wonder that a recent bloomberg piece revealed the people s bank of china is close to issuing its own cryptocurrency the bloomberg article doesn t share a specific timeline but wang xin at the people s bank of china offered a hint of clarification on regulation asia stating a digital currency issued by the central bank can improve the efficiency of monetary policy and help to optimise the payment system we had an early start but lots of work is needed to consolidate our lead no matter if china s cbdc could be close or lots of work is still needed they appear serious about implementing it and even the possibility that this digital currency could soon exist should raise a red flag that s because china s effort to create a cbdc is really part of an overall strategy of de dollarization another way for china to put a dent in the u s dollar s hegemony according to a recent 5 minute forecast from agora financial china s central bank has filed more than 80 patents as part of the push to create a digital currency we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the patents include proposals related to the issuance and supply of a central bank digital currency a system for interbank settlements that uses the currency and the integration of digital currency wallets into existing retail bank accounts sure seems like china could be creating an alternative to the u s dollar for transactions and this isn t the first time they ve pursued alternate economic channels for trade with that goal in mind jim rickards has even suggested that countries like china may be building toward a gold backed digital currency which would make their currency an even stronger competitor to the u s dollar if it came to fruition thankfully according to rickards china hasn t yet amassed enough gold to reach strategic parity with the u s dollar so at this time they may be unable to implement a gold backed digital currency but in spite of that china appears to be closer to introducing a digital currency than we might think according to gal luft and anne korin authors of the book de dollarization first it is already a de facto cashless society the largest bank note in circulation is 100 yuan about 15 making big cash transactions cumbersome while cash is not practical credit cards have never become mainstream in the country this is why china has become the leading society in mobile payments even though the ideal move might be to wait until they amass enough gold who knows what china will do to dethrone the dollar and don t forget about russia and saudi arabia which may join forces with china to kill the dollar even sweden has recently started real world testing of the world s first cbdc called the e krona which proves the idea is beginning to take off bottom line the u s dollar is being targeted by other nations and cbdcs are more ammo in their arsenal whether countries like china are successful remains to be seen as the dollar weakens gold tends to get stronger the u s dollar has maintained a hegemony as the global reserve currency since 1944 in 2010 the united nations conference on trade and development suggested it be replaced because of the instability of its value on the global market for various reasons china russia and other countries want to weaken and eventually dethrone the dollar to gain a foothold in global trade whether they succeed or not it s a good idea to hedge against a weakening dollar
discussing the u s federal reserve is not your typical go to topic of conversation at the office water cooler for laughs ask your colleagues their thoughts on the latest fed meeting and watch the blank stares appear your membership to future water cooler discussions will likely be revoked but the fed s impact is expansive ultimately impacting most every facet of our daily financial lives as america s central bank the federal reserve serves as the decision making body for u s monetary policy its mandate is to promote the health and stability of our financial system through management of short term interest rates and the availability and cost of credit it seeks to manipulate spending investment employment and inflation to foster economic growth the fed s main tool in this endeavor is to adjust the benchmark fed funds rate upon which short term debt is often based lowering interest rates on credit induces consumer and business spending helping boost economic growth conversely raising the cost of debt acts as a deterrent on spending and taps the brakes on economic growth while implementing its rate hike agenda the fed must walk a tightrope of balancing economic growth and inflation rising prices the ideal pace allows for a steadily growing economy that keeps excessive inflation in check through targeted and measured rate hikes if the fed raises rates too fast it risks prematurely stalling economic growth too slow the fed risks the economy overheating with runaway inflation but the fed is still reeling from its alleged mismanagement of interest rates over the past two years in 2018 at a time when the u s economy was weighed down by a severely weak global economy and trade disputes the fed charged ahead with four 0 25 rate hikes moreover the fed was further projecting two to three additional 0 25 rate hikes in 2019 the resulting chaos was brutal on concerns the fed would de stabilize a strong and growing economy with its aggressive agenda of interest rate hikes the dow jones industrial average plummeted nearly 19 from oct 3 through dec 24 2018 last year the fed spent much of its time undoing the interest rate hikes it had imposed in 2018 first the fed eliminated its two to three projected rate hikes in 2019 it then enacted a series of three consecutive 0 25 rate cuts beginning at its july meeting in short the fed was implying that the four rate hikes in 2018 were a mistake without explicitly saying so in hindsight the fed s greatest fault was its stubborn reliance on its economic forecasting models the fed uses its theoretical models to project the future dynamics of the u s economy such as economic growth employment and inflation these models were telling the fed that the strong economy labor market and rising wages would drive inflation higher to unacceptable levels something that never happened despite acknowledging this disconnect between its models and real world data the fed pushed through its four 0 25 rate hikes in 2018 amid rising anger from both wall street and main street america as we begin 2020 the fed appears more even keeled in promoting its interest rate agenda it s been less aggressive in its public commentary and seems to be taking a more wait and see approach in delivering its interest rate forecasts the role of the fed should be behind the scenes using its monetary policy to gently guide and stabilize the economy on a gradual upward trajectory in recent years its actions have hindered not helped that upward trajectory this year let s hope the fed has learned from its prior mistakes
stephen roach a senior fellow at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia in an interview with beijing review stephen roach a senior fellow at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia shared his observations on the chinese economy under the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 epidemic an edited excerpt follows beijing review in recent interviews with chinese media outlets you expressed optimism on the prospects of the chinese economy and predicted a sharp rebound once the virus is under control where do you think the resilience of the chinese economy comes from stephen roach while the chinese economy has slowed to a virtual standstill in early 2020 due to the impacts of covid 19 this devastating disease should not impair the underlying strength of the chinese economy in my opinion that strength reflects four key economic transitions from investment and export led growth to consumer driven growth from manufacturing to services from surplus saving to saving absorption and using that drawdown of domestic saving to fund china s social safety net and boost discretionary household consumption and from imported to indigenous innovation as long as the government continues to focus its reform strategy on these key transitions once the virus runs its course which remains my strong expectation for the second half of 2020 these transitions in conjunction with recent stimulus actions by the people s bank of china pbc will play a decisive role in providing a strong post virus impetus to the chinese economy you were in china during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak what are the differences in the chinese economy today is it more resilient or more vulnerable compared to conditions prevailing in 2003 the chinese economy today is far bigger better balanced and more globally important in renminbi terms the chinese gdp is about seven times its size 17 years ago its share of the world gdp as measured by the international monetary fund s imf purchasing power parity metric currently stands at 19 7 percent fully 2 3 times the 8 7 percent share in 2003 at the same time it is less dependent on manufacturing as the secondary share of the chinese gdp fell from 45 6 percent in 2003 to 40 7 percent in 2018 while a surging service sector boosted the tertiary share of the economy by 10 percentage points from 42 percent in 2003 to 52 percent in 2018 with the broader world economy mired in an unusually anemic post crisis recovery since the global financial crisis of 2008 china s ongoing growth has accounted for fully 37 percent of the cumulative gains in global output since 2008 notwithstanding the serious short term disruptions associated with covid 19 today s rebalanced chinese economy is far more resilient than it was back in the sars days at the same time with the world far more dependent on china today than it was back then short term disruptions in the chinese economy are bound to have a more serious impact on global growth when china sneezes today s world is far more at risk of catching a bad cold than it was in 2003 workers make protective clothing at a factory in urumqi xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china on february 14 xinhua what kind of measures do you think the government could take to facilitate an economic rebound at this point in time the highest priority for government policy must be virus containment addressing modern china s most serious public health emergency the economy comes second and fortunately for china it is strong enough to endure even this serious shock there is of course very little that traditional countercyclical policy measuresâ monetary and fiscal alikeâ can do to offset the severe economic pressures associated with quarantines and travel restrictions the actions taken thus far by the pbc are important to stabilize financial markets in the event of another sharp drop such as that which occurred on february 3 barring that possibility stimulus should add fuel to any post virus rebound in the economy with the pre virus chinese economy having slowed to a 27 year low of 6 percent growth in late 2019 china s policymakers are wise to err on the side of stimulus at the same time it would be imprudent to back away from the critical deleveraging campaign that has been such a high priority for the chinese leadership over the past three and a half years once the virus is contained the natural forces of recovery should take hold comparable to those that occurred in the aftermath of sars in 2003 by staying focused on public health imperatives and bringing covid 19 under control as soon as possible the chinese economy should be well positioned for a solid rebound in the second half of 2020 what impact do you think this outbreak will have on the global economy how would a chinese rebound help the world economy with china accounting for about 20 percent of the global gdp a 2 percentage point shortfall in annualized chinese gdp growthâ a distinct possibility in the first half of 2020â could knock approximately 0 5 percentage point off annualized world gdp growth during the first and second quarters of 2020 that could be problematic for a global economy that has already slowed into the danger zone indeed world gdp grew by just 2 9 percent in 2019 according to the imf s january 20 update only 0 4 percentage point above the widely accepted 2 5 percent global recession threshold with european industrial output beginning to weaken late last year and with the japanese economy contracting much more sharply than expected in the final period of 2019 due largely to the second installment of a consumption tax hike the global economy was not exactly on firm footing before the sharp disruption to the chinese economy all this means that covid 19 together with its collateral impacts on neighboring countries through supply chain and finished goods trade linkages could heighten financial market fears of global recession during the first half of 2020 staff members work on a production line that makes ultrasound machines at the ge healthcare plant in wuxi jiangsu province in east china on february 15 xinhua what is your perspective on the long term prospects of the chinese economy do you think this public health emergency will lead to the middle income trap for the country china faces many challenges in its daunting aspirations to push ahead on its twin centenary development goals the integrity of its public health system is necessary but not sufficient for china to stay the course it underscores the safety net constraint that has long encouraged fear driven precautionary saving by chinese households thereby inhibiting more vigorous growth in discretionary personal consumption the middle income trap is less about disease control and public health and more about the critical shift from imported to indigenous innovation this of course has become a major area of dispute in the trade conflict with the united states which strikes at the heart of many of china s most important pillars of technological prowess intellectual property rights technology transfer cyber security and access by china s leading technology companies such as huawei and zte to critical u s made components such as semiconductor chips the conflict with the united states has been an obvious and important wakeup call for china s aims to build a self sustaining culture of indigenous innovation there are many encouraging signs of extraordinary progress in achieving this objective over the past several years especially in key applications industries such as e commerce fintech life sciences and of course artificial intelligence the outbreak of covid 19 is a grim reminder that technological prowess is not an end in and of itself if china seizes the opportunity to convert newfound prowess in indigenous innovation into a higher quality growth experience complete with a state of the art public health system it will be much better positioned to avoid the long feared setbacks of the so called middle income trap copyedited by rebeca toledo

dear editor as an oil and gas producing nation guyana may face challenges that other oil and gas producing countries encountered in the early stages of development mitigating these risks is critical for the future prosperity of guyana and presents fertile ground for discourse nigeria is a relevant case study in this area before the discovery of oil nigeria s economic mainstay was the exportation of agricultural produce such as palm oil cocoa groundnuts cotton and other crops however as activities in the oil and gas industry expanded with the discovery of more hydrocarbon reserves the economic concentration of the country gradually shifted to crude oil exportation in many ways nigeria s economy was similar to guyana s six sisters economy today although nigeria attained the status of a major oil producing country by 1970 and was rated the seventh largest producer of crude oil in the world millions of nigerians still live in poverty today nigeria neglected smes to focus on oil exportation and paid a stiff price small and medium sized enterprises smes are the engine of growth that promote equitable development and the incubators of entrepreneurship individual creativity and innovation smes drive economic growth and development neglecting smes is a critical mistake according to the world bank 2019 smes provide significant economic activity in the private sector in high income and emerging economies and account for two thirds of employment with small firms contributing more to work in low income countries than high income countries in guyana more than 70 percent of the small and medium sized enterprises smes failed during the past five years with the most significant number of closures occurring in 2015 in 1994 smes in guyana represented 45 of the private sector manufacturing and there were several problems that impeded performance and productivity including the lack of finance for capital improvement the irregular power supply that hampered production the lack of modern machinery skills training high taxation and marketing deficiencies in 2019 the world bank identified similar constraints that impede sustained growth and prosperity in guyana these include taxes burdensome regulations an inadequately educated labour force and corruption are some problematic areas these problematic factors have had a negative impact on guyana s competitiveness in the global market space in a global competitiveness report 2015 2016 guyana ranked 121 out of 140 countries meanwhile singapore was ranked number one in global competitiveness in the 2019 gci report inefficient government bureaucracy lack of innovation and corruption are the most significant problematic factors affecting guyana s competitiveness these factors contribute to guyana s rank of 134 out of 190 countries in the ease of doing business ratings an oil bonanza will not make guyana more competitive globally or improve its rankings in global indexes without a strategic plan and the allocation of human and financial capital to find and implement sustained solutions to the problems improving guyana s competitiveness as a country is a significant area of concern renowned harvard professor michael porter s concept of competitiveness focuses on the prosperity created from the economic activities rather than inherited prosperity i e the exploitation of national resources depending on inherited success often becomes a powerful barrier against upgrading real underlining competitiveness guyana has been slow to develop the institutions and laws needed to govern the new oil industry and a recent political crisis has further delayed that process there is a paucity of data in the area of business discontinuance closure and factors that determine small and medium enterprise sme success in guyana although the definition of small business differs from country to country and from region to region small and medium companies are significant contributors to employment and growth in the caribbean and latin america dr minto coy a professor at the mona school of business and management at the university of the west indies noted that scholarly and practitioner communities pay insufficient attention to small businesses in the caribbean minto coy emphasised that five decades of scholarship in the caribbean focused on socio economic issues with inadequate attention to challenges that small businesses and entrepreneurship encounter in various categories these categories include financial support government policies programmes education and training research and development commercial infrastructure market openness physical infrastructure and cultural and social norms that are entrepreneurial factors that impact small businesses according to the global economic monitor gem there is no data for guyana in these categories for smes it will take prudent management of the oil revenues and the will to confront challenges crafting the appropriate policies and a serious effort to attract the human capital including the diaspora necessary to fill gaps and transform institutions organisational culture and behaviour in guyana for guyana to bring about transformational change to improve smes success competitiveness and innovation there must be an efficient collection of data that provides useful information to inform policy it is essential to establish a robust agency for mining sme data if guyana is to be competitive globally guyana needs to craft a national value proposition npv and a comprehensive small business development strategy to create a competitive advantage with oil revenue funding there should not be any constraints regards wayne forde
the economic refugees of old have been replaced by well placed people leaving or staying away from india s unattractive political economy tn ninan 22 february 2020 8 31 am ist montek singh ahluwalia in his non memoir backstage the story behind india s high growth years recounts how he and wife isher decided to return to india from washington 40 years ago giving up attractive careers at the world bank and international monetary fund imf montek joined government as an economic adviser in the finance ministry and isher joined a think tank they would have had modest salaries and below par government housing but they felt they were contributing to india s development process along the way they became the capital s power couple so life had its compensations other economists too came back around the same time some earlier and some later manmohan singh bimal jalan vijay kelkar shankar acharya rakesh mohan and so on they returned after studying at the best universities and working in plum jobs at international organisations they and others like them became the leading makers or influencers of economic policy for the next three or four decades rising like montek to high offices and enjoying good reputations plus of course the bungalows of lutyens delhi and social cachets that would not be available to them elsewhere the question that was posed earlier this week at the release of montek s book was why aren t people like them coming back today bag and baggage to set down roots here in india the ones who came more recently were clutching the green cards that gave them an escape hatch through which to return to green pastures arvind panagariya raghuram rajan arvind subramanian and other perfectly honourable gentlemen like them one answer is that india has always had economic refugees and they went where they could find jobs in west asia and singapore or a better education that would underwrite good careers many have done brilliantly heading global tech giants and winning nobel prizes but there is a darker side to the story although india is no longer the desperately poor country of the 1980s and 1990s having risen a few years ago to lower middle income status has ceased to be an economic prison like cuba and offers more career options with higher salaries vastly superior cars and consumer goods modern hospitals and new liberal arts colleges and the simple freedom to travel without signing p forms and getting eight dollars to take with you it seems to have become a less attractive country in which to live and work businessmen including some with recognisable names and faces are becoming overseas citizens they are investing more in other markets where life is simpler wealthy professionals with internationally marketable skills and degrees are also taking their money with them prompting the finance minister in her budget to introduce a tax on such money transfers they may be fleeing tax terrorism prodded by more limited economic opportunities than they had imagined or simply keeping one foot in india and another overseas because public discourse here has acquired a nasty edge and who knows what s coming next or perhaps it is just the air quality in our cities which is a deterrent whatever the reason the economic refugees of old have been replaced by well placed people leaving or staying away from india s unattractive political economy diplomats from under populated countries like australia and canada report a sudden increase in the number of indians seeking to emigrate the other question is should our economists look back with satisfaction or in anger to be sure there were high points like the reforms of 1991 the years of rapid growth a decade ago and transformation in sectors like telecom but we should not have waited till 1991 to launch the reforms as montek writes rajiv gandhi was warned by the imf chief in early 1988 that a crisis was building up but he did nothing the telecom revolution here was not special to india other countries too engineered dramatic improvements in tele density nor were india s years of rapid growth unique emerging markets as a whole grew at 7 9 per cent in 2004 08 forget china today india is being bettered in trade by bangladesh and vietnam and the thai baht is worth rs 2 25 it was half that in 1991 the print

stephen roach a senior fellow at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia in an interview with beijing review stephen roach a senior fellow at yale university and former chairman of morgan stanley asia shared his observations on the chinese economy under the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 epidemic an edited excerpt follows beijing review in recent interviews with chinese media outlets you expressed optimism on the prospects of the chinese economy and predicted a sharp rebound once the virus is under control where do you think the resilience of the chinese economy comes from stephen roach while the chinese economy has slowed to a virtual standstill in early 2020 due to the impacts of covid 19 this devastating disease should not impair the underlying strength of the chinese economy in my opinion that strength reflects four key economic transitions from investment and export led growth to consumer driven growth from manufacturing to services from surplus saving to saving absorption and using that drawdown of domestic saving to fund china s social safety net and boost discretionary household consumption and from imported to indigenous innovation as long as the government continues to focus its reform strategy on these key transitions once the virus runs its course which remains my strong expectation for the second half of 2020 these transitions in conjunction with recent stimulus actions by the people s bank of china pbc will play a decisive role in providing a strong post virus impetus to the chinese economy you were in china during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak what are the differences in the chinese economy today is it more resilient or more vulnerable compared to conditions prevailing in 2003 the chinese economy today is far bigger better balanced and more globally important in renminbi terms the chinese gdp is about seven times its size 17 years ago its share of the world gdp as measured by the international monetary fund s imf purchasing power parity metric currently stands at 19 7 percent fully 2 3 times the 8 7 percent share in 2003 at the same time it is less dependent on manufacturing as the secondary share of the chinese gdp fell from 45 6 percent in 2003 to 40 7 percent in 2018 while a surging service sector boosted the tertiary share of the economy by 10 percentage points from 42 percent in 2003 to 52 percent in 2018 with the broader world economy mired in an unusually anemic post crisis recovery since the global financial crisis of 2008 china s ongoing growth has accounted for fully 37 percent of the cumulative gains in global output since 2008 notwithstanding the serious short term disruptions associated with covid 19 today s rebalanced chinese economy is far more resilient than it was back in the sars days at the same time with the world far more dependent on china today than it was back then short term disruptions in the chinese economy are bound to have a more serious impact on global growth when china sneezes today s world is far more at risk of catching a bad cold than it was in 2003 workers make protective clothing at a factory in urumqi xinjiang uygur autonomous region in northwest china on february 14 xinhua what kind of measures do you think the government could take to facilitate an economic rebound at this point in time the highest priority for government policy must be virus containment addressing modern china s most serious public health emergency the economy comes second and fortunately for china it is strong enough to endure even this serious shock there is of course very little that traditional countercyclical policy measuresâ monetary and fiscal alikeâ can do to offset the severe economic pressures associated with quarantines and travel restrictions the actions taken thus far by the pbc are important to stabilize financial markets in the event of another sharp drop such as that which occurred on february 3 barring that possibility stimulus should add fuel to any post virus rebound in the economy with the pre virus chinese economy having slowed to a 27 year low of 6 percent growth in late 2019 china s policymakers are wise to err on the side of stimulus at the same time it would be imprudent to back away from the critical deleveraging campaign that has been such a high priority for the chinese leadership over the past three and a half years once the virus is contained the natural forces of recovery should take hold comparable to those that occurred in the aftermath of sars in 2003 by staying focused on public health imperatives and bringing covid 19 under control as soon as possible the chinese economy should be well positioned for a solid rebound in the second half of 2020 what impact do you think this outbreak will have on the global economy how would a chinese rebound help the world economy with china accounting for about 20 percent of the global gdp a 2 percentage point shortfall in annualized chinese gdp growthâ a distinct possibility in the first half of 2020â could knock approximately 0 5 percentage point off annualized world gdp growth during the first and second quarters of 2020 that could be problematic for a global economy that has already slowed into the danger zone indeed world gdp grew by just 2 9 percent in 2019 according to the imf s january 20 update only 0 4 percentage point above the widely accepted 2 5 percent global recession threshold with european industrial output beginning to weaken late last year and with the japanese economy contracting much more sharply than expected in the final period of 2019 due largely to the second installment of a consumption tax hike the global economy was not exactly on firm footing before the sharp disruption to the chinese economy all this means that covid 19 together with its collateral impacts on neighboring countries through supply chain and finished goods trade linkages could heighten financial market fears of global recession during the first half of 2020 staff members work on a production line that makes ultrasound machines at the ge healthcare plant in wuxi jiangsu province in east china on february 15 xinhua what is your perspective on the long term prospects of the chinese economy do you think this public health emergency will lead to the middle income trap for the country china faces many challenges in its daunting aspirations to push ahead on its twin centenary development goals the integrity of its public health system is necessary but not sufficient for china to stay the course it underscores the safety net constraint that has long encouraged fear driven precautionary saving by chinese households thereby inhibiting more vigorous growth in discretionary personal consumption the middle income trap is less about disease control and public health and more about the critical shift from imported to indigenous innovation this of course has become a major area of dispute in the trade conflict with the united states which strikes at the heart of many of china s most important pillars of technological prowess intellectual property rights technology transfer cyber security and access by china s leading technology companies such as huawei and zte to critical u s made components such as semiconductor chips the conflict with the united states has been an obvious and important wakeup call for china s aims to build a self sustaining culture of indigenous innovation there are many encouraging signs of extraordinary progress in achieving this objective over the past several years especially in key applications industries such as e commerce fintech life sciences and of course artificial intelligence the outbreak of covid 19 is a grim reminder that technological prowess is not an end in and of itself if china seizes the opportunity to convert newfound prowess in indigenous innovation into a higher quality growth experience complete with a state of the art public health system it will be much better positioned to avoid the long feared setbacks of the so called middle income trap copyedited by rebeca toledo
in a recent wall street journal article mary anastasia o grady writes that venezuela s national superintendency for the defense of socio economic rights is reportedly pressuring stores to accept the government s new digital fiat currency the petro the venezuelan government claims its digital currency which launched in early 2018 is backed one for one by a barrel of oil the petro is also intended to circulate at a fixed exchange rate with the bolívar soberano the latest iteration of venezuela s fledgling currency ms o grady quotes me summarizing some of the work i have done with josh hendrickson and thomas hogan which shows that a government can get its citizens to use its preferred money so long as it is sufficiently big or is willing to levy sufficiently large punishments but she leaves another question unanswered why would the venezuelan government prefer the petro stays alive three reasons stand out avoiding u s sanctions venezuela relies heavily on oil revenues according to opec oil revenues typically account for around 99 percent of venezuela s total export revenues and historically much of those oil exports have gone to the u s however its oil exports fell by a third in 2019 in large part because of economic sanctions levied by the u s to fully appreciate the nature of the problem it is useful to make a distinction between primary and secondary sanctions primary economic sanctions levied by the u s government prevent americans from purchasing oil from venezuela however the u s government has also announced that it will impose sanctions on anyone else trading with venezuela and these secondary sanctions have been pretty effective why are u s secondary sanctions so effective j p koning is certainly correct when he writes that most companies and countries do not want to risk losing access to u s markets but he probably goes too far in claiming this has very little to do with the u s dollar functioning as the world s reserve currency the u s government has a much easier time monitoring international transactions executed in u s dollars international transactions executed in u s dollars are typically cleared in a new york bank those banks know their customers and are obliged to hand over transactions data to the u s government when subpoenaed or if they suspect a crime is being committed related texas oil production to rise in 2020 despite lower prices if the international transaction is executed in some other currency like euros the information is a little more difficult for the u s government to access of course most european banks will refuse to clear the transaction as well since the u s government can require they hand over the relevant transactions data in which case they would be found to have violated sanctions by processing the transaction or they would lose access to u s markets on grounds of non compliance and since most international transactions are executed in u s dollars a european bank that cannot transfer money to and from u s banks will struggle to serve its international transactions making customers nonetheless the risk of detection is probably a little lower than it would be if the transaction were made in u s dollars and as a result the transaction is more likely to be executed the international financial plumbing has a lot of pipes running to and from the u s and that gives the u s a lot of power to levy sanctions not just on its own citizens but also on citizens and companies of other countries interested in international trade you can probably see where this is going if venezuela were able to create a parallel financial system one with no pipes going to and from the u s it could make and receive international transactions with even less risk of detection than is afforded by other national currencies like the euro ruble or renminbi that s where the petro comes in as a digital currency it enables one to send or receive funds virtually anywhere around the world and to the extent that those transactions are disconnected from the u s financial system they are much less likely to be detected by the u s government again the sanctions still apply but by conducting transactions in petros they are easier to get around why then does venezuela push the petro at home why not just require it for international transactions for one few will be willing to accept the petro if there isn t a very big market for petros hence by increasing the demand for petros at home venezuela makes it less risky for foreigners to accept them if only for a short period of time internal monitoring for international transactions the petro offers those interested in skirting u s sanctions some financial privacy not afforded by traditional cross border electronic transfers for internal transactions in contrast it almost certainly offers far less financial privacy than hand to hand currency as josh hendrickson and i explain in a recent working paper hand to hand currency cash affords a lot of financial privacy there are drawbacks to using cash to be sure cash does not bear interest it is easier to lose and easier to steal than balances held at a bank and less likely to be insured due to loss or theft it is more cumbersome for high valued transactions since one must carry many notes and odd amount transactions since one must provide the correct denominations and it typically requires the sender and receiver to be physically present in the same location when funds are transferred related u s administration discusses plan to oust venezuela s maduro but for relatively small local transactions where financial privacy is important cash is still king it is easy to imagine then why the venezuelan government might want to push its citizens to swap physical bolivares for digital petros even in the absence of international sanctions the petro makes it much easier to monitor transactions and punish those conducting transactions inconsistent with the prevailing government s objectives it is difficult to mount much opposition without funding and it is difficult to raise funds for an opposition movement if would be contributors worry they will be caught and punished by requiring petro use the maduro regime tightens its grip on power your inbox bottom of form cash shortages finally widespread petro use would presumably help venezuela with another one of its self inflicted problems cash shortages advertisement when the money supply i e cash and deposit balances increases as it tends to do quite rapidly in venezuela the purchasing power of that money falls as a result more cash is needed to make routine transactions but venezuela does not print its bolivares notes and for obvious reasons the private companies willing to crank out its ever increasing supply of bolivares notes are not willing to receive payment in bolivares this has led to some amusing headlines in april 2016 bloomberg reported that venezuela doesn t have enough money to pay for its money in july 2018 the economist reported that venezuelan cash is almost worthless but also scarce the reality on the ground is far from amusing though the inability to make routine transactions leads to a decline in production leaving ordinary venezuelans even poorer than they already were there are two solutions to this problem the first and probably more benevolent solution is to manage your money well in the absence of hyperinflation you don t have to continuously print up vast quantities of ever larger denomination notes but managing your money well first requires getting your fiscal house in order and that can be difficult to do when you are trying to maintain a populist winning coalition the second solution is to convert transactions executed in cash into those conducted with digital balances by reducing the reliance on cash in normal times you also reduce the absolute increase in demand for cash balances as the broader money supply increases in the limit where no one uses cash you eliminate the need to print notes altogether if the national superintendency for the defense of socio economic rights is successful in pressuring stores to accept the petro it would serve the maduro regime well by making it easier to avoid sanctions the petro enables the government to regain some of its lost oil revenues by making it easier to monitor domestic transactions the petro aids efforts to stamp out political opposition and by reducing the need to print up so many new notes during periods of hyperinflation the petro reduces the likelihood and magnitude of cash shortages alas in helping the maduro regime maintain power the petro seems unlikely to improve the lives of ordinary venezuelans by william luther via zerohedge com more top reads

the s p 500 is coming off one of the best years it s seen in decades the dow jones industrial average is knocking on the door of 30 000 after only 2 years in the 20 000 range and traders are unsure whether the party s ever going to end while there s no telling when the current rally might abate a large contingent of cautious traders has started the new year hedging some of the market s euphoria

broad market direxion daily s p 500 bull 3x shares etf spxl has shed a net 45 million in that same span as traders locked in profits from the index s stellar fourth quarter a big year for growth and debt the fact that 2019 was a huge year for price gains in both equity and debt instruments puts bullish and bearish traders alike in an interesting position while spxl ended the year up more than 100 direxion s two 3x fixed income etfs the direxion daily 7 10 year treasury bull 3x shares tyd and tmf finished 2019 up 16 77 and 38 respectively what s more they often moved inverse to the spxl usually seeing some of their biggest moves as equities fell the price action in 2019 is in part thanks to three consecutive interest rate cuts from the federal reserve aimed at encouraging borrowing and staving off recessionary threats like slow global growth and the u s china trade war while the cuts fueled borrowing among companies and enticed investors to maintain their exposures they also pushed bond yields lower across the board and buoyed the price of existing bonds that come with a more attractive rate what s more the grim global outlook in 2019 also prompted international investors to seek out the steady yield from u s treasury notes that although historically low come with a better yield than other government debt instruments that carry negative rates when uncertainty reigns although wall street is currently enraptured in another staggering rally the increasing interest in fixed income does hint at the potential for turbulence as 2020 gets underway that s because despite the improved performance of equity investments through the latter half of 2019 and the initial days of 2020 uncertainty still abounds about the resilience of the global economy most traders are already well aware of the high valuations and diminished outlook many companies have outlined for their upcoming fiscal year additionally the latest and most optimistic projections from the international monetary fund anticipate similar growth trends and risks that characterized 2019 including trade hazards and diminished growth from developed nations another emerging trend furthering the likelihood of increased volatility is currently playing out in the futures market specifically vix futures while cboe s volatility index has plotted a steady course to year lows february vix contracts surged into the new year and put the spread between january and february contracts at more than 4 points the options curve smooths over heading into march which itself represents another drastic shift in spreads that could cause a reverberation effect in the stock market in any case the high price for near term contracts puts the relative calm the market is seeing now into fairly stark relief these fundamental headwinds are capped off by an already raucous election year in the united states and the ongoing impeachment trial of the sitting u s president as that political chess match plays out the market may begin to fray at the edges especially as some candidates from the democratic side like sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren gain traction and cause anxiety on wall street for their extreme regulatory and economic proposals and president trump threatens to continue his policy of trade protectionism debt is king what do these obstacles mean for fixed income for the time being u s bonds and treasury notes remain the safest and highest yielding investment for institutional and international investors to hold while bond prices likely won t see the same kind of shot in the arm they did last year with the three interest rate cuts rates are also not likely to rise and push prices down that fact underlies the current market rally which has seen the s p 500 tack on 15 since the start of october despite few fundamental catalysts the point is there is a lot of optimism on wall street at the moment but at the edges there remain a lot of warning signs as well if
