labour 2001 2009 republican party member spouse mitch mcconnel b 1953 as we learned after president herbert hoover signed the smoot hawley tariff at the outset of the great depression vibrant international trade is a key component to economic recovery hindering trade is a recipe for disaster asa hutchinson governor of arkansas 2015 republican party member b 1950 importantly in the 1930s in the great depression the federal reserve despite its mandate was quite passive and as a result financial crisis became very severe lasted essentially from 1929 to 1933 ben bernanke economist chair of the federal reserve 2006 2014 republican party member b 1953 by david chapman the r word seems to be on the tongues of a number of economists on the other hand a number of economists scoff at the r word the r word is of course recession it has been 10 years since the last recession officially ended in june 2009 it was known as the great recession the longest official recession since the great depression and the steepest decline since the recession of 1945 ten years with no recession matches the 10 years with no recession between march 1991 and the march 2001 if there is no recession in july then this would become the longest uninterrupted period of growth since 1854 right now given the current economic signs no recession is expected to get underway this month yet there has been a frenzy of commentators saying the fed is going to cut rates in july offsetting that there has been no indication from the fed that they are about to cut rates what fed chair jerome powell said was that the central bank was prepared to act to sustain the economic expansion if president trump s trade war weakened the economy then on tuesday this past week powell did say that he is open to a rate cut that did it and after a rather poor may when the dow jones industrials dji fell 2000 points the market rebounded in a fury in all probability what is happening is a massive short squeeze on rumours of a rate cut some have noted that the stocks that had the highest short positions are leading the way higher nonetheless the market has gone into a rate cut frenzy bond yields fell and gold shot up as well his remarks sent stocks soaring as investors predicted a cut in interest rates of course at the june meeting they will discuss rates they always do but will they act we do not believe a rate cut is justified despite the headwinds from the current trade wars between the u s and china actually it is more than just china as trump goes after anybody that appears to annoy him his approach is to tell countries what he the u s government wants them to do and if they don t fall in line he raises tariffs places sanctions embargo and tries to cut them off from the u s dollar system but a rate cut today would send the wrong message and it would be a hint of panic on the part of the fed yes there has been a host of soft numbers the most recent u s manufacturing pmi in may fell to 50 5 the lowest reading since september 2009 new orders have also been falling the lowest since august 2009 the recent nonfarm job numbers were disappointing the lowest gain since february but they were still positive see commentary on jobs report the poor results were blamed on the bad weather and flooding that have plagued the midwest retail sales have softened but consumer sentiment is the highest in a year maybe they are just happy and don t need a third car to make them happier the stock markets have done nothing for the past year and half the s p 500 is currently around 2 875 in january 2018 the s p 500 topped at 2 870 the tsx composite is hovering around 16 240 in january 2018 the tsx composite topped at 16 421 the stock markets have been up and they have been down it has been a roller coaster since the peak in january 2018 the s p 500 fell 12 then went up 16 followed by another down 20 then whee right back up again almost 26 each high was slightly higher than the previous high and each low lower than the previous one as well in technical analysis we call this a broadening top we have labeled the chart abcde this particular labeling is to denote the broadening top and not an elliott wave count this market has come from a long way starting in march 2009 it is up 330 sounds spectacular except remember it has going up on record low interest rates combined with a massive amount of liquidity through quantitative easing qe if one injects 4 trillion into the market economy then something is sure to happen debt exploded adding to the massive injection of liquidity u s debt is up almost 24 trillion since 2008 globally debt has exploded upwards by roughly 100 trillion in the same period housing prices went up in canada markets in vancouver and toronto were in a bubble and now that bubble is cooling gold had a run from 680 to 1924 topping in 2011 a gain at the time of 183 gold is still up 95 from 2008 despite a rough time over the past 7 years antiquities rose art rose in fact everything went up no wonder they called it the everything bubble source www stockcharts com if the bottom of the channel holds any decline would be limited to a 24 fall from the may 2019 high the bottom of the channel is around 2 250 that is only slightly more than the decline from october 2019 to december 2019 but if the broadening top is correct the decline below the bottom of the channel tends to be at least equal to the breadth of the channel that could take the market down to around 1 650 for a decline of about 44 the good news is that is less than the 2007 2009 decline of 57 and the 50 drop of 2000 2002 however it is still potentially pretty serious the e wave may not yet be complete as the current up move could carry to the top of the channel near 3 000 but what has really happened in the u s gdp has averaged only 1 8 annually since 2009 with the best year being 2015 between 2002 and 2007 u s gdp averaged 2 4 annually the past decade has been the feeblest period of growth since the great depression global growth has been led by the asian economies particularly china but despite the growth and the huge price increase in the stock market not everyone has benefitted over the past decade the income share of the richest 10 is now over 50 the highest level since the 1920s and 1930s the same 10 also own 75 of the wealth source www stansberryresearch com the rich are getting richer high wage earners have seen their incomes rise 41 in real terms since 1980 middle income earners wages have stagnated rising only 6 while low income workers wages have actually declined in real terms losing 5 this scenario has played itself out in the western economies no wonder there has been a sharp rise in nationalism particularly nationalism that is also anti immigration the middle class the backbone of the western economies is being squeezed but the lower end is being squeezed right out hence the reason that a strong man has appeal it s happened before and it ended in ww2 the strong man in reality is a false prophet source economic policy institute www epi com www stansberryresearch com this is being played out against the backdrop of massive debt increase as long as the economy holds up the debt is manageable but if the economy starts to slide into a recession the debt becomes a time bomb household debt student debt corporate debt all have exploded in the past decade but none more so than government debt governments can write overdrafts the rest can t eventually they get called in in 2007 it started with bear stearns and ended with merrill lynch lehman brothers and aig the chinese banking system is overladen with debt much of it cannot be repaid china does not want a trade war it could push the debt and their banking system over the edge that in turn could see corporations go bankrupt resulting in a sharp rise in unemployment which in turn could trigger social unrest china s central bank pboc has considerable maneuverability compared to the fed but they can t bail out everybody mexico is highly vulnerable in a trade war because american companies have moved a considerable number of their operations there a trade war with mexico could trigger dislocations with these companies resulting in plants shutting down or even moving their operations back to the u s which is what trump wants that in turn could trigger considerable unrest in mexico an unstable mexico is far more dangerous for the u s s borders than the much smaller central american countries that are currently the source of migrants coming to the u s honduras guatemala el salvador the trade war also reverberates back into the u s with corporations facing reduced sales as they would have to pass on the cost of the tariffs to the u s consumer u s corporate debt is potentially more destabilizing than government and consumer debt some have estimated that there is upwards of 20 trillion u s dollars outside the u s if the faith in the u s is shaken then those dollars could suddenly be sent back as countries begin to see more value in their own currency or alternative currencies such as gold that could result in a considerable decline in the value of the u s dollar left out on all market commentaries is the potential cost of dealing with a host of natural disasters as a result of what many believe to be climate change hurricanes floods tornadoes wildfires and even earthquakes have a cost here in canada it was estimated that the wildfires that consumed fort macmurray cost 3 5 billion because of the frequency of floods that have hit areas in the past few years people are going to have to be moved buyouts are being offered and if you don t take them you are on your own in the next flood one could call them internal refugees the cost of moving them could be in the billions over the past two decades the hurricanes and wildfires that have hit have been more frequent and more deadly and more costly all good things eventually come to an end and time is running out on this rise sure there could be another run to new highs but it is against a deteriorating backdrop a recession is coming it is a question of when not if as we have written before with trade wars there are no winners everyone loses and right now we are locked in an unprecedented trade war that has not yet played itself out things could become more unpredictable the jobs report source www shadowstats com the u s nonfarm jobs numbers for may were a disappointment in canada it was a time to cheer u s nonfarm payrolls rose 75 000 in may the market had expected an increase of 175 000 the april nonfarm numbers were revised downward to 224 000 from 263 000 still the 2 month average was 150 000 the average for the past year is 162 000 may employment was up 0 9 over the past year the weakest growth since 2013 net of revisions the two months were essentially flat full time employment actually fell 83 000 while part time employment rose 66 000 it was the third consecutive monthly drop for full time employment the official unemployment rate u3 remained unchanged at 3 6 as did the labour force participation rate also unchanged at 62 8 in february the rate was 63 2 what that says is that fewer people are participating in the economy it also helps to lower the unemployment rate the u6 unemployment rate which includes discouraged workers and longer term unemployed but under one year came in at 7 1 down from 7 3 finally the shadow stats unemployment www shadowstats com came in at 21 1 down from 21 2 the shadow stats number is the u6 unemployment which is the highest level officially reported plus long term discouraged workers over one year and those defined not in the labour force in 1994 the number for those not in the labour force fell by 8 000 in may there are 96 215 thousand listed as not in the labour force of that 53 782 thousand are listed as retired while another 10 128 thousand are disabled canada posted another good jobs number with a gain of 27 700 in april the market expected only 8 000 the report however is tinged with a note of caution it appears that 61 500 jobs were listed as self employed the actual number of employees fell 33 800 self employed could translate as we can t find a job that we d really like to do so we ll say we are self employed however the number of hours worked dropped despite what appears to be a good jobs number on the surface when you look underneath it is not as good as reported that appears to be translated into the gdp numbers that have been weak for the past two quarters ontario once again produced the most jobs up 20 900 the question is how meaningful is it given the big jump in self employed the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since records have been properly kept in 1976 the rate came in at 5 4 vs 5 7 the previous month the labour force participation rate fell to 65 7 from 65 9 as the labour force participation rate falls it helps to lower the unemployment rate note that there remain 1 082 thousand unemployed markets and trends gains losses trends close dec 31 18 close jun 7 19 week ytd daily short term weekly intermediate monthly

stockcharts com attempting to figure out where we are is difficult particularly given the complexities of the wave structure since the market topped back in january 2018 this is just one interpretation we count five waves to a top in october 2019 the october december 2019 decline we have labeled wave 1 down or it could be an a wave we are currently working on the 2 or b wave once this wave is complete the market should have substantial decline for wave 3 or wave c down that wave most likely would be a multi year decline that would bottom somewhere between 2020 and 2022 we are sure there are other interpretations but this is our best for now source www stockcharts com with rumours of a rate cut in the background the markets soared this past week the s p 500 gained 4 4 the dow jones industrials dji was up 4 7 the dow jones transportations djt gained 4 1 and the nasdaq jumped 3 9 the small cap russell 2000 gained 3 3 interestingly the dow jones utilities dju continues to make new highs jumping 2 8 this past week however on friday the dju put in an outside reversal day after once again making new all time highs is that a signal that the dju is about to fall we ll keep an eye on the dju elsewhere the tsx composite gained a more subdued 1 2 while the small cap dominated tsx venture exchange cdnx fell 0 8 thus remaining in its rut the world msci index gained 1 2 in europe the london ftse 100 was up 2 6 following pm may s resignation the paris cac 40 was also up gaining 2 2 while the german dax was up 2 7 in asia china s shanghai index was battered by negative trade news and fell 2 5 while tokyo s nikkei dow also fell down 0 8 news that the u s and mexico found a deal to satisfy trump on the weekend should help propel the markets higher on monday that will squeeze the shorts even further the s p 500 has potential to rise to about 3 000 this time if that happens we will watch closely for divergences between the indices meaning some make new highs but not all the market is in a bit of a frenzy right now at the recent low sentiment had fallen under 12 bulls a sign that the market might be making a low in one week sentiment has jumped to 48 an extreme is noted when sentiment hits 90 or higher we appear to be entering a period of irrational exuberance and that never ends well source www stockcharts com it was interesting to note the action on some indicators this past week given the sharp jump in the stock markets the nyse advance decline line rose but has not yet made new highs however the nyse new highs minus new lows jumped sharply to the highest level it has seen since the mini bull began in december at 246 it is not far from 300 readings over 300 are rare and usually indicate a top however the indicator that didn t budge this past week was the mcclellan ratio adjusted summation index known as the rasi we ll keep an eye on this one because if the rasi fails to make new highs with the market it would be an important divergence we ll also watch the nyse advance decline line for new highs as well that indicator as we have noted before could be misleading the market that s something that happens rarely source www stockcharts com given the backdrop of rate cut frenzy it is not surprising that bond yields tumbled this past week prices that move inversely to yields moved higher the u s 10 year treasury note fell as low as 2 07 this past week closing at 2 09 that s the lowest level since september 2017 not surprisingly sentiment has hit over 90 bulls that is more indicative of a potential bottom in yields top in price the trouble is we don t know how that will play out a period of sideways movement would be enough to cool the high sentiment readings would we be surprised to see yields fall further no as we could fall to 2 05 or even lower given the current frenzy in the market right now regaining back above 2 20 would be mildly negative recession watch spread source www stockcharts com another frenzy the market has been in is bond and note yield spreads turning negative yes a number of yield spreads have turned negative we note 10 year 3 mth negative 19bp 10 year 3 mth libor negative 33bp 5 year 2 year flat 3 mth fed funds negative 4bp 2 year fed funds negative 8bp 10 year 3 mth libor negative 33bp however we note that the 10 year 2 year yield spread is positive 24bp another one worth watching is the 30 year 10 year spread it is positive 48bp both those spreads did go negative for a few months before the 2001 2002 recession and the 2007 2009 recession all the other spreads were admittedly much more all over the map and not as reliable indicators as the 10 year 2 year or even the 30 year 10 year yield spreads and the spreads need to go negative for at least 3 months before a recession our closely watched 10 year 2 year yield is not indicating a recession source www stlouisfed org recession what recession we would have expected high yield bond spreads to widen this past week given the frenzy over a rate cut and the potential for a recession instead the spreads went lower what me worried obviously not or spreads would have widened the spread fell from 4 47 o 4 42 this past week we will continue to monitor this source www stockcharts com all the frenzied talk of a rate cut sent the u s dollar lower this past week the us index lost 1 3 this past week the euro gained 1 5 the british pound was up 0 9 and the japanese yen gained a small 0 2 the canadian dollar leaped on the news of the jobs report on friday gaining 1 9 on the week the us index has fallen into a band of support that ranges from 96 to 97 the us index is currently in the middle of that range a breakdown under 96 would most likely send the us index down to the next support level of 94 80 to 95 a breakdown under 94 80 would signal that the major rally that got underway back in january 2018 was officially over currently the us index is approaching oversold levels the fact that it is the frenzy over a possible rate cut is not a solid reason for the us index fall seems to be sell the rumour we await buy the news a return and breakout over 97 50 would signal that the us index is prepared to resume its uptrend it is possible that the us index has topped the recent high at 98 26 barely met the minimum target of the ascending triangle that formed over the past several months that also could be a sign of failure a breakdown under 96 would signal that a new u s dollar bear is underway source www stockcharts com gold jumped this past week as the rate cut frenzy took hold gold was up 2 7 while silver jumped 3 2 platinum lagged even further gaining 1 2 while palladium considered more an industrial metal gained a small 0 7 copper fell on the week losing 0 4 gold hit a high this past week at 1 352 which was above the 1 350 high seen on february 20 2019 but rather than bust through that zone gold pulled back closing at 1 346 given that the u s appears to have a cut a deal with mexico to avoid tariffs it is possible that the u s dollar will rise on monday and gold will fall the 1 350 to 1 370 is extremely important for gold anyone that follows gold knows this is the zone of the highs since 2016 the high in july 2016 was 1 377 subsequent highs were seen in september 2017 at 1 362 april 2018 at 1 369 and the recent high in february 2019 at 1 350 if gold were to fail to hold this zone and were rejected then we could see another run down towards 1 250 and the 1 235 1 250 zone we had targeted previously for a final low before we take off on a new bull on the other hand if gold were to successfully charge through 1 370 and the july 2016 high of 1 377 then we would know for sure we are on our way higher to at least 1 400 to 1 550 the trouble is every gold bug follows this and they will all go bananas when it busts through 1370 to 1 377 what s key however is that above 1 400 the institutions should start to get in and the junior exploration stocks will finally show some signs of life currently we don t believe managed futures and the hedge funds are fully in the recent move appears to have happened too fast usually these types of moves are not sustainable as they are based more on speculation than they are based on any fundamental shifts we notice stocks were not responding at the end of the week as gold went higher this may be a divergence that also bears watching especially if gold pulls back source www cotpricecharts com if we are to take the commercial cot seriously then we must pay attention to the latest the commercial cot for gold fell to 30 from 39 this past week on the other hand the large speculators cot managed futures hedge funds etc leaped to 74 from 64 the highest level seen in months the commercial cot is signaling that gold should fall in the near term in one fell swoop the commercial cot is down at levels last seen in january 2019 just before gold topped the commercial cot has suddenly turned bearish source www stockcharts com silver like gold enjoyed a good week this past week gaining 3 2 silver appears to have broken out of a descending wedge triangle the descending wedge triangle projects silver to rise back to the recent highs just over 16 silver rose into a zone of resistance with the 50 100 and 200 dma the 100 day ma is just above 15 20 a break above that level could take silver to 16 and higher only a return back below 14 85 could see silver once again test down towards 14 source www cotpricecharts com the silver commercial cot fell to 47 this past week down from 50 unlike the gold commercial cot the drop this past week is not that bearish the silver commercial cot is still bullish what we don t want to see is for the commercial cot continue to maneuver lower this past week long open interest fell almost 5 000 contracts while short open interest rose around 9 000 contracts the large speculators cot rose to 47 from 43 this indicator while weakening is still not particularly bearish silver could well start to outperform gold going forward source www stockcharts com the gold stocks enjoyed a strong up week as gold and silver rose as a result of the frenzy surrounding rate cuts the tsx gold index tgd rose 4 7 and is now up 6 8 on the year while the gold bugs index hui was up even more gaining 7 6 on the week the hui is now up 5 2 on the year however despite a rise in gold prices again on friday the gold stocks were decidedly moody the tgd fell 0 8 both the tgd and the hui have seen their rsis above 70 usually a danger zone but oversold conditions can remain in place for some time especially in a strong bull market despite the run up the tgd remains just short of the march high of 204 78 the breakout on the triangle suggested a target of 210 with potential to rise to 232 friday s action appeared to indicate at least a pause to the sharp rise there is considerable support down to 190 the entire 200 210 zone is resistance a breakout above 210 215 would suggest a move to 232 or higher source www stockcharts com wti oil finally managed an up week gaining 0 9 it helped that both russia and saudi arabia once again talked of supply cuts to help boost the price of oil we had previously noted that there was good support down to 50 but below that level a strong test of the december lows at 42 would take place volume was quite strong on the recent drop indicating that this was no weak bear move down the market appears to be shrugging off the posturing of the u s vs iran despite the rhetoric and troop buildup in the persian gulf there is little expectation that the u s is going to attack iran quite simply iran is not iraq it has a strong army and decent weaponry although they are clearly inferior to the u s it is a large country compared to iraq and while there are internal problems between the regime and the people if invaded the people will come together to thwart any invasion as well the iraq government has given support to the regime in tehran that would open another front in iraq the u s has moved people out the energy stocks managed to find some stability as well this past week given the recent sharp drop the u s oil gas index xoi gained 3 0 but the tsx energy index ten failed to follow losing 2 4 wti oil has considerable resistance up to 55 and 56 so our expectations are low for a sudden rebound here a consolidation is more likely chart of the week source www armstrongeconomics com i confess i love this chart it has a striking resemblance to the chart on the next page quite simply they are pictures of a currency slowly becoming worthless no it does not happen overnight not only does it take years but it takes centuries the decline of the roman silver denarius stretched from before 280 bc to 500 ad a period of nearly 8 centuries the chart on the u s dollar below only goes from 1774 to 2012 it is probably lower today a period of only about two and half centuries could it be possible that we have devalued the value of the u s dollar faster than the romans devalued the silver denarius the real decline in the value of the silver denarius came after 180 ad and death of marcus aurelius 161 180 succeeding emperors moved to cutting the amount of silver in the denarius the emperor caracalla 198 217 introduced the antoninianus in 215 it was worth roughly 2 denarii even though the silver content was actually only worth about 1 5 denarii the iberian silver mines were running out and the emperors needed the silver to pay their armies and buy loyalty following the death of marcus aurelius the empire soon fell into chaos with usurpers seizing the throne and in one instance a senator buying the throne didius julianus march to june 193 the emperor maximinus 235 238 declared simply that all wealth belonged to the state society began to break down and people began to hoard money as the economy went underground there were attempts at reform but the silver content in the antoninianus kept falling until it was just bronze by the late 3rd century further attempts at reform were made but that all generally failed by the end of the fifth century money became essentially worthless with the exception of the gold solidus that had replaced the gold aureus collapse of the u s dollar monetary system source www goldchartsrus com will the u s dollar eventually meet the same fate as the roman silver denarius we don t wish to speculate but the fall has been nothing short of spectacular there are more and more u s dollars floating around the world but what a dollar will purchase has fallen sharply since the fed was formed in 1914 the second fall came in 1934 when gold was confiscated and the u s dollar was devalued with gold being revalued upwards to 35 ounce from 21 67 ounce since the end of the gold standard in august 1971 the purchasing power of the u s dollar has fallen precipitously more and more dollars are needed to make a purchase significantly debt also exploded following the end of the gold standard and defense spending went skywards to pay for the ongoing u s wars sound familiar it rings with the need for the roman emperors to pay their armies as the third fourth and fifth centuries were ones of constant warfare the loss of purchasing power for the u s dollar is best illustrated with the chart below that shows the purchasing power of the u s dollar vs gold for many years the price of the u s dollar was relatively stable and 1 000 would buy you more than 50 ounces of gold not any more today us 1 000 would only purchase roughly 0 75 ounces of gold canadian 1 000 would buy you even less given a rate of cdn 1 us 0 745 cdn 1 000 would buy only about 0 59 ounces of gold collapse of the u s dollar monetary system source www goldchartsrus com despite years of quantitative easing qe and record low interest rates coupled with easy monetary policy economic growth is roughly 20 below the where it was before the financial collapse of 2008 more and more dollars are thrown at the economy yet all it has generated is lower growth and massive debt and like the roman emperors of the third century governments are looking for money through their agencies the irs cra facta and fintrac does

2018 was the 150th anniversary of the tuc and the 70th anniversary of the trade union advisory committee to the oecd as part of the celebration of these achievements the tuc s economics and social affairs department organised an event lessons from the great financial crisis on 12th november 2018 the day after armistice day and 100 years after the ending of the first world war several speakers including ex prime minister gordon brown were invited to address the gathering of trades unionists thought leaders and economists below is a transcription of ann pettifor s contribution introduction few people will have heard of thomas lamont that is regrettable as he bears considerable responsibility for the failure of europe to recover after the first world war more on that below after the crisis of 2007 9 his successors on wall st lobbied heavily for no change after that crisis they bear considerable responsibility for the failure to learn the lessons of that crisis thanks to their lobbying and to the mystique that surrounds the activities of both wall st and city of london while there was some tinkering at the margins there was no fundamental change made to the international financial architecture and system to learn lessons from the great financial crisis we must tell ourselves the correct story about how we got here that is difficult because as rana foroohar of the financial times argues financialisation is the least studied and least explored reason behind our inability to create a shared prosperity getting the story of financialisation right is difficult the opaque and complex activities of the finance sector are designed to obscure the very nature of money as an intangible social construct renders finance and financialisation invisible to the public but if we are to learn lessons from the crisis and prevent future crises we must tell ourselves the correct story of how we got here so how did we get here and where are we now gordon brown reminded us earlier guardian article and again this morning that we are in a leaderless world the cooperation that was seen in 2008 would not be possible in a post 2018 crisis both in terms of central banks and governments working together that is largely true except in one respect where there has been leadership and consistent international coordination since 2009 by the world s central bankers they have since the crisis taken historically unprecedented and carefully coordinated action to bail out the private finance sector this was done by absorbing about 15 trillion of the finance sector s sometimes toxic assets bonds on to their balance sheets in exchange for liquidity or central bank money qe by these actions central bankers have made it possible for the private finance sector to repair their own balance sheets and to use the liquidity to engage in further speculative activity their international coordination saved the finance sector but not the world despite this bailout of the finance sector and because no structural changes were made to the international financial system we are sleepwalking into the next financial crisis as brown warned back to 1919 reviewing the last 100 years of monetary theory and policy yesterday people around the world commemorated the ending of the first world war we do that because to understand how we got here it helps to review the past and to place our present predicament in a wider context commemorations of one hundred years since the signing of the armistice at the end world war provides a useful starting point for reviewing the evolution of the financial system i choose to begin the financial story in 1919 and to locate it in paris at the palace of versailles it was there that victorious allies negotiated the notorious peace treaty of that year john maynard keynes a member of the british delegation played a key role in the negotiations as eric rauchway documents in his book the money makers 2015 rauchway paints a vivid picture of the streets of paris on may day 1919 at the height of the negotiations the city s workers had agreed to a general strike and to these squares they came on behalf of the revolutionary ideals of 1919 some signed their names to cards saying they were striking for an eight hour day for a just peace and for an end to the allies ongoing military expedition to russia where the us the uk and france had sent soldiers to fight against the red army socialism certainly propelled some workers into the paris streets that day they took to the streets of the city in the name of socialism but they were also demanding what they thought they had just fought a war for better working conditions and a just and lasting peace from around the city came the sounds of gunshots and ambulances after the fighting stopped diplomats who ventured into the streets had to step over or around bodies while the streets of paris were chaotic there was turmoil in germany the humiliation of the armistice signing had led to a naval uprising the forced abdication of the german kaiser and to the election of revolutionary councils by then too the bolsheviks were firmly entrenched in russia keynes was well aware of the dangers posed to capitalism at this pivotal moment in economic history to prevent further bloodshed and violence and to block the emergence of bolshevik style governments in europe it was necessary he believed to resolve debts and to restore employment incomes and economic stability to europe he set about producing a simple but nevertheless revolutionary plan for the rehabilitation of europe it was a back of an envelope plan constantly checked and amended as he improved his understanding of german and allied economies assets and liabilities central to his plan was his understanding of money as a social technology rather than real exchange based on barter the problem he addressed was this the germans owed the british money but had no capacity to pay nor capital to invest in reconstruction of those assets that would generate income for repayments of debts the british owed the americans money but they too had no capacity to pay unless the germans paid which they could not his plan can be briefly summarised as follows germany would issue 1 billion in bonds the bonds would pay 4 this would enable the the prostrate reich to use the bond market to raise finance to pay most of what it owed in reparations and debt there would be a 1 sinking fund to retire repay the principal by 1925 70 of the money raised would go to reparations 30 was for reconstruction the bonds would have priority over all other german obligations enemy nations would guarantee them jointly severally the us uk and france would guarantee 20 each the league of nations would impose penalties or foreclosure if germany defaulted the bonds would be acceptable as payment between allied governments and as first class collateral at central banks in other words they could act as a form of inter governmental currency or money backed not by gold but by the economic strength of allied nations in this sense keynes s idea was revolutionary the first step in the abandonment of the gold standard but keynes was thinking even more ambitiously he hoped that in the future the allied backed bonds would form the basis of a new international reserve currency the germans could use the bonds to raise finance for debt repayment and reconstruction the french could use the bonds to pay debts to the british and the british could use them to pay debts to the americans his plan included provisions for other central powers and new nations to issue similar bonds similarly secured by richer allies a revolutionary plan the key point of the scheme for the rehabilitation of european credit and for financing relief and reconstruction was this it re designed and reconceptualised the world s economic and financial architecture it proposed a new international financial order based not on bars of gold but on economic strength and publicauthority it was a plan that would permit domestic economies to be restored to stability and prosperity within a sound and very necessary international framework his scheme was a radical departure from the architecture of the gold standard that fantastic machinery of global self regulation by international bankers and financiers a system in which the invisible hand played a pivotal role in cross border capital mobility in the allocation of finance and in determining interest and exchange rates in other words a system that stripped democratically elected policy makers of the monetary tools and powers needed for the management of their economies the revolutionary element of keynes s plan was that it replaced a system governed by the private authority of financial markets with one governed by the public authority of states he sent his proposal to the british treasury and to the prime minister david lloyd george they enthusiastically backed the scheme and proposed it to their allies including president wilson of the united states the president rejected the proposal outright for fear it was said the americans might be left holding the bag keynes agreed that might indeed be so but america could afford to bear the cost of recovery it had not incurred foreign debts to finance the war and had profited immensely from the war thanks both to foreign lending by wall st but also from increased munition exports to warring europeans furthermore if the american economy was to remain buoyant then it was vital for american goods to find export markets abroad and for those sales to be financed unbeknown to keynes but recently revealed by rauchway wilson s letter of rejection was not by his own hand but was drafted by the chief executive of j p morgan thomas w lamont described in his biography as the ambassador of wall st when wilson seemed to write about the desirability of postwar lending going through the usual private channels it was the voice of the usual private channels speaking about its own desirability lamont objected to any proposal that prioritised allied backed bonds over all other obligations meaning private bank bonds his bank j p morgan had massively expanded its foreign lending to governments during world war l and could not risk repayment of those bonds being subordinated to publicly backed bonds the consequence of the american decision to reject keynes s scheme were to be catastrophic and as the years passed must have caused him great personal as well as professional anguish the fantastic free market machinery of the gold standard was restored followed by bouts of credit inflation and debt deflation the 1920s and 30s witnessed mass unemployment and industrial unrest post war industrial production in the usa peaked in january 1920 as the economy moved into a major depression with production levels dropping by 32 5 by march 1921 after the 1920 21 bust wall st bankers financed the roaring twenties boom and the massive inflation of debt this was followed by a debt deflation the wall st crash and the great depression in europe economic instability unemployment deflation and austerity led to the rise of fascism and culminated in a devastating world war worldwide there were further consequences monetary hegemony passed to the united states central banks were made independent of political authority capital markets were liberalized high real rates of interest prevailed and the uk was burdened by a colossal and crippling war loan of 2 billion issued at 5 thankfully the agony was extinguished in britain in 1931 when britain s national government ramsay macdonald suddenly abandoned the gold standard then in 1933 on the first night of his inauguration president roosevelt began dismantling the american gold standard the consequence of these decisions was that both britain and the united states turned away from austerity deflation and the threat of nationalism and fascism and embraced a monetary system based on public authority policy autonomy and democracy germany and italy embarked on a different path one that was to lead to fascism and world war bretton woods the revival of the revolutionary scheme of 1919 at the end of the war in 1944 roosevelt convened a conference of economists from all over the world europe latin america russia india and africa he insisted that bankers be excluded from their deliberations at a special venue the bretton woods hotel in hampshire usa the scheme that emerged from bretton woods was a bastardised version of keynes s 1919 scheme while markets in capital and goods were to be managed there was to be no jointly backed asset to serve as a reserve currency instead the us dollar alone was made dominant keynes made a proposal for an international clearing agency central bank that would be jointly backed by the government bonds of its member countries it would undertake the role of debiting and crediting payments between countries and setting these against countries reserve accounts in addition to clearing the central bank would have powers to discipline countries that built up surpluses or deficits in the event keynes s proposal was abandoned and the bretton woods system made dependent on a single national central bank the us federal reserve while the dollar was to become the world s reserve currency this had the effect of transferring global savings to the united states 1945 1971 nevertheless the imperfect and for keynes disappointing bretton woods system ushered in a new more stable international monetary architecture for a period until the 1960s and the creation by the city of london of the eurodollar market the bretton woods regime subordinated the finance sector to the interests of domestic economies and to public authority most importantly it permitted countries the policy autonomy needed to aim economic policy at full employment from bretton woods the marshall plan evolved and this in turn led to the establishment of the trades union advisory committee at the oecd whose 70th anniversary we are commemorating today the bretton woods era became to be understood as a golden era of tranquillity in international capital markets to quote barry eichengreen and peter h lindert west germany experienced the economic miracle that led unemployment to fall to 0 5 in 1966 it was the era of high economic growth in japan and les trente glorieuses the 30 glorious years in france in the english speaking world this period was and is still known by both keynes s friends and enemies as the golden age of economics it was an age in which the welfare state expanded with pension schemes national health insurance unemployment insurance etc it was also a period of strong productivity growth when living standards improved year after year 1971 2007 the new era of debt inflation and deflation bretton woods was followed by the gradual restoration of the fantastic free market machinery of the inter war years this was predictably followed by a period of renewed inflation and deflation from 1971 2007 in august 1971 president nixon had unilaterally dismantled the bretton woods international financial architecture some economists argue that this was at the time the biggest debt default in history as the us reneged on its obligation to repay its debts in gold and instead offered its creditors greenbacks the imf whose staff were not consulted about the nixon decision was given the task of rebuilding the international system it failed to come up with a plan no international financial architecture was put in place of bretton woods from thereon the us treasury bill bond served almost by default as the world s reserve currency in future the world was to be governed by the fantastic machinery of free markets in capital goods and services cross border capital flows were made mobile self regulation by commercial bankers and subsequently shadow bankers led to a massive expansion of credit at high real rates of interest keynes abandoned in the uk the bank of england began the deregulation of credit creation lifting lending ceilings and removing limits on interest rate setting the 1971 regime competition and credit control widely known as all competition and no control provided the framework for deregulation this led to excessive credit creation which coupled with the decision to a system of exchange rate flexibility led to the 1970s price inflation in 1956 post war inflation had peaked at 7 but for most of the bretton woods years it remained subdued turning negative at the end of the 50s the gradual deregulation of the finance sector under first the labour chancellor roy jenkins followed by the city of london s opening up of the eurodollar market in the late 60s led to a rise in inflation but it was after competition and credit control was put in place under the conservative chancellor anthony barber that inflation took off in september 1971 inflation had risen by almost 10 in august 1975 it rocketed to 27 blaming keynes and workers for inflation ever since then both keynes and trade unions have been blamed for the 1970s inflation that is nothing less of a calumny one that has succeeded spectacularly it has displaced and discredited keynes s monetary theories and policies for the management of capital flows interest rates and credit creation and it has succeeded in redefining keynesianism as fiscal stimulus note that keynes s preoccupations are reflected in the title of his great work the general theory of employment interest and money not a theory of tax and spend regrettably the labour movement itself regularly takes on responsibility for the inflation of that period while steadfastly ignoring the activities of the largely opaque finance sector john evans previously secretary of the tuac has argued that at the time the tuc was having to grapple with demands for wage rises of 32 in 1975 but while demands for wage rises were inflationary they were a reaction to the rise in price inflation to 26 caused by too much money chasing too few goods and services coupled with rises associated with the fall in sterling brought on by exchange rate flexibility so while there can be no doubt that union wage demands exacerbated inflation they were not causal financial deregulation as it had done in the 20s and 30s was causal of credit debt inflation which in turn inflated asset values wages and prices the consequences were to be made clear much later in the 2007 9 crisis by 2010 when it peaked private debt in the uk had risen from under 60 of gdp in 1980 to 200 of gdp the modern era of fantastic free market machinery after the collapse of bretton woods central bank rates rose and were to be used by public authorities as the sole monetary instrument with which to target both inflation and the exchange rate mobile capital markets were given a free hand to pressure and determine both exchange rates and a nation s bank rate rates for commercial bank lending were left to the whim of the invisible hand the result was a dramatic rise in the riskiest lending by commercial bankers risky loans commanded the highest rates and were therefore the most profitable regulators effectively shrugged their shoulders complacently arguing that the invisible hand of the market could be relied upon to discipline bankers for excessive lending sub primers were to prove them catastrophically wrong in 2006 7 and of course as elsewhere in the world the economic goal posts had been moved from full employment to the oecd s plan for essentially exponential growth after 1973 bankers embarked on a huge international loan boom to countries in latin america africa and asia periodic debt inflations were then followed by debt deflations there were recurring financial crises and private bank bailouts largely engineered through the imf and world bank these crises began on the periphery of the global economy but then gradually moved towards the core the anglo american economies as was typical of the 1920s and 30s the deregulation of credit creation at high real rates of interest led initially to a massive debt inflation to the non payment of debts and to a debt deflation the system imploded on 8 august 2007 when inter bank lending froze and the credit crunch began the crisis culminated in the bankruptcy of lehman s bank in september 2008 the global financial crisis led to an era of lost growth and ensuing recession estimated at over 10 trillion more than one sixth of global gdp in 2008 2009 became the first year on record where global gdp contracted in real terms between 2007 and 2009 unemployment worldwide rose from 164 million to 188 million between the first quarter of 2008 2008 q1 and 2009 q2 the uk s gdp shrunk by more than 6 the number of unemployed in uk rose from 1 6million in 2008 to almost 2 7million in late 2011 austerity in 2010 nipped a nascent recovery in the bud gdp only reached pre crisis levels in 2013 q3 this led to the slowest uk recovery from recession in over 300 years lessons were not learned from the crisis instead policy makers resorted to the deflationary policies of the 1930s monetary radicalism was coupled with fiscal conservatism quantitiative easing and negative real rates of interest led to a massive expansion of central bank largesse in the form of liquidity which in turn inflated debt and asset prices global debt rose by over 8 trillion in the first quarter of 2018 to more than 247 trillion or 318 of gdp that was almost double the level of debt which imploded and caused the crisis of 2007 9 at that time global debt stood at 142 trillion and at 269 of gdp according to mckinsey fiscal contraction and austerity transferred the burden of adjustment on to those innocent of the crisis the 99 this in turn led to rising inequality popular unrest and the rise of nationalisms around the world and even fascism in parts of europe ten years after the crisis europe and much of the world are experiencing social insurrections and political crises reminiscent of the inter war years the 1920s and 30s quantitative tightening as this goes to press central bankers are again coordinating this time around a process of quantitative tightening or normalisation as it is framed by its adherents this involves shrinking central bank balance sheets by dumping assets bonds purchased at the height of the crisis back into capital markets this has the effect of lowering the price of these assets securities or bonds and increasing their yield tightening by the us s federal reserve is leading to a strengthening of the dollar and to a rise interest rates which in turn is destabilising the currencies of emerging dollar indebted markets such as argentina turkey and south africa higher interest rates aimed at vast bubbles of debt pose a real threat to the global economy as they render debt unpayable in this sense the fed is repeating the errors of the both the gold standard era and the greenspan era between 2003 6 the fed had steadily raised interest rates intending to take away the punchbowl from financiers drunk on debt instead higher rates took the form of a dagger aimed at and then bursting a vast bubble of debt so no madam chair we have not learned the lessons of history or of the last financial crisis and john maynard keynes s monetary theories and policies for a stable international financial framework aimed at international recovery based on public not private authority have been firmly killed off by thomas

published monday 10 june 2019 print disqus by ed steer yesterday in gold silver platinum and palladium the gold price drifted quietly lower almost from the open of trading in new york at 6 00 p m edt on thursday evening with its low tick of the day coming at or shortly after the 2 15 p m afternoon gold fix in shanghai it wandered higher without much conviction until the noon silver fix in london and then began to head higher from there the price really took off at 8 30 a m in new york when the less than happy job numbers hit the tape jpmorgan et al were there in an instant as the dollar index cratered at the same moment from that point it was held in a tight grip until the afternoon gold fix was put to bed in london and then it rallied some more but a minute or so after 10 30 a m edt da boyz slammed all four precious metals lower and that engineered price decline lasted until shortly after 3 p m in after hours trading the price managed to rally a few dollars after that before trading sideways into the 5 00 p m close the low and high ticks for gold were recorded by the cme group as 1 334 30 and 1 352 70 in the august contract gold was closed in new york on friday at 1 339 90 spot up only 5 10 on the day net volume was enormous once again at just under 321 000 contracts and there was just under 12 500 contracts worth of roll over switch volume in this precious metal the silver price didn t do much of anything in far east trading on their friday and volumes were noticeably on the light side the price pattern starting at the london open was a carbon copy of what happened with gold so i shan t bother with the rest of the play by play but the high tick in silver back over 15 briefly came at the same precise moment as the high tick in gold the low and high in this precious metal was recorded as 14 84 and 15 15 in the july contract silver was closed at 14 97 spot up 10 cents from thursday net volume in silver was very heavy once again at just over 86 500 contracts and there was a pretty healthy 21 500 contracts worth of roll over switch volume out of july and into future months the platinum price didn t do much of anything in far east trading on friday either but began to crawl lower starting shortly after 10 a m cest in zurich the low came on the jobs report number dollar index crash at 8 30 a m in new york its ensuing rally was also capped by jpmorgan et al at the same time as silver and gold and it was sold lower until shortly after 11 30 a m in new york trading it gained a couple of dollars of that back by 1 p m edt and then traded ruler flat into the 5 00 p m close platinum was closed at 806 spot up 4 dollars on the day the price pattern in palladium was mostly the same as it was for platinum including the price capping shortly before 10 30 a m in new york it was sold lower until 1 p m in comex trading and didn t do much of anything after that palladium was closed at 1 338 spot up 6 bucks from thursday the dollar index closed very late on thursday afternoon in new york at 97 04 and opened down 3 basis points once trading commenced at 7 45 p m edt on thursday evening it crawled higher from there at glacial speed and the 97 18 high tick was printed at precisely 11 00 a m bst in london the index crawled lower from there until the job numbers were released at 8 30 a m in washington and the result was the most spectacular waterfall decline i ve seen in anything in years those gentle hand s were at battle stations and managed to turn it higher at the 96 46 mark at 10 50 a m edt they didn t get it higher by much and from that juncture it chopped quietly sideways until trading ended at 5 30 p m the dollar index finished the day at 96 54 down 50 basis points from its close on thursday there s no telling how far the dollar index would have fallen nor how high the precious metals would have risen if the ppt hadn t been working overtime in all markets yesterday including the equity markets here s the dxy chart from bloomberg and the waterfall decline should be admired as it s a beauty click to enlarge and here s the 5 year u s dollar index chart courtesy of the folks over at thestockcharts com internet site the delta between its close 96 49 and the close on the dxy chart above was 5 basis points on friday click to enlarge the gold shares gapped up about two percent at the open but ran into selling right away that selling pressure continued for most of the remainder of the friday session and the hui actually closed down 0 18 percent it was the same for the silver equities but they didn t suffer the same ignominy as the gold stocks as they managed to squeeze a positive close as nick laird s intraday silver sentiment silver 7 index closed up by 0 34 percent click to enlarge if necessary and here s nick s 1 year silver sentiment silver 7 index chart updated with friday s doji click to enlarge as well i had a brief chat with keith neumeyer the grand poobah over at first majestic silver yesterday afternoon and i asked him about the short position in his company s shares and why the precious metal equities were performing so poorly his answer shocked me although it shouldn t have he says that this happens on all rallies in the silver stocks as all the same people that are short the metal in the comex futures market short the shares as the rally progresses knowing full well that precious metal prices are going to be hammered lower in the not very distant future so not only are they making a killing in the futures market their cleaning up in the silver and gold stocks as well including gdx and if you re looking for proof all you have to do is look at the share price action in the hui and the silver 7 index since monday with friday s price action being the perfect poster boy for that here are a couple of charts from nick that show what s been happening for the week month and year to date the first one shows the changes in gold silver platinum and palladium for the past trading week in both percent and dollar and cents terms as of their friday closes in new york along with the changes in the hui and the silver 7 index here s the weekly chart what a difference a week makes it s green across the board and the only reason that the precious metal stocks particularly the silver equities have performed so poorly is that there is active shorting going on as per my conversation with keith neumeyer just above click to enlarge the month to date chart is the same as the weekly chart as the month is only one week old so i won t bother posting it as the numbers are identical on both here s the year to date chart and it s much improved the fact that jpmorgan holds a current death grip on silver is obvious in this chart and that s certainly reflected in the state of the silver 7 index plus the active shorting going on currently platinum is barely above unchanged but that s because da boyz have been engineering its price lower over the last three weeks click to enlarge as i ve pointed out in this space over the last few weeks and again today the shorting of the precious metal equities mostly silver will certainly be rocket fuel during the next big rally in that precious metal with gold overbought i expect a correction of some type in the not too distant future but it will only prove to be a temporary setback daily delivery report showed that 2 gold and 1 silver contracts were posted for delivery within the comex approved depositories on tuesday i won t bother expanding on these tiny amounts but if you wish to look the link to yesterday s issuers and stoppers report is the cmeshowed that 2 gold and 1 silver contracts were posted for delivery within the comex approved depositories on tuesday i won t bother expanding on these tiny amounts but if you wish to look the link to yesterday sis here one thing i did notice in the above report was that jpmorgan issued 250 palladium contracts from its own account for delivery on tuesday there were ten long stoppers in total with jpmorgan picking up 49 contracts for its client account so far in the june delivery month just one week old only 361 gold plus 309 silver contracts have been delivered june is not a typical delivery month in silver and gold deliveries for june are proceeding very slowly with a huge number of short issuers exiting their short positions once called upon for delivery for physical gold that they most likely didn t have the cme preliminary report for the friday trading session showed that gold open interest in june fell by 24 contracts leaving 1 258 still around minus the 2 mentioned a few brief paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that 9 gold contracts were actually posted for delivery on monday so that means that 24 9 15 more gold contracts vanished from the june delivery month silver o i in june declined by 1 contract leaving 4 left minus the 1 contract mentioned two paragraphs ago thursday s daily delivery report showed that zero silver contracts were posted for delivery within the comex approved depositories on monday so that means that 1 silver contract disappeared from the june delivery month for the second time this week and the second since wednesday there was a withdrawal from gld as an authorized participant removed 37 748 troy ounces there were no reported changes in slv once again i don t know if these counterintuitive withdrawals are masking large deposits on those same days or not but as ted mentioned in yesterday s column both etfs are owed physical metal so it s a given that the authorized participants in both these etfs are now shorting the shares in lieu of depositing physical metal that makes it even more obvious that physical gold and silver in any size is just not available and i know that ted will certainly have something to say about all this in his weekly review this afternoon there was no sales report from the u s mint yesterday month to date the mint has only sold what i reported on monday 1 000 troy ounce of gold eagles 1 000 one ounce 24k gold buffaloes and 223 500 silver eagles gold over at the comex approved depositories on the u s east coast on thursday but in the out category there was 32 214 300 troy ounces 1 002 kilobars that departed jpmorgan the link to that activity is there was no in activity inover at theon thursday but in the out category there was

all brooches are centrally arranged in a cross shaped pattern the smallest brooch stylistically belongs to the late 8th century the five larger brooches can be dated to the early ninth century all items in the hoard are intricately decorated in the trewhiddle style the brooches were in very good condition when they were discovered evidence suggests that all the brooches were made in the same workshop all of the brooches except for the smallest were complete with intact pin spring and hinge components the largest brooch is a silver disc with an intricate openwork pattern and inlaid with black niello this 10 2 cm brooch is an excellent example of the trewhiddle style the outer edge of the brooch contains eight panels of intertwined creatures the center of the brooch is ornamented with stylised animal and plant decorations the back of the brooch is undecorated the pin and spring hardware is intact and decorated with two stylised beasts click to view photo ii photo iii in 1978 william king a sexton for the church of st mary magdalene in pentney norfolk was digging a grave and noticed a circular piece of metal embedded in the soil in removing the metal he uncovered five additional metal discs king gave the artefacts to the church rector who saved them in the parish chest three years later the new church rector john wilson found the discs and gave them to the norwich castle museum the british museum was asked to evaluate the brooches it was determined that the hoard items were anglo saxon silver disc brooches the finds were declared treasure trove and property of the crown the hoard contents were purchased by the british museum as discoverer of the hoard king was awarded 137 000 25 000 of which he gifted to the church the commitment of traders report for positions held at the close of comex trading on tuesday june 4 came in exactly as ted stated they would including silver which he was unsure of in silver the commercial net short position increased by 13 404 contracts or 67 0 million troy ounces of paper silver they arrived at that number by selling 4 599 long contracts and increasing their short position by 8 805 contracts it s the sum of those two numbers that represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report it was all managed money traders plus a whole bunch more as they increased their long position by 7 310 contracts plus they covered 11 161 short contracts all at a loss it s the total of those two numbers 18 471 contracts that represents their change for the reporting week and as is always the case it was the traders in the other two categories that made up for the difference between what the managed money bought and the commercial traders sold in this case 18 471 minus 13 404 equals 5 067 contracts both categories decreased their net long positions during the reporting week the other reportables by 4 505 contracts and the nonreportable small traders by 562 contracts those two numbers add up to 5 067 contracts the difference between what the commercials and the manged money traders did during the reporting week which they must do the commercial traders in the producer merchant and swap dealer category both increased their net short positions and added to long positions to the tune of 13 404 contracts mentioned earlier the commercial net short position in silver is back up to 61 4 million troy ounces i didn t have a chance to talk to ted about all this yesterday as i got my times to call him mixed up but in an e mail from him yesterday afternoon he stated that the pleasant surprise that jpm looks to be still long silver to the tune of 5 000 contracts or so you d never know it by looking at the producer merchant category of yesterday s cot report but the companion bank participation report tells a completely different story and my discussion on that is a bit further down here is the 3 year cot chart from nick laird updated with friday s data and the increase should be noted click to enlarge of course the commercial net short position in silver is even larger now since the tuesday cut off most likely significantly so but by how much won t be know until the cot report next friday in gold the commercial net short position blew out by 62 622 contracts or 6 26 million troy ounces of paper gold they arrived at that number by selling 58 773 long contracts and they also added 3 849 short contracts it s the sum of those two numbers that represents their change for the reporting week under the hood in the disaggregated cot report it was all managed money traders plus more as they added 40 349 long contracts and they also reduced their short position by 29 559 all for big losses the sum of those two numbers 69 908 contracts represent their change for the reporting week the difference between that number and the commercial net short position 69 908 minus 62 622 equals 7 286 contracts was made up as it has to be by the traders in the other two categories the other reportables didn t do much during the reporting week decreasing their net long positions by 481 contracts it was the traders in the nonreportable small trader category that did most of the heavy lifting as they reduced their net long position by 6 805 contracts of course the commercial traders in the producer merchant and swap dealers category increased their net short positions by a considerable amount with the traders in the latter category doing the largest percentage of that amount the commercial net short position in gold is back up to 17 26 million troy ounces here is the 3 year cot chart for gold courtesy of nick laird click to enlarge like in silver the commercial net short position in gold has grown even larger since the tuesday cut off but by how much remains to be seen in the other metals the manged money traders in palladium increased their net long position in this precious metal by 248 contracts the managed money traders are net long the palladium market by 9 532 contracts over fifty percent of the total open interest total open interest in palladium is 18 724 comex contracts down 1 381 contracts from the previous week as you can tell it s a very tiny market in platinum the managed money traders increased their net short position by another 3 227 contracts the managed money traders are now net short the platinum market by a fairly hefty 12 911 contracts in copper the managed money traders increased their net short position in that metal by a further 5 003 contracts during the reporting week and are now net short the comex futures market by a whopping 45 769 contracts that translates into a short position of 1 14 billion pounds of the stuff here s nick laird s days to cover chart updated with yesterday s cot data for positions held at the close of comex trading this past tuesday it shows the days of world production that it would take to cover the short positions of the big 4 and big 5 through 8 traders in each physically traded commodity on the comex click to enlarge for the current reporting week the big 4 traders are short 99 days of world silver production which is unchanged from last week s report and the 5 through 8 large traders are short an additional 61 days of world silver production down 1 day from last week s report for a total of 160 days that the big 8 are short which is a bit over 5 months of world silver production or about 373 4 million troy ounces of paper silver held short by the big 8 in the cot report above the commercial net short position in silver was reported as 61 4 million troy ounces as mentioned in the previous paragraph the short position of the big 8 traders is 373 4 million troy ounces the short position of the big 8 traders is larger than the total commercial net short position by a chunky 375 7 minus 61 4 equals 314 3 million troy ounces the reason for the difference in those numbers as it always is ted s raptors the 41 odd small commercial traders other than the big 8 are net long that amount as i mentioned in my cot commentary in silver above ted stated that jpmorgan s long position in silver remains around the 5 000 contract mark but as i commented further up the proof of that lies in the discussion on silver in the bank participation report that follows the big 4 traders now in that category are short on average about 99 divided by 4 equals 24 75 days of world silver production each and at least one of them still comes from the ranks of the managed money category despite the increase in short covering during the reporting week the four traders in the 5 through 8 category are short 61 days of world silver production in total which is 15 25 days of world silver production each ted s of the opinion that there are most likely three managed money traders with short positions still large enough in the comex futures market to inhabit the big 8 category the big 8 commercial traders are short 34 6 percent of the entire open interest in silver in the comex futures market which is basically unchanged from the 34 5 percent they were short in last week s report and once whatever market neutral spread trades are subtracted out that percentage would be around the 40 percent mark in gold it s now 38 2 percent of the total comex open interest that the big 8 are short up quite a bit from the 34 4 percent they were short in last week s report and around the 45 percent once the market neutral spread trades are subtracted out in gold the big 4 are short 39 days of world gold production up 6 days from what they were short in last week s cot report the 5 through 8 are short another 25 days of world production down 2 days from what they were short last week for a total of 64 days of world gold production held short by the big 8 up 4 days from last week s report based on these numbers the big 4 in gold hold about 61 percent of the total short position held by the big 8 up 6 percentage points from last week s cot report the concentrated short position within a concentrated short position in silver platinum and palladium held by the big 4 commercial traders are about 62 68 and 84 percent respectively of the short positions held by the big 8 silver is up 1 percentage point from a week ago platinum is up 2 percentage points from last week and palladium is unchanged from a week ago and still at its record high if you look at the above days to cover chart above you can see these percentages for yourself between the red and the green bars for each precious metal the grotesque short position of the big 4 traders relative to the positions of the big 8 traders in palladium should be noted the june bank participation report data is extracted directly from the data in yesterday s commitment of traders report it shows the number of futures contracts both long and short that are held by all the u s and non u s banks as of tuesday s cut off in all comex traded products for this one day a month we get to see what the world s banks are up to in the precious metals and they re usually up to quite a bit the june bank participation report covers the time period from may 8 to june 4 inclusive in gold 5 u s banks are net short 64 906 comex contracts in the june bpr in may s bank participation report these same 5 u s banks were net short 27 281 contracts so there was a whopping increase of 37 625 contracts from a month ago but on a gross basis it s far more than that this bpr in gold shows a gross long position of 8 163 contracts held by these five u s banks and i would suspect that jpmorgan holds that entire amount and they could hold a fairly chunky short position now as well citigroup and hsbc usa would also hold substantial short positions in gold as well but as to who other two u s banks might be that are short in this bpr i haven t a clue but it s a given that their short positions would not be material also in gold 28 non u s banks are net short 76 122 comex gold contracts which is a bit under three thousand contracts per bank in the may bpr these same 28 non u s banks were net short 55 851 comex contracts so the month over month change is up a lot as well 20 271 contracts however as i always say at this point i suspect that there s at least two large non u s bank in this group including scotiabank it s certainly possible that it could be the bis in no 1 spot but regardless of who this second non u s bank is the short positions in gold held by the remaining 26 non u s banks are immaterial at the low back in the august 2018 bpr these same non u s banks held a net short position in gold of only 1 960 contacts so they re back to being short big time and almost a record short position to boot the non u s banks haven t been this short gold since back in june of 2017 and it s a given that they re at a record now since the tuesday cut off as of this bank participation report 33 banks are net short 29 3 percent of the entire open interest in gold in the comex futures market which is up a huge amount from the 18 5 percent they were short in the may bpr here s nick s chart of the bank participation report for gold going back to 2000 charts 4 and 5 are the key ones here note the blow out in the short positions of the non u s banks when scotiabank s comex short position was outed by the cftc in october of 2012 click to enlarge in silver 4 u s banks are net short 7 600 comex silver contracts in june s bpr in may s bpr the net short position of these same 4 u s banks was 9 642 contracts so the short position of the u s banks is down 2 042 contracts from may bpr to give you an idea of how low this short position for these 4 u s banks is this is the smallest net short position held by these banks since november 2014 and the second smallest u s bank short position on record going back to 2011 in the cot discussion on silver ted stated the jpmorgan still held a long position in comex silver the reason he thinks that way is that the gross long position of these 4 u s banks in this bpr is 7 219 contracts up from the 5 096 contracts they held in may s bpr i m sure he suspects correctly i might add that most if not all of this amount is held by jpmorgan then it becomes pretty obvious that citigroup and hsbc usa now hold the lion s share of the remaining short position of these four u s banks but jpmorgan could also be shorting the silver market as well and it wouldn t be obvious here as traders in the producer merchant category can be long and short the comex futures market in silver at the same time a luxury that other traders aren t allowed but the take away from this is that jpmorgan is hanging onto its long position in silver and may even be adding to it at every opportunity despite the fact that it has been going short this silver rally all the way up and whoever the remaining u s bank may be of the 4 u s banks in total their short position like the short positions of the two smallest banks in gold is immaterial as well also in silver 21 non u s banks are net short 27 559 comex contracts which is down a bit from the 28 005 contracts that 22 non u s banks were short in the may bpr i would suspect that canada s scotiabank still holds a goodly chunk of the short position of these non u s banks i believe that a number of the remaining 19 non u s banks may actually net long the comex futures market in silver but even if they aren t the remaining short positions divided up between these other 19 non u s banks are immaterial and have always been so as of june s bank participation report 25 banks are net short 16 3 percent of the entire open interest in the comex futures market in silver which is down a bit from the 18 9 percent that they were net short in the may bpr with much much more than the lion s share of that held by citigroup hsbc usa scotiabank and maybe one other non u s bank i m sure jpmorgan now holds a short position in comex silver but it would not be material compared to the other three although it certainly may have increased since the tuesday cut off here s the bpr chart for silver note in chart 4 the blow out in the non u s bank short position in october of 2012 when scotiabank was brought in from the cold also note august 2008 when jpmorgan took over the silver short position of bear stearns the red bars it s very noticeable in chart 4 and really stands out like the proverbial sore thumb it is in chart 5 click to enlarge in platinum 5 u s banks are net short 10 394 comex contracts in the june bank participation report in the may bpr these same banks were net short 17 112 comex contracts so there s been a whopping decrease of 6 718 contracts month over month which reversed the equally big increase in the may bpr that s quite a change for the worst since then even with the improvement in june s bpr also in platinum 19 non u s banks are net short 7 095 comex contracts in the june bpr which is down a lot from the 11 487 comex contracts they were net short in the may bpr this big decline is not surprising considering the engineered price decline in this precious metal during the current reporting period and as of june s bank participation report 24 banks are net short 20 9 percent of platinum s total open interest in the comex futures market which is a whopping big decrease from the 38 2 percent they were net short in may s bpr here s the bank participation report chart for platinum and the big drop in the world bank s short position is more than obvious click to enlarge in palladium 4 u s banks are net short 7 425 comex contracts in the june bpr which is up a tad from the 7 298 contracts that these same 4 u s banks held net short in the may bpr also in palladium 15 non u s banks are net short 923 comex contracts which is also up a bit from the 687 comex contracts that these 15 non u s banks were short in the may bpr when you divide up the short positions of these non u s banks more or less equally they re completely immaterial especially when you compare them to the positions held by the 4 u s banks as of this bank participation report 19 banks are net short 44 6 percent of the entire comex open interest in palladium in may s bpr the world s banks were net short 37 1 percent of total open interest so there s been an unhealthy increase in the short position of the banks in this precious metal over the last month and just as a point of interest these 4 u s banks hold 89 percent of the total short positions held in palladium by all the worlds banks combined here s the palladium bpr chart you should note that the u s banks were almost nowhere to be seen in the comex futures market in this precious metal until the middle of 2007 and they became the predominant and controlling factor by the end of q1 of 2013 and are even more so today click to enlarge this certainly wasn t a very happy bpr in gold silver appeared to be the surprise with a slight decrease from the may bpr but it was coming off a major price low back on may 28 and virtually all of that improvement was lost by the time the bpr came out a week later on june 4 if we could see a bank participation report as of the comex close on friday it wouldn t make for happy reading in either metal but it should be mentioned that along with jpmorgan s gross long position in the comex futures market in silver and most likely gold as well ted figures they re sitting on 20 million ounces of physical gold plus around 850 million troy ounces of silver they could allow precious metal prices to explode at any time and they d still come out smelling like a rose but will they they answer is i don t know nor does anyone else i don t have all that many stories for you today however i should point out that doug noland s commentary this week is a must read critical reads huge payrolls miss only 75 000 jobs added in may as wage growth slows for once adp was right with the market unsure how to trade today s payrolls number with both a very

revised down from 189 000 to 153 000 and the change for april was revised down from 263 000 to 224 000 making it a net zero for the month and suggesting some serious deceleration in the labor market amid the trade war the jobs market slowdown is becoming increasingly clearer monthly job gains have now averaged 164 000 in 2019 compared with an average gain of 223 000 per month in 2018 the 3 month average of jobs growth declined to 151k in may the fifth sequential slowing and the smallest gain in 20 months the post recession average is 175k so growth is back below a long term trend according to

qe unwind started total assets fell by 42 billion in may as of the balance sheet for the week ended june 5 released this afternoon this was the balance sheet week that included may 31 the date when

posited that the fed s balance sheet could swell to 10 tn during the next crisis when the current bubble bursts the fed and global central bankers will see no alternative than to flood the global financial system with central bank credit this is a terrible reprehensible prospect i warned a decade ago that qe was a slippery slope after a decade central bankers would surely today prefer to rebrand qe as a conventional and elemental part of their arsenals but it will not be until the next bursting bubble phase before there is a modicum of a body of evidence from only one cycle for assessing the effectiveness of history s most radical monetary experiment today global securities markets are eagerly anticipating the return of zero rates and more qe chairman powell draghi and others are conveying the message that they are getting their arsenals ready powell draghi kuroda and the like fully appreciate that a decade of ultra loose monetary policies have fueled dangerous bubbles but they ve thrown in the towel a fight they are afraid to confront the fed has not only abandoned normalization it has deserted its primary responsibility for safeguarding financial stability we re witnessing nothing short of a historic failure in the bernanke inflationary policy doctrine today masked by precarious speculative dynamics throughout the risk markets and a historic melt up in global sovereign bond prices history has never experienced such powerful financial bubbles on a globalized basis the scope of international trend following and performance chasing finance is unprecedented many tens of trillions and with these bubbles at risk of bursting central bankers are resolved to employ whatever it takes monetary stimulus to hold dislocation at bay the upshot is only further emboldened market participants more intense speculation a greater accumulation of speculative leverage and even more precarious terminal phase bubble excess draghi s replacement will suffer the same fate as bernanke s successors once you ve pulled out the monetary bazooka there will be no dropping it from the arsenal nothing in fact will suffice but a bigger bazooka bigger bubble demands bigger bazooka and global bond markets are these days priced for a horde of jumbo bazookas yet there s more to this story than central banks held hostage by speculative bubbles more than trade wars

concurrently at 8 30 a m in new york yesterday morning was met full force in the precious metals as jpmorgan et al showed up with all guns blazing what rallies that did develop in all four were capped at the same moment around 10 30 a m edt and a vast majority of what gains were allowed up to that point disappeared before the comex close or shortly thereafter then to add insult to injury da boyz were shorting the precious metal shares again yesterday like they ve been doing almost all week and as keith neumeyer pointed out in my discussion on the hui and silver 7 indexes further up it s a near certainty that sometime in the very near future da boyz will engineer precious prices lower so that they will not only stick it to the managed money traders but they ll also make a killing on the precious metal shares as well but despite what appears to be inevitable in the very short term it will only be a temporary set back as it s a given that u s interest rates are headed lower as will the u s dollar there s nothing that can stop that now as it s obvious that the u s is headed for a major recession or worse all that jpmorgan et al are doing is delaying the inevitable for as long as possible here are the 6 month charts for the four precious metals plus copper and wtic gold is certainly in overbought territory now and silver would be there as well if its price wasn t being as actively managed as it is platinum is still miles below any moving average that matters and palladium was barely allowed to break above its 50 day moving average yesterday copper on the other hand traded at a new intraday low for this engineered price decline but didn t close at a new low wtic managed to added to its mall gains on thursday click to enlarge i never thought i d live to see times that we are living in today central banking run amok and the equity and bond markets now the biggest financial casinos the world has ever known it s global in scope and it s starting to contract bubbles don t work in reverse and as the world s central banks know all to well so it s print or die on an unimaginable scale going forward as doug noland so eloquently put it in his commentary in the critical reads section powell draghi kuroda and the like fully appreciate that a decade of ultra loose monetary policies have fueled dangerous bubbles but they ve thrown in the towel a fight they are afraid to confront the fed has not only abandoned normalization it has deserted its primary responsibility for safeguarding financial stability we re witnessing nothing short of a historic failure in the bernanke inflationary policy doctrine today masked by precarious speculative dynamics throughout the risk markets and a historic melt up in global sovereign bond prices and then this draghi s replacement will suffer the same fate as bernanke s successors once you ve pulled out the monetary bazooka there will be no dropping it from the arsenal nothing in fact will suffice but a bigger bazooka bigger bubble demands bigger bazooka and global bond markets are these days priced for a horde of jumbo bazookas yet there s more to this story than central banks held hostage by speculative bubbles more than trade wars weak global manufacturing and even the fragile european banking system the vulnerable chinese bubble is a potential catalyst that could rather abruptly panic global markets and central bankers alike i m sure that british economist peter warburton along with a lot of others back nearly twenty years ago could have ever imagined that the world s financial system would have degenerated into the frankenstein monster that has come shambling forth over the last generation particularly in the last six or seven months the situation is now totally out of control i m going to trot out warburton s four most famous paragraphs from april 2001 yet one more time what we see at present is a battle between the central banks and the collapse of the financial system fought on two fronts on one front the central banks preside over the creation of additional liquidity for the financial system in order to hold back the tide of debt defaults that would otherwise occur on the other they incite investment banks and other willing parties to bet against a rise in the prices of gold oil base metals soft commodities or anything else that might be deemed an indicator of inherent value their objective is to deprive the independent observer of any reliable benchmark against which to measure the eroding value not only of the u s dollar but of all fiat currencies equally they seek to deny the investor the opportunity to hedge against the fragility of the financial system by switching into a freely traded market for non financial assets it is important to recognize that the central banks have found the battle on the second front much easier to fight than the first last november i estimated the size of the gross stock of global debt instruments at 90 trillion for mid 2000 how much capital would it take to control the combined gold oil and commodity markets probably no more than 200 billion using derivatives moreover it is not necessary for the central banks to fight the battle themselves although central bank gold sales and gold leasing have certainly contributed to the cause most of the world s large investment banks have over traded their capital so flagrantly that if the central banks were to lose the fight on the first front then the stock of the investment banks would be worthless because their fate is intertwined with that of the central banks investment banks are willing participants in the battle against rising gold oil and commodity prices central banks and particularly the u s federal reserve are deploying their heavy artillery in the battle against a systemic collapse this has been their primary concern for at least seven years their immediate objectives are to prevent the private sector bond market from closing its doors to new or refinancing borrowers and to forestall a technical break in the dow jones industrials keeping the bond markets open is absolutely vital at a time when corporate profitability is on the ropes keeping the equity index on an even keel is essential to protect the wealth of the household sector and to maintain the expectation of future gains for as long as these objectives can be achieved the value of the us dollar can also be stabilized in relation to other currencies despite the extraordinary imbalances in external trade now it s not just the fed fighting this battle it s now all the central banks of the world all for one and one for all but in the precious metals market it s mostly three u s banks the powers that be in the u s simply cannot allow any significant amounts of the tens of trillions of dollars sloshing around out there to find a home in hard assets at least not at the moment and that s why they ve been preventing the big 6 commodities from rising in price in response to an ever increasing money supply and desperate money looking for yield this is one of their last attempts to prevent that from happening they will fail and when they do they will fail spectacularly once the run to hard assets begins there will be no stopping it and as i ve said before on many occasions that failure will come through either circumstance or by design but it is coming all that i m doing now is watching all this unfold with stark disbelief if you re not afraid of the impending financial and monetary train wreck that draws ever nearer at an accelerating rate with each passing month you should be i m done for the day and the week and i ll see you here on tuesday ed digg this article published monday 10 june 2019 e mail print source goldseek com please enable

the white house is said to be vetting judy shelton a former campaign adviser to president donald trump for a top policymaking position at the federal reserve the new york times and bloomberg reported in may that shelton is being vetted for the position and she told markets insider she has been contacted by the office of presidential personnel in an interview with markets insider shelton laid out what she would bring to a central bank whose policies she has long been critical of advertisement the conservative economist said she thought it would be superficial to answer yes or no to whether the central bank was independent said she wanted a zero percent inflation target and expressed support for the president and his policies shelton currently serves as the us director for the european bank for reconstruction and development this interview took place on june 6 2019 you can read the full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview advertisement gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entre into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas advertisement and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy advertisement shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know advertisement heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous advertisement then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution advertisement shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government advertisement heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed advertisement heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low advertisement stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed advertisement shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed advertisement the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target advertisement shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth advertisement i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented advertisement shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of advertisement shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about advertisement see also
the white house is said to be vetting judy shelton a former campaign adviser to president donald trump for a top policymaking position at the federal reserve the new york times and bloomberg reported in may that shelton is being vetted for the position and she told markets insider she has been contacted by the office of presidential personnel in an interview with markets insider shelton laid out what she would bring to a central bank whose policies she has long been critical of advertisement the conservative economist said she thought it would be superficial to answer yes or no to whether the central bank was independent said she wanted a zero percent inflation target and expressed support for the president and his policies shelton currently serves as the us director for the european bank for reconstruction and development this interview took place on june 6 2019 you can read the full interview transcript edited for brevity and clarity below you can click here for articles on the following points from the conversation full interview advertisement gina heeb where exactly are you in the run up to the i know you haven t formally been nominated but i have seen reports that you re being vetted and then i ve also seen reports that it s not a sure thing if you could speak to that judy shelton i really can t speak to it i met with people from the office of presidential personnel and so i assume i m being considered i m also reading that i m being considered what i appreciate is that i think that the whole issue is an interesting one and deserves a lot of attention at a time when the fed itself seems to be asking questions about our models working or are mechanisms delivering the best economic performance potential because it s not that the fed creates economic growth but i think it s an important part of having the conditions out there that make it possible to generate a productive economic growth they re all really important issues i also think because we do live in an economy where international trade is very important the central banks do affect exchange rates i think it s an it s an interesting time even from an intellectual framework point of view to say how do you have something that is coherent how do you integrate domestic and international monetary policy so that you have the appropriate level playing field for free trade i like that because my name is out there people are more interested pro or against but the point is we re talking about these things i m very pleased about that and we ll just have to see what happens if anything goes any further for me advertisement heeb could you tell me a little bit about your relationship with president trump shelton i was actually an adviser to ben carson during the primary just on issues that would come up on the federal reserve but he really wasn t asked enough about it during the debate i wasn t able to really have much of an impact i don t think and then when he went with donald trump i was very happy because one thing i really liked about what donald trump was bringing up as a candidate was the issue of currency manipulation here i am someone who thought that this had been ignored for decades and here was someone at the presidential candidate level who was willing to say that he believed in free trade but that currency manipulation was an unfair trade tactic and i thought finally we re going to address this i think early on maybe it was in july or august of 2016 i wrote something for the wall street journal on trump s contribution to sound money because to me again that s an entre into this whole issue of what is the importance of money and having monetary clarity to transmit price signals if you want to take a free market approach and for me that s all kind of what i would call the sound money thinking that interests me very much at right about that same time i had a note from steven mnuchin saying would you be willing to have your name as part of the trump economic advisory council i was pleased to be part of that group i ve known larry kudlow and respected him very much for a long time i ve known steven moore for a long time likewise their idea of productive economic growth and the necessary aspects of it i m aligned with them to a large extent i was happy they wanted to include me and then within a month of that i went out to one of the rallies and met trump as he was a candidate and he was traveling with mike pence i sat with him and his wife and attended the rally and met members of the team they were all there that day and then were sending memos back and forth to members of the economic team just with ideas advertisement and then i guess a few weeks before the election david malpass who was very much involved with the trump economic team asked if i would serve on the transition team i was thrilled to do that and then when trump won we jumped into action and i was the lead adviser for international affairs at the treasury and that was the landing team that we had during the transition that was a wonderful experience and i guess that was about three months because it actually included preparing papers and studies and recommendations for the incoming treasury secretary and kind of overseeing the area that david malpass was slated to become the undersecretary of international affairs so preparing positions in conjunction with david and then also briefing secretary mnuchin through his confirmation hearing and shortly after that but then i really wasn t looking for a position i loved the experience during transition but i wasn t seeking a position i just kind of said great thank you very much and i was looking forward to seeing things unfold it was several months later it was well into the summer of 2017 that david malpass at treasury asked if i would be interested in serving in this particular position and there s a lot at the european bank for reconstruction and development heeb right well it sounds like you ve had a busy few years and developed close relationships within the administration and with the president would those change if you were nominated to the fed shelton well how do you mean i mean i guess you don t give up friendships but you mean like would i take orders or something i don t know i think the people who are already there are especially aware of what are the appropriate boundaries and anyone who knows me knows i m pretty consistent in my own person i guess i don t know how else further to answer but i think that when you can work with people and you re like minded but obviously the fed is independent and i know everyone respects that i wouldn t see any conflicts at the same time i don t think that you put up artificial barriers or change your feelings of respect or friendship for people heeb what about larry kudlow i know you mentioned a close relationship with him would you guys discuss monetary policy advertisement shelton when i say close friends i ve just known him a really really long time we don t really get together socially or anything and i always took it as a professional task we would write memos he would just say what are your thoughts on this or that issue if it involved more international monetary issues i would write with great seriousness memos but i would say in more of a professional not even arm s length except that i know generally how he might feel about something and he probably knows generally how i feel the only thing he s ever said to me when we talked about whether i could throw my hat in the ring for this was i said something that while working in my current position i had really refrained from commenting i had been writing op eds i used to write more often for the wall street journal about exchange rate issues or monetary issues but i felt like since the treasury i didn t work for treasury but it involved a relationship with treasury i didn t know what was appropriate to say i don t really like feeling like i can t write things because i don t want to violate i think treasury respects the fed and vice versa and he said well one thing you would be free to say what you want if you were in line for the fed and i remember saying really don t governors have to be careful what they say in speeches and such and he says not that i know of he said i think people write what they think and i thought well that sounds liberating actually but i have no sense that i have any special in or i don t know if i m even on a short list to tell you the truth i just think he was talking generally that i agree to say what i think so that s always very appealing heeb do you worry that expressing support for fiscal policies could make people skeptical of the central bank s independence shelton i haven t really thought about that because i wouldn t be responding to i don t know why the fed is i don t know i haven t really thought about it i saw people trying to make something of if somebody wanted to meet for coffee and talk with me for me the easiest most convenient place was at the trump hotel and i saw people say oh oh she s trying to promote that i thought no it s a block or two from treasury and they leave you alone and you can have a cup of coffee and sit there and no one bothers you and there s not loud music that drives you out so anyway i don t know advertisement heeb i just came across a photo of you the other day at trump hotel i was going to ask if you frequent there shelton when i come into dc if i m in the us i basically live on an old farm a very old property and it s almost two hours away by train so for me it s easy to then get into dc and i don t have an office there i can t bring reporters into the treasury my office is back in london and so i have to meet at some hotel or coffee shop and that one happens to be very convenient because i m usually going to treasury or state or nsc or the visits that are involved with my work at ebrd after i met with james politi in london he said can i take your photo i thought well okay and then i saw people say oh she s promoting that i don t see any conflict whatsoever isn t it regular and maybe you know better than i do isn t it regular practice for the treasury secretary to meet with people at the fed to meet with chairman powell i believe so heeb that s definitely normal they usually issue a readout and as long as everything s transparent it s normal i m more so asking about these close relationships as opposed to a formal meeting because you already have these friendships within the administration shelton when i say close i don t know what people are thinking i mean i don t go out and play golf with anyone i don t i m kind of a hermit i m not very socially active i don t mean close i don t even mean picking up the phone or even emailing i don t even do that now really that was really during the campaign and just on maybe three or four issues related to the economic agendas going forward what do we think about this or what do we think about that just things that were circulated on the team it s just that i ve known larry kudlow since i think early 90 s i would say it s more of a long term respect for him as a person i just think he s great but we re not what i would call social friends only because i m not socially as i say we live on a farm and i m kind of a hermit advertisement heeb to sum it up you wouldn t allow these relationships close or not to influence your decisions as a fed board member shelton no heeb do you think that central bank independence in general has been challenged by the president he repeatedly comments on the job the fed is doing he pressures them to lower interest rates and even reportedly wanted to fire chairman jay powell shelton i would say that that s one of those things where people say oh the the independence of the federal reserve if you get on the federal reserve website it is an agency of the us government right away then you say okay but they re very independent i think some of the practices are i m not saying what i believe necessarily i m just saying let s look at the reality of sort of the sacrosanct idea that they re so independent the federal reserve purchases the debt issued by the government issued by another agency of government the treasury then the federal reserve as another independent federal agency of government purchases that debt collects the interest off that debt pays for its own and at one time was purchasing 60 percent of the debt being issued by the treasury during the crisis years then it takes the interest off that portfolio that the treasury is paying to the holder of the debt another agency of government and lives off that i mean takes its own administrative expenses out of that amount the interest on the government debt it s holding then it remits the rest of that back to the treasury and we call that revenues to the federal budget now that i think is a bit fiscally incestuous advertisement then i think okay so not so independent in a way and as you just mentioned to me it s not unusual at all for treasury officials to meet with the head of the fed i think it s healthier to be transparent i would rather have a president who says what he thinks about the policies out loud for everyone to hear instead of these little subtle meetings we re now learning about historically as to whether nixon said this or that to arthur burns or intimidated or put pressure on in these supposed behind the scenes attempts to intimidate i think paul volcker has referred to words from secretary baker i don t know that those took place but i can well imagine and i would much rather have someone if the goal is to be transparent then instead of people sort of doing the signaling that oh how dare they why not just be open about it and i think it s even sillier people who then say oh now the fed wanted to lower rates but now they can t because it will look like the president intimidated them i mean that was kindergarten to talk about these things i think everybody s professional and everyone should feel free to talk about things i don t think they re intimidated by what is said at the presidential level i think we should be happy that someone is savvy enough about the role of interest rates and the role of the federal reserve to have an opinion heeb so you re saying that the fed is not currently a completely independent institution am i getting that right shelton i m just saying that people are human and they absorb tons of information and i presume we choose people who are capable of executing their best independent judgment in the interest of the responsibility to which they have pledged their fealty and their capabilities to uphold i m not appalled at the notion that the president can have an opinion about financial markets or about monetary policy i think that the chairman of the fed is fully capable of handling it of taking into consideration whatever advice he deems appropriate from whatever sources he deems appropriate and he is his own person and intellectually secure and will do what he thinks is the best thing to do i think people harumph a lot about this without saying everyone s doing their best job let s give them credit heeb do you think the fed is currently a completely independent institution advertisement shelton i think i ve answered that heeb what was your answer sorry it wasn t clear to me shelton is the fed a completely independent institution i mean isn t that what you just asked me a moment ago heeb i wasn t clear on whether your answer was yes or no shelton well i think it would be a little bit superficial to say yes or no the fed itself calls itself an agency of government an independent agency but as i think i just walked you through the fed purchases the debt issued by treasury and takes the interest from that and then remits that back to the treasury as revenues to the federal budget i think at one point when it was really over a hundred billion that it was remitting under bernanke he even said with some pride that we are one of the larger revenue centers for the federal budget and i think they were about the sixth largest contributor to the federal budget that year so not independent fiscally just looking at the financial income statement for a consolidated government advertisement heeb but is it independent from political influences that s more so what i m asking shelton well i think that the federal reserve has to be aware of economic slash political developments at any given moment because there s a lot of interaction there and i think the fed has to take prudent consideration of what is happening politically and economically and i hope they don t have blinders on heeb but i mean for political motives or shelton hey gina i m assuming that you re just being a straight shooter with me as i m trying to be with you so if there s another answer you re looking for heeb no just a yes or no would be fine advertisement shelton well okay anything else heeb i was just seeing if you d be able to answer it in a yes or a no shelton well i really think i ve overkilled on that i see we ve almost done 30 minutes so give me your next legitimate question heeb i think that was a legitimate question so i m just going to say you didn t want to answer yes or no on that shelton wow well okay i m sorry i don t know why i thought this would be a good conversation could you give my answer which i think was more that it would be superficial to try to say yes or no to is the fed an independent agency and then sort of give my enlarged answer in terms of the intermingling with the relationship between treasury and the fed advertisement heeb i think we re saying the same thing in a different way you re saying you think it would be superficial to say yes or no and i was just saying that you weren t saying yes or no shelton that s a hot button issue it s the kind where people will say oh she doesn t believe in the independence of the federal reserve so then it will take a longer answer whereas i suppose it s easy to say no it s 100 percent independent and they should never even talk to each other that it should be more strict and i don t think they should be allowed to read newspapers you could say that but i don t think that s realistic i would say my most true answer in my opinion is that you choose professional people they rise to the position and they have integrity and they don t wear blinders but they always choose what they think is the best way to fulfill their responsibilities and i just think you give responsible people the benefit of the doubt that they are not unduly influenced that the primary goal of their service is to conduct it responsibly i don t think people are intimidated or they wouldn t be in that position heeb okay well we can move on here i recently read that you were against the fed s dual mandate there have been growing debates about how inflation should be measured even at these conferences in chicago this week what do you think the fed s mandate should be and what yardsticks should be used for measurement shelton on the dual mandate it s another one of those concepts that has taken on sacrosanct importance i wonder how much people really go back and read that legislation the humphrey hawkins legislation from 42 years ago and that was a time when i think there was a certain amount of hubris those are the phillips curve days the idea that government could fine tune economic performance and could chart it there was an overemphasis on econometrics in the quantitative approach to running the economy and controlling it that you had this perfect trade off between unemployment and inflation the mandate just said maximizing employment okay so i don t know if that s the fed s job or how you then define it we re certainly at minimal unemployment right now a 50 year low or 49 year low advertisement stable prices stable usually means no movement if that is the sacrosanct mandate then we get back into really interesting if you go back and look at the transcripts when janet yellen and alan greenspan were talking about why 2 percent versus 0 percent what is stable i mean if it s a value of a house and you have 2 percent inflation for 10 years 20 years that means the price changes what 20 to 40 percent during your ownership of your house is that still relevant is 2 percent right is it good to sort of incentivize people i think that was the argument that yellen made again the transcripts i really recommend they re fascinating to read because she convinced alan greenspan and he was probably more a zero change in prices guy a zero delta guy and she made a good case basically to say workers want to see a nominal increase in their wages it s very keynesian that ultimately money illusion even though you re not any wealthier if all prices go up two percent there s still an incentive if there are sticky wages downward nobody wants to have flat income or negative so you build in this little cushion that makes it look like you re getting ahead that s more economics as a social science and i think she got a lot of that from her husband it s very well known in that field so those are interesting arguments but to just say the fed s mandate is stable prices and not comment about why the 2 percent or some people are four percent or even six percent to give the fed more room to maneuver those are interesting questions not answered by that quote dual mandate and then to me it s actually a triple mandate that people seem to forget the third element is in the same sentence it was the maximum employment price stability and moderate long term interest rates what happened to that we have the 10 year now lower than the 3 month what happened to moderate long term interest rates that disappeared when the fed became much more activist following 2008 i don t understand why people call it the dual mandate and then they don t bring up that it was actually three things you could say from a saver s point of view that not being compensated for retirement when you re as trump used to say during the campaign people who have done all the right things to put money in savings accounts are getting creamed that was his word but i thought he was absolutely right about that maybe low rates are good for developers but they sure don t give adequate compensation to people who are saving to put away for retirement in a responsible way i wish the fed would have been more concerned about the third and for no reason less important aspect of the mandate it was a triple mandate heeb okay i have a few questions if we could just back up a little bit as far as maximum employment you said you don t know if that s the fed s job you would be against that as a congressionally mandated task for the fed advertisement shelton well what do they mean by that because what was the fed doing differently when we had high unemployment a few years before and then when the trump administration came in and we got some other things going like reducing the regulatory burden and i think a better environment from a tax point of view for business and entrepreneurship i think people are starting to see potential movement and getting an improved trade reform set of policies in place now we have low unemployment but the fed was the same fed during all of that and if people are saying the fed should maximize employment will you do that by lowering rates or raising rates i find people start arguing without knowing what they really want the fed to do are negative rates good for employment is that what people mean when they say the fed should maximize employment does that always mean they should lower the interest rate because i think some labor groups had thought that but maybe now they re reconsidering to me the only thing that really matters from a jobs point of view is getting productive economic growth you don t just want the fed to do things that are good for investors who arbitrage differential interest rates or who speculate on currencies you want to see what we re starting to get which is increased productivity which then justifies the increased wages those are things that i think have more to do with other policies that the government can be involved with including infrastructure i don t think the fed can create that i don t think just by raising or lowering interest rates you can you can create productive jobs so i would just leave it at that heeb so the mandate should be productivity growth shelton i do think stable money is very important i think you ll find many central banks that s their only mandate monetary stability you could say that and that s not very controversial advertisement but i just think that there are other factors including people s confidence about economic growth you could look at fed policies now on paying interest on excess reserves does that or does that not disincentivize banks to make loans it s the loans to small businesses or consumer loans or mortgages the kind of community bank loans that i think help to create jobs so the fed is a factor but there it might not be the rate of the interest it s whether banks decide that it s easier to leave the money sitting at the fed and collecting interest for doing nothing or to actively seek risky loans by definition the kind of loans that create more small businesses and lead to more employment i would say i want the fed s actions not to discourage employment just by raising or lowering rates if that s all the fed can do that s why i m looking at mechanisms for how they do it not just whether they re going up or down i think you had written something saying that i m in favor of zero interest rates or near zero i m not commenting i try to go out of my way to say i don t know what the interest rate should be i don t think anyone does i think that s the whole issue of you have a central bank thinking that it s smarter than the free market in terms of what the interest rates should be based on the supply of loanable funds and the demand for loanable funds i m not saying what it should be what i m talking about is a mechanism that rewards banks and pays them 2 35 percent interest for doing nothing i think that is not good for employment heeb would you instead use manipulating the balance sheet as opposed to these it sounds like you want to eliminate the interest rate on excess reserves shelton that s the primary way that they raise and lower the interest rate that was meant to be an emergency measure at the time everyone including ben bernanke thought that if you inject all this liquidity into the system in the wake of the meltdown in 2008 that that was an assumption that if you increase base money and we have the normal multiplier effect that you re looking at excessive inflation down the road and so bernanke wanted to move up the timetable for paying interest on excess reserves to lock up those reserves because then he said with all these people saying what about inflation down the line if you re going to have all of this quantitative easing he said i can stop inflation in 15 minutes that s because all you would have to do is keep raising it to the level where banks would say why should i make any loans i mean what if i could get 10 percent from the fed advertisement the point is that became a way to prevent the inflation that everyone expected when we didn t get the inflation that s when i think the fed should have been saying why is that the dog that s not barking why aren t we seeing an increase in the cpi because the goal of pumping the money in was to make it easy for companies with this low cost of capital to invest in expanded plant and equipment and then to hire people so then that would start helping that was the idea that you would be hiring these people and you d be paying them because now you had expanded production capabilities that their aggregate level of wages gave them increased purchasing power and that would have put pressure on the cpi and you would have seen the inflation so when we didn t see that after so many years i think we should have said it was a reasonable experiment maybe by the fed but where is that money going and maybe it s not doing what we thought instead of buying or investing in expansion maybe companies were buying back their own shares to a larger degree than anyone would have thought and maybe already wealthy investors are getting access to margin accounts at near zero rates where they can invest in the market and maybe governments had the opportunity to borrow big time at low rates and lock in low rates those were the unanticipated consequences where i think then the fed should have said that maybe the model isn t working the way we thought heeb you mentioned that no one knows what the interest rate should be shelton instead of saying no one knows i m just saying that having studied the soviet economy i think we had the experiment that was showing what works better central planning or market mechanisms and i m saying market mechanisms give you better outcomes in a sense by having a committee of people decide what the interest rate should be that s a closer model to central planning than having the free market find the interest rate that is appropriate for the cost of capital that s what we re pricing in the market the cost of capital and that s the interest rate i m just saying there are people who have funds they could lend and there are people who could use funds because they see productive investment opportunities and normally banks would be the financial intermediaries that charge the interest rate that allows them to connect the source to the use hopefully in the most productive way because they re good at judging risk and return and that s why we have banks heeb i m going back a few questions because i forgot to ask a follow up here you mentioned the two percent inflation target you said some people want four or six percent do you have a target advertisement shelton my sense would be genuine price stability is really i mean my ideal would be zero stable prices mean stable heeb so zero percent inflation shelton well yeah price stability means stability i m not saying the cpi measures everything i m not saying the pce measures everything what would you really want to do is the level of money and credit in an economy is calibrated to stable consistent price signals that are conveyed through time that would be the ideal heeb you said in a financial times interview the fed has a soviet style power over markets as a board member you would get just one vote and the framework would be largely the same as it is now so why do you want to be part of that shelton i don t think i want to answer that i think it would be presumptuous but i think it s good to have fresh thinking and to challenge it s hard to do i mean i will say that within the current structure i don t believe in just pulling the rug out from people and coming in and trying to blow it all up i think consistency and moving toward a better place i would want to be having the conversations asking the fed and i m very pleased to see the fed is already doing this going through self evaluation is the federal reserve functioning in a way that is setting up optimal conditions for productive economic growth advertisement i would start by looking just very generally we see around the world i think we re up to 11 trillion in securities that or have a negative interest rate and i think that situation has been largely engineered by central banks i think we have to say what is the role of central banks in a productive economy and are they helping or hurting i think it s legitimate to say are they too dominant or does it turn out that they only serve a small segment of the private sector and what is their interaction with governments and what is their impact on currency those are all the questions we should be talking about at a very basic level i m happy for the new open debate on all of these issues heeb what do you think of the fed saying it s ready to act if trade conditions worsen a lot of people saw that as a signal that they could lower rates shelton i think the market is a little bit kabuki theater and over responds in both directions to comments the fed doesn t wear blinders and is watching developments economic and political all the time as it should that was kind of just an obvious statement but i think the market grasps at clippings and overreacts for better or worse heeb but what about the actual policy move to make that statement does that signal that tariffs are hurting the american economy or have the potential to shelton what we re going through on all of that has more to do with negotiating toward a better overall trading platform more of a level playing field i see that as necessary and especially with china that had been neglected for too long and i think in the end we ll end up in a good place advertisement heeb what is necessary the tariffs or the fed response shelton i think it s appropriate on trade to use the levers that you have to work with your trade partners especially in these bilateral agreements i think that we needed to confront china and and work out a better relationship that s more equitable with more access to their markets that s just one factor in the economic outlook that the fed takes into consideration heeb are there any conditions that would call for tightening monetary policy shelton i think just the classic ones the fed is now saying that they are willing to overshoot the two percent target because they were undershooting for so long i would think that at some point we would be using if we re doing a path to phase out of paying banks on excess reserves because i think that s going to be challenged that whole practice then the fed still has 3 6 trillion in its portfolio that it can interact but then that s going to these other questions of should the fed be trying to engineer an artificial interest rate i think that s when you cause distortions heeb you support the gold standard but i haven t seen a lot of details about how it would be implemented advertisement shelton first of all whenever you see that please please try to figure out what do people mean when they attribute that to me do they mean a gold standard where we only have 261 million ounces so i don t understand do people really think that i m saying that somehow about 300 or 350 billion or so i d have to calculate it out but not a big chunk is that what they re talking about or are they talking about where during like the classical international standard i mean the government didn t stand ready to convert all they did is look at what thomas jefferson wrote on the establishment of a money unit the united states you just declare what is your measurement what do we call the us dollar he did it as so many grains of silver or so many grains of gold and you just define it bretton woods was something completely different where only a foreign central bank had the right to convert dollars into gold i m not sure what people mean when they attribute that to me or what they think i m suggesting what i said is that it s a good way to look at the virtues of what you want your monetary system to provide in terms of a monetary integrity or price signal clarity or international system of sorts that sovereign countries can voluntarily agree to abide by what do you want and do you have a universal reference or benchmark so that other countries could voluntarily agree to abide by certain rules on currency relationships it doesn t have to be gold gold is the cliche but if someone wants to suggest something different i ve heard people say sand or water or oil i just haven t seen anything better than gold heeb you re not in favor of pegging a currency to the price of gold shelton when you say pegging what do you mean by that what are you asking me heeb when a currency is defined in terms of advertisement shelton i m sure i ve never said that the fed should have a price rule to ratchet up or down interest rates in accordance with the daily price of gold but i m sure that if anything i would have said a price rule i don t think is a good idea i ve never suggested that i m not badmouthing the gold standard i m saying look to see what you like about prior systems that have worked and see if we could develop a future system that would incorporate the virtues of things that worked in the past heeb but you haven t favored a system in which the value of a currency is defined in terms of the price of gold shelton i m just saying that it s way too easy to toss out the term when the government overspends you could say oh we should just have a gold standard because then you have some discipline because then there s kind of a fiscal price to pay you could lose gold and then that shrinks your money supply and then that puts the brakes on if you re overinflating or whatever you re doing wrong i mean there s lots of aspects to it but you really have to be careful about what you mean to just say oh you favor the gold standard i would just say if you re talking about the classical international gold standard like alan greenspan like robert mundell the nobel prize winner i recognize the virtues of when we had an international voluntary currency system that honored the sovereignty of countries and that was based on their own self discipline and not say like we have problems with the euro because if one country kind of blows it whether it s greece or italy or portugal it doesn t threaten the whole system those are those are things we should be talking about advertisement see also

fukuoka frankfurt european central bank policy makers are open to cutting the ecb s policy rate again if economic growth weakens in the remainder of the year and a strong euro hurts a bloc already bearing the brunt of a global trade war two sources said the ecb said on thursday that its interest rates would stay at their present levels until mid 2020 but president mario draghi added rate setters had started a discussion about a possible cut or fresh bond purchases to stimulate inflation the apparently mixed message failed to convince some investors who saw it as too tenuous a commitment to more stimulus this sent the euro rallying to a 2 1 2 month high of 1 1347 against the us dollar but two sources familiar to the ecb s policy discussions said a rate cut was firmly in play if the bloc s economy was to stagnate again after expanding by 0 4 in the first quarter of the year if inflation and growth slow then a rate cut is warranted said one of the sources who requested anonymity because the ecb s deliberations are confidential an ecb spokesman declined to comment the ecb s deposit rate is already 40 basis points below zero and the bloc s top rated governments such as germany s can borrow at negative rates for up to a decade in this context countering the euro s strength rather than lowering already rock bottom borrowing costs would be the main reason for a further cut to that deposit rate one of the sources said i ll give you five reasons for a rate cut the source said before repeating exchange rate five times the ecb doesn t formally target an exchange rate but draghi noted the euro s appreciation in his news conference on thursday and has long highlighted the currency as a crucial determinant of financing conditions the source said a euro at 1 15 would still be tolerable for some but 1 20 would be a critical level to watch the single currency has risen by 2 against the dollar in just over a week as the federal reserve signaled its willingness to cut its interest rates if needed this was seen by some analysts as a sign the us central bank was bowing to pressure from the white house to keep the dollar weak and strengthen the administration s hand in its trade negotiations the argument for more quantitative easing qe from the ecb was less clear to some policy makers however the sources said one of the sources said more qe could help soothe stock markets if these were spooked by an escalation in the trade war although there would be a risk for the ecb in appearing to kowtow to equity investors the other said the main benefit of qe was compressing the difference between short and long term borrowing costs making access to finance easier for companies and households but this so called term premium was already low reuters
a trader shows u s dollar notes at a currency exchange booth akhtar soomro reuters even exorbitant privileges can be lost and there are a number of factors suggesting that over time the us dollar may be at risk of surrendering its lead if not its role as the world s preeminent reserve currency some of these factors relate to u s policy decisions others to policy decisions and developments elsewhere but all point in the same direction the primary reasons for the dollar s continued dominance are inertia and the lack of viable alternatives neither of which u s policymakers should find comforting for the longer term the most obvious u s policy contributions to a diminished role for the dollar are from economic sanctions and protectionist trade initiatives all else equal protectionist policies divert trade away from the u s and may induce new trade partners to settle in currencies other than the dollar sanctions do the same and since they may effectively preclude dollar settlement the implications for the dollar are more acute in addition to the treasury department s list of 6 300 specially designated nationals and more than 20 countries against which some type of sanctions are in place the extraterritoriality of certain sanctions to affect persons and entities in other jurisdictions extends their reach further competition from abroad while u s policies have clearly pushed some countries such as iran and russia away from the dollar officials in china and the euro zone have been actively touting their currencies as reserve and transaction substitutes the chinese renminbi was added to the international monetary fund s special drawing rights basket in 2016 joining the dollar euro yen and british pound in a development the fund said enhances the attractiveness of the rmb as an international reserve asset the renminbi was introduced as a numeraire in commodity markets in 2018 when crude oil futures began trading in the shanghai international energy exchange a number of european officials have talked up the role of the euro with european commission president jean claude juncker telling the european parliament in his 2018 annual program address that it is absurd that 80 of european energy imports are settled in dollars france germany and the u k set up the instrument in support of trade exchanges instex earlier this year to work around u s sanctions on iran and while it may be more politically symbolic than economically effective instex confirms that even allies will seek dollar alternatives if policy differences with the u s cannot be bridged it will be some time before the renminbi or euro poses a serious challenge to the dollar and they may never do so but chinese and european policymakers will be actively looking for opportunities to expand the roles of their currencies while the us approach toward the dollar in this regard can be characterized as benign neglect at best finding safe haven elsewhere it is difficult to directionally disentangle the causes and consequences that tie the dollar as the world s reserve currency to u s treasury securities as the globally preferred risk free asset but it is worth considering whether a decline in the role of the dollar might be preceded by foreign investors central bank reserve managers in particular seeking risk free dollar assets other than treasurys it is certainly conceivable that the link between treasurys and the dollar could break down and if investors were to accept dollar liabilities of issuers other than the u s treasury as risk free substitutes they would also likely consider those issuers non dollar liabilities similarly however highly rated borrowers whose liabilities could be risk free substitutes for us treasurys are typically sovereigns as well and they almost always borrow in their own currencies there is another much smaller group of highly rated borrowers that regularly issue debt in dollars as well as other currencies supranational institutions state street global advisors estimates that central banks hold about one third of supranationals debt compared with 18 of sovereign debt central banks hold an even bigger share of supranationals dollar debt suggesting reserve managers can and do separate the desire to be invested in dollars from the desire to be invested in us treasuries even so the supranationals market lacks size and will never come close to the treasury market in terms of depth and liquidity limiting its role in central bank diversification of risk free foreign currency assets the wheels are in motion
the american economy is showing signs of cooling and wall street is counting on jerome h powell the chairman of the federal reserve to come to the rescue the big question facing the fed is when not whether to act as far as investors are concerned but the fed faces a tricky balancing act as it tries to parse economic data that are routinely complicated by president trump s unpredictable policies mr powell signaled last week that policymakers were ready to help prop up the economy should mounting risks from mr trump s continuing trade battles and slowing global growth hit the united states economy the jobs report last friday showed that gains slowed sharply in may prompting fed watchers to expect rate cuts sooner rather than later just last month fed officials agreed to leave rates unchanged as washington s trade war with china seemed on the brink of being resolved but mr trump renewed his fight just days after that april 30 and may 1 meeting raising tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and threatening to tax nearly every chinese import china has since retaliated with higher tariffs on american products
projections based on the latest performance indicators of national economy have started another wave of pessimism according to a world bank report the gdp growth rate will decline from 5 8 per cent in 2018 2019 to 2 7 per cent in the coming fiscal year consumer prices rose by 8 2 per cent between february 2018 and february 2019 the contributing factors in this included currency depreciation pressures exerted by domestic demand and higher fuel prices average inflation for october 2018 february 2019 was 7 per cent this compares poorly with 4 1 per cent for the corresponding period the previous year what do these figures tell us they say that the purchasing power of the people has declined significantly the story does not end there tighter fiscal and monetary policies introduced in the name of austerity might have destabilising consequences for the economy through increasing unemployment among all the proposed measures higher economic growth rate widening the tax base increasing tax revenue privatization documenting the informal sector and decreasing budget deficits along with current account deficits to fight chronic macroeconomic problems the most significant is gdp growth increasing the size of pie to be shared the economic problems are not unique to pakistan almost every developed country has been through the storm the wretchedness and tribulations caused by the great depression that hit the world in 1929 1933 the stagflation that hit many large economies including the us in early 1970s and the recession of 2007 2008 are not distant history the scars inflicted by these catastrophic phases of business cycle are hard to erase from memories despite the nightmare situations these economies fought their way out of their problems if other countries can survive economic crisis what can stop us let s first see how these countries reached prosperity after dreadful conditions between 1869 and 2018 the output of the united states shows an increasing trend despite a few episodes of decline during the world wars and recessions achieving economic growth and sustaining it is the secret of their success in developed and emerging economies the output growths for the last two decades have been phenomenal the question arises how have they succeeded in attaining economic growth at a rate which we have not been able to target let alone realize the answer lies in the way their institutions promote growth a police officer in grade 16 enjoys more authority in pakistan than a medical doctor acemoglu and robinson in their book why nations fail introduce two types of institutions inclusive and extractive inclusive economic institutions are those that provide security of property rights and relatively equal access to economic resources to a broad cross section of the society extractive economic institutions are those that provide security of property rights and relatively equal access to economic resources to only the elite of the society according to the authors these institutions develop a set of incentives which determines sustainable economic growth for example inclusive economic institutions incentivise inventions and innovations by ensuring property rights for every individual in a society creative individual react to these incentives by innovating because the profits yielded by these innovations translate into their prosperity the entire society reaps benefits in the shape of employment and economic growth there are countries which owe their economic success to giant companies which thrive on innovations and contribute to social welfare here s a glimpse of the success stories in 2017 apple s market capitalization amounting 1 trillion 1 000 billion dwarfed the gdps of pakistan 304 952 billion sweden 538 04 billion argentina 637 59 billion switzerland 678 88 billion saudi arabia 683 82 billion the netherlands 826 20 billion and turkey 851 10 billion apple s worth exceeded the combined net worth of 11 richest men in the world totalling 831 1 billion charles koch 53 40 billion sergey brin 54 20 billion larry page 55 70 billion larry ellison 58 20 billion mark zuckerburg 65 20 billion carlos slim 65 70 billion amancio ortega 70 40 billion bernard arnault 80 70 billion warren buffet 84 20 billion bill gates 94 90 billion and jeff bezos 148 50 billion in the united states alone apple plans to create two million jobs by investing 350 billion by 2023 apple is just one example the net worth of each of amazon 777 8 billion alphabet 766 4 billion microsoft 750 6 billion and facebook 541 5 billion exceeds the current gdp of pakistan the wealth creation is clearly a panacea all other options merely redistribute the pie pakistan on the other hand offers a different set of incentives the incentives are to be sought in careers in politics military or civil bureaucracy or sale of imported products despite being the sixth most populous country in the world we have not produced a single company whose worth constitutes a significant proportion of the gdp the leading companies in pakistan enjoy success not through innovation but by creating monopolies using their proximity to politics this sort of success exploits the common man and hampers economic growth this is not the way the developed countries operate why do we lag behind in terms of innovation it is because top students dream of making it to military bureaucracy or civil bureaucracy the number of medical doctors and engineers taking css examinations is alarming no wonder the country suffers from a shortage of almost 200 000 doctors many of the doctors and engineers who can t make it to superior services fly abroad sindh chief minister murad ali shah once complained that there was a severe shortage of qualified engineers to carry out development projects the situation in academia is no different speaking to the media in 2017 the then hec chairman said that the country had a deficit of 36 000 phds is it the disparity in wages and perks that is causing people to choose bureaucracy over serving the community as a doctor engineer teacher mathematician physicist chemist biologist accountant or lawyer in most instances it is the social dynamics a police officer in grade 16 enjoys more authority in pakistan than a doctor most graduating candidates thus dream of joining the powerful this poor distribution of privileges and incentives deprives the nation of some of its best brains it does not allow the society to find its einstein edison gates zuckerberg or jobs while politicians bureaucrats and military leader have their important roles modern societies cannot be built without innovating scientists engineers and entrepreneurs the government must think of ways to establish inclusive institutions only then will students who find physics mathematics and chemistry interesting pursue these fields they will then have the opportunity to come up with innovations that will result in wealth creation and employment

says cbn s policies targeted at the vulnerable sanwo olu vows to fight power providers in lagos until supply improves dangote how do you have economic growth without power obaigbena urges cbn to intervene in education sector obinna chima central bank of nigeria cbn governor mr godwin emefiele yesterday warned that rising volatility in the crude oil market occasioned by the rapid increase in the supply of shale oil by the united states which has seen its production rise from nine million barrels per day in 2017 to over 12 million barrels per day today portends great risk to nigeria s growth trajectory emefiele said this at a roundtable session titled going for growth with private sector operators in lagos the event was for private sector operators to express their views and also provide inputs into the roadmap to be unveiled by the cbn governor for the next five years in the coming days he stressed the need to take actions that would wean the economy from excessive reliance on crude earnings for survival this means that we must strengthen our efforts over the coming years to stimulate growth and create jobs in critical sectors of our economy that will help insulate our economy from shocks in the global economy in doing this the cbn has recently been caught in a syndrome which we term the dilemma of monetary policy in nigeria typically for a nation to be seen prosperous any citizen of that country will expect the following macro economic indices to prevail that is a low interest rate regime a stable exchange rate regime and robust reserve position a low inflationary environment and lastly an environment of full employment in fact i love these and would have less stress in monetary policy if all these are possible but the question we should ask ourselves at this session is in the nigeria of today are these all possible at the same time indeed we are fully cognisant of the diversity of opinions of even some of you in this audience regarding our actions on monetary policy he maintained that the bank would continue to defend the naira saying that the cbn act demands that the bank defend the naira using the foreign exchange reserves in effect the cbn would be disobeying the law establishing it if it sits idly by and allow the naira to be determined wholly by the so called market forces second those who call for floating of the currency betray their willful ignorance of the effects of significant depreciation however short lived on inflation several empirical analyses have shown that the pass through of changes in the exchange rate on consumer prices is almost one to one this implies that for every percentage point depreciation in the naira there is almost the same rise in inflation i have also heard a lot of people suggest that all they want is for the cbn to reduce interest rates in fact for us at the cbn achieving a low interest rate regime will give us a great sense of accomplishment indeed given our determination to stimulate economic growth it is obvious that we would want to pursue a policy of moderating interest rates yet in an environment where inflation recently was a high as 18 72 percent it would be counter productive to reduce interest rates because any attempt to ease interest rates under a high inflationary environment will no doubt retard growth while we are delighted that we have been able to fight inflation down to very low double digits we believe it is still too high for the nigerian economy our goal is to moderate it down to single digits more also we need to keep in mind that nigeria s high interest regime reflects not only the cost of capital but also the cost of doing business in the country a typical branch of nigerian bank provides its own security with sometimes permanent police presence its own electricity supply with several generators diesel tanks and inverters and its own broad band internet services for banks whose main source of income is from interest earnings these deficiencies become costs which it must necessarily pass on to borrowers so regardless of what we do at the cbn it is important that we realise other aspects of our business environment that promote and sustain high interest rates speaking further the cbn governor who just last week assumed office for the second term of five years said the policies of the apex bank in the past five years have been focused on protecting the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable persons in the country the meeting had in attendance the governor of lagos state mr babajide sanwo olu captains of industry led by president of the dangote group alhaji aliko dangote founder of zenith bank plc mr jim ovia the chairman anap foundation atedo peterside and ceos of banks and other leading private sector organisations according to emefiele the apex bank is very comfortable staying on the side of the weak vulnerable and poor masses and protecting their purchasing power he argued the central bank s development finance initiatives and foreign exchange intervention are targeted at supporting vulnerable persons in the society sadly while most people in this room may be spared the brutal consequences of inflation the majority of nigerian masses and fixed income earners are not the poor masses are the ones that bear the brunt of losing purchasing power of the meagre salaries they receive ever so infrequently indeed given the current resistance to pay increased minimum wage of n30 000 one wonders how the fixed income earner would survive the consequences of inflationary pressure arising from the pass through from exchange rate depreciation being proposed by the naysayers he told his audience emefiele said the task of building a stronger economy was far from complete with the pace of gross domestic product gdp growth still very fragile and badly lagging behind population growth rate of 2 7 per cent he reiterated the fact that the level of credit to the private sector by financial institutions was still very low according to the cbn governor domestic industries particularly high employment generating sectors like textile and garment sectors have continued to deal with rampant smuggling and dumping of materials through our borders these challenges no doubt call for action by the monetary and fiscal policies through the implementation of policies the spirit and letter of which must be respected by all he added governor sanwo olu in his remarks pledged to continue to fight power providers in the state until there is increased power supply to households and firms the governor emphasised that making lagos a 21st century economy requires improved power supply to drive businesses and households he pledged to modernise essential services in the state and strive for maximum efficiency in the public sector institutions we are going to do this so that we can become increasingly competitive and innovative it is important to unleash the potential of the state so as to attract foreign direct investments fdis to the state sanwo olu he urged the central bank of nigeria to remain vigilant so as to safeguard the economy from external shocks according to sanwo olu there was need for policymakers in the country to positively take advantage of ongoing us china trade war as well as the brexit to reposition the economy aliko dangote on his part described consumer credit as a vital tool for fighting corruption in the country to this end dangote urged the cbn and commercial banks in the country to work towards developing consumer credit products so as to encourage low income earners we need to work very hard on consumer lending it is even going to help the government in fighting corruption especially for the low income earners if somebody has a paid job and there is consume credit you can take such credit to buy household equipment and pay for four years we must also do mortgage it will also help in terms of fighting corruption he explained he however said the biggest challenge in the country was implementation how do you have economic growth without power without power there can t be growth egypt electricity increased by 10 gigawatts which is equivalent to 10 000 megawatts in 18 months but in nigeria we have been struggling for 18 years without adding 1 000 megawatts and we have spent about three times the amount egypt spent why so i think we all need to be concerned about that i keep saying that when you look at the contributions to the gdp the government is only about 17 per cent and 80 per cent is private sector he added owing to this he advised private sector operators to remain committed to contributing to the growth of the economy it is only the private sector that can partner with government to create this it is not difficult but we must drive the process no foreigner can invest unless we the locals invest in our country he pointed out that smuggling was causing a lot of harm to businesses in the country citing nigeria s porous border as a challenge dangote said there was need to focus on import substitution jim ovia in his contribution stated that to engender growth there is need to get all the fundamentals in the economy right no matter the economic theory we propound if the fundamentals are not right it definitely cannot work if we have the fundamentals right the common man does not want to know whether interest rate is high or low ovia declared the zenith bank chairman also supported dangote s call for consumer lending saying the reason why the initiative has not blossomed in the country was because of inadequate know your customer atedo peterside in his remarks noted that monetary policy has its limits he advised the cbn to ensure that the issue of multiple exchange rate is addressed he also said there was need to implement policies that would ensure that inflation gradually drops to about five per cent peterside called for friendly policies that would encourage fledgling entrepreneurs saying when aliko dangote and i were in our 30s we were allowed to grow but today we are killing the youths he also urged governments in the country to address the issue of multiple taxation herbert wigwe the chief executive officer access bank plc also said there was need for a conducive environment for businesses to thrive he called for stability of government policies to enable investors plan long term he faulted a situation where policies are suddenly changed in the middle of business decisions nduka obaigbena the chairman of thisday and arise news network advised the central bank to extend its development finance intervention to the education sector so as to enhance the quality of graduates that are churned out annually this he said would have a multiplier effect on productivity in the country obaigbena added we spend lots of money on school fees and our educational institutions are getting worse what the central bank can do is to consider a framework for student loans where proper salaries are paid to cutting edge professors so that we can get the quality we need in education and then you structure the school fees in a payment system that can last 30 years or more so it is that intervention in education that can begin to build the next world class innovators and students for nigeria
neil woodford was once the man with the midas touch the darling of the investor community his record of picking winners was such that money flowed like torrents into his funds as time went by picking winners became more difficult and some of woodford s growth stocks turned out to be duds a few eyebrows were raised eventually as investors started to contemplate big losses many of them asked for their money back the demands for redemptions became so great that trading in woodford s flagship fund was suspended for 28 days or to put it in old fashioned terms capital controls were imposed if woodford s predicament sounds familiar then it should picture a fast growing emerging market economy that is proving a magnet for foreign investment office blocks financed by overseas money are going up everywhere in the capital city the stock market is red hot because american european and japanese investors think the potential returns look a lot better than they do at home for a while as with woodford everything is hunky dory then things start to take a turn for the worse the inflow of foreign capital leads to a stronger currency which makes imports cheaper but exports dearer the economy starts to overheat and the balance of payments deteriorates without preventative action foreign investors will head straight for the exit leading to a collapsing currency and the prospect of an appeal to the international monetary fund for help slapping on capital controls has its attractions but as will almost certainly be the case with woodford it is far too late why because preventing investors from getting access to their money simply demonstrates just how big a hole you are in panic results but if the crisis of 2008 proved one thing it was that in extremis the unthinkable becomes the doable and after the second world war capital controls were integral to achieving the main domestic policy keeping people in work governments thought they could allow free movement of capital or full employment but not both attitudes changed during the free market revolution of the 1970s and early 1980s finance was liberalised barriers to capital were torn down the first big economic decision margaret thatcher s government made after the 1979 election was to remove foreign exchange controls a lack of curbs on investment flows became one of the central pillars of globalisation the imf advice to emerging market economies was that free movement of capital was good controls were bad governments could protect themselves from financial turbulence by keeping inflation budget deficits and public debt low by having a flexible exchange rate and by having deep capital markets that avoided the need to rely on foreign investment clearly though abiding by the central tenets of the washington consensus has not been sufficient to prevent crises last week mark carney provided two reasons why that is the first is that emerging economies headed by china and india now make up a much bigger proportion of the global economy about 60 of total gross domestic product but the profound shift in the economic balance of power over the past 30 years or so has not been matched by a reordering of the global monetary system as carney noted the dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade invoices and two thirds of global securities issuance two thirds of the external foreign debts of emerging economies are denominated in dollars and the us currency acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70 of world gdp this means that changes to us economic policy especially interest rate decisions by the federal reserve have a disproportionate impact on global economic and financial conditions the bank of england estimates that the influence of us financial conditions on foreign gdp has increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005 even though the us accounts for a much smaller share of the world economy so no matter whether they keep inflation low and display rigid budgetary discipline emerging countries can find themselves in real trouble when the us raises interest rates the second reason is that the structure of the global financial system lends itself to crises for a start emerging market countries know they are vulnerable to sudden capital flight their response has been to amass huge reserves in safe assets to fend off attacks on their currencies there has been a glut of saving which has helped drive down global interest rates this leaves investors with a choice they can keep their money in advanced countries and accept low returns or they can look to the emerging markets where the risks and the rewards are higher sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk since the financial crisis supervision of banks has been tightened up so they have to hold more capital against potential losses but regulation is much laxer for investment funds and according to carney more than half have a structural mismatch between the frequency with which they offer redemptions and the time it would take them to liquidate assets under stress they would be forced into a fire sale that would trigger further redemptions a vicious circle that could ultimately disrupt financial markets it is not just woodford s problems that illustrate carney s point perfectly the governor has highlighted a fault line in the global financial system and provided a clue as to where the next crisis is coming from it would be wrong to assume the governor is advocating a return to capital controls he certainly isn t but it is worth noting that when they were in force financial crises were rare and if perhaps that should be when the next big one arrives the call for their pre emptive use will get a lot louder

european central bank policy makers are open to cutting the ecb s policy rate again if economic growth weakens in the remainder of the year and a strong euro hurts a bloc which already bearing the brunt of a global trade war two sources said on thursday the ecb said that its interest rates would stay at their present levels until mid 2020 but president mario draghi added rate setters had started a discussion about a possible cut or fresh bond purchases to stimulate inflation the apparently mixed message failed to convince some investors who saw it as too tenuous a commitment to more stimulus this sent the euro rallying to a two and a half month high of 1 1347 against the us dollar but two sources familiar to the ecb s policy discussions said a rate cut was firmly in play if the bloc s economy was to stagnate again after expanding by 0 4 per cent in the first quarter of the year if inflation and growth slow then a rate cut is warranted said one of the sources who requested anonymity because the ecb s deliberations are confidential an ecb spokesman declined to comment the ecb s deposit rate is already 40 basis points below zero and the bloc s top rated governments such as germany s can borrow at negative rates for up to a decade in this context countering the euro s strength rather than lowering already rock bottom borrowing costs would be the main reason for a further cut to that deposit rate one of the sources said i ll give you five reasons for a rate cut the source said before repeating exchange rate five times euro on the rise the ecb doesn t formally target an exchange rate but draghi noted the euro s appreciation in his news conference on thursday and has long highlighted the currency as a crucial determinant of financing conditions the source said a euro at 1 15 would still be tolerable for some but 1 20 would be a critical level to watch the single currency has risen by 2 per cent against the dollar in just over a week as the federal reserve signalled its willingness to cut its interest rates if needed this was seen by some analysts as a sign the us central bank was bowing to pressure from the white house to keep the dollar weak and strengthen the administration s hand in its trade negotiations the argument for more quantitative easing qe from the ecb was less clear to some policymakers however the sources said one of the sources said more qe could help soothe stock markets if these were spooked by an escalation in the trade war although there would be a risk for the ecb in appearing to kowtow to equity investors the other said the main benefit of qe was compressing the difference between short and long term borrowing costs making access to finance easier for companies and households but this so called term premium was already low

while us equities are less than 3 per cent from a record high capital economics sees wall street back in the clutches of the bears pretty soon it has forecast the s p 500 will likely drop by around 20 per cent from its level now to 2 300 by the end of the year mr sanghani said it is not unusual for the s p 500 to rise while bonds rally the rush to buy drives the bonds price up and yield down in the expectation of looser monetary policy but the stock market usually falls if those expectations are vindicated by economic weakness he said that disappointment is likely to be magnified given the lofty value in us equities is based on a consensus view earnings across the s p500 will rise by 30 per cent this year a figure mr sanghani says is far fetched if the market fails to live up to current forecasts it is at that point bad news will be bad news and will stop propping the market up bad news will then resume the usual and coherent practice of driving prices down unemployment will drive rates here having ruled a line under a disappointing march quarter the data flow is a bit quieter although still important this week the reserve bank is fighting to get a 4 back in front of the unemployment rate and the incremental creep from 4 9 per cent in february to 5 2 per cent in april is not what is supposed to be happening a slowing construction sector is making it tougher for the rba to meet its unemployment forecasts pixabay michael gaida the may labour force release thursday will obviously not be impacted by the rba s rate cut last week but it may have a big impact on the timing of any future cut a full rate cut is not priced in until august with the market betting a rate cut at the next meeting is around a 50 50 proposition that bet is tightening by the day and data release a shocker that is the unemployment rate heading to 5 3 per cent or higher would put pressure on the rba to cut again in july a flat to good result would give the board a bit more time however the consensus is the jobless queue won t have lengthened last month and a solid 15 000 new jobs will have been added election jobs bounce for what it s worth nab believes it will be a blockbuster if one off month for jobs thanks to the election federal elections typically create around 80 000 jobs although most of those workers already put in more than the required one hour week required to be defined as fully employed yep one hour a week is not a huge hurdle to stumble over nab has split the difference and calculated the election temporarily created 20 000 jobs those gaining and losing seats netted out at zero on top of 20 000 created elsewhere in the economy the federal election may have temporarily created 20 000 jobs in may supplied aec while mindful of the volatility of the labour force numbers nab actually forecasts a 40 000 gain in employment and a 0 1 percentage point fall in unemployment to 5 1 per cent nab s kaixin owyong said the other key economic insights of the week will be the monthly check on the mood of both business and consumers the added interest this time around is the surveys will gauge sentiment after the election in the lead up to the election business conditions and confidence as measured by the nab soured and forward looking measures such as orders employment intentions and capacity utilisation fell consumers on the other hand were in a more chipper mood with optimists outnumbering pessimists while that trend is likely to continue what is needed is for it to translate into consumer spending the cheery response given to westpac and

london cnn business 1 easing time markets are pretty confident that central banks are about to enter a period of easing up on interest rates when the us jobs report came in well below expectations on friday stocks moved higher the reason it could clear the way for the federal reserve to start cutting interest rates mark cabana rates strategist at bank of america merrill lynch said rates cuts are now all but assured it s definitely happening he said data from cme group now indicates a 25 probability that the fed cuts interest rates at its june 18 19 meeting the likelihood that rates will be lower than current levels following the july meeting is above 80 it may seem counter intuitive that a strong signal of slowing economic growth would push the us stock market higher but in recent years investors have become increasingly focused on the fed and the fed alone we have now reared an entire generation of investors that buy stocks because interest rates go down said brian belski chief investment strategist at bmo capital markets the thinking easier monetary policy will help boost borrowing padding corporate earnings and possibly freeing up more cash for stock buybacks but honing in on the fed also carries risks for one this cutting cycle will almost certainly look different than in the past how it will unfold is difficult to predict central banks have significantly fewer tools at their disposal than they did a decade ago in europe interest rates remain in negative territory and at record lows the federal reserve has more leeway but its benchmark rate currently set between 2 25 and 2 5 also leaves little room to maneuver cabana thinks that because the fed has less space for dramatic action it will move to quickly cut rates they know they have limited ammunition therefore they need to get out ahead of it he said but it s far from a settled debate others expect the central bank to move methodically and at regular intervals since it knows there s little margin for error in reality no one knows for sure we ve never been in this scenario before cabana said another wrinkle is that bond markets are pricing in multiple near term rate cuts from the fed according to belski bond yields are already falling on that expectation which could diminish the stimulative power of the rate cuts if the fed just delivers exactly what the market is expecting then it s not going to have an economic impact cabana said the market s already baked that in and mortgage and borrowing costs are already lower not everyone agrees that rate cuts are a done deal in a note friday pnc chief economist gus faucher said he thinks that the fed will hold interest rates when it meets later this month it may start cutting later in the year if june job numbers are also soft he added one big question is whether it s a problem that stocks seem to be decoupling from economic fundamentals the divergence between stocks and bond yields implies that a correction could be in store 2 mexico tariffs president donald trump has called off tariffs on goods from mexico that were set to go into effect on monday i am pleased to inform you that the united states of america has reached a signed agreement with mexico trump tweeted friday the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the u s on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended the tariffs which would have started at 5 and could have eventually climbed as high as 25 were opposed by many members of the president s own party and businesses that move goods back and forth across the border markets could rally on the news but the psychological impact of the skirmish may linger the auto industry might have dodged a bullet with this one but it s not emerging completely unscathed said ivan drury senior manager of industry analysis at edmunds in many ways this situation underscores how rocky international production can be under the current administration 3 opec report oil prices are sinking which means investors will pay close attention to opec s monthly report on thursday on the radar what opec says about the forces driving prices lower as well as any insight on supply by country oil plunged into a bear market last week on concerns about excess supply and slowing economic growth right now a lot rides on whether saudi arabia can secure an agreement to extend production cuts which could help prop up prices 4 coming next week monday us job openings chinese trade data tuesday uber uber ceo dara khosrowshahi at the economic club of washington dave busters play earnings tesla tsla shareholder meeting e3 gaming conference begins wednesday us and chinese inflation data us oil inventories lululemon lulu earnings thursday german inflation data tesco tscdf and broadcom avgo earnings opec report european union industrial production friday us and chinese retail sales university of michigan consumer sentiment

several people directed me to a john cochrane post that has an amusing critique of the us government s recent attempt to label germany and italy as currency manipulators the most obvious objection raised by cochrane is that neither germany nor italy has a national currency to manipulate both use the euro i will end up showing that this us government initiative is every bit as absurd as john claims but i will first try to explain the logic of the currency manipulation argument before criticizing it on other grounds when i began investigating the issue of currency manipulation i discovered that the concern isn t actually about currencies at all rather what people object to is better described as saving manipulation policies that boost the current account by increasing domestic saving a recent book by fred bergsten and joe gagnon provides the best explanation of why some people worry about currency manipulation indeed it s the only plausible interpretation that i ve run across in their explanation it s obvious that the actual concern is governmental attempts to artificially boost the current account surplus almost always via policies that boost the national saving rate actual currency manipulation say by a new populist government in latin america that devalues its currency is not a source of concern because simple currency devaluation does not boost domestic saving it does increase the current account instead the gains from devaluation are offset by higher inflation as predicted by purchasing power parity the sort of currency manipulation that worries bergsten and gagnon is when countries artificially depreciate their real exchange rate by purchasing lots of foreign assets or via fiscal austerity even countries such as germany and italy can do this sort of manipulation without impacting the nominal exchange rate at all for instance a eurozone country can run a tight fiscal policy currently more true in germany than italy fiscal austerity can then depreciate a eurozone country s real exchange rate by reducing the domestic price level despite the preceding i end up in the same place as cochrane let s start with the question of why the government doesn t honestly tell us exactly what it is objecting to why not label germany and italy saving manipulators if that is what we actually object to i suspect the reason is political if our government says those devious germans are manipulating their currencies then it sounds bad to most americans if we say those devious germans are running balanced budgets it doesn t sound bad at all most americans already believe that germans are sensible people and if we tell them that germany balances their budget then americans will look even more enviously on the highly disciplined german economic system it s true that academic economists now tend to worry about the paradox of thrift and the associated idea that more saving will depress aggregate demand but most people still believe that balanced budgets are prudent while i usually agree with the professors over the man on the street on macro issues fiscal policy is one area where i go with popular prejudice i don t believe that we are hurt by german saving as any negative effects on aggregate demand are offset by us monetary stimulus indeed more saving is often good as it boosts investment without reducing aggregate demand here s my general rule of international relations if you have a quirky theory that most people do not accept you are free to implement that theory in your own country but you are not free to force the entire world to adhere to your quirky theory thus america should be free to tear up our nuclear agreement with iran but it is not free to force all other countries to follow our lead in a policy rejected by most experts in america and in our allies similarly the us government is free to run trillion dollar deficits if it believes that the theories of john maynard keynes are applicable to an economy where the fed targets inflation at 2 they aren t but it s not free to force other countries to adhere to keynesian theory i think most americans understand this which is why the treasury hides a policy directed at saving manipulation under the extremely misleading label of currency manipulation in fact the us government policy is far worse than what one might infer from the previous discussion the treasury department s accusations of currency manipulation are based in part on the level of bilateral trade deficits a concept almost universally regarded by economists including bergsten and gagnon as being utterly meaningless it s hard to overstate the craziness of implementing us policy that is aimed at harming other countries and that is based on the economic equivalent of astrology here s cochrane i called this post institutionalized nonsense yes every president brings to his or someday her administration some nutty ideas some campaign rhetoric that does not correspond to cause and effect reality sensible cabinet secretaries and career staff must indulge the rhetoric but by this document the treasury is institutionalizing nuttiness setting up rules and procedures that monitor bilateral goods deflcits and waste our nation s vanishing prestige haranguing countries about their macroeconomic policies that produce such undefined and ill measured ephemera why listen to us on say iran sanctions or tiananmen square if we are going to indulge in this sort of nuttiness meanwhile the administration continues to badger the fed to lower interest rates in order to well

budget after general elections won by the nda government with a whopping 353 seats so that the key triggers to watch could be with respect to infrastructure spending economic and consumption growth revival job creation agricultural reforms fiscal prudence etc in the coming days the rbi s role is limited with respect to economic revival as it has cut the repo rate by 2 25 percent since january 2014 from 8 percent and banks passed on only a meagre 60 bps of rate cuts to end users consumption and investment revival will happen not when rbi cuts the rates but when banks cut the rates hence rbi

senior vice president and head of research wealth at centrum broking told moneycontrol fiscal prudence undoubtedly and inarguably is the foundation for sustenance of any economic growth however when economy seems to have evidently hit deeper rough patch providing fiscal respite may be merited by the finance minister especially when monetary policy hasn t been able to stimulate the economy either due to non transmission or otherwise he added the first session of 17th lok sabha will be held from june 17 to july 26 2019 macro data the government will release industrial output data for april and

increased marginally to 2 92 percent from 2 86 percent in previous month but core cpi contracted to 4 6 percent from 5 percent mom other data points to watch in the coming week would be current

government and rbi which does not want this liquidity crisis to turn like us subprime crisis will deal with liquidity issue the malaise was caused due to the rather illiquid nature of assets which the lenders had agreed to finance but since lenders are no longer able to rollover their bonds commercial papers they have no option but to sell the mortgaged assets which has become quite difficult in the current market this temporary funding gap mismatch unless the rbi proactively helps them can snowball into a bigger crises of confidence that can lead equity markets to roll down further jimeet

first a review of last week s events eur usd it seems that mario draghi has already lost the ability to influence the market which is waiting for the arrival of the new head of the ecb to replace him at least the rather soft rhetoric of draghi and his reasoning about a possible quantitative easing sounded last thursday was perceived quite calmly by investors the euro was not weakened by the statement that it was not worth expecting a rate increase until the middle of next year either as a result surprisingly the press conference of the ecb leadership played into the hands of the european currency and the pair went up to the level above 1 1300 there followed a smooth rollback to the level of 1 1250 and a new breakthrough to the north at the time of publication of data on the labor market in the us on friday june 07 experts were prepared for the fact that the nfp indicator the number of new jobs created outside the agricultural sector could shrink by about 30 but almost no one expected a reduction of 3 times from 224k to 75k as a result the pair soared to the level of 1 1345 and the weekly swing was 180 points as for the end of the five day week at the end of the trading session 1 euro was worth 1 1333 gbp usd they say that no news is good news following the resignation of prime minister theresa may there were no significant events in the british isles which allowed the pound to strengthen its position during all week step by step president trump s visit to queen elizabeth ii hit the front pages of the secular but not the economic chronicle and mrs may s efforts who directed the remnants of her influence in order to prevent the hard brexit could only slightly support the uptrend of the british currency the same applies to weak statistics on employment in the united states as a result the pair returned to the highs of a week ago putting the final chord practically where the analysts who were waiting for correction indicated at the level of 1 2733 usd jpy recall that the votes of the experts last week were divided as follows 50 sided with the bears 25 sided with the bulls and 25 stood in the middle confused we can say that it is this discrepancy that is reflected on the pair chart quotes of the yen against the dollar are strongly correlated with the us treasury bonds the fall of the latter stopped on monday june 3 stopping the pair from falling below the mark of 107 80 then the dollar began to regain its position and by the time of the nfp data publication reached the height of 108 65 after which the pair sharply went down felt the bottom at the level of 107 88 and finished the week at 108 18 cryptocurrencies bitcoin has been declared halal in egypt in accordance with the sharia law the new decree lifts the ban on cryptocurrency in force since 2018 and this is probably the best news of the week in general the background was mostly neutral in the absence of the news as many analysts assumed despite attempts to turn the pair up a correction continued the bulls were taking profits and this sale stopped the influx of new investors if on friday may 31 the btc usd pair was at the level of 9 100 on thursday june 6 it fixed a locallow dropping to 7 450 and losing 18 in six days the ethereum chart eth usd almost completely repeated the dynamics of the elder brother bitcoin but the ripple and the litecoin turned out to be much more capable of regeneration thus the xrp usd pair almost returned to the values of the end of the previous week and ltc usd even slightly exceeded them as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd speech by mario draghi on june 6 pushed the euro up on wednesday june 12 we are expecting his next speech from which investors still hope to get clearer guidelines on the ecb s monetary policy for the foreseeable future another source of operational information for the market is president trump s twitter in which he often shares information and plans regarding his trade wars primarily with china as for the exact figures the upcoming week will be devoted to inflation on wednesday the cpi index values will be published by the national bureau of statistics of china on wednesday and friday consumer price indices in the usa will become known and on thursday june 13 the german ones in the meantime expert opinions are divided as follows 60 supported by graphical analysis on d1 and 20 of oscillators that give signals the pair being overbought expect that it will try to break through the support of 1 1215 and retest the lows in the 1 1100 zone the alternative point of view is held by 40 of experts and the vast majority of oscillators and trend indicators in case they are right the pair will be able to consolidate above the level of 1 1400 aiming at the resistance of 1 1525 gbp usd at the beginning of the coming week candidates for the post of the uk conservative party leader will likely be known it will also become more or less clear how many votes they can get by moving to the post of prime minister and to what extent the likelihood of a hard brexit and exit from the eu without an agreement is likely currently 55 of the experts supported by graphical analysis on h4 continue to side with the bulls and 45 side with the bears the trend indicators have exactly the same ratio 55 are for the growth of the pair and 45 stand for its fall oscillators have a slightly different picture there despite the overwhelming advantage of the green 10 of the indicators on h4 and d1 give signals the pair is overbought which can indicate either a fairly strong correction or a beginning of a downward trend some impact on the behavior of the pair may be exercised by the data on the labor market in the uk which will be published on tuesday june 11 but with a high degree of probability it can be assumed that this influence will be mild and short lived usd jpy it is also unlikely that the gdp data in japan which will be released on monday june 10 will have an impact on the market the main drivers are still the yield of us government bonds oil prices and the course of the us china negotiations in such a situation of uncertainty 40 of analysts have turned their eyes to the north 40 to the south and 20 to the east the main support levels are 107 75 and 107 00 resistance levels are 109 15 109 65 110 35 and 110 65 cryptocurrencies will the current bitcoin correction be actually only temporary or is this the beginning of a new downtrend disputes about how applicable methods of analyzing the movement of fiat currencies to digital currencies flare up with a new force proponents of the theory of growth of course are bitcoin holders who are trying in every way to warm up the market with all sorts of news for example the founder of the company dadiani syndicate has reported that she received an order from one of the clients to acquire 25 of all currently issued bitcoins which is about 4 5 million coins worth about 36 billion another piece of news is that only from the beginning of june the largest btc wallets have attracted 2 72 billion but if this is so why despite the influx of these billions the btc usd rate fell by 18 in six days although in fairness it should be noted that at the end of the working week on june 7 both bitcoin and the major altcoins attempted to recover and the btc usd pair returned to the 7 800 8 000 zone which can be considered pivot point for the last three weeks as for analysts at the moment 50 of them believe that the pair should go down to the horizon 7 000 30 for returning to the zone above 9 000 and the remaining 20 are for lateral movement in the channel 7 500 8 450

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by francesco canepa and balazs koranyi fukuoka japan frankfurt reuters european central bank policymakers are open to cutting the ecb s policy rate again if economic growth weakens in the rest of the year and a strong euro hurts a bloc already bearing the brunt of a global trade war two sources said related stories the ecb said on thursday that its interest rates would stay at their present levels until mid 2020 but president mario draghi added rate setters had started a discussion about a possible cut or fresh bond purchases to stimulate inflation the apparently mixed message failed to convince some investors who saw it as too tenuous a commitment to more stimulus this sent the euro rallying to a 2 1 2 month high of 1 1347 against the u s dollar but two sources familiar with the ecb s policy discussions said a rate cut was firmly in play if the bloc s economy was to stagnate again after expanding by 0 4 in the first quarter of the year if inflation and growth slow then a rate cut is warranted said one of the sources who requested anonymity because the ecb s deliberations are confidential an ecb spokesman declined to comment the ecb s deposit rate is already 40 basis points below zero and the bloc s top rated governments such as germany s can borrow at negative rates for up to a decade in this context countering the euro s strength rather than lowering already rock bottom borrowing costs would be the main reason for a further cut to that deposit rate one of the sources said i ll give you five reasons for a rate cut the source said before repeating exchange rate five times the ecb doesn t formally target an exchange rate but draghi noted the euro s appreciation in his news conference on thursday and has long highlighted the currency as a crucial determinant of financing conditions the source said a euro at 1 15 would still be tolerable for some but 1 20 would be a critical level to watch the single currency has risen by 2 against the dollar in just over a week as the federal reserve signaled its willingness to cut its interest rates if needed this was seen by some analysts as a sign the u s central bank was bowing to pressure from the white house to keep the dollar weak and strengthen the administration s hand in its trade negotiations italian central bank governor ignazio visco also blamed the euro s surge after the ecb s latest decision on interactions with u s interest rates the argument for more quantitative easing qe from the ecb was less clear to some policymakers however the sources said one of the sources said more qe could help soothe stock markets if these were spooked by an escalation in the trade war although there would be a risk for the ecb in appearing to kowtow to equity investors the other said the main benefit of qe was compressing the difference between short and long term borrowing costs making access to finance easier for companies and households but this so called term premium was already low reporting by francesco canepa in fukuoka and balazs koranyi in frankfurt editing by christopher cushing and dale hudson
the dovish turn by global central banks is failing to persuade investors that policy makers have what it takes to ignite inflation spurred by flagging global growth and renewed trade frictions the federal reserve and european central bank ecb both flashed new willingness this week to deliver stimulus to their respective economies if necessary their counterparts in india and australia went a step further and cut interest rates but investors are doubling down on bets that inflation won t rebound us break even rates a proxy for inflation expectations fell on friday even as a big miss on jobs and wages prompted traders to up bets on the first fed rate cut in a decade to boot long term price growth expectations in the us as captured by five year five year forward inflation swaps have fallen toward a 27 month low a similar gauge for the euro zone sits below its level during the financial crisis markets may be pricing in concerns that central banks have less room to reduce rates than they once had but there s a more cynical way to read the numbers that policy makers are hamstrung in being able to spur price growth us consumer price index data due wednesday is likely to add to that worry as analysts forecast inflation rose just 0 1 in may from last month down from 0 3 in the previous month economists at jpmorgan chase co this week predicted average inflation in developed markets would slide to 1 6 by the end of this year from 2 1 in the current quarter low inflation is a global phenomenon said zakaria darouich senior fund manager at paris based cpr asset management years of record low interest rates don t seem to have much impact on inflation in terms of investment we don t have strategies in place that envisage inflation going back to targets in the near term part of the problem is that policy makers have little room to act the fed may have hiked interest rates from their record low but their benchmark range 2 25 to 2 5 is still below where it was in the run up other economic slumps less ammo fed cuts to fight past recessions have tended to average 575 basis points according to bank of america corp analysts the ecb and bank of japan neither of which has tightened from record low rates possess even less ammunition they can fire at weakening economies other tools in the central bank arsenal have sparked criticism in the wake of the post crisis bond buying spree quantitative easing is seen as having mixed results the more it s deployed low inflation tends to spur demand for bonds and push down yields as it s interpreted as a signal of slowing growth falling yields can in turn prompt investors to turn to riskier assets like longer dated securities or those with lower credit ratings for their higher returns policy makers appear sanguine even as traders try to call their bluffs ecb president mario draghi said this week that the bank still has headroom while chair jay powell and fellow fed officials met in chicago to discuss ways of changing their monetary policy strategy to tackle a recession that may come sooner than they previously suspected central bankers may be eyeing up the trade war as the biggest threat to their outlooks but citigroup inc economists take a dimmer view easing from central banks without fiscal support from governments won t help policy officials achieve their inflation targets citi argues monetary policy is relatively impotent to achieve the desired outcomes said cesar rojas an economist at the new york based lender it s often posited that forces such as ageing populations technological advances and shifting labor trends are pulling down inflation offsetting these effects is more the job of governments than monetary officials the argument goes even as they too have little room to work given rising debt burdens it is clear that central banks cannot do this alone said paul donovan chief global economist at ubs group ag bloomberg
fukuoka japan global finance leaders meeting in japan this weekend said they were increasingly worried that the trade dispute between the united states and china which shows no signs of abating could propel the world economy into a crisis the sense of gloom at the gathering of the group of 20 major economies came amid increasing evidence that global economic growth is slowing amid president trump s renewed trade war with beijing in a closing statement or communiqué officials at the g 20 warned that trade tensions have intensified and agreed to address the risks but the trump administration intent on rewriting the rules of international commerce in america s favor gave no sign that it was ready to back down treasury secretary steven mnuchin continued to blame china for prolonging the fight and insisted that the trade dispute was not hurting america s economy or hampering global growth i don t think in any way that the slowdowns you re seeing in parts of the world are a result of trade tensions at the moment mr mnuchin told reporters on the sidelines of the g 20
garba shehu urges foreign media to report beyond crime conflict and disease one would imagine that business papers like economic success stories apparently not instead they feast and thrive on negatives financial times for instance is worried about a government policy that is enabling boom in rice production in nigeria and the economist is panicky about toothpick manufacturers springing up following tariffs that protect local manufacturers to get off the ground and compete globally both papers only see negatives specifically economist dwells on out of date statistics deliberately it turns away from the positives as it will complicate already tailored narratives some foreign correspondents keep the storyline simple africa is home for all bad things poverty disease and crime and unremitting bleakness lives on the continent and success is the aberration since only negative reports on africa make it to the international media a backward picture of a nation is painted succinctly and efforts at growth in different ramifications both investment and diplomacy are ignored from the content of these stories readers must be baffled that nigerians know toothpicks let alone be able to manufacture them the fact remains that with squeeze in media budgets there are not enough knowledgeable foreign correspondents based on the continent to report accurate news and uphold journalistic standards and the parachuting style clearly defies ethics and quality to cut cost many media houses rely on the expedience of technology the highly revered and sacrosanct fact checking skill of journalism slips as a result anyone with a laptop is trusted as credible source cogent arguments no longer have a place instead we have jumbled and emotive criticisms for instance the financial times declares proudly that president buhari failed to spur rice growing whilst stating that production was at record levels up 60 per cent in 2018 from what we had in 2013 theeconomist talks about overdependence on oil yet criticises policies such as subsidies or financial incentives that allow local businesses to compete and diversify the economy it frowns at power shortfalls but turns around to attack alhaji aliko dangote the man building the world s largest oil refinery and improving power infrastructure in nigeria fundamentally the foreign correspondents fail to appreciate context understandably if they have to cover a large patch with shoe string budgets but never the less it is impermissible as facts must remain sacred the economist states that the economy was sputtering when president buhari s first term began in 2015 and still concluded he made a bad situation worse sputtering sounds euphemistic the reality is that the economy was on its knees the overdependence on oil paired with impending global commodity crash made the entry into recession at the beginning of the term inevitable now however the first quarter growth of 2019 has been the strongest the international monetary fund imf recently said analysts and onlookers must recognise how deep the shock was to the economy as a famous american business magnate observed only when the tide goes out do you discover who s been swimming naked indeed nigeria had been awash in oil dollars over 100 a barrel yet previous governments failed to add muscle to the economy since the recession struck crude oil went below 40 per barrel the government has taken measures to redress weaknesses in our economy the imf goes on to praise the strong diversification in the economy and welcome the focus on public investment for instance the government has spent record figures on infrastructure in the past two years and capital expenditure is now around 30 per cent of the budget rather than inadequate 10 per cent in 2015 there has also been a drive to self sufficiency where possible it makes no sense for nigeria to import rice yet foreign shipments were dumped to maintain dependency farmers needed help strategic tariffs were applied to allow for initial competition whilst the central bank of nigeria financial initiatives allowed growers to access capital for fertilizer and equipment over the past three years production has risen year on year nigeria as of 2018 is africa s largest producer of rice self sufficiency has almost been attained from reading some foreign articles you would be surprised to find these success stories mentioned amazed that anyone would cheer the decision on tariffs to ward off desolation and the failure to see or present any achievement perpetuates stereotypes that serve as disincentives to foreign direct investment and partnership granted there are challenges in nigeria the country is a large and diverse nation with structural challenges that have been passed down through decades but foreign reports ignore the complexity and instead offer platitudes as solutions this diminishes the difficulties facing those in governance they must merely stamp out corruption or improve governance common advice amongst those quick to criticise but barren in tangible and measurable solutions similarly we are told to harness the vim of nigerians which is true but this seems obvious as to even need mentioning it is to be sure how you do that we in governance have no illusion about this vim is harnessed when a nation has decent infrastructure that connects the economy and thousands of miles of road have been constructed as well as the expansion and upgrading of colonial era railway network when children have good education we are currently ensuring nine million free school meals daily across the nation and it has boosted enrolment and attendance and when business reforms create enabling environment already nigeria has gone up 24 places in ease of doing business ranking since 2018 and the country is currently one of the top 10 global reformers which is good news shehu is senior special assistant to the president on media publicity

washington june 8 us job growth slowed sharply in may and wages rose less than expected raising fears that a loss of momentum in economic activity could be spreading to the labor market which could put pressure on the federal reserve to cut interest rates this year advertisement the broad cool off in hiring reported by the labor department yesterday was before a recent escalation in trade tensions between the united states and two of its major trading partners china and mexico analysts have warned the trade fights could undermine the economy which will celebrate 10 years of expansion next month the longest on record adding a sting to the closely watched employment report far fewer jobs were created in march and april than previously reported indicating that hiring had shifted into a lower gear the labor market thus far has been largely resilient to the trade war with china today s report makes a cut more likely and supports our view that the trade tensions will ultimately slow growth enough for the fed to respond in september and december with cuts said joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch in new york advertisement nonfarm payrolls increased by 75 000 jobs last month the government said it was the second time this year that job gains dropped below 100 000 economists polled by reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 185 000 jobs last month job growth in march and april was revised down by 75 000 president donald trump in early may slapped additional tariffs of up to 25per cent on us 200 billion rm829 6 billion of chinese goods which prompted retaliation by beijing last week trump said he would impose a tariff on all goods from mexico to force authorities in that country to stop immigrants from central america from crossing the border into the united states talks to prevent the duties from kicking in at 5per cent on june 10 continue fed chairman jerome powell said on tuesday the us central bank was closely monitoring the implications of the trade tensions on the economy and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion advertisement trump who has routinely tweeted about the strong labor market made no comment about may s weak hiring but defended duties on chinese goods white house economic adviser kevin hassett told fox business network that bad weather in the midwest was to blame and described the meager job gains as a little bit of a blip down economists however said there was nothing to suggest the weather was the culprit the weakness in job growth was broadly experienced across industry groups and not obviously driven by distortions such as weather or strikes said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york us house of representative speaker nancy pelosi a democrat said the employment report was a disturbing sign that the administration s disastrous special interest agenda is hollowing out our economy following the report financial markets priced in a rate cut as early as july and two more later this year economists however believe the fed will probably wait for more signs of labor market weakness and clarity on the trade issues before easing monetary policy fed officials are due to meet on june 18 19 fed officials are likely to remain cautious at the june meeting and keep all their options open said michael hanson head of global macro strategy at td securities in new york the dollar fell to a 2 1 2 month low against a basket of currencies while us treasury prices rose stocks on wall street were trading higher worker shortages last month s slowdown in job gains however probably understates the labor market s health as layoffs remain low employment gains over the last three months have averaged 151 000 above the roughly 100 000 needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population in the four months since the first hiccup in hiring appeared in february however monthly payrolls gains have averaged just 127 000 the slowest pace over a comparable stretch in nearly seven years some of the weakness in hiring could be because of worker shortages especially in the construction transportation and manufacturing sectors but the worker shortage argument is somewhat undercut by moderate wage growth average hourly earnings grew just 3 1per cent year over year the slowest annual increase since september just three months earlier wages had been rising at their fastest rate in a decade but gains have moderated since the tepid employment report added to soft data on consumer spending business investment manufacturing and homes sales in suggesting the economy was losing momentum in the second quarter following a temporary boost from exports inventory accumulation and defence spending growth is cooling as the massive stimulus from last year s tax cuts and spending increases fades the atlanta fed is forecasting gross domestic product rising at a 1 4per cent annualised rate in the second quarter the economy grew at a 3 1per cent pace in the first quarter the unemployment rate remained near a 50 year low of 3 6per cent in may a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 1per cent last month the lowest since december 2000 hiring slowed across all sectors in may with the share of industries showing job gains during the month the smallest since july 2016 manufacturing payrolls increased by 3 000 last month after gaining 5 000 positions in april the sector is struggling with an inventory overhang that has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders at factories employers in the construction sector hired 4 000 workers in may after adding 30 000 jobs to payrolls in april professional and business services employment rose by 33 000 transportation and warehousing payrolls fell as did retail employment government shed 15 000 jobs the most in 16 months reuters
central bank of kenya governor dr patrick njoroge holds the new and old sh1 000 notes when he unveiled the new currencies on june 3 2019 it is the paradox of our time that on the day we were celebrating self rule madaraka day the breaking news was demonetisation of sh1 000 note in economics speak it is the withdrawal of a currency from circulation the timing was perfect during a holiday and more so when celebrating self rule did this breaking news mean we are still struggling to self rule ourselves on the economic front 56 years later was the timing supposed to give us a weekend to digest the news or was it to stop a rush to banks and forex bureaus did the news catch us flat footed or we anticipated it after a similar move in india in 2016 that apart does central bank of kenya cbk have a museum of currencies beyond the demonetisation of the sh1000 note we have new coins and notes that is what the constitution demanded new currencies without human portraits the thinking supported by murang a senator irungu kang ata is that such portraits on the currency can be politically polarising interestingly even the us whose constitution we copied uses portraits of presidents on their currencies but they must not be living beyond constitutional requirements why else are we changing the currency or demonetising one reason is counterfeiting the new currency notes and coins are harder to fake seen canadian notes they are smaller and easier to carry and hopefully longer lasting two the focus on the big note ngiri or thau is because of its alternative use not just as a medium of exchange it s an alternative bank if you want to keep money at home or elsewhere use this note you need less space and less weight if carrying it around have you noted the booming business in safes the yellow pages showed very few safe dealers in the past today they are many i doubt if we are buying safes to keep our exam certificates and title deeds only but let us be fair to ourselves we keep money at home or office for a number of reasons we prefer cash to see the money in transactions i noted the other day that casual workers want cash not m pesa there is some pride in handling real cash that is why mobile banking has not picked as fast as expected we also keep cash for emergencies illegal or shadow economy prefers cash you can t write a check when buying cocaine cash leaves no trail that makes it hard for the taxman to get you or even the police it is not just the sh1000 note that is popular in illegal business or underworld the 100 note and 200 and 500 euro notes are popular too lots of such notes disappear from circulation into underworld such big notes are popular in corruption deals if you are getting a cut of sh100m cash would be preferred again no trail no tax the new stringent cbk regulation might have inadvertently pushed lots of people into ngiri notes instead of answering so many questions in the bank when opening an account why not just keep that money at home did i hear a lot of kenyans have opened accounts in the neighbouring countries because of our stringent banking regulations while the target is fraudsters and terrorists innocent businessmen and women are caught in between the cbk fined some banks for handling nys money that has made them implement the regulations to the letter never mind the rising cost of compliance both for banks and customers demonetisation is more than meets the eye recent police raids have found lots of cash in a number of homes there is a widely held belief that some people have bunkers full of money this is probably the money cbk is targeting any money got through your sweat is likely to be banked for safe keeping and made available to the formal economy it can be lent to investors or government through treasury bills and bonds hoarding money at home slows down the intermediating role of banks in general demonetisation and introduction of new coins and notes is good in the long run more money in the formal system will give our economy a much needed boost less counterfeits will restore faith in our currency we hope the noblest objective will be achieved reducing corruption proceeds from corrupt deals and counterfeits could be used to fund terrorism or other activities that are a threat to national security counterfeits and corruption discourage hard working and innovation which are critical to economic growth if counterfeits lead to inflation even the innocent suffer where do we go from here this policy shift despite its huge publicity affects few people how many kenyans carry sh1000 note in the countryside getting change for such a note can be a tall order but the few who keep such notes are influential and not always positively expect vibrancy in some sectors as the few try to bring their money from the shadows real estate is one could lots of buildings start coming up could there be an explosion of generosity as such money hoarder s reason it s better to give than to lose what of buying luxuries like cars or expensive perfumes there is no limit to what one can do to clean money the amount of money held in sh1000 note is about sh218b about 8 percent of the proposed sh2 7 trillion budget that might be a big boast to the economy and taxman we anticipate no significant inflation as those hoarding that money try to get it into formal system let s face it the effects of demonetisation of sh1 000 notes might not be as severe as expected data from stock exchange does not show a big shift in the index the exchange rate has not shifted significantly too could it be because we had the weekend to digest the news was the breaking news old news to some the financial sector is the nervous system of an economy we hope the cbk reforms including demonetisation will make it more efficient so far cbk has done an exemplary job in stabilising the exchange rate and inflation one joke i heard is that instead of throwing away the old notes we can use them to pay our foreign debts that is gross misunderstanding of how an economic system works it s akin to suggesting that we should print money give it to everyone and declare an endless holiday money obeys the laws of supply and demand we would end up with hyperinflation and your money would be of little use zimbabwe shows what can happen if money supply is increased recklessly south american nations had a similar problem in the 80s and so did germany during world war ii finally academics have a golden opportunity to study the effects of policy changes live without textbooks and their inert ideas phd students where are you where are behavioural economists the writer teaches at the university of nairobi
published monday 10 june 2019 print disqus dear ray income and wealth inequality is capitalism the problem boston new york and the ideas of economists and political philosophers both when they are right and when they are wrong are more powerful than is commonly understood indeed the world is ruled by little else practical men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences are usually slaves of some defunct economist john maynard keynes nothing is more dangerous than a dogmatic worldview nothing more constraining more blinding to innovation more destructive of openness to novelty stephen jay gould inequality has emerged as a major issue in the us and beyond a generation ago it could reasonably have been asserted that the overall growth rate of the economy was the main influence on the growth in middle class incomes and progress in reducing poverty this is no longer a plausible claim the share of income going to the top 1 percent of earners has increased sharply a rising share of output is going to profits real wages are stagnant family incomes have not risen as fast as productivity the cumulative effect of all these developments is that the us may well be on the way to becoming a downton abbey economy it is very likely that these issues will be with us long after the cyclical conditions have normalized and budget deficits have at last been addressed lawrence summers in the financial times february 2014 ray dalio is the thoughtful somewhat controversial founder of the world s largest hedge fund bridgewater associates which he started in 1975 while much of his writing is private i and many others peruse every word we can of his and the bridgewater team s thinking i find it to be some of the most interesting market commentary i read lately ray read his bio here has been far more open with his thinking posting books and essays this letter is the beginning of a response to his articles why and how capitalism needs to be reformed parts 1 and 2 and a follow up piece titled it s time to look more carefully at monetary policy 3 mp3 and modern monetary theory he posted both publicly on linkedin on first reading those i will admit to thinking ray dalio is kinda sorta wrong i agreed with much of part 1 with a few quibbles ditto for part 2 but when i read the third piece i found myself thinking ray dalio is really really wrong in that essay he basically endorses modern monetary theory mmt coming from someone of ray s stature and knowing that others like bill gross are beginning to endorse mmt either obliquely or directly i found myself wanting to shout stop this is dangerous as it turns out ray and i have mutual friends and none describe him as particularly dangerous they have nothing but good things to say about him both businesswise and personally he is clearly a generous man and watching him in interviews and on stage he is both disarming and comes across rather warmly definitely not dangerous but ideas have consequences ray s essays are in his typical conversational style there are plenty of footnotes and explanations in the combined 12 348 words which fill 42 pages not counting footnotes and appendixes almost any reader would agree with much of the first two part essay ray has done us all a service by pointing out the elephants in the room some tinged with pink which are rarely mentioned in public discourse we discuss various parts of the elephant but seldom the entire creature by that i mean the rapidly growing potential for left of center progressive control of both congress and the white house part of that growth stems from an increasing frustration over the perceived differences between haves and have nots between the protected and unprotected combined with fascination for government solutions to our society s perceived ills as the economist reported recently 51 of those polled between ages 18 29 have a positive view of socialism that should scare you source the economist a growing number of that generation are taking that view into the voting booth democratic presidential candidates are all burnishing their progressive credentials i have zero insight into who might win that nomination fight but there is a more than reasonable chance it will be the most left leaning presidential nominee in a very long time since at least george mcgovern for whom i voted and given the potential for recession between now and the election they have a reasonable chance of winning just as trump figured out how to energize the frustration of enough voters to win the presidency it is likely we will see a populist nominated on the democratic side a democratic president and congress will give us higher spending and taxes and if that election happens amid recession there will be an increasing drumbeat to do something radical the already huge 2 trillion deficit we will have by then could easily swell even more dalio to his credit recognizes that would be a negative outcome he proposes dealing with the increasing deficit and debt via modern monetary theory mmt or directly printing money he also hopes it would help equalize the increasing income and wealth disparities but i m jumping ahead of myself today i ll begin an open multipart letter back to ray in a conversational response he addresses problems that are quite real and proposes solutions we may not like them but at least he has ideas his tone invites discourse and so i intend to reply in that spirit this is a potential learning moment for us all dear ray first i want to thank you for the insight and wisdom you ve offered over your career they have intellectually enriched many of us i find much to admire in your most recent essays but a few points leave me with serious trepidation that being said i think we generally agree on the problems and specifically that they pose a serious threat to us economic and social well being you use the word existential threat or risk several times in the essays someone as thoughtful as you doesn t use that language lightly you talk about wealth and income disparity as a failure of capitalism quoting from you over these many years i have also seen capitalism evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of americans because it s producing self reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have nots this is creating widening income wealth opportunity gaps that pose existential threats to the united states because these gaps are bringing about damaging domestic and international conflicts and weakening america s condition i think that most capitalists don t know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists don t know how to grow it well yet we are now at a juncture in which either a people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie which explains why i think that not reforming capitalism would be an existential threat to the us these conditions pose an existential risk for the us the previously described income wealth opportunity gap and its manifestations pose existential threats to the us because these conditions weaken the us economically threaten to bring about painful and counterproductive domestic conflict and undermine the united states strength relative to that of its global competitors i agree with this the current situation could easily become a series of crises that would in fact be existential as seen from today s relatively benign world we are being forced into difficult choices both political and economic and the longer we kick the proverbial can down the road not dealing with the real fundamental issues the more difficult and starker those choices will be we are rapidly approaching a time in which there will be no good choices only extremely difficult controversial and or bad choices none of which resolve the fundamental problems that said we need to make sure our choices don t exacerbate the problems let s start with what i think we agree upon we both recognize that there is widening wealth and income disparity in the us i would point out that that is a worldwide trend but agree it applies to the us in particular this is causing political frustration with what you term the potential to bring about painful and counterproductive domestic conflict if by that you mean serious partisan divisiveness and angry rhetoric i completely agree the risk is that we veer widely from side to side of the road and never find the middle income and wealth inequality for the benefit of this letter s readers let s recap some of your charts along with a few from my own letters on these subjects you generally compare the top 40 and bottom 60 you could have made a starker comparison using 80 20 or 90 10 or even 99 1 i congratulate you on avoiding the extremes to make your case let s look at some of your charts this first one is self explanatory showing the top 40 have seen their incomes rise significantly while the bottom 60 have been flat for almost 50 years source ray dalio i find in these next charts some of the more disheartening trends you describe as i m sure you know survey data shows this may be the first generation in a long time that doesn t expect their children will see higher living standards whatever the american dream is the hope that we have for our children is embodied in it that hope seems to be slipping away and it aggravates the political angst that concerns us both source ray dalio the difference is even clearer when you look at the top 1 versus the bottom 90 source ray dalio and when you look at income distribution and growth by quintiles over the last almost 50 years it s a very sobering reality source ray dalio my friend bruce mehlman shows it in different ways which i used recently in a letter on inequality source bruce mehlman here s another one comparing stock market growth with family net worth this isn t really surprising since we know the top quintile owns most of the stocks the lower 80 see little direct benefit but the magnitude of the disparity is still remarkable source bruce mehlman i agree with you that the following is the most discouraging trend while most americans think of the us as being a country of great economic mobility and opportunity its economic mobility rate is now one of the worst in the developed world for the bottom as shown below in the us people in the bottom income quartile have a 40 chance of having a father in the bottom quartile in the father s prime earning years and people in the top quartile have only about an 8 chance of having a father in the bottom quartile suggesting half of the average probability of moving up and one of the worst probabilities of the countries analyzed in a country of equal opportunity that would not exist source ray dalio this is yet another cause of the widening political and social divides when parents no longer have hope their children can lead better lives when children no longer feel they can rise above the result is higher partisanship and populism is capitalism the problem you argue that capitalism is not achieving its goal of more equitably distributing the fruits of capitalism to your point my good friend ben hunt of epsilon theory notes that the s p 500 companies have the highest earnings relative to sales in history source ben hunt let me push back with what is admittedly a small quibble in the grand scheme of things i think of capitalism more in the context of property rights rule of law and free markets properly understood it provides a level playing field for entrepreneurs to offer goods and services that produce incomes and profits i don t think equitably distributing those profits is capitalism s role ensuring that all participants are treated fairly and to some extent regulating these personal and corporate endeavors is the role of society in general and government in particular so when you say that capitalists are not very good at sharing profits i would say that capitalism is not designed to do so that is the role of society and government yes capitalists are part of that society and in general prefer to keep more of their profits and have less regulation i agree that capitalists are not very good at distribution because of their own self interest and as you point out when people begin to sense that their own particular interests are not being fairly addressed there is the potential for political crisis quoting rather extensively from your letter the problem is that capitalists typically don t know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don t know how to grow it well while one might hope that when such economic polarity and poor conditions exist leaders would pull together to reform the system to both divide the economic pie and make it grow better which is certainly doable and the best path they typically become progressively more extreme and fight more than cooperate in order to understand the phenomenon of populism two years ago i did a study of it in which i looked at 14 iconic cases and observed the patterns and the forces behind them if you are interested in it you can read it here in brief i learned that populism arises when strong fighters leaders of the right or of the left who are looking to fight and defeat the opposition come to power and escalate their conflict with the opposition which typically galvanizes around comparably strong fighting leaders the most important thing to watch as populism develops is how conflict is handled whether the opposing forces can coexist to make progress or whether they increasingly go to war to block and hurt each other and cause gridlock in the worst cases this conflict causes economic problems e g via paralyzing strikes and demonstrations and can even lead to moves from democratic leadership to autocratic leadership as happened in a number of countries in the 1930s we are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large in the us the ideological polarity is greater than it has ever been and the willingness to compromise is less than it s ever been the chart on the left shows how conservative republican senators and representatives have been and how liberal democratic senators and representatives have been going back to 1900 as you can see they are each more extreme and they are more divided than ever before the chart on the right shows what percentage of them have voted along party lines going back to 1790 which is now the greatest ever in other words they have more polar extreme positions and they are more solidified in those positions than ever and we are coming into a presidential election year we can expect a hell of a battle source ray dalio i sadly agree that we are entering a period of rather severe partisanship as a long time participant in the political process i think we are further from reasonable discussion and compromise than at any time of my life i suspect you would agree as we are almost the same age let me offer some thoughts on how the conflicts will unfold and then present another possible solution as you will see i think mmt would make our problems even more intractable and raise the likelihood of a severe crisis to be continued next week we will deal with ray s further analysis of our problems some of which i agree with and then we ll get into the most significant dispute that of using mmt i think this is an important conversation not just between two people but throughout the entire nation the answers to the questions posed by the problems we agree upon will make a huge difference to both our society and our children s future not to mention our own future boston new york and i am enjoying the beautiful weather here in puerto rico at the end of the month shane and i will fly to boston to be with our good friends steve cucchiaro and his future bride jama to help celebrate their wedding then shane goes to california for a week while i meet with my mauldin economics partners in boston and then take the train down to new york for a few days of meetings and media then on july 4 i fly to well i m not sure the next destination is up in the air as no meetings have been confirmed hopefully i will know by this time next week then i will meet up with shane and we will go back to puerto rico puerto rico or something has been very good for me ten years ago i developed what my doctor mike roizen author of many best selling books and otherwise known as oprah s doctor diagnosed as late onset high blood pressure sometime around age 59 someone took my blood pressure dial which for all my life had been quite normal and cranked it to the right mike told me there are 10 things that are important about staying healthy and the first three are blood pressure blood pressure and blood pressure he put me on two standard blood pressure medicines they brought my blood pressure back under control a few years later i stopped taking one of them as my blood pressure became more stable in my latest checkup this year they found a little plaque in one of my arteries in addition to prescribing a mild statin mike really stressed the importance of my diet shane has me eating mostly fish and chicken in addition to cutting out cheese and dairy this has been good for my weight but oddly a few weeks ago my blood pressure began to drop significantly the answer was to adjust my blood pressure medicine to an even smaller dose i seem not to need as much because my body likes either the fish or the island lifestyle maybe some of both it will be interesting to see if i reach the point where i don t need any medicine at all one can dream it s time to hit the send button i want to thank the many people who have been talking with me about ray dalio s writings you know who you are this has been a significant learning experience for me and it certainly helped clarify my thinking about what i have been calling the great reset and japanification the cloudy crystal ball is getting a little bit clearer let me

for several years now officials at the federal reserve claim that they are data driven well the markets continue to take the fed at its word after favorable words by fed chairman jerome powell and other federal reserve officials this week the stock market has took off bond prices rose and the value of the us dollar declined the stock market rose due to hints that federal reserve officials might lower the policy rate of interest this year once if not twice this move just confirms the relationship built up over the past ten years or so between the stock market and a supportive federal reserve bond market prices rose because the statements from chairman powell and others signaled to investors that the data being received by the fed indicated a slowing down of the economy and continued modest price increases the value of the us dollar declined because the expectation of lower interest rates causes the dollar to drop relative to currencies of other nations that are not expected to drop their policy rates of interest on friday news from the labor market appeared to support these feelings only 75 000 jobs were added to the economy in may one of the lowest totals since the end of the great recession economists took this low number as another indication that the us economy seemed to be slowing â the dow jones industrial average extended its rally friday putting the index on pace for its best week in more than six months after lackluster employment figures for may fanned investorsâ expectations of loosened monetary policy â thus with the data moving this way officials at the federal reserve can feel justified in leaning toward lowering the fedâ s policy rate of interest because of the changing economic conditions many fed officials especially chairman powell seemed to be uncomfortable talking about lowering the rate if it appeared as if president trump was bullying them into such a move the target range for the federal funds rate is now 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent and the effective federal funds rate has varied between 2 37 percent and 2 45 percent ever since the fed changed the range in the middle of december 2018 at the same time the yield on the 3 month treasury bill is just under 2 30 percent for much of this year this yield has varied between 2 35 percent and 2 45 percent thus from late december 2019 the 3 month yield has been close to or above the yield on the 5 year us treasury note and since early may this has placed it near the yield on the 10 year treasury note the flat or inverted yield curve one can argue however that the inversion of the yield curve has come from the decline in the longer term end of the bond market whereas the 3 month rate rose with the increase of the fedâ s policy rate of interest in the november december time period the yield on the 10 year treasury note has fallen dramatically since that time just before the fed raised the policy rate in december 2018 the 10 year treasury yield was up in the 2 80 percent to 2 90 percent range the decline in this longer term security came through a fall in the yield on the treasury inflation protected securities otcpk tips while inflationary expectations remained roughly the same note the yield on the 10 year tips dropped by over 70 basis points from about 110 basis points in the middle of december 2018 to just under 40 basis points in recent trading two things in particular have changed first investors grew more and more concerned over the strength of economic growth throughout the past six months or so markets have reflected a decline in optimism about economic growth both in the united statesâ and in europeâ and in the world secondly there has been a major change in the trade talks that have been going on in the world followed by the threat by president trump about raising tariffs on mexican produced goods these events have changed the whole psychology of the market place and have created an ever increasing problem for the fed this has raised another question to me â can the fed stay in control â to me this is a very precarious time for the fed i believe that the federal reserve has done a very good job in getting us where we are today but market conditions and political conditions are creating lots and lots of uncertainty an uncertainty that fed officials have to deal with in setting monetary policy right now chairman powell and other fed officials are using verbal guidance to guide the markets this as described above has buoyed the financial marketsâ at least for the near term but 2019 is not going to be an easy time given all that is taking place and given all that could take place we have the known unknowns to thing about but then there are the unknown unknowns how will the fed handle them and how will markets react federal reserve officials still are pursuing the goal of reducing the fedâ s securities portfolio so far this quarter from march 27 through june 4 the securities portfolio has decline by more than 106 billion this pace is still in keeping with the original fed targets of at this time removing about 50 billion in securities each month overall since this â reductionâ operation started the fed has overseen a decline of just over 600 billion in the securities portfolio reserve balances at federal reserve banks a proxy for â excess reservesâ has declined by almost 620 since the program started the crucial thing to remember about this effort is that the fed has always stated that it would err on the side of not reducing the portfolio too fact because it did not want to create any liquidity problems for the banking system in my research i have seen no indication that the reduction achieved by the fed has caused any liquidity problems in the banking system the banking system seems to have a very adequate amount of liquidity and so the adventures of the fed continue their actions still need to be closely watched
