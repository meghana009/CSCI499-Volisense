my unpublished 100 000 word book the financial jigsaw is being serialised here weekly in 100 issues by peter j underwood author quote of the week it is the absence of facts that frightens people the gap you open into which they pour their fears fantasies desires hilary mantel last week we looked at further examples of inflation models and more thought experiments to illustrate how difficult it is to build effective inflation and deflation models in a multi product economy here is the link to last week issue 47 stock buy backs and its effects on asset inflation we have already looked at this subject but it again raises its ugly head as the markets continue to swoon and we go into the new quarter this could mean inflation down the track what this means is the following with buybacks having become the most important marginal buyer of stocks the one trading desk that dominates the daily flow of buybacks which amount to just under 3 billion in gross purchases each and every day has more influence on the overall market than even the ny fed and the person who controls that trading desk will be the most powerful person on wall street meet neil kearns a name few have ever heard of certainly not a name on par with stevie cohen israel englander larry fink lloyd blankfein jamie dimon bill dudley or any other hedge fund billionaire that is part of the wall street folklore is the head of goldman sachs corporate trading desk now that brexit might be coming to a conclusion after almost three years i will continue to provide weekly updates as events progress brexit update 19th april 2019 parliament is in recess so little to report on this front at present they are all happily off on their holidays to exotic places as befits our endangered leaders let s hope they enjoy the rest because when they get back all hell is going to be let loose why if theresa may and jeremy corbyn continue to engage in head to head discussions with no effective outcome then the european elections in uk on 23rd may will go ahead and the tory government is going to be slaughtered the brexit deadline to 31st october 2019 remains in place unless the pm can get parliament to agree an exit plan beforehand at present this looks unlikely but with a review at the end of june with a decision to leave passed by parliament by 22nd june the uk will avoid confirmation of the eu elections having taken place on 23nd may 2019 and an extract from zerohedge over in the uk as everyone starts thinking about chocolate eggs there has still been no brexit breakthrough rather talks between labour and the tories over a brexit compromise are apparently close to stalling as should come as no surprise to anyone who knows uk politics tory plotters are working to undermine pm may s authority even further and there are warnings from germany that there will be no further extensions to brexit after october mr market is having none of this however and gbp remains around 1 30 details of parliament s deliberations can be found here the launch of the new brexit party headed by nigel farage passed successfully this week and with nearly 1 000 applications to be a candidate for the eu elections they have plenty of choice for some sterling personalities to challenge the wilting tory party and the non starter labour party with their failure in chief jeremy corbyn dragging down their vote as well as the tories imminent demise while we are on the subject of brexit this article might be worth a visit as it describes what perhaps divides the leavers and remainers with such ferocity chapter 9 inflation deflation there are known knowns there are things we know that we know there are known unknowns there are things that we now know we don t know but there are also unknown unknowns there are things we do not know we don t know the original source of this koan may be landmark education of seattle washington although generally it is attributed to former us defence secretary donald rumsfeld there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics mark twain in the absence of the gold standard there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation there is no safe store of value alan greenspan the austrian school of economics has sound answers i am a supporter of the austrian school of economics which has always claimed fear the boom not the bust it is in boom times when periods of rapid economic growth sow the seeds for a crushing collapse as experienced in 2008 following the 2001 07 expansion bubble which burst with serious consequences it may be claimed officially that today we continue to suffer these consequences by having been in a period of disinflation reduction in the rate of inflation not to be confused with deflation negative overall inflation which i contend we have in fact suffered for at least ten years in the same way that our politicians claim to be reducing the deficit but are not reducing the overall government debt disinflation is a reduction in the rate of inflation rather than actual deflation which is the reverse of inflation austrian economic models will be discussed in chapter 11 macroeconomics 101 in a few months time inflation and the velocity of money inflation is accumulative in the same way that debt accumulates over time so that a measured annual rate of inflation compounds on a previous year s inflation and results in a serious loss of purchasing power sometimes over short periods of time for example if last year the rate of inflation was 10 per annum and this year it falls to 9 per annum we can say that we are in a period of disinflation likewise if inflation suddenly falls to 1 then we can say deflation has occurred in that year but either way over say five years inflation has continued its ominous trend a compounding effect however there is another aspect to inflation which is not always obvious and has to do with the rate at which money moves through the economy and described by economists as the velocity of money a simple equation links four variables associated with inflation caused by the changes in the supply of money which was proposed by the economist irving fisher in 1911 m x v p x q where m is the total dollars in the nation s money supply v is the number of times per year each dollar is spent velocity of money p is the average price of all the goods and services sold during the year q is the quantity of assets goods and services sold during the year this formula is purely theoretical and does not take into account one of the most important influences on economies that of the combined effect of each individual s behaviour otherwise known as the aggregate of demand and now part of behavioural economics we see that each term is defined by the values of the other three unlike the other terms the velocity of money has no independent measure and can only be estimated by dividing pxq by m some supporters of this quantity theory of money claim that the velocity of money is stable and predictable it is suggested that it is determined mostly by financial institutions if that assumption is valid then changes in m can be used to predict changes in pxq if this is not true then a model of v is required in order for the equation of exchange to be useful as a macroeconomics model or as a predictor of prices and therefore inflation financial repression is a method to engender artificial low interest rates the uncertainty surrounding the theory of money and its unpredictability made policy makers at the federal reserve rely less on the money supply in controlling the u s economy instead the policy focus has shifted to interest rates such as the setting of interest rate targets by the federal reserve using money printing to maintain their targets which at present are extremely low in historical terms these low rates are distorting economic signals which are so necessary for the smooth functioning of markets causing variable volatility globally within all markets this process is referred to as financial repression and many believe that the federal reserve has no option but to continue printing money qe forever because if they don t the markets could collapse overnight changes in money supply influence inflation ignoring the effects of monetary growth on real purchases and the velocity of money suggests that the growth of the money supply may cause different kinds of inflation at different times for example rises in the u s money supply money printing between the 1970s and the present time encouraged first a rise in the inflation rate for newly produced goods and services in the 1970s and then asset price inflation in later decades it may have encouraged a stock market boom in the 1980s and 1990s and then after 2001 a rise in home prices being the famous housing bubble which collapsed in 2008 this theory assumes that the amounts of money in circulation are the causes of these different types of inflation rather than being the results of an economy s normal reactions to supply and demand the fact remains that inflation and financial repression work together they are inseparable partners and as inflation develops financial repression evolves into plain confiscation following the 2008 crisis we have seen only increasing financial repression mostly in the form of price manipulation some of this manipulation is overt as with interest rates and some is hidden as indicated by gold price manipulation the consumer price index cpi or the published unemployment rates as the us national debt interminably grows this manipulation will be increasingly exposed and the general fear of confiscation will become tangible and in the public domain any rational investor can see that his bank account is at risk of confiscation and that the likelihood of being caught in a bank run is rising daily little is being discussed in the mainstream media about withdrawal rates of money from bank deposits in the eu uk and usa but it is happening the cyprus event is having its effect on the behaviour of bond investors who are classed as the smart money and who are ensuring the safety of their wealth by moving it to safer places the destruction of a currency through hyperinflation governments need bank deposits to fund the bonds they force their banks to buy regulations the pressure on the bankers and the open threats are all part of the same means to coerce bankers to fund their debts with your savings hyperinflation is the ultimate and most expensive bailout of a broken banking system which every holder of the currency is forced to pay in a losing proposition as it inevitably ends in a final destruction of the currency there are plenty of examples venezuela being the most recent poster child with zimbabwe and argentina not far behind turkey is looking vulnerable too hyperinflation is the ultimate failure of an economic system which can be a good thing because like a forest fire it is not until the old debris is swept away that a new system can grow and prosper this is the hope upon which we must all rely the shrinkage of an economic system exacerbates a fall in tax revenue and increases the intervention of central banks leading to the self fulfilling outcome of unmanageable government fiscal deficits production output will fall and produce a shortage of goods together with an increase in the circulation of money which triggers higher inflation the general reaction of government is to implement price controls which further distort the normal operation of markets and worsens the situation politicians and bankers are left powerless we can now see how rising interest rates which attract deposits and hyperinflation can go together the loss of confidence in the system will push interest rates higher which causes even more difficulty in producing goods unleashing shortages and higher prices ludwig von mises remembered in the case of the german hyperinflation with a 900 per cent interest rate in september 1923 the reichbank was practically giving money away chapter 7 of his book money method and the market process it is during a period of high inflation in goods not matched by a balanced increase in wages that people soon begin to vote with their feet and leave the system altogether this is happening already across the world under a process known as system d when people opt out of the traditional market systems altogether the wage slaves finally wake up and decide that at a certain point one is better off working outside the system to avoid this hidden inflation tax and of course all government taxes just like the romans who left their cities during the slow decline of their empire millions of workers in the developed world could decide to become self employed and leave the system this happens to be a typical characteristic of under developed economies where it is nigh impossible for government to collect sufficient taxes to fund society this feature of economies in decline is witnessed all too obviously in venezuela as well as italy greece and spain today as their economies implode on the anvil of austerity imposed by the eu imf and ecb

the divergence thesis that drives our constructive outlook for the dollar received more support last week than we expected a few hours after investors learned that japan s flash pmi remained below the 50 boom bust level europe reported disappointing pmi data as well and a few hours after that the us reported that retail sales surged in march by the most in a year and a half 1 6 this coupled with the new cyclical low in weekly jobless claims boosted gdp forecasts quieted the recession talk with some markets closed on monday the week not only will have a slow start but the potential to change the investment climate is low the us earnings season continues with some favorites like amazon facebook twitter and microsoft on tap boeing also reports and some economists see the grounding of the 737 max and production cuts shaving us q2 gdp by a 0 2 0 3 through slower equipment spending and exports at the end of the week s p reviews greece and italian debt italy s rating will likely be kept at bbb where both moody s and fitch also are there is a reasonable chance that greece s rating is revised up from the current b s p has a positive outlook for greece it would be a catch up move as fitch already put greece at bb last august with a stable outlook we provide a thumbnail sketch of the six events that will command attention two major central banks meet bank of japan and the bank of canada there are two big data points us q1 gdp and australia q1 gdp there are two official events as the uk parliament returns from the vacation and brexit remains the focus though may 2 local elections will steal some attention and us china trade talks resume 1 bank of japan governor kuroda indicated recently that the boj could provide additional easing if the price gains lost momentum this seems to be a bluff for more than a year now kuroda has slowed the pace of bond purchases in fact catching the market by surprise it the boj announced before the weekend that it would reduce the amount of long term bonds it will purchase for the first time in a few months there seems to be little appetite for a deeper cut in the minus 10 bp deposit rate or the zero target of the 10 year benchmark yield capped at 20 bp the japanese economy stagnated in h2 18 and the economy may have contracted in q1 19 the all industries index is a proxy for gdp and after falling by 0 2 in january it is expected to have fallen by 0 1 in february and will be reported before the boj meets exports fell for four consecutive months through march core inflation which the boj targets excludes fresh food stood at 0 8 it peaked at 1 0 last september and october operationally the closure of the local markets and settlement for ten days later this month for the ascension of the new emperor will likely require massive injections of liquidity which could weigh on the yen kuroda wants to project a central bank with tools and will at its disposal but it seems increasingly exhausted the boj may reduce outlook for exports and production trade talks with the us pick up with prime minister abe in washington at the end of next week with finance minister aso north korea s test of a new tactical weapon will likely also be on the agenda 2 bank of canada the neutral stance will be maintained the economic data is sufficiently mixed to allow the officials to be patient and monitor developments extrapolating the overnight swaps index the market is pricing less than a one in five chance of a rate cut in the next six months canada faces two immediate economic challenges first which is well known is the housing market in the toronto and vancouver regions the second is that its non oil exports have fallen to their lowest level in a year with a 4 decline in february overall exports are off 6 from the record highs set last july the new provincial government in alberta will reverse the current policies and boost the output employment growth remains robust averaging 30k over the past six months which is comparable to the us adding 300k a month and nearly twice the 12 month average consumption has softened but gain in february retail sales 0 8 which was twice the median forecast in the bloomberg survey snapped a three month drop 3 us q1 gdp the government shutdown the unusually cold weather and what seems to be a typical pattern for weakness in q1 coupled with the dramatic decline in equity prices in q4 18 and the knock on impact from the wealth effect depressed expectations for growth at the start of the year it looked like the economy was stagnating or worse the inversion of parts of the yield curve was seized upon as further evidence that the end of the expansion was at hand the atlanta fed s gdpnow tracker began the quarter with a 0 3 projection and after the retail sales report stands at 2 8 the median economist forecast according to bloomberg is 2 2 which would match the q4 18 pace some economists have a more dour estimate of 1 5 we are neither as optimistic as the atlanta fed nor as pessimistic as the naysayers our expectation is for around 2 growth the report is released at the end of the week and a few days before the may 1 fomc meeting there is little chance of a change in policy but it would appear that some of the cross currents that had concerned powell co have abated 4 australia q1 cpi the market continues to favor a rate cut by the reserve bank of australia later this year the forward rate implies about a 31 bp easing in rates by year end while the overnight index swaps are consistent with around a 75 chance of a cut yet recent data have been robust with the composite pmi moving back above 50 and full time jobs growth averaging 37k a month in q1 the most since july 2017 chinese officials appear committed to strengthening the economy and australia is often seen as a proxy of sorts for china the quarterly cpi matched the four year peak of 2 1 in q2 18 and has eased since headline cpi is expected to have slowed for its third consecutive quarter in q1 19 prices are expected to have risen by 0 2 in the first three months of the year for a 1 5 year over year pace down from 1 8 in q4 the underlying rates trimmed mean and the weighted median are also expected to have slowed the easing of price pressures gives the rba scope to cut when the economic outlook justifies it based on the current information set we pencil in a cut in late q3 5 brexit parliament returns from its holiday recess and the brexit debate will be taken up again however the immediate focus is on the local elections that will be held on may 2 although the tories have made a mess of brexit from the get go labour s agenda and rhetoric estrange voters and prevents it from truly capitalizing on the situation though some polls have just begun showing labour edging ahead if the uk is to leave the eu their other commitments see good friday agreement circumscribes their degrees of freedom and some form of a customs union arrangement continues to be the most likely meanwhile the uk economy appears to be relatively well employment growth is strong and retail sales jumped 1 1 in march retail sales rose by an average of 0 8 a month in q1 19 after a flat average in q4 18 and a 0 3 average gain in q3 18 the manufacturing sector that is contracting in the eurozone pmi is surging in the uk the 0 9 rise in february manufacturing output followed a 1 1 gain in january the two month average is the strongest since the end of 2016 6 us china trade talks officials continue to assure investors that progress is being made in the trade talks between the world s two largest economies us trade representative lighthizer is headed to beijing later this month while vice premier liu will return to the us in early may late may has long been identified as a possible timeframe for the two leaders to meet china has already reportedly stepped up its purchases of soy and swine from the us much of us demands appear to have been agreed upon by china but rather than this being a result of the savvy american negotiators it seems that china was moving in this direction with the help of past american and european pressure as well as most importantly its internal dynamics the dollar depreciated by about 10 against the yuan in 2017 when it fell against most currencies it recouped these losses last year largely in line with its broader performance and returned toward cny7 00 area the yuan has strengthened against the dollar this year its 2 4 appreciation makes it among the strongest currencies in the world behind the russian rouble s 8 8 gain and three latam currencies chilean peso up 4 7 the mexican peso up 4 6 and the colombian peso which has risen 2 8 it is not clear what commitments the us is making treasury secretary mnuchin seemed to accede to the chinese demand that the enforcement mechanism is two way fair equal acknowledging that china may be in its rights to act if the us fails to live up to its commitments that said it might be more convincing for many if lighthizer were to make a similar commitment disclaimer
by dr george venturini the restoration of malpractice fraser lord malcolm of nareen supplied the mantra bringing australians back to their convict colony origin life he prophesised with haruspical solemnity is not meant to be easy he conveniently forgot the rest of g b s s quote but take courage it can be delightful what of the whitlam reforms could not be un done was kept camouflaged in bureaucratic inertia by the time bob hawke came around he provided a shorter slogan bringing australia together to the electorate at large he offered the accord a form of corporativism he provided for some the opportunity to get wealthy quickly abeles bond skase and he did not forget the mates of w a inc hawke provided australia with the opportunities of the freshly imported economic neo liberalism the rule of the market privatisation re regulation cutting public expenditure for social services the elimination of the concept of public good or the sense of community and all that to be replaced by individual responsibility hawke had been captured by the simplistic mantra of ronald reagan in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem privatisation the selling of everything which stands or moves because private management is better came around with paul keating he added trade liberalisation corporatisation and small government neo liberalism was more subtly albeit quietly redirected towards a particular organisation of capitalism despite the slogan of the small government the basic feature of such reorganisation was the use of the government and the facilities of the state to protect capital imposing market imperatives on society and by curbing the power of organised labour by insisting on the acceptance of class collaboration a typical fascist dogma the hawke government introduced the prices and income accord some union leaders became participants in the implementation of neoliberal reforms not its opponents class consciousness often a difficult position to obtain and defend in a non ideological labor party was disappeared from the daily relations and in a short time the hawke and keating governments succeeded in adopting and firming policies which would transfer wealth from labour to capital the australian dollar was floated government utilities were sold university fees were introduced when the air pilots challenged

keating s successor john winston howard won his position in the shadow cabinet at the pirate boarding of 1975 and advanced his chance as future minister for business and consumer affairs by rummaging in company of the future treasurer sir phillip reginald lynch through the suitcases of the mysterious pakistani banker tirath khemlani who had abused the credulity and taken advantage of the passion of reginald francis xavier rex connor the whitlam government minister with responsibility for minister for minerals and energy such investigating function is normally left to lower rank cops not for howard a morally deaf ordinary suburban solicitor and a visceral monarchist to boot to abide by the stultifying forms of the palace or of the other sacred places of s w 1 the city of westminster which hosts the house and the courts of imperial justice howard quite likely informed by a publicly paid by privately engaged high positioned person at treasury could not think of anyone going to the source of petrodollars by passing the middle men who work from the city or the wall in new york the people of the form did not mind that and the pubs finally had something juicy to talk about there was actually no khemlani scandal as a consequence of an attempt at borrowing money outside the authorised channels of wall street and the city of london there was at most a clumsy attempt to keep the farm by giving execution to connor s plans of a national energy grid and a gas pipe line across australia from the north west shelf gas fields of western australia to the cities of the south east and that would have required the borrowing of four billion dollars duly authorised by a decision of the federal executive council presided over by governor general kerr who countersigned the decision during his five years as treasurer howard activated his belief in free market economics which was challenging economic orthodoxies in place for most of the century he came to favour tax reform including broad based taxation a freer industrial system including the dismantling of the centralised wage fixing system the abolition of compulsory trade unionism privatisation and deregulation in time telstra

friend in washington expressing his solidarity in the aggression on afghanistan the whole country having been declared responsible for 9 11 and later still involving australia in war crime aggression on iraq to liberate that country from saddam hussein despite the running scandal of the already mentioned australian wheat board ltd there followed six years of a bureaucratic labor government with two prime ministers rudd gillard rudd in 2008 the rudd labor government shored up the big four banks which faced potential disasters because of their dependence on foreign funds and underwrote their borrowings this allowed the a n z c b a n b a and westpac to tighten their oligopolistic grip by the middle of 2009 they were capturing nearly 100 per cent of new housing mortgages up from 60 per cent

figures of people transferred to immigration detention out of a total of 8 588 people 3 889 of people had overstayed visas or breached conditions 3 644 people had been detained at airport and 963 people had been detained after arriving by boat in addition 25 foreign fishers had been detained for five years abbott transformed the hall and fore front of parliament into a brothel like circus in which he performed with the same language he had used at university while pursuing half naked all those whom in his budding clerical inspiration attempt he would characterise as commons poofters and femmos in 2013 he finally became prime minister having for years attacked an opponent whose cardinal fault was that of being female not for the tony abbott who obviously learnt nothing when director of australians for constitutional monarchy about the hanoverian formalities of westminster but preferred the crudity of phil the hun whom he later on in a prime ministerial raptus he knighted julia gillard s profession of loyalty to the american great and powerful friend expressed before the joint session of congress had not been sufficient to spare her from abbott joint like behaviour the abbott premiership marked the beginning of a policy of neo liberalism without any restraint to be doubly sure the abbott government deprived what was already a shameful paper tiger the australian securities and investments commission of 120 million in the first budget that caused a reduction of personnel of 200 units and of course justified an unwilling corporate regulator in doing less in july 2014 senator mathias cormann former general manager 2004 2006 of healthguard and acting general manager 2006 2007 of h b f insurance companies attempted and in part succeeded in weakening the

company the largest in western australia the name of which betrays the fact that it also offers general insurance products including car life home and travel insurance abbott had inherited labor s future of financial advice act legislated in 2012 but not due to take full effect until mid 2014 at first the result of a parliamentary inquiry and years of agonising about how to protect consumers in the wake of the collapse of investment schemes including those run by bridgecorp holdings ltd commonwealth financial planning ltd opes prime group limited storm financial limited timbercorp trio capital group and westpoint the law banned secret commissions and required financial advisers to put the interests of their clients ahead of their own actually it came into effect on 1 july 2013 during the life of the gillard labor government but the australian securities and investments commission decided to take a facilitative compliance approach meaning it wouldn t enforce it until 1 july 2014 which turned out to be after the coalition took office then when all had been lost the banks and financial advisers begged for more time they have been thrown into disarray and would not have their systems ready a s i c said it would not enforce the law until 1 july 2015 two years after it had been due to begin a s i c and finance minister mathias cormann had given the financial advice industry an extra two years in which to charge commissions and escape an overarching requirement to put the clients first a s i c s poltroons could not believe their good fortune the watcher was assured that nothing should be done until 1 july 2015 the so called corporate regulator would give an extra period of two years from the enactment of f o f a to put their house in order meanwhile they would continue to a use their credulous clients what is meant by controlling the result of a royal commission is demonstrated by the one appointed by prime minister abbott in 2014 the royal commission

on march 29 2019 the office of the united states trade representative ustr published its annual national trade estimate nte report on foreign trade barriers which highlights significant foreign barriers to u s exports u s foreign direct investment and u s electronic commerce 1 this year s nte report comes at an important time as the trump administration has been vocal about its view that current trading arrangements have permitted widespread unfair treatment of the united states including by its largest trading partners the administration has shown that it is willing to address such issues through negotiation for example it has recently proposed formal negotiations with japan and the eu is in the midst of bilateral negotiations with china and has completed a renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico at the same time the administration also has been willing to take aggressive unilateral actions in response to perceived unfair treatment causing significant commercial disruptions and frictions in the global trading system these developments have generated significant interest in the administration s views and priorities with respect to the trade policies of the united states major trading partners this report aims to shed light on these issues by reviewing key developments in this year s nte with respect to major us trading partners namely china japan the european union canada mexico brazil and korea china the 2019 nte lists a multitude of longstanding us concerns about china s trade and industrial policies which seek to limit market access for imported goods foreign manufacturers and foreign services suppliers while offering substantial government guidance resources and regulatory support to chinese industries it also identifies several new us concerns and highlights the trump administration s recent efforts to obtain the elimination of certain chinese practices through the unilateral actions it has taken against china under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 we discuss these issues below new developments in the 2019 nte the report highlights several new developments over the last year that are of concern to the united states including the following e commerce china s new e commerce law which entered into force in january 2019 allegedly introduced provisions that weaken the ability of rights holders to protect their rights online and that make it more difficult for chinese electronic commerce platforms to be liable for selling counterfeit and other infringing goods china s new e commerce

banks but in practice china has maintained restrictions that do not allow for significant non chinese competition in commercial banking activities foreign suppliers also allegedly have been unable to secure licenses to supply electronic payment services in china under a licensing process that china established in 2017 following an adverse wto ruling and have had similar difficulties with respect to internet enabled payments services china recently finalized measures that remove equity caps relating to chinese owned banks but in practice china has maintained restrictions that do not allow for

the nte the report highlights several alleged barriers related to technology transfer foreign investment and intellectual property protection investment restrictions and technology transfer china

any means possible so as to equip chinese companies to dominate international markets intellectual property china s intellectual property rights protection and enforcement regime continue to present serious barriers to u s exports and investment and there are erious inadequacies in the protection and enforcement of trade secrets the report notes that some of these issues were the subject of ustr s recent investigation of china under section 301 based on which the united states has imposed additional tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese imports it further notes that china has responded to that action by imposing retaliatory tariffs on us goods however the report does not reference directly the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the united states and china regarding the issues raised in the section 301 investigation and other issues other alleged barriers the report also describes a wide range of longstanding us concerns about china s trade policies and economic model that are not directly related to the recent section 301 action subsidies and excess capacity china continues to provide substantial subsidies to its domestic industries and is the world s leading offender in creating noneconomic capacity china continues to provide substantial subsidies to its domestic industries and is the world s leading offender in creating noneconomic capacity services and digital

agriculture china remains a difficult and unpredictable market for u s agricultural exporters largely because of inconsistent enforcement of regulations and selective intervention in the market by china s regulatory authorities china s regulators fail to routinely follow science based international standards and guidelines bilateral negotiations as noted above the report does not reference directly the ongoing bilateral negotiations between the united states and china in which the united states is seeking chinese commitments to eliminate not only the policies identified in the section 301 investigation but other alleged trade barriers discussed in the nte for example the united states reportedly is seeking commitments from china related to digital trade services e g electronic payments motion pictures and cloud computing and various agriculture issues e g biotechnology approvals however the extent to which these issues will be addressed in a potential us china agreement remains unclear and other key trade frictions highlighted in the nte undoubtedly will remain the nte notes that the trump administration is pursuing other avenues to address such issues e g by working with the eu and japan to identify further effective action and potential rules that could address problematic subsidies practices not currently covered by existing obligations japan the report highlights a range of barriers to goods and services trade with japan including in areas such as agriculture and automotive trade that are likely to be central to forthcoming bilateral fta negotiations in addition to discussing longstanding issues identified in previous iterations of the nte this year s report introduces new sector specific issues aligned with the trump administration s stated trade priorities we discuss the most significant issues highlighted in the report below new developments in the 2019 nte ustr notes several new or exacerbated regulatory challenges that it sees as negatively impacting us companies competitiveness relative to their japanese counterparts including i changes to the reimbursement pricing system adversely affecting us medical devices and pharmaceuticals companies ii newly noted tariffs of 3 5 percent to 10 percent on certain fish and seafood products iii new concerns relating to government procurement procedures including that technical specifications are selected to exclude us products and services or direct procurements towards a specific japanese company iv a potentially problematic geographical indications law and v the denial of access to the electrical grid for us companies attempting to sell renewable energy while these additions are relatively narrow in scope the updated report does demonstrate a continued focus on incremental market access issues both for goods and services some of which could be addressed via a bilateral fta other alleged barriers the report highlights several other alleged trade barriers

by david haggith we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the us stock market is slightly overbought which is not a positive in terms of head room for more of a rally it s massively built up on debt that is now more expensive to maintain and or obtain the fed is still rapidly tightening money supply and says it will continue to do so for several more months interest rate increases and money tightening that already happened through this past december will continue to worsen economic conditions until summer because any changes by the fed have about a half year lag time for the general economy that also means all the tightening that continues between now and september will continue to pile more and more weight on top of the economy until next february which is why the trump admin is screaming the fed went too far 2019 q1 us corporate earnings are coming in almost as poorly as economists said they would and they don t look set to start rising much in the next quarter if at all measures used to help earnings beat much lower expectations and not by much were mostly cost saving measures not revenue boosters or they were mere accounting choices earnings are after taxe numbers so they benefited hugely in 2018 from the trump tax cuts in a way that had nothing at all to do with companies doing better business they are also reported as a per share number and the main thing that changed was the number of outstanding shares in the denominator as a result of stock buybacks so really earnings were pathetic transportation is declining as product shipments decline west coast port imports plunged 19 from the previous quarter 3 yoy trucking lost ground four months in a row manufacturing is slowing in the us and europe pmi plummeted in the us to a 31 month low taking us back to the obama era businesses reported significant slowing in output new orders and hiring china had a march growth spurt but only because of a massive stimulus pump china injected 200 billion yuan of liquidity in one shot into its economy and interest rates still jumped up business inventories are growing while sales are declining meaning production has to slow more than it already has because back pressure is building us interest rates inverted completely on the gauge the fed uses to estimate recession risk 3 month rates over ten year rates which has been the fed s most reliable indicator of a coming recession major cash from repatriation is starting to dwindle while stock buybacks using cash and cheap credit were the only fuel pushing the us market upward most of the last ten years take buybacks out of the equations and the market would have been flat at best us government debt is soaring as far as the eye can see at the highest rate of increase we ve ever seen meaning the government cannot do any more than it is already doing existing stimulus effects from the trump tax cuts have been waning each of the last two quarters us gdp for the first quarter of 2019 is estimated to be substantially lower still meaning the tax cuts after more than a year are grossly failing to perform as promised while they are not paying for themselves either the imf and world bank have projected a decline in global gdp over the full year the fed is highly reluctant to turn back to more quantitative easing and rate reduction and thereby really prove it couldn t do what it claimed it could and would therefore it will be late in helping and more limited in the help it can provide forcing it to more extreme and reckless experiments in novelty monetary policy when it does jump back in us unemployment is bottoming out which it always does immediately before a recession with an increase in the last couple of months although there was also blip of decrease in reported filings at the end of march housing has been in steady decline across the usa for more than half a year now and prices have finally begun to fall to coincide with the declining sales housing starts and permits in march took another tumble and february s bad figures thought to be a one off due to bad weather were just revised from an 8 9 plunge to a devastating 12 crumpling heap australia s housing market looks like the us market did just as the us market took down the world the uk and canada are having problems too retail sales growth including autos have been in continual decline for months though there was a bounce in march more retail stores nearly 6 000 have already closed in the first quarter of this year than closed in all of last year or the year before and those years were pretty bad more auto factories are closing too march s improvements on the metrics above may just be a rebound after the government shutdown while december february s lows would have been abnormally lower due to the shutdown too which makes something between january february stats and march stats the place we re actually stuck in which is still not good any trade deal with china appears likely at this point to come out limper than a boiled wanton as negotiations drag on after promise and promise of summits that fail to deliver or fail to even happen john bolthead and mike pompous have likely scuttled any hope of a north korean nuclear deal if there ever was any hope as you recall the nuclear cold war was weighing on the stock market many months ago when rhetoric and nuclear activity last heated up the stock market is back at its highest peak level which may make investors skittish at this point given the major crashes that happened the last two times it got into this stratosphere this is a perilously high ceiling of resistance to break through of course if it does break through and holds it could soar just as before the dot com crash the values of many high tech companies online companies are based on soft metrics such as number of daily users or volume of user interactions rather than hard profits and there is a lot of fantasy in some of those narratives inflationary pressures are backing off but deflationary pressure is more indicative of a recession than inflation as deflation happens when demand recedes and growth stalls lower inflation also presses the fed back to interest reduction and more quantitative easing which it doesn t want to do lest it underscore the fact that we are stuck forever in money printing mode just to hold against a receding tide and where the fed doesn t have much room to move no wonder the fed as laid out in my last premium post is paving the path for significant fundamental changes in how it does business in a world of economic conditions that it says have changed forever
20 04 2019 listen abstract economics is a way of life everyone wants a better life with more goods and services than they already have to improve their living standard people from the very first day of their existence have been searching for ways to increase the production of goods and services with their resources at hand in their long journey from the stone age to the modern age people have indeed made tremendous achievements in every conceivable field in the process however a few in the society became super rich by expropriating more of the wealth for themselves and leaving others poor the gap between the rich and poor grew so wide that currently three of the wealthiest individuals own more assets than the poorest in the world and this process is continuing both in rich and poor countries this article attempts to briefly outline the long progression of exploitation in society and its obvious fallout for maintaining social coherence developed as well as developing countries must find an equitable solution to this conundrum introduction economics may be defined in a number of different ways all definitions would however invariably lead to its central theme that it deals with the art of accumulating material wealth the main objective is of course to achieve a comfortable life for everyone as such the idea of economics is nothing new to people although adam smith who published the wealth of nations in 1776 is regarded as the father of modern economics the very idea of economics is as old as the human race itself it was not by choice that people started to practice economics their very survival practically forced them to engage in economic activities the main difference between ancient and modern economics is that we have learned from our experiences how to practice economics in a more scientific and organized manner the very fundamental idea of economics is that at any given time economic resources are limited while human wants are unlimited so to get the greatest satisfaction of their wants people always needed to utilize their limited resources in the best or most economic way people constantly had to choose what would satisfy them most since they could not get everything they would want the basic lesson of economics is that everything in life has a cost and the true cost of what people get is what they actually give up this concept of economics was as true when people lived in the cave as it is true today undoubtedly people have come a long way from the time of cave living and have made enormous progress in their living standard they are now indubitably better fed better clothed better educated or informed people are enjoying life more and even living longer in other words there has been tremendous economic progress over time more importantly with the never ending technological innovations especially in regard to managing information communication and transportation this progress is continually improving at a rate never imagined who could have ever thought that even after uncovering the mystery of the moon people would be aspiring to reach the distant planet mars so soon yet while human society has been making such colossal progress very unfortunately not everybody in society is getting the opportunity to enjoy and share the enhanced or improved benefit or wealth equally indeed the opportunity gap among the people in each country and across the nations is truly staggering small numbers of people in society indubitably live in great luxury while many others find it hard to even properly feed themselves as per the latest data of the world bank in september of 2018 there were about 736 million people in the world who survived on less than 1 90 per day in 2015 in terms of 2011 purchasing power parity the credit suisse global wealth databank 2017 report shows that the total wealth in the world grew by 6 over the past 12 months to 280 trillion of which more than half is owned by 1 of the world s population at the other end of the spectrum the world s 3 5 billion adults who make up 70 of the world s working age population account for just 2 7 of global wealth the gap between the rich and poor can be illustrated by the fact that the 3 wealthiest individuals have more assets than the poorest of the world s population and this gap is widening instead of shrinking the latest survey of oxfam international published ahead of the 2019 world economic forum in davos switzerland shows that the world s billionaires are growing 2 5 billion richer every day while the poorest half of the global population is seeing its net worth dwindle the combined fortunes of the world s 26 richest individuals reached 1 4 trillion last year the same amount as the total wealth of the 3 8 billion poorest people here s an example of a relatively poor asian country named bangladesh the seventh largest country in terms of population with the achievement of steady economic growth over the past decades the country is no longer considered to be a least developed country as usual the main driving force behind its growth has been its industrious labor force both at home and abroad yet the general public seems to have benefited the least from this growth with a per capita income of about 1 517 4 561 as per imf s estimate in terms of 2017 purchasing power parity the majority of its people still continue to struggle to make ends meet while the country is said to have topped the list of countries that witnessed the quickest growth in the number of ultra wealthy people between 2012 and 2017 according to the world ultra wealth report 2018 of wealth x on the other hand the economic situation in a rich country like the united states where per capita income is about 59 500 is not any better either some might find the disparity here even worse according to the new york times report in december of 2017 the inequality in the united states has grown so much that the richest 1 of people now own more wealth than the bottom 90 this report also points out that in china 15 percent of the income growth since 1980 flowed to the richest 1 percent of chinese while 13 percent flowed to the bottom half even in egalitarian social democratic europe 1 percenters got 18 percent of the growth in the period and the bottom half got 14 percent in this way income disparities are reaching levels not before seen in modern history what a shocking anomaly in the distribution of wealth in poor as well as rich countries now the obvious question is how the rich obtained their wealth and how do they keep multiplying it we must remember that wealth is something that is created by people with labor so for wealth to be concentrated in the hands of a limited few many others would have to be deprived of their due shares of that wealth from such a point of view the disparities that currently exist and their continual expansion in both poor and rich societies could only be achieved through the perpetration of economic exploitation the origin of this disparity could easily be traced in the economic repression of one human being by another early economics and the role of family in the beginning people basically relied on their bare hands to make a living the initial economic problem they faced was how best to utilize their time to collect food or build a shelter there was simply not enough time to do everything they wished done for example if they spent the whole day catching fish they would have to forgo meat the cost of having more fish would be meat so people had to decide what they wanted most fish or meat if they wanted both they would have to allocate their time accordingly the choice would be made based on the cost and benefit of each even after making a choice people had to economize on their time and energy in order to increase their output this theme or idea eventually led each person to do the things that he was best suited for thus people learned things by doing and went on building things using their experience what we see around us today besides the gifts of nature are indeed built by people with their bare hands the learning process is continuing and more and better things are being built with new knowledge and experience gained in the early days of the human race the two most significant elements of economics production and distribution of goods and services did not seem to pose too much of a problem for people typically the head of the family would direct other members to a specific task and he would also distribute the output among the family members in the end the weak and the sick members would be provided for the family was the center of every economic activity where each able bodied member had an active part in this way family economics applied all of the basic economic concepts such as production division of labor distribution and decision making after the family grew in size and age it would disintegrate but then each of its members would scramble to start a new family the process would repeat itself and gradually with the increase in population communities began to form in different areas the formation of communities may have brought changes to people s lives but it has not quite dampened the spirit of a family even in modern times the family continues to remain the main center of economic activities in many parts of the world the economic functions of a family are therefore valuable for society since family units make up the institutions that run society the absence of the family unit would weaken the economy the family makes its members available to produce and distribute goods and services it s important to note here that people learned from their experience that their demand for goods and services would not end the fulfillment of one demand was followed by the creation of demand for another the more the people got the more they wanted there was simply no end to their demand so their struggle for obtaining more goods and services simply went on the involvement and cooperation of immediate family members might be sufficient in fulfilling certain parts of their demand but with the increase in population changes had to be made every new situation not only changed the nature and scope of their demand but also brought new challenges so to meet those challenges people eventually sought and made alliances with other community members with the continual change in their circumstances people went on to widen or rearrange their alliances from time to time it was mainly through these kinds of developments in society that people gradually came to unite under the banner of one s clan community region and finally came to form the state the rise of social ruling class economics has in essence worked as the main motivating force for bringing together various segments of society the purpose of each social alliance was in most part to accumulate wealth individually as well as collectively but the outcome of that very process in which people made alliances for the production and distribution of goods and services affected the society in a most astounding way instead of the wealth accruing evenly in society a few leading people found a way to gain more wealth than the others how the disproportionate distribution of wealth in society is likely to have materialized would not be difficult to follow in every stage of their alliance people were uniting under one leadership this leadership customarily went to those in society who were very shrewd manipulative and at the same time possessed organizing power after having gained the leadership position the leader insisted on getting a bigger share of wealth for himself this process eventually elevated a class of people in society who came to be known as leaders and these leaders customarily collaborated with each other to accomplish their own goals by way of collaboration the leaders then succeeded in establishing a ruling class which pursued the practice of accumulating extra wealth for themselves and their cronies to accomplish their goals of accumulating wealth the members of the ruling class began to perpetrate extortion brutality and oppression over their followers this is basically how wealth in society followed power and the stronger the power was the more wealth it was able to accumulate and then of course more wealth would bring more power the emerging ruling class also faced competition from other aspirants as there were resistances everybody had to establish his lead by defeating the competing forces in society to be sure human history is filled with tales of various warring factions and of enmity among different races as well as the fierceness of their conflicts these conflicts eventually got resolved by the supreme law of the land the law of survival of the fittest through this law the feeble and the weak were eliminated while the powerful continued to prosper one very remarkable outcome of this process was the rise of slavery in which people used to be bought and sold like commodities in fact slavery was not only considered to be the main pillar of economic society in the ancient time it even became part and parcel of every civilization the system of slavery developed and prospered on the very concept of oppression as to the extent of brutality and oppression that existed during slavery it is already well documented the rise of kingdoms human society underwent many changes most of the changes were nevertheless initiated by the members of the social ruling class their intense desire to accumulate more wealth and to achieve greater control in society led them to continually undertake many new adventures among other initiatives these adventures included the expansion of their power base from localities to regions and beyond but success in such endeavors would depend on their consolidation of power for this reason society experienced power consolidation which became an ongoing phenomenon there were power struggles everywhere and these struggles frequently put one society against another in the end it was the dominant power which prevailed and continued to excel in the not too distant past society used to be ruled by kings and emperors trade was a major factor in the rise of kingdoms some of these kingdoms were small while others were big and exerted extensive power it depended mainly on which kingdom could amass how much wealth and power and where each kingdom stood in relation to others here are some of the greatest empires in the history of the world british empire ottoman empire mughal empire mongol empire russian empire qing dynasty umayyad caliphate and the roman empire however there should not be any delusion about kings and emperors as being mystical or supernatural beings they were purely and simply products of the social ruling class the emergence of kingdoms in society was the ultimate result of the consolidation of power every consolidation of power came through the process of elimination society continually experienced power successions at each succession the winner gained more power which was then used to gain still more power it was basically through this kind of process that the most manipulative and powerful emerged as the king or monarch who ruled society authoritatively and created a family based dynasty as with everything else in life every social struggle or conflict extracted a price but it was the common people who always ended up paying the price the bigger the consolidation of power the higher was the price they had to pay the establishment of kingdoms in society involved a bigger mobilization and thus extracted a much heavier price again it was the common people who took the full brunt of such cost they not only paid for the establishment of each kingdom but also for its maintenance the kings and their cronies managed to lead a comfortable life at the expense of the common people history clearly reveals the kind of brutality and oppression the kingdoms of the world perpetrated on mankind birth of democracy and capitalism as many of the kings were ruthless rulers resistance against them was slowly brewing in society with the increase of awareness among people it was only a matter of time before many of the kings would lose their power europe actually pioneered the movement to dethrone the kings of the world in ancient greece there were city states headed by basileus or hereditary kings with growing discontent among the people some of those kings were successfully overthrown in the eighth century bc this was followed by a period of experimentation with a number of political alternatives like oligarchy timocracy tyranny and finally with democracy the idea of democracy in greece was believed to have originated sometime in the sixth century bc the greek democracies however were not truly representative governments they were governments run by free male citizens only and others didn t have any say after the fall of the roman empire in the fifth century ad when europe was practically thrown into disarray various small scale political entities began to form in the roman held areas from the fifth to the fifteenth century a period known as the middle ages europe underwent numerous changes with large scale political organization broken down the economic structure of europe was rapidly changing it eventually settled in a system of governance which came to be known as feudalism feudalism was primarily characterized by a political and economic system in which a king shared his power with the nobility who required services from the common people in return for allowing them to use his land in the country the basic unit of economic organization was the manorial estate where the noble was the lord while in the town centers there were the institutions of guilds which were basically the remnant organizations of various manufacturing and business units such as trade professional and craft organizations from the roman era there the guild masters would run their own affairs in any case during medieval time economics was not the most important aspect of people s lives religion pretty much dominated their lives and the churches wielded the ultimate authority on all economic matters the feudal system was however responsible for generating a middle class which soon began to exert its influence on society by the 16th century various democratic movements had begun to develop in europe these movements principally grew to challenge the entrenched power of the church and the feudal aristocracy these movements eventually succeeded in transforming society from feudalism to capitalism the ultimate transformation from feudalism to capitalism was thus the result of the struggle between the aristocratic elites and the emerging middle class men who clearly wanted to share power in society the objective of the democratic movements was primarily to replace the autocratic regimes by the well to do middle class men and not necessarily by the public as a whole the next two centuries witnessed the effects of democratic revolutions that swept the countries of europe and the british colony of america which declared its independence in 1776 and adopted the name the united states of america different arguments are put forward for the proliferation of democratic movements in different areas but the central argument remains that democratic ideas grew primarily to facilitate the growth of capitalism capitalism itself has been defined in a number of ways as it encompasses a number of ideas in common usage however it refers to an economic system in which the means of production are predominantly privately owned and operated for profit in the beginning the term capitalism was mostly used to describe a system that would promote private investment and industry with little or no governmental control the prevailing feudal system in europe was thought to work against the development and expansion of capitalism the primary argument was that a free individual as opposed to a serf bound to his landlord s land in the feudal system was essential for the growth of capitalism colonization and the industrial revolution by the middle of the fifteenth century the kingdoms of europe were gearing up for various expeditions around the world they were essentially being driven by the idea of mercantilism mercantilism has been defined as a system of political economy prevailing in europe after the decline of feudalism based on national policies of accumulating bullion establishing colonies and a merchant marine and developing industry and mining to attain a favorable balance of trade the european race for expeditions went into full swing after christopher columbus accidentally discovered america in 1492 the initial voyages were taken in the name of trade but when the opportunity for colonization presented itself the europeans immediately grabbed it by the middle of the eighteenth century most of the countries of asia africa south america as well as australia were converted into their colonies having established their authority the colonial powers were then engaged in siphoning off wealth from these areas as these colonies provided lucrative jobs to many of their citizens the system promptly gave rise to a strong bourgeois class which in effect provided the last push needed to make capitalism the dominant system in europe indeed the colonies provided what was needed for the expansion of the capitalist system a captive market and the source of raw materials among the europeans the british clearly emerged as the strongest and largest of all colonial powers at its height their colonies were so widespread that the sun was said not to set in the british empire thus as a colonial power they clearly reaped the most benefit by utilizing their newly acquired wealth the british forged the industrial revolution in the late eighteenth century this revolution was brought on by the discovery of the steam engine various spinning machines the mechanical loom and a whole series of other mechanical devices by forging this revolution the british achieved enormous economic success their vast colonies helped them to achieve their rapid success the colonies readily provided them with the necessary raw materials and gave them a huge market for their manufactured products it was only a matter of time when other powers would join the british bandwagon in fact while most of the world still remained colonized the european and north american countries underwent swift industrialization which immediately put their economies on the path to speedy growth the economic growth that these powers achieved through industrialization later changed the scope of capitalism itself the colonial powers by establishing a system of trade brought raw materials from their colonies and then used them as a market for their finished products with such a system in place european capitalism continued to flourish through the end of the nineteenth century subsequently american productivity began to outstrip that of europe the vast natural resources of america along with the exploitation of african slaves the large scale capture of native american land by means of genocide and the expanding vibrant immigrant labor force quickly gave the country a great advantage over the european powers as a matter of fact with the rapid increase in productivity or wealth creation america rapidly achieved its economic superiority over the rest of the world and eventually emerged as the world superpower both economically and militarily the united states currently possesses the largest economy in the world its total gdp is more than 19 trillion as against the total world gdp of about 80 trillion the united states is clearly the benefactor of modern capitalism while at the same time the country has also earned the reputation of being imperialist imperialism would normally refer to a policy of extending control or authority over foreign entities as a means of acquisition and or maintenance of empires the united states does not however call itself an empire it is being labeled as an imperialist country because of its exercise of superior economic and military power to maintain its dominance over distant lands to promote its capitalist policies the rise of communism while europe was undergoing dramatic change as a result of the industrial revolution cynicism about capitalism was also growing this was mainly because the capitalist system was creating a disparity within society the factory owners were gaining wealth and political influence while the living conditions of the average urban industrial laborer were continually deteriorating as the gap between the rich and poor was widening many social thinkers began to imagine a more equitable society and specifically on how to achieve such a society the most famous of all such thinkers turned out to be the german philosopher named karl marx 1818 1883 having observed the capitalist system first hand he saw how capitalism was promoting exploitation by transforming the laborers into some tradable commodities and through this process of exploitation wealth was being concentrated in the hands of few marx then envisioned a society where all wealth would be shared equally the way to achieve such a goal he thought was by getting rid of private ownership of property and by establishing a social system to protect the citizens from the exploitation and instability of the market economy his prescription was communism communism refers to a type of government where the main goal would be for workers to take control of factories and business and to share things more equitably marx in collaboration with his friend friedrich engels published the basic ideas and principles of communism in the form of the communist manifesto in 1848 they had maintained that to achieve communism a country would first need to become socialist the proposed system of marx was later put to test in fact until quite recently about half of the world population lived under the so called communist rule his original ideas were however modified to suit various political circumstances russia was the first country to try the system though the country never became communist in the way that marx and engels described china was another famed country that adopted the system it largely tried to establish its own brand of communism but neither system ultimately succeeded although the central planning system under the communist rule succeeded in transforming these and other distressed societies by putting their economies on the right track the system came to stumble after a while modern communism thus failed to live up to marx s grand ideas theories abound why these systems failed in the end from an economic point of view communism would appear to have failed because it lacked procedures to motivate people to achieve efficiency that was needed for the production of goods and services with fewer resources while capitalism promotes economic efficiency through competition though it also creates a monopoly and widens inequality communism tries to maintain social equality by creating an egalitarian or a classless society with less or no competition the end result was that the communist countries failed to match the economic prosperity of the capitalist countries in addition communism faced steadfast opposition from capitalism ultimately both internal as well as external pressures precipitated the collapse of the communist system however it was capitalism that in effect brought communism which in turn brought changes to capitalism the emergence of welfare states in europe where people clearly enjoy a better safety net in life proves the kind of change communism has brought to capitalism the communist system may have collapsed but the idea continues to linger whether communism will revive again as a viable system in some different forms depends entirely on how capitalism handles itself in the future the problem with developing countries there are hosts of reasons why some countries continue to remain poor the main problems may however be grouped into three categories extreme poverty lack of any political vision and the level of corruption in these countries industrialization is the key to economic development but its success very much depends in addition to appropriate government policy on the education and health of the country s workers now without having met the basic human requirements of food clothing and shelter how does a country proceed to industrialize or achieve success in industrialization so the situation of extreme poverty is quite a serious drawback for these countries the roots of their poverty could be traced to the era of colonial rule many years of neglect and economic oppression by the colonial powers have created such an impact there that they find themselves in a serious deadlock from which they cannot easily break out in order to reduce the impact of poverty in these countries what would then be needed is a revolutionary change both socially and culturally but to bring about such a change in traditional societies where most are illiterate would require very intelligent political guidance this is precisely what some of these developing countries have failed to achieve these countries may be politically freed from their colonial powers but most have yet to establish a political system for adopting the policies to reduce poverty improve education or nurture economic development on the contrary their corrupt leaders have engaged in siphoning whatever wealth they can muster for their personal benefit some of these countries are so poor that they depend on foreign aid for survival but since their corrupt officials also grab the lion s share of the money aid the general public hardly benefits from such aid thus the level of corruption has become another big impediment to their progress what is more surprising the members of their ruling class even fail to invest their money in the industrialization of their own country they find it prudent to invest their ill gotten money in a much safer environment in western countries as a result many of these countries industrial bases continue to remain weak countries such as china india indonesia malaysia south africa and a few others which have succeeded in establishing a responsible political system or have taken right measures to modernize their production facilities are making progress though it is true that their industrialization is not benefiting everybody equally in the country the hope is that any progress they make will bring some benefit to the poor however as evidence clearly points out a number of asian african and latin american countries even after so many years of political freedom have failed to adopt a political system for implementing the changes necessary as a result their economies remain very depressed and their people seem hopelessly trapped in poverty while economics rules the world in all other cases for poor countries politics seems to rule the world until such time that the political leadership of these countries is prepared to implement the changes needed there will be no escape from their present predicament globalization and its effect the world today is known to be gripped in the process of globalization and this process is influencing worldwide wealth distribution the term globalization refers to the changes in societies and the world economy that are the result of greatly increased trade and cultural exchange in the context of economics it is understood to refer almost exclusively to the effects of trade specifically trade liberalization or free trade although trade between nations is not a new phenomenon the term globalization has come to be used extensively since the late 1990s as a result of the rapid increase of world wide integration of markets of goods services and capital with modern technology such as the internet fast communication and rapid transportation money as well as economic resources can now move from one country to another practically in a flash the growth of capitalism depends on trade and the freer trade is the faster capitalism would grow as the benefactor of modern capitalism the united states adopted the policy of free trade to basically promote and preserve the economic superiority it has already achieved but what is good for the united states economically may not be good for others especially when it involves the economies of poor developing countries by adopting the policy of free trade a country openly subjects itself to the international competition for all goods and services since the economies of poor countries are weak their outmoded industries could not withstand competitive pressure from outside so the race for business competition for these developing countries may be over before it could begin also it is said that developing countries have an advantage in labor intensive industries but it has been proven that cheap labor is not quite a good substitute for capital goods with capital goods the developed countries have achieved much higher productivity per worker and they are able to increase such productivity with better education improved health care as well as modern amenities in other words the playing field for free trade is not leveled and the developed countries come out ahead with such a system so instead of reducing inequality between nations trade liberalization is actually having the opposite effect it is widening the economic gap in the world however some countries especially china and india seem to have turned the situation around these two countries initially took different routes to development and kept their economies mostly closed from outside competition but in so doing they were able to put their houses in order and brought a kind of economic stability when they finally embraced the capitalist bandwagon they were pretty much prepared to take advantage of free trade that the united states was promoting today with improved education and better technology these countries are enjoying the status of fastest growing economies in the world though china s economy is currently experiencing slower growth its economy has by now firmly secured the second position in the world after the united states yet in the opinion of professor paul kutasovic of new york institute of technology india is more favorably positioned for long term sustainable growth than china according to the eminent historian peter stearns the economic trend has been successfully turned he maintains that although the united states will still be a factor the economies of china and india will become very dominant by 2050 now even if his prediction comes true it must be noted that their growth is not benefiting everybody equally as capitalism did elsewhere a big gap between the rich and poor has already been created in these countries and this trend is very much likely to continue the rise of populism like communism another specter has been haunting europe the specter of populism there is no single definition of the term populism it is a range of political approaches that deliberately appeal to the people often contrasting this group against a so called elite populism can be seen on any political spectrum left or right but most successful populists seem to be on the right particularly the radical right in europe the brexit the impending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union movement is considered to be a prime example of the effect of this phenomenon however the phenomenon is no longer confined to europe in the us by tapping into popular discontent donald trump one of the few modern billionaires having been elected president is defying the traditional democratic system and emanating all sorts of unpleasant and scary signals he seems to be aligning with the autocrats of the world like vladimir putin of russia kim jong un of north korea and rodrigo duterte of the philippines beside the us a populist in brazil south america has also recently succeeded in getting elected as president on the whole populism reflects deep suspicion of the prevailing establishment and populists tend to be nativist and suspicious of foreigners skeptical of the facts as provided by the establishment press including the scientific theory on the cause and effect of global warming and don t have much respect for the intellectuals the populist leaders are inclined to dislike the complicated system of democracy preferring instead direct democracy like a referendum which rises to authoritarianism some believe populism is not an ideology but rather a strategy to obtain and retain power yet others see globalization and mass immigration to be the cause for the rise of populism in western countries as globalization drew in once previously closed economies like china india and other developing countries and helped reduce world poverty wealth became more concentrated in the hands of few meanwhile middle class incomes stagnated as their work was driven out by a barrage of cheap imports furthermore white people seem to suffer from an identity crisis when they face the influx of immigrants from the middle east africa and elsewhere as they see that the establishment political structure cannot stop terrorist threats or flow of immigrants they look to support the populist leaders for a change these are the reasons why politicians like trump and his equivalents in europe who launched their rages against globalization and immigration were able to gather the votes populism may seem to be gaining some ground but many believe as long as the european union the united states china india and japan continue to support policies that favor more integration more extensive supply chain and see continued advantage economically by being part of a world market the populist backlash should not be a big concern for at least now only the future will tell what actually lies ahead with populism conclusion human society has come a long way from the stone age to the modern age slavery and monarchy supposedly have ended in society except may be in the arabian peninsula after experimenting with various systems society seems to have settled with democracy undoubtedly society made tremendous progress in every conceivable field with ever improving technological innovations it has even invalidated thomas malthus theory of doomsday by acquiring the technological know how to produce enough food to feed the world of several billion yet the problem of hunger oppression injustice and inequality in the world persists although the governing system may have changed the economic exploitation has continued and with the advancement of knowledge the technique of exploitation is also changing for example economists consider rational behavior to be a key factor in economic activity in a world of rational people both buyers and sellers are to benefit from their exchanges but as we know not all people in society are equally rational nobel laureates george akerlop and robert shiller clearly pointed out in their book phishing for phools the economics of manipulation and deception that the sellers in their pursuit of maximizing profits constantly innovate ways to systematically exploit the mental weaknesses of the less rational or ignorant buyers through manipulation and deception to increase their sales moreover climate change due to excessive exploitation of the environment for economic gain is another looming danger facing mankind the privileged few continue to refuse to accept this argument even though global warming is having a serious impact on the world climate shri narayan pandey and alok kumar have presented their report on the effect of climate change in the article exploring the association between environmental cost and corporate financial performance that appeared in the nmims management review of november 2016 and on the expanding gap in wealth distribution simran sethi presented an argument in her article trade liberalization and inequality published in the nmims journal of economics and public policy of october 2018 that there has been an increase in inequality in both developed and developing countries thus it should be obvious that extortion brutality oppression deception and maipulation that the emerging ruling class had introduced in the early days have since been institutionalized under capitalism in the name of democracy when the monarchs of the world lost power a new breed of elites took over they now control democracy everywhere with the help of their wealth today they are perpetrating similar acts of exploitation within society there may be differences in the make up of these elites but their characters essentially remained the same the economic power rests with them and they use that power to further their wealth earlier the wealth in society mostly followed power now the power tends to follow wealth at one time colonization was used to accumulate wealth now it is being accomplished in the name of the free market system as a result the gaps between the rich and poor of the world are not diminishing but continually widening as it has so far shaped the present world economics is likely to shape the future as well capitalism is currently dominating but for reasons of inequality it is also fueling the kind of social unrest the world never has seen before such as the september 11 2001 terrorist attack on america at the world trade center towers in new york city and the pentagon in washington d c area as horrendous as these attacks were they haven t brought any meaningful change to society other than making terrorism a part of modern day life the world has always experienced social unrests as it struggled with the law of survival of the fittest and social dominance when religion was first introduced it had a profound effect on human lives but since religious ideas fell short of fulfilling people s economic expectations its dominance gradually diminished the apparent revival of religious fervor among people may not necessarily mean that religion will dominate again it should be seen however as a clear indication that people especially in developing countries are losing their patience with the existing system for change for lack of any other viable system people are simply falling back on religion to organize their resistance many of the acute problems the world is facing today such as the rise of fundamentalism increased insurgency or terrorism and the plight of immigrants can be easily traced to the widening economic disparity between the rich and poor in each country and across the countries these problems cannot be solved without addressing their root cause the economic disparity with advanced education and greater access to information people are now learning more and more about the disparity that exists and is expanding in society as technological innovations have greatly increased communication and awareness among people every incident no matter where it happens has immediate worldwide effects therefore unless the world moves to establish a more equitable distribution of wealth enforces much greater accountability provides equal opportunity for everybody and institutes a better safety net for common people the present unrest in the world is not likely to go away but may intensify into a much bigger force so what lies ahead for mankind depends entirely on how capitalism meets these challenges finally the above is the briefest narrative of the history of economic exploitation in society and its obvious fallout if we are to seek social harmony among people our future research should indeed be focused on finding a way to reduce the huge economic disparity in society by establishing a more equitable distribution of wealth and enforcing better justice for all practical implications if history is any guide one must realize that it would not be possible to achieve or maintain true equality in society in fact true equality in society may never be achieved the most that one might hope for is somewhat better treatment of society s underprivileged by providing them with necessities of life and by opening up opportunities for them with access to education and healthcare to accomplish this the government could structure the country s tax system for the rich to help the poor ironically some politicians in the united states have already started floating a proposal to impose a progressive wealth tax system on the super rich which idea seems to be gaining traction arguably globalization has helped reduce world poverty but not to the level that could be justified especially when one compares it to the accelerated rise of the super rich class of people in the emerging economies india as well as other south asian countries could be cited as good examples of this situation to uphold social coherence these countries could thus set an example for other emerging economies by establishing a system whereby the underprivileged would be properly taken care of to that end they could certainly draw lessons from the egalitarian societies of europe as well as japan references akerlop george a and shiller robert j 2015 phishing for phools the economics of manipulation and deception

by chris martenson propertyesp com au conditions today mirror 2016 when growing weakness in the global economy and wobbling financial markets caused the world s central banks to absolutely freak out they responded by dumping more thin air money into the system than ever before in history and it worked for them at least economic growth stabilized and the prices of stocks real estate and other assets enjoyed another three year joyride similarly as things started getting shaky in late 2018 the same playbook was deployed and again we ve seen stocks rocket upwards ever since but will the strategy actually work this time it s unclear and a lot is riding on the answer back in 2016 the financial world was falling apart the us dollar was spiking emerging market currencies were getting destroyed the s p 500 equities was exhibiting a classic head and shoulders formation indicative of a coming plunge the macro economic outlook looked grim too with global trade slipping into contraction source but then everything suddenly turned around as if by magic well we now know that magic was actually a massive quantity of monetary and fiscal stimulus pumped into the system by the world s central banking cartel our concern is that the monetary and fiscal authorities are thinking that since they were successful back in 2016 they can repeat the same strategy here in 2019 but can they maybe or maybe not if the answer is yes our prediction is to expect what we got last time just taken to more extremes a vastly wider wealth gap between the 1 and everyone else accelerated destruction of savers and the middle classes and anemic gdp growth coupled with explosive further growth of global debt levels if the answer is no a massive crash of epic proportions unlike any most of us have ever experienced is in store credit bubbles are ugly beasts they re fun while they last but devastating when they burst the longer they carry on the worse the crash when it comes this bubble has been going on for longer than most people ever could have imagined 2016 a post mortem it s eerie how closely recent developments resemble what took place at the start of 2016 in 2016 there were slumping emerging markets a slew of macro indicators pointing to a global slowdown and equity bear markets all over the place and then presto everything reversed during one night in february 2016 it was as if nothing had ever happened somehow all those fundamental macro warnings just melted away in a burst of financial market exuberance s p futures took off in the overnight session between feb 7th and the morning of february 8th as if the entire world suddenly had a change of heart from that moment on the s p started climbing to new all time highs practically unabated until september 2018 so what happened here what new information became available to the world s investors in the wee late night early morning hours of february 8th 2016 that wasn t available the day before nothing fundamental that s for sure massive buy orders showed up in the middle of the night and it was only later that the economic data began to turn the corner what came first was the tremendous application of monetary fiscal and financial stimulus just gobs and gobs of it economic recovery such as it was showed up later what you need to understand is that between 2016 and the middle of 2018 the world s central banks opened up the floodgates here and poured the most amount of money into the system since the global financial crisis began back in 2008 in the chart above you can see where the central banks panicked back in mid 2015 it didn t take long for their combined printing hit the highest run rate of the entire crisis at 2 5 trillion dollars by mid 2016 they then kept the pedal to the metal clear through mid 2018 this represents by far the largest stimulus of the entire mis begotten quantitative easing experiment that began after the gfc printing up money from thin air to jam into the financial markets and thus into the portfolios of the rich the most money printing ever by a huge margin this wasn t even remotely in line with their public statements which were all geared towards soothing and placating the masses the economy is robust they said growth is on track they cooed but behind the scenes they were hastily and often haphazardly dumping the largest ever quantity of money and credit into the system the world had ever seen not unlike how a 5 year old fearing getting caught pushes a pilfered bag of chips quickly under a nearby sofa cushion as mentioned frequently here at peak prosperity even though a painful correction was likely avoided by these efforts not everybody shared equally in the resulting years of continued gains in a system now as heavily financialized as ours is the benefits of such extreme stimulus efforts accrue exponentially to those who own and control financial assets those at very tippy top of the wealth income distribution it s amazing to see how not only does the top 1 dramatically outpace the bottom 99 but the top 0 1 leaves the top 1 in the dust same for the top 0 01 vs the 0 1 and the top 0 001 they re in a stratosphere all their own the developed world is quickly becoming an oligarchy and more central bank printing only exacerbates that dynamic we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the more they prop up the system with more money printing the more trumps brexits yellow vest protestors and populist politicians we ll see money printing is a political act of wealth redistribution from the bottom to the top it s unfair and socially destabilizing even if they can t yet see the true culprit here the masses are beginning to wake up to how badly screwed they re getting until and unless until and unless we wrote in early 2018 we warned that until and unless the world s central banks reversed course and began printing like crazy the vast global cesspool of over expensive bubbly financial assets would soon undergo a painful downwards re pricing and start fall they did through september 2018 up through christmas eve then as they have done so many times a miracle bottom was formed one that didn t resemble a true bottom where buyers and sellers settle in and wrestle for a while with neither side gaining ground what we experienced instead was a very steep v a needle bottom if you will an upside down matterhorn what caused this violent reversal some immediate return of global macro conditions to amazing awesomeness some new data revealing massive new sources of corporate profits no none of that it was just another 1 trillion of central bank money printing coupled with every other conceivable option to shove additional money and credit into the system in a recent interview james grant of grant s interest rate observer provided his views on the fed and other central banks and their role in backstopping every downwards wiggle in today s stock markets emphasis mine q what would you do if you were at the helm of the world s most powerful central bank a i fear it might be too late but to start with i m in favor of interest rates which are discovered in the marketplace and at the very short end interest rates ought to be pitched at a level that provides some premium to the inflation rate so my first order would be to give a speech saying that we are out of the business of manipulating expectations we are out of the business of manipulating the stock market the stock market is going where it wants to go and if it goes down a lot so be it that s not our line of work we are in the business of securing a currency which holds its value and which provides a good medium of exchange q sounds straightforward but how would the financial markets react a they would consider it as very radical and very unhelpful but the way forward is to somehow reinstitute the interaction of supply and demand on wall street and to get the fed out of the business of wholesale manipulation of values because today the fed is expected to intervene when things go badly and what this has given us is immense distortions source the central banks are so terrified of the franken markets they ve created that they now intervene both directly and indirectly overtly and covertly to do anything and everything necessary to prevent them from ever going down again james grant thinks the fed should get out of the business of wholesale manipulation of asset prices and we could not agree more its constant interventions and manipulations are terribly destructive on so many levels societally structurally ecologically and politically that it s worth an entire book to point them all out but here we are and the fed does not look like it s planning to change its behavior anytime soon this better work our macro beef with all of this is that even if the fed is successful we all lose the natural end to its current policies is a tiny fraction of the population owning everything but even worse than that our planet is being despoiled by this desperate quest for more fantasy wealth represented by fantasy digits within the entirely human contrived fantasy of our financial markets the immense distortions that james grant mentions above lead to all sort of malinvestment that should never happen in a rational world but as long as there s a short term profit motive funded by endless thin air money there s an incentive to harvest the last tree fish the last tuna drain the last aquifer and then where will we be if we don t tame our addiction to endless growth always more more then we ll simply consume ourselves out of existence or at least to a civilization ending conclusion real wealth consists of real things it s health it s the safety and security of those we care about it s access to food and clean air and water it s being in meaningful relationships held lovingly in the here and now what we call money is a claim on wealth but it s not real wealth in and of itself hopefully we can all agree that if the sun blinked out for some reason we d soon realize that money was never the thing of vast importance we made it out to be similarly if our ecosystems crash we ll learn that the pursuit of money is much less important than we currently realize certainly not as important as eating or if we stupidly allow the gap between the wealthy and the poor to widen we ll soon wake up to the type of revolution that history books are full of the steps being taken by today s central banks are diverting us from having the conversations we really need to be engaging in those in power perpetuate the repeatedly disproven idea that printing money is the same thing as prosperity our future is bleaker for their actions not brighter the younger generations are starting to figure this out in droves as they face the piling evidence that they are inheriting a world burdened by debt pollution and serious inequality this is something the baby boomers running the central banks really ought to be noticing sooner or later the propping the manipulating the cajoling and the distorting will fail when it does the aftermath will be quite unpleasant tragically we could have avoided much of the coming reckoning if we d learned the right lessons from 2000 and 2008 and allowed the bad debts and the poorly run large banks to simply fail the world would have shuddered for a brief period but it would have then carried on from a much more sustainable baseline the wealth gap would be a fraction of what it currently is and trump almost certainly would not be president brexit not on the table and populist movements blooming like california poppies after heavy spring rains but we didn t learn the right lessons and so here we are in part 2 why this better work we look closely at just how awful the fast deteriorating macroeconomic situation is it s very bad gdp is falling in nearly every region of the globe long hot real estate markets have nosed over world trade volumes are shrinking industry energy consumption is in decline the list goes on and on left to itself the economy would enter recession in a skinny minute to flush out the many trillions of bad debt and malinvestment that have accreted over the past decade to prevent this from happening and to keep asset prices moving higher or to even simply keep them at their current ultra expensive levels the central banks will need to deploy a truly mind boggling amount of intervention will they and will the system respond the same way it did before and even if it does will the 99 9 placidly subsist on even smaller crumbs as the remaining wealth is hoovered into the pockets of the top 0 1 if the answer to any of these questions is no none of us is fully

as the conflict between russia and ukraine continues with the threat of a potentially greater conflict emerging critical factors have emerged that severely mitigate russia s ambitions along with shifting military capacities and a shifting reliance on russian gas ukraine has a blossoming relationship with its newest partner china in february 2014 russian troops began their attack on ukraine this attack left most of eastern ukraine in the hands of separatists and russian soldiers the conflict ostensibly created independent separatist states in the donetsk and luhansk oblasts a sham referendum on the return of crimea to russia was then promoted as russian president vladimir putin celebrated the annexation of crimea further threats were advanced towards ukraine through a sponsored military conflict in eastern ukraine each day the organization for security and co operation in europe osce special monitoring mission reports of battles between ukrainian and russian sponsored troops in the donetsk and luhansk regions between 2014 and 2018 this military conflict continued in eastern ukraine where more than 10 000 people have been killed and thousands displaced on november 25 2018 russian ships attacked and boarded three ukrainian vessels in the crimean port of azov near the black sea a freighter was placed to block the port under the claim that ukraine had violated russian waters as these conflicts continue the underlying treaties and protocols which had been agreed upon to regulate relations between russia and ukraine have been violated by russia at almost every opportunity yet despite these apparent threats and the threat of a potentially greater conflict between russia and ukraine critical factors have emerged that mitigate russia s aims chiefly among them are ukraine s increased ability to defend itself against russia militarily russia s decreased military capacity a diminishing reliance on russian gas and most of all ukraine s blossoming relationship with its newest partner china background to the conflict in 1992 the ussr broke apart into the russian federation and a host of former territories once part of the ussr these formerly allied states were granted or asserted their autonomy and became independent states some joined nato the former warsaw pact nations were no longer in the thrall of moscow and went their own way it was only ukraine which remained a problem in april 1991 mikhail gorbachev had prepared a treaty recognising the breakup of the ussr into autonomous republics but was prevented from signing the treaty by the attempted coup against him in august of that year on august 24 1991 the coup had failed and leonid makarovych kravchuk head of the ukrainian parliament passed a motion declaring the independence of ukraine with him as its first leader a referendum in december 1991 voted kravchuk in as the first president of an independent ukraine it was at that point that the u s became deeply involved in ukrainian politics the u s s primary concern was strategic the control of ukraine s nuclear weapons at that time ukraine was the third largest nuclear power in the world the u s demanded that ukraine immediately remove its nuclear weapons to russia where they would be destroyed and demanded that ukraine immediately sign the salt 1 and the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt ukraine s denuclearization was established with three international treaties first russian president boris yeltsin president clinton and kravchuk signed the trilateral accord in moscow on january 14 1994 with ukraine committing to the elimination of all nuclear weapons including strategic offensive arms located in its territory the accord was buttressed with paragraphs of american russian security guarantees the united states and russia stated that they would reaffirm their commitment to ukraine in accordance with the principles of the csce conference on security and cooperation in europe final act to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of the csce member states and recognize that border changes can be made only by peaceful and consensual means they also reaffirmed their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state and that none of their weapons would ever be used in self defence or otherwise in accordance with the charter of the united nations in a private letter to president clinton kravchuk promised that ukraine would he nuclear free by june 1996 the three parties met again in budapest with the u k on the 5th of december 1994 and signed the npt the budapest memorandum according to the budapest memorandum ukraine would become party to the treaty on the non proliferation of nuclear weapons and effectively cede its nuclear arsenal to russia russia the u s and the uk would respect ukrainian independence sovereignty and existing borders refrain from threatening or using force against ukraine refrain from economically pressuring ukraine seek immediate united nations security council action if ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used refrain from using nuclear weapons on ukraine consult with one another should questions arise regarding these commitments the black sea fleet and russian gas the next area of concern was the division of the soviet black sea fleet it has always been a key military concern of the russian state from the czars onward to have access to a warm water port for its navy unfortunately for the russians the independence of the ukrainian state left its key warm water ports sevastopol odessa and nikolayev entirely under ukrainian control the russians were keen on maintaining their black sea fleet in the black sea and operating the large soviet naval fleet stationed there the ukrainians entered into discussions with the russians on the division of the fleet of warships in the black sea ports and the leasing of ukrainian ports to the russian navy this change in the status of the soviet navy was conducted within the framework of the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe cfe which was being negotiated between nato and the warsaw pact organisations nato essentially a euphemism for the pentagon played an important role in advising the ukrainians on its black sea fleet issues it also generated the creation of the organisation for security and co operation in europe osce which then and now plays an important role in the relationship between nato the ukraine and russia in june 1993 then ukrainian president leonid kravchuk and russian president boris yeltsin signed an agreement essentially splitting the fleet in half the agreement quickly fell apart ukrainian and russian military leaders objected to their losses of either ships or ports in september 1993 and again in april 1994 the black sea fleet agreement was renegotiated on 28 may 1997 after nearly five years of controversy the dispute was finally settled when prime ministers chernomyrdin and lazarenko signed three intergovernmental agreements they would divide the fleet s assets while leasing port facilities in sevastopol to the russian navy both nations split the fleet s ships evenly while russia agreed to buy back some of the more modern ships with cash as a result russia ultimately received four fifths of the black sea fleet s warships while ukraine received about half of the facilities the two leaders agreed that russia would rent three harbours for warships and two airfields for a twenty year period for a payment of about 100 million annually sevastopol which had been partly under russian control was given to ukraine a crisis however would soon develop in august 2008 several russian black sea fleet warships dropped anchor off the georgian coast during and after the august 2008 russian armed conflict with georgia over abkhazia and south ossetia ukraine which sided with georgia and nato during the conflict repeatedly said that russian black sea combat ships regularly transported undeclared cargo to the georgian enclaves and refused to submit customs declarations while crossing ukrainian territorial waters the u s intervened diplomatically for the ukrainians to support them in their pressure on the russians in the crimea not to use their ships to intervene in the georgian war as a result then ukrainian president viktor yushchenko announced that ukraine would not extend the lease of the sevastopol base beyond 2017 and urged the russian fleet to start preparations for a withdrawal the war in georgia which was supported by nato and the european union and the threat by the ukrainians that russia would lose its warm water naval bases in crimea provoked russia to retaliate against both ukraine and the european union russia threatened to cut off supplies of natural gas to ukraine and western europe in january 2009 these threats were made real when russia reduced exports of gas to europe by 60 europeans pressed for some sort of a compromise the dispute was framed as a commercial dispute over prices and payments but there were far more strategic concerns involved the black sea fleet while the u s supported the ukrainians in their defiance of the russian threats europeans pressed for some sort of a compromise which would let the gas flow to their countries the ukrainians were caught in the middle europe was desperate for ukraine to do whatever it took to assuage the russian gas threat while the u s and its nato allies pressed the ukrainians to follow through on ending the russian leases which allowed them a presence in the black sea despite the arguments brought forward in favour of each of these policies a realistic assessment of the situation was made that there was no substitute at that time for russian gas so a compromise would have to be reached with russia after much discussion a compromise was reached and the ukrainian and russian parliaments on 27 april 2010 ratified a deal to extend the lease on russian naval bases in ukraine for 25 years after the then current lease expired in 2017 in return ukraine received a 30 discount on russian natural gas europe got its gas restored this began an accelerated process in europe to bring the government of ukraine under its wing and control which could prevent further confrontations on the transport of gas although ukraine was not very interested at that time in joining nato it was interested in establishing a relationship within the aegis of the european union during her periods in office prime minister yulia tymoshenko had met with representatives of the european union under the terms of the european neighbourhood policy enp which aimed to create a ring of friendly states allied but not members of the european union she became the voice of europeans in the ukrainian leadership the u s policy was far more confrontational the neocons who dominated u s foreign policy towards ukraine were loath to lose the opportunity of denying russia the use of naval bases in the black sea especially after the georgian war while vaguely sympathetic to the europeans their main enemy was seen as russia and any diminution of russian power and influence was a main concern their keymain supporters within ukraine president viktor yuschenko and prime minister tymoshenko had just lost control of ukraine in the national election of a new president viktor yanukovych who had taken office on the 25th of february 2010 yanukovych was the president from the donbas region mainly russian speaking which the yuschenko and tymoshenko governments had largely ignored or opposed during their presidencies that meant that the ratification of the treaty extending russian occupation of the naval bases was being considered by the rada parliament under a political majority controlled by viktor yanukovych and his party of the regions the ratification process of the treaty in the rada took place amid violent protests by the opposition which called the deal an act of treason former president yushchenko criticised the new government for trading sovereignty for gas what happened in the supreme rada is a military usurpation i am convinced that this is not the end he said at a media briefing former prime minister yulia tymoshenko called on citizens to rise against the current leadership however despite protests the rada ratified the treaty on 27th of april 2010 the european union continued to encourage ukraine to move closer to eu accession however the first thing the eu wanted was to control ukrainian energy policy so it could protect the european wide price of gas in december 2009 the energy community ministerial council decided on the accession of moldova and ukraine to the eu on december 15 2010 ukraine ratified the energy community treaty and became a full contracting party of the energy community with a legal commitment to adopt eu energy competition and environmental directives in may 2010 president yanukovych promised to adopt the legislation necessary for creating a free trade zone between ukraine and the european union further discussions in the next year led to proposals for even closer bonds between the eu and ukraine they were broken off however when former pm tymoshenko was arrested and jailed for corruption under politically motivated circumstances by the yanukovych government the eu would put the accession of ukraine on hold until yanukovych freed tymoshenko although the eu would agree to accept the accession of ukraine into the eu the rada decided that before ratification there must be a three way trade agreement which included russia to prevent a gas crisis and ratification of the agreement with the eu was suspended this was not only a question of an argument about gas yanukovych had refused to sign the eu agreement because his supporters primarily in the eastern heartland were bitterly opposed to its terms as they came with a long list of economic austerity programs this resulted in considerable backlash within ukraine at the refusal of the government to sign the agreement and a repeat of the occupation by protestors of the maidan square now called the euro maidan resulted ukraine is in a far better place to defend itself against russia militarily the uprising in the east a wave of demonstrations and civil unrest began on the night of 21 november 2013 with public protests in independence square in kiev and demands of closer european integration these protests expanded becoming a movement for the resignation of president yanukovych and his government a parliamentary coup there was a great deal of violence in the square by both the government and the various fascist nationalist parties who made up a substantial part of yanukovych s opposition by 25 january 2014 the protests had been fueled by the perception of widespread government corruption abuse of power and violation of human rights in ukraine as the protests continued violence intensified with shootings and beatings on all sides resulting in about 80 dead and 600 wounded in the clashes at the square on february 21 after negotiations between president yanukovych and representatives of the opposition aided with mediation by the european union and russia the agreement about settlement of political crisis in ukraine was signed the agreement provided a return to the constitution of 2004 that is to a parliamentary presidential government carrying out early elections of the president until the end of 2014 it also provided for the formation of the government of national trust the rada and the international partners agreed however while this seemed generally acceptable as a compromise to the negotiators the protestors and representatives of the u s government insisted on further concessions and the resignation of the president at this time the economic situation in ukraine was dire it was running out of money ukraine turned first to its erstwhile partners in the eu requesting 20 billion euros us 27 billion in loans and aid the eu however was only willing to offer 610 million euros us 838 million in loans along with harsh conditions on the ukrainian economy which would have required heavy austerity and changes to the law on the other hand russia offered us 15 billion in loans and cheaper gas prices without the onerous demands for an austerity program on the 21st of february 2014 believing that his time was up and that civil war was looming president yanukovych abandoned his office fleeing to kharkiv and later to russia the rada met the next day to impeach yanukovych for being unable to perform his duties a date was set for new elections and two days later a warrant was issued for the arrest of the ex president for the mass killings of civilians with the ouster of yanukovych russia began supporting the rebelling regions of donetsk and luhansk which had supported yanukovych arms equipment and irregular soldiers were sent to fight against the ukrainian army in mid march nato revealed satellite photos showing russia s covert invasion of ukraine s eastern border an eu emergency meeting added further sanctions on russia s oil and banking sectors in april 2014 russia supported local rebels which took over city halls and police stations throughout eastern ukraine by july russia continued to strengthen its military force on the border there were 19 000 to 21 000 troops massed 14 advanced surface to air missile units and 30 artillery batteries it was clear that russia could launch an attack into eastern ukraine at a moment s notice russia had already launched rockets across the border in support of ukrainian rebels in an effort to prevent further violence the trilateral contact group on ukraine was formed which consisted of representatives from ukraine russia and the osce the group was established in june as a way to facilitate dialogue and resolution of the strife across eastern and southern ukraine meetings of the group along with informal representatives of the breakaway donetsk and lugansk people s republics took place on 31 july 26 august 1 september and 5 september 2014 the details of the agreement signed on 5 september were called the minsk protocols they agreed to twelve major points to ensure an immediate bilateral ceasefire to ensure the monitoring and verification of the ceasefire by the osce decentralisation of power including through the adoption of the ukrainian law on temporary order of local self governance in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts to ensure the permanent monitoring of the ukrainian russian border and verification by the osce with the creation of security zones in the border regions of ukraine and the russian federation immediate release of all hostages and illegally detained persons a law preventing the prosecution and punishment of persons in connection with the events that have taken place in some areas of donetsk and luhansk oblasts to continue the inclusive national dialogue to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in donbass to ensure early local elections in accordance with the ukrainian law on temporary order of local self governance in particular districts of donetsk and luhansk oblasts to withdraw illegal armed groups and military equipment as well as fighters and mercenaries from the territory of ukraine to adopt a programme of economic recovery and reconstruction for the donbass region to provide personal security for participants in the consultations despite the signing of the minsk protocols skirmishes continued further talks took place in minsk to try and resolve some of the issues which were continuing the violence they would then sign a memorandum to the minsk protocols these included to pull heavy weaponry 15 kilometres 9 3 mi back on each side of the line of contact creating a 30 kilometre 19 mi buffer zone to ban offensive operations to ban flights by combat aircraft over the security zone to withdraw all foreign mercenaries from the conflict zone to set up an osce mission to monitor implementation of minsk protocol despite this the battles continued the minsk protocols were essentially irrelevant in summary russia sent troops and equipment to carry on a war against ukraine using its own troops and surrogates in the donetsk and luhansk russia annexed crimea it has taken effective control of the azov sea it has violated the terms of the trilateral accord the conference on security and cooperation in europe final act the budapest memorandum the agreement about settlement of political crisis in ukraine and the two minsk protocols now russia is beefing up its troop levels and naval vessels in and around ukraine and is threatening further attacks despite the sanctions against russia by the us and the eu despite these apparent threats and the condonation of russia s behaviour by europeans desperate for russian gas there are several factors mitigating russia s success ukraine is in a far better place to defend itself against russia militarily it has had growing support from a more openly neocon foreign policy direction by the united states there has also been a formidable decline in russia s ability to afford or achieve the modernisation of its military equipment along with a lack of competent manpower among this there has also been a diminishing reliance despite nord stream 2 by europe for russian gas most of all ukraine has a growing relationship with its newest partner china the russian reliance on ukrainian military technology one of the major difficulties of the russian military stance towards ukraine has been the fact that the most developed facilities for military production were located in ukraine the russian army had been starved of new equipment for over twenty years and much of what it had available was built in ukraine ukraine s military industrial complex is the most advanced and developed branch of the state s sector of economy there are about 85 scientific organizations specialized in the development of armaments and military equipment along with an air and space complex and research design and development institutes to design and build modern ships and armaments for the ukrainian navy this includes the ability to design and build heavy cruisers missile cruisers and anti submarine warfare asw cruisers ukraine s military industrial complex in conjunction with numerous scientific research institutes and scientific industrial corporations has the capacity to develop and produce substantial small arms communications and automated control systems intelligence and radio electronic warfare equipment and engineer equipment and materiel perhaps the best example is the company motor sich it has been the sole producer of engines for the mi 8 and mi 24 helicopters it produced these engines for the russian helicopter industry and a wide range of other military components the air firm antonov is based in ukraine and is one of the major suppliers of aircraft for the russian air force and for russian arms exports the ability of the russian industry to fill its own needs is compounded by the fact that it needs ukrainian parts and subassemblies for its exports and consumption losing control of the eastern ukraine has jeopardised moscow s ability to fulfill multibillion dollar international contracts without ukrainian inputs antonov also supplies the engines for the jointly produced an 148 planes ukraine and russia had plans to produce 150 planes of this type worth 4 5 billion other exporters to russia include mykolayiv based zorya mashproekt which sells several types of turbines to russia including those installed on military ships another is kharkiv based haroun which supplies the control systems for russian missiles the volume of russian imports of major conventional weapons in 2009 2013 was 176 percent higher than for the previous five year period of 2004 2008 the yasumasa plant in dnipropetrovsk is the only service provider for satan missiles that russia uses the ukrainians are also the main supplier of spare parts which its armed forces desperately need russia is scrambling to supply domestic factories with the technology needed to produce these components inside russia however much of the higher inputs of technology especially in the electromechanical area are sourced in france germany britain and the u s now effectively closed off to russia by sanctions despite efforts by russian troops in the eastern ukraine many of the existing plants were attacked and damaged by the rebels of donetsk and lugansk additionally the skill set of the russian factories has been degraded by the demographic crisis of russia and an ageing population russia did not have the capacity to replicate the ukrainian military industrial complex inside the russian borders overnight despite its bluff and bluster to the contrary when the ukrainian government decreed that it was banning all military sales to russia it was a challenge to president vladimir putin and russia s generals where would they get the turbines for their ships the missiles for their launchers the transport aircraft for their soldiers the engines for their helicopters their spare parts et al the russian government tallied up the costs of modernizing its aging military forces equipment and concluded that it would total about 800 billion vladimir putin had campaigned for the presidency by calling for a rejuvenated russian military he published an article in rosicky gazeta outlining the massive spending he was intending to pursue in building up the armed forces unfortunately russia didn t have the money and arms manufacturers were in no position to use the funds even if they got them owing to their state of dereliction and the disappearance of skilled workers in the machine tool industry not only was supply a problem there were serious problems with quality for example uralvagonzavod the country s only tank manufacturer is a good case putin himself bowed to army pressure to place an order for 2 300 tanks to be built over the next 10 years despite a statement by general staff head nikolai makarov that the military would not be purchasing any tanks in the next five years due to their substandard quality in an article in ria novosti on 15 march 2012 ground forces chief col gen alexander postnikov said that the most advanced weapon systems manufactured for russia s ground forces are below nato and even chinese standards and are expensive the weapon models that are manufactured by our industry including armour artillery and small arms and light weapons fail to meet the standards that exist in nato and even china he said that russia s most advanced tank the t 90 was in fact a modification of the soviet era t 72 tank but cost 118 million rubles over 4 million per unit it would be easier for us to buy three leopards with this money postnikov said military modernisation was russia s key priority but it was made infinitely more challenging by the loss of ukrainian facilities technology and skilled workers and of course international sanctions president putin has consistently promised more funds for this endeavour but has been hampered by several key problems some of which he cannot control for years russia has been in the midst of a demographic crisis and it might be getting worse there was a 5 4 decline in the birth rate between 2017 and 2018 up until last year the population has been holding somewhat steady but the low birth rate coupled with low immigration made 2018 the first year there was a population decline in absolute terms global tables of male life expectancy put russia in about the 160th place below bangladesh russia has the highest rate of absolute population loss in the world the russian population is ageing and russia remains in the throes of a catastrophic demographic collapse the population is expected to fall to 139 million by 2031 and could shrink 34 per cent to 107 million by 2050 russia is suffering from a mass emigration of its populace especially among the educated according to the state statistics service sss approximately 4 5 million people moved out of russia between 1989 and 2014 the smallest outflow occurred in 2009 when just 32 500 people emigrated but the numbers began rising again after 2011 and in 2014 once again reached 1995 levels the situation has gotten significantly worse russian government statistics show a sharp upturn in emigration over the last four years almost 123 000 officially departed in 2012 rising to 186 000 in 2013 and accelerating to almost 309 000 in 2014 after the annexation of crimea and even more in 2015 it isn t only the educated and the young who are leaving russia their money is leaving even faster according to expert estimates for all the years about 3 trillion has been exported abroad the net outflow of private sector capital from russia in january february 2019 amounted to 18 6 billion which is 2 1 times more than the figure for the same period last year 8 7 billion the russian central bank reports according to bloomberg s estimates over the past 25 years about 750 billion have been taken out to offshore jurisdictions from russia calculations of the mgimo professor valentin katasonov show that about 3 trillion were withdrawn from the country since the collapse of the ussr bloomberg economics calculations suggest some 750 billion in russian assets moved offshore over the last 25 years the bleeding appears to have slowed though it s unclear if this reflects tighter controls and mounting geopolitical risk or if the flows have simply been getting harder to track the cost of the continuing war in ukraine and the massive bleed of russian military resources in syria are also taking a heavy toll on the russian budget the cost of rebuilding syria will make a heavy dent in russia s economic well being however it has committed itself to a wide range of improvements in its military capabilities this despite russia s lack of adequate shipyards missile factories available conscript manpower essential electronic and guidance systems and subsystems blocked by sanctions the burden of maintaining aged and decrepit equipment and an ever expanding effort to extend its political reach into the middle east africa and latin america has increased dramatically much of this is the traditional russian policy of bluff and bluster but with the official burial of the inf treaty it is engaged in some expansion of its intermediate range missile systems some of these efforts towards greater capability appear to be directed against ukraine as russia is stepping up its threat level as ukraine prepares for elections ukraine and its new friends while ukraine has continued its daily confrontations with the forces of the donetsk and luhansk regions and russian forces along its littoral black sea and sea of azov coasts the u s passed a 47 million u s military aid package for 2018 the u s confirmed in march 2018 that it had delivered to kyiv 210 javelin anti tank missiles and 37 javelin launchers as well as military trainers in their use and deployment these had already had a marked effect on the deployment of tanks by russia and the rebels however the russian pressure on ukraine has not ceased in mid december 2018 russia moved military convoys north on the simferopol armyansk highway toward the border between kherson oblast in ukraine and crimea later that month russian submarines of the black sea fleet conducted drills in the black sea to practice covert movements while submerged russia also shifted fourteen su 27 and su 30 fighter jets to belbek airbase near sevastopol this was presumably to begin an assault on the dnepr river canal which provided fresh water to the crimea before the ukrainians blocked it the russians built a bridge over the kerch strait to bring supplies to crimea an unsteady bridge which is not expected to last too long because of the seismic conditions in the strait but it is low enough to block many of the commercial vessels shipping goods to and from the ukrainian ports of mariupol and berdiansk the u s and eu have been pushing back against this attempt by russia to strangle ukraine economically by sending vessels and missile cruisers to the area yet russia hasn t stopped its continued pressure on ukraine however there is a new dimension to the power equation with the arrival of a large chinese presence china has increased its involvement in ukraine using development assistance through its belt and road initiative bri as a rationale for its efforts china s main goal is economic benefits for itself and as a foil for the brake on russian aggression which would threaten the bri china is strengthening its position in eastern europe to gain an advantage in its relations with russia the eu and the u s for china ukraine is an important bri partner for ukraine china is its main asian economic partner in 2011 the countries signed a strategic partnership by january 2015 ukrainian president petro poroshenko and chinese leader xi jinping discussed increasing cooperation during the world economic forum in davos switzerland in september 2017 ukraine s foreign minister pawlo klimkin paid a visit to china and then last december ma kai china s vice premier visited kyiv china s activities in ukraine are ideal for its bri mostly because of ukraine s transit state position and its free trade agreement with the eu one of the main elements of bri is establishing new railway connections between china and europe in 2016 ukraine launched a test of a new rail ferry line transporting goods between the black and caspian seas but using other connections that exclude russian territory chinese investment has proved to be much less onerous than the strict rules of the eu and the bretton woods agencies which insist on managing ukrainian corruption china aggressively competes with ukraine s western partners for a strong foothold in this important frontier economy often with much less restrictions combined with free trade agreements with the eu and canada the eu has become ukraine s largest bilateral trading partner at 30 billion euros per year along with steady u s trade ukraine remains a highly attractive partner to china and chinese companies with beijing having pledged at least 7 billion for major ukrainian infrastructure projects chinese companies which often come in under budget and complete large projects ahead of schedule are now major competitors with europe for big infrastructure projects on the south eastern black sea coast the china harbor engineering company completed a 40 million dredging operation to give bigger ships access to yuzhny port while it s been reported that ports in odessa chornomorsk and izmail may also benefit while chinese companies tackle ukrainian infrastructure projects such as coastal highways and roads built to withstand the burden of heavy grain laden trucks others are investing in new grain silos and port elevators to help with transportation logistics china clearly sees ukraine as a special area of interest both for its location and for its agricultural productivity along with direct access to the danube river the black sea and the sea of azov ukraine also has 22 000 kilometres of interconnected railway to europe with bilateral trade between ukraine and china now exceeding us 7 6 billion a year ukraine also supplies china with the bulk of its corn consumption a major chinese agricultural giant noble agri has two assets in ukraine a sunflower seed processing complex in mariupol and a grain facility and port terminal in mykolaiv which boasts a capacity of 2 5 million tons per year and storage capacity of 125 000 tons ukraine is the only european country where noble agri has a presence while it competes worldwide with us companies like cargill monsanto and bunge at the moment there is no open conflict between china and russia over ukraine however it is clear that china does oppose any expanded military initiatives between russia and ukraine especially those which may close down its ports and rail lines china has essentially economic interests in ukraine interests which will disappear if hostilities break out between the two china has grown to be a much more formidable military power than russia its military history is one which demonstrates the growth in chinese power the most important conflict between the russian military and president putin may have arisen from putin s policy towards china putin s administration has been making every effort to engage with china by asking for assistance to join with russia as a consumer of its energy exports as well as a builder of pipelines ports and railroads this includes growing a financial partnership these efforts have put president putin in direct conflict with the russian military which views china as a strategic enemy for decades there has been an intense competition between the two nations in their border regions which at times has resulted in conflict and disputes over land after a treaty was completed in november 1997 establishing the border between the two countries and a 2004 complementary agreement returning some territory to china relations have been strained since then as there is an increasing imbalance between the two sides militarily economically and in terms of manpower russia has a very serious problem with china there are too few russians in the regions of khabarovsk and primorsky krai to match the chinese russia is being depopulated at a prodigious rate with many of those who lived in siberia and the russian east dalnevostok moving west to the cities across the urals there are not enough russians to conduct the business that will need to be done on a project as vast as the extraction of oil the building of a pipeline and the establishment of roads ports and infrastructure in that region even russians admit that this work will be performed by chinese labourers russian companies do not have the manpower the working capital or the inclination to perform this infrastructural work it has not improved with the continuing depopulation of the region the dependence on chinese manpower has had an important effect on russia s purported tilt towards china russian politicians may think it makes sense to shift focus to co operation with china but the russian military has no such compulsions russia s military has voiced concerns over its naval bases in sovetskaya gavan and bolshoi kamen not far away officials were surprised that president putin appears more concerned about nato 6 000 miles away than about china a nation with a population of billions that shares a border a quarter of a mile away across the amur and the ussuri rivers there are concerns that russia would not be able to prevent a chinese decision to take back some of its lost lands in the russian far east this issue has been compounded by the current chinese military and economic expansion in the arctic and the growth of china s military exports to the world of products derived from russian designs but improved upon by the chinese we are no longer bound by any limitations either on the range of our missiles nor on their power let the enemy know about it too we need high precision missiles and we are not going to repeat the mistakes of the budapest memorandum ukrainian president petro poroshenko the ukrainian response the most important aspect of the ukrainian response to the advances by china is in its military industrial complex negotiations with the chinese china is trying to buy or control the vast military capability of ukraine which was denied to russia after its invasion of ukraine one key area of interest is helicopter manufacturing and ukraine has the firm motor sich that is a world leader in building helicopter engines and other components as well as turbine engines for warships ukraine and its western partners are not willing to allow what many consider a national treasure to become chinese owned china which has been buying components from motor sich since the 1990s would greatly benefit from its trade secrets and key personnel as long as russia occupies crimea and donbas that business relationship remains blocked on the other hand ukrainians feel a new door has been opened for them by the u s leaving the inf treaty in march 2019 president petro poroshenko said that ukraine was no longer bound with some limits regarding missile range and that ukraine would now seek to develop high intermediate precision missiles ukraine has the technology and the tools for this already poroshenko stated we are no longer bound by any limitations either on the range of our missiles nor on their power let the enemy know about it too we need high precision missiles and we are not going to repeat the mistakes of the budapest memorandum with the resurgence of ukraine s defence industries the rise of a working relationship between ukraine and china and the increasing active participation of the u s in supplying ukraine with increased lethality there are limitations of russia s ability to project hard power against the ukrainians regardless in no way does this diminish or impede russia s cyber efforts or the use of trolls hackers and subterfuge to alter the political destiny of ukraine or its ability to

us dollar falls amid rising british pound new york the us dollar decreased in late trading on friday amid a stronger british pound which was lifted by upbeat british retail sales data in the first quarter signalling robust economic growth for the country in late new york trading the euro increased to 1 1245 from 1 1230 in the previous session and the british pound rose to 1 2994 from 1 2988 in the previous session xinhua news agency reported the australian dollar increased to 0 7148 from 0 7146 the us dollar bought 111 93 japanese yen lower than 111 94 japanese yen of the previous session the us dollar decreased to 1 0143 swiss francs from 1 0153 swiss francs and it was unchanged at close to 1 3386 canadian dollars from 1 3386 canadian dollars in the three months to march 2019 the quantity bought in retail sales in britain increased by 1 6 per cent when compared with quarter 4 2018 following sustained growth throughout the first three months of the year said the office for national statistics on thursday separately year on year growth in the quantity bought increased by 6 7 per cent in march the highest since october 2016 with a range of stores noting that the milder weather this year helped boost sales according to the british independent producer of official statistics the dollar index which measures the greenback against six major peers decreased 0 09 per cent at 97 3650 in late trading
u s review outlook for q1 gdp is brighter but can it be sustained two indicators this week turned the tables on what to expect out of next week s gdp report we now look for an annualized growth rate of 2 6 for the economy in the first quarter an unexpected narrowing in the trade deficit is one rationale as this indicates a big boost from trade a surge in civilian aircraft exports was a key factor and one that we do not see as sustainable retailers posted the best monthly increase in a year and a half which means less of a slowdown in consumer spending than many had feared thanks to a solid labor backdrop and other positive fundamentals the consumer spending story has legs trade to buoy u s gdp at least in the first quarter perhaps the most impactful economic development this week was news that the trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in february as exports surged 1 1 and imports rose just 0 2 of the roughly 2 3 billion increase in exports 2 2 billion came from just one category civilian aircraft given boeing s challenges with its 737 max line of aircraft we expect this dynamic to unwind in coming months for more on the impact to growth from boeing see our recent special report the one off surge in aircraft exports was a bit of a surprise but another reason that the narrowing in the trade deficit caught most forecasters off guard is the fact that this is occurring amid ongoing tariff disputes and a deterioration in the outlook for global gdp growth global export volumes for example are down 1 0 on a year over year basis and as the middle chart shows this is something that rarely occurs outside of a u s recession if global trade continues to dry up eventually u s exports will be vulnerable to that slowing for now however trade is on track to provide a sizable boost to gdp growth in the first quarter according to our latest tally net exports will add about 0 7 percentage points to the annualized rate of gdp growth in the first quarter before becoming a drag in the second quarter consumers on track to offer sustainable support to gdp although we have concerns about the ability of net exports to be a sustainable driver of gdp growth in subsequent quarters the consumer is poised to be a more sustainable driver and here we also got some good news this week we had been bracing for a slowdown in the pace of q1 consumer spending but after this week s solid report on march retail sales it now appears that the slowdown in spending will be more modest than feared even after retail sales fell in two out of three months leading up to this week s report for march we have maintained the view that this was a soft patch rather than the beginning of a sustained retrenchment in consumer spending that assessment gained credibility with news that retailers saw a 1 6 pop in march sales that was the best month in the past year and a half and takes some of the sting out of recent disappointing reports control group retail sales excludes some of the more volatile categories and feeds into the personal consumption expenditure line in the gdp report this category notched a solid 1 0 gain in march that may not be enough to meaningfully lift q1 consumer spending but it indicates a higher starting point and some momentum going into the second quarter unlike the boost from trade which is likely to be a flash in the pan the improvement in consumer spending is on track to remain supportive of gdp growth in coming quarters the tight labor market is at last generating average hourly earnings growth north of 3 and that ought to be sufficient to allow consumers to continue to spend as the year progresses u s outlook existing home sales monday next week begins with existing home sales data for march given february s 11 8 surge we expect a modest pull back in sales for the month pending home sales which reflect purchase contracts and precede existing sales by one to two months registered a small decline in february meaning march closings will likely exhibit a similar pattern however the return of winter weather likely influenced pending contracts and february s weakness masks an overall improvement in buying conditions in recent months which should be supportive of sales moving forward underlying demand continues to be solid marked by low unemployment and rising wages as the fed maintains a more dovish monetary policy stance mortgage rates continue to track lower which has induced a steady rise in mortgage purchase applications overall existing home sales appear set for modest improvement this year compared to relatively sluggish activity experienced throughout much of 2018 previous 5 51m wells fargo 5 38m consensus 5 30m durable goods orders thursday thursday brings the advanced report for durable goods orders total orders declined 1 6 in february and we expect orders partially rebounded during march february s decline was owed to a 31 1 decline in commercial aircraft orders orders excluding the volatile transportation sector fared slightly better rising 0 1 during the month on the topic of aircraft orders the grounding of the boeing 737 max will likely not affect new orders this month as only one airline has cancelled an order and widespread cancellations are unlikely that said deliveries of the 737 max have been suspended which we suspect will drag down durable good shipments during march in february nondefense capital goods shipments increased 0 6 but followed a sizable 1 5 drop in january dimming the prospect for a strong showing from equipment spending in the first quarter previous 1 6 wells fargo 0 9 consensus 0 7 gdp friday capping off the week is a first look at real gdp growth during the first quarter of 2019 on a quarter over quarter annualized basis we expect real gdp rose 2 6 in q1 a modest pick up relative to the 2 2 pace registered in q4 consumer spending will likely moderate somewhat compared to the robust pace experienced for much of last year but stronger than expected retail sales indicate less of a dropoff in spending from q4 a narrowing of the trade deficit will also provide a boost as a recent rise in exports has outweighed more modest growth in imports business investment will continue to add to gdp growth but likely slowed in q1 alongside trade tensions and slower global growth meanwhile residential investment should finally provide some modest support as lower mortgage rates have breathed new life into the housing market government purchases are also poised to expand while we look for a fairly strong contribution from inventories previous 2 2 wells fargo 2 6 consensus 2 2 quarter over quarter global review some signs of life for the global economy the past week has seen some more hopeful signs for the global economy in particular china s q1 gdp beat expectations holding steady at 6 4 year over year while march retail sales and industrial output quickened from their january february pace developments from europe were mixed u k economic figures remain resilient overall even in the face of brexit uncertainty including a sizable gain in march retail sales however eurozone april manufacturing confidence rose less than expected while service sector confidence fell more than expected chinese economic data improve the main international economic development this week was a constructive batch of chinese economic data q1 gdp surprised to the upside as growth unexpectedly held steady at 6 4 year over year meanwhile the first quarter also finished on a solid note as march activity figures not only accelerated but also beat consensus forecasts march retail sales firmed to 8 7 year over year while industrial production firmed to 8 5 altogether these activity figures reinforce the message from china s march pmi surveys which were encouraging in tone with the united states and china representing the world s key global economies trends in china s economy have important implications for asia emerging markets and the global economy more broadly the more upbeat figures suggest china s monetary and fiscal stimulus may finally be starting to take in supporting growth and for now there appears to be no let up from chinese authorities with respect to stimulus we will be watching chinese data for potential further upside surprises a development that would be positive for the global economy and financial markets eurozone data mixed but disappoints overall investor concern about the state of the eurozone economy persists and recent activity and survey data have at best mixed which has not allayed those concerns the release of the april eurozone pmi indices saw the manufacturing pmi recover less than expected to 47 8 meanwhile the services pmi fell more than expected to 52 5 reversing its march increase those pmi surveys offset more positive but less important news from earlier in the week as february construction output rose 3 month over month so far both industrial and construction out are up in january february compared to q4 2018 indeed based on pmi surveys for the first quarter and activity data through february the current eurozone q1 gdp estimate based solely on the incoming data flow is for a gain of 0 45 quarter over quarter even with some probable weakness in march activity figures there could be a slight firming in eurozone q1 gdp from the 0 2 gain seen in the fourth quarter although the april pmis offer less confidence that any strength will be sustained through 2019 u k economic figures back in focus with brexit on the backburner for now as the exit date extended to october 31 the focus returned to u k data this week overall those economic figures were mixed wage growth remains sturdy with average weekly earnings rising 3 5 year over year in the three

broadly u k growth has been remarkably resilient as evidenced by gains in january and february gdp considering the brexit uncertainty that is still hanging over the economy even with those steady

even further to 1 5 year over year while the consensus forecast is for the core inflation measures to ease as well in addition to modest inflation australian economic growth is also subdued q4 gdp rose just 0 2 quarter over quarter and falling house prices indicate a slowing housing market although labor market trends remain resilient that said with inflation and economic growth both subdued

canada wednesday the bank of canada announces its monetary policy decision next week and is expected to hold its policy interest rate steady at 1 75 in march the central bank said there was increased

february retail sales rose 0 8 month over month and the march cpi quickened to 1 9 year over year while employment figures have been solid overall if the overall strengthening of economic growth were to continue we would expect the bank of canada to raise its policy rate a further 25 bps this year sweden s central bank also announces monetary policy next week the central bank raised rates 25 bps

sector has also been somewhat subdued in recent months in february retail sales rose a modest 0 6 year over year although for march some firming in sales growth is expected to 0 8 year over year the subdued activity data are consistent with the q1 tankan survey which foreshadowed a slowdown in growth given sluggish momentum the chances of less accommodative bank of japan policy have dissipated

consensus 0 1 month over month point of view interest rate watch fed speakers emphasize patience there were a number of fed speakers who were busy making public statements this week before the blackout period ahead of the may 1 fomc meeting took effect crucially none of the speakers sought to change the narrative that the fed likely will be on hold for the foreseeable future chicago fed president evans a voting member of the fomc this year said that the fed should embrace inflation modestly above 2 percent 50 percent of the time with the pce deflator up only 1 4 on a year ago basis at present it does not seem likely that evans will be arguing for a rate hike anytime soon boston fed president rosengren also a fomc voter this year said that the economy is doing well but that inflation is under the fed s 2 objective which is another implicit acknowledgement that the fomc does not need to hike rates anytime soon james bullard voting member from st louis expressed sympathy for nominal gdp targeting which if adopted would imply that the fed should support strong nominal gdp growth with an accommodative policy stance patrick harker non voter from philadelphia struck a slightly more hawkish tone when he said that the fomc could potentially hike rates once at most in 2019 but harker also acknowledged that he too is in a wait and see mode at present not only does the fomc look at hard data on the economy but it also pays attention to anecdotal evidence that is collected by the federal reserve banks this evidence is summarized in the so called beige book which is usually released two weeks ahead of a fomc meeting the anecdotes contained in this week s beige book suggest that economic activity expanded at a slightto moderate pace in march and early april contacts also used the word moderate when describing the pace of employment growth and prices were reported to have risen modestly since the last fomc meeting words like moderate and modestly do not connote a great deal of urgency consequently it seems that the fed will be on hold for the foreseeable future credit market insights greater opportunity zone clarity the treasury department released a new set of regulations this week related to opportunity zones which should provide commercial real estate investors with greater clarity and help to bring more capital in off the sidelines created as part of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 opportunity zones aim to incentivize capital investment into more than 8 700 low income areas across the united states via advantageous tax provisions the program allows the deferment of capital gains until 2026 as well as the elimination of taxes on capital gains if investments within these distressed communities are held for 10 years or more yet there has been significant uncertainty surrounding the program s stipulations which has acted to restrain investor appetite for new projects the new regulations detail a set of flexible requirements for businesses to qualify for the incentives and affirm that tax benefits can carry over to new investments after a sale of a qualified property among other provisions on balance this suggests the benefits of these zones are applicable to a wider swath of business and capital than previously known or known with certainty at least opportunity zones have already sparked tremendous interest and dozens of funds have launched to focus on these areas with this new set of rules providing greater clarity and flexibility we expect to see a pickup of capital investment into commercial real estate projects helping to sustain the economic expansion topic of the week potential gdp growth we published a report this week in which we estimate that the potential gdp growth rate of the u s economy is 2 1 at present potential gdp growth is the rate at which an economy can grow in the long run without generating inflationary or dis inflationary pressures as shown in the top chart our estimate of the economy s potential growth rate which we refer to as gdp optimal is more stable than the actual gdp growth rate that said gdp optimal is not constant but rather varies over time we estimate that potential gdp growth at present is the midpoint 2 1 of a 1 6 to 2 6 range in a report published in october 2018 we estimated that the natural unemployment rate which we call u optimal also changes over time bottom chart the current 3 8 unemployment rate is a bit below our 4 1 point estimate of u optimal that said the actual unemployment rate at present is within the 3 6 to 4 5 range that we estimate contains u optimal finally we have written in a previous report that the neutral fed funds rate which we call r optimal also varies over time our estimates of the changing nature of the economy s potential growth rate the natural rate of unemployment and the neutral fed funds rate should be seen in the context of an august 2018 speech by fed chairman powell he discussed the complications that arise in monetary policymaking when the navigational stars of the economy are not fixed powell argued that the changing structure of the economy necessitates that the fed needs to be data dependent rather than on some preset course like the fed we do not navigate our forecasts entirely by the unobserved variables of potential gdp growth and the natural unemployment rate but our estimate of these variables in conjunction with our estimate that the current fed funds rate is only one quarter percentage point above r optimal gives us some comfort that our view of unchanged fed policy through most of next year is reasonably correct

us equity markets have been on a tear in 2019 reclaiming lost ground to come within breathing distance of their all time highs the rally has been fueled mainly by the fed putting its rate hike plans on ice though easing trade tensions and corporate buybacks helped as well while stocks could advance even further and break new highs the risks seem increasingly asymmetric with gains looking limited if growth stays solid but losses severe in case fears of a recession make a comeback what a difference a few months make back in december the decade long rally in us equity markets looked ready to end with the major stock indices suffering heavy losses amid concerns that we are approaching the final stages of this business cycle and that a recession may be around the corner fading fiscal stimulus from the tax cuts overtightening by the fed trade tensions a slowdown in the housing market and global weakness from europe to china were all part of this narrative fast forward to today fears of a recession have taken a back seat and us markets are flirting with their all time highs with the benchmark s p 500 index gaining an astonishing 15 9 year to date what changed fed to the rescue in short fed policy changed the us central bank made it clear it wouldn t raise interest rates again for at least a few quarters while it monitors incoming data and the economy s health that was a sharp turn from the two rate hikes it had previously penciled in for 2019 which provided relief for stocks as lower borrowing costs tend to benefit risky assets in fact market pricing has grown more pessimistic and currently indicates a 50 probability for a fed rate cut by december this begs the question if traders think there s a good chance the most important central bank will cut rates soon in response to economic weakness is the current equity rally sustainable search for yield it wasn t just a cautious fed that pushed investors towards riskier assets of course signals of progress in the us china trade negotiations no doubt helped more broadly one could argue that there s no real alternative to stocks for now bonds are particularly expensive which means yields are low providing very little or even negative real returns to investors when one accounts for inflation and currency hedging costs case in point 5 year greek government bonds now yield less than their us equivalents which shows just how far the search for yield has gone buybacks petal to the metal another major driver behind this rally has been the record pace of corporate stock buybacks companies buy their own stocks back from the market decreasing the total number of stocks outstanding and thus increasing the value of all remaining ones by decreasing the supply of their stocks they boost prices providing immense support for markets the bad news is that this practice is coming under scrutiny by lawmakers both democratic and republican ones prominent democratic senators want to attach strings to buybacks such as companies having to pay workers higher wages before buying their own stock republicans meanwhile suggest buybacks could be taxed at higher rates to discourage them the bottom line is that any clampdown of buybacks would diminish one of the biggest sources of demand for equities although this is extremely unlikely while trump is in office valuations distorted related to buybacks is the more attractive valuation of equity indices investors usually look at several metrics to determine whether a stock or index are overvalued or undervalued the most popular is the 12 month forward price to earnings p e ratio it represents the dollar amount someone needs to invest to receive back a single dollar in annual earnings so the higher it is the more expensive a stock is considered and vice versa equity index valuations are more reasonable now compared to recent years when markets were trading at similar levels however the real question is whether these valuations have been distorted by constant buybacks which by definition boost earnings per share and thus push down on p e ratios as they leave fewer public shares to distribute earnings among hence take metrics like p e with a grain of salt as they may be understating actual valuations don t discount the bern markets haven t focused on the 2020 presidential race yet but that may change once the democratic primary debates kick off in june to be clear the main risk for stocks is bernie sanders capturing the democratic nomination the senator from vermont is an outspoken critic of large pharmaceutical firms big banks and huge multinationals overall he wants to raise corporate taxes and increase social welfare and while his policies may prove an effective antidote to low wage and productivity growth in the longer run the short term effect on stocks will most likely be negative his bid shouldn t be discounted for multiple reasons not least because he is the frontrunner in opinion polls out of the democrats that have entered the race only behind former vice president joe biden who hasn t announced yet separately nearly all opinion polls have sanders beating trump if it gets to that so it may be just a matter of time before investors realize how big of a risk the bern is recession ahead or false alarm finally let s examine the worst and best case scenarios ahead on the pessimistic side even though recession fears have abated given central bank caution the likelihood for one remains elevated in june the us expansion will become the longest in history so a downturn is already long overdue meanwhile new york fed models suggest a 27 chance and rising for a slump by early 2020 notice that this number stayed below 50 even in the height of the 2008 crisis so 27 may understate the actual probability this would be a catastrophic outcome for stocks with the potential for severe losses given current valuations even if the recession is shallow on the bright side the us economy is still in good shape with the atlanta fed gdpnow model pointing to 2 8 growth in q1 the global economy seems to be stabilizing too thanks to massive stimulus in china so in the optimistic scenario where recession fears prove to be a false alarm equities could eek out some further late cycle gains and potentially carve out new record highs however consider what that would mean for monetary policy the fed put its rate hike plans on ice because of growth worries so if those truly diminish then it could resume rate increases which typically hurts stocks that doesn t necessarily mean markets will fall especially in a strong growth environment but rather that any upside could be limited amid rising interest rates asymmetry concluding the risks surrounding equity prices seem asymmetric if fears of a recession prove correct heavy losses could follow but if the economy dodges the bullet and the situation improves any upside in stocks may be only limited as central banks resume their hiking cycles and cap the market rally beyond that demand for stocks hinges on corporate buybacks valuations seem stretched and even if growth remains stable and healthy the mounting risk of higher corporate taxes via a sanders presidency hasn t been priced in yet therefore while markets could well advance and break new highs the rally increasingly seems to be on wobbly legs and the risk to reward of additional upside from here doesn t look particularly attractive

so which is one of the reasons they have created the new international development finance corp idfc which is slated to begin operating at the end of this year like the marshall plan which in the post world war ii years used generous economic aid to fight the appeal of soviet communism in western europe the idfc aims to help washington push back against beijing s sweeping belt and road initiative the new institution should allow the united states to better align its commercial and development goals with its foreign policy in the developing world but the idfc will start at a significant disadvantage relative poverty whereas the new idfc will have about 60 billion in capital the belt and road initiative is a 1 trillion effort by some estimates pakistan alone has already received more cash commitments from china than the value of the entire idfc budget this shortfall raises the question of what else the united states should do if it s serious about countering chinese influence the answer is to use a version of what some economists call the judo strategy a method small firms deploy to compete against larger companies judo strategies tend to involve turning what is supposedly a competitor s key asset in this case its size against it for example smaller retail firms can outcompete bigger chains bogged down by costly bricks and mortar infrastructure by selling things more cheaply online or they can offer a personalized consumer experience that eludes firms operating at a larger scale recipients of chinese investments are effectively financing beijing s efforts to manage its internal economic problems when it comes to u s china competition a successful u s judo strategy should consist of three building blocks first washington should leverage the fact that china is violating well established international norms with its lending policies second the united states should draw attention to the corruption underlying the belt and road initiative and third u s officials should creatively use idfc resources to liberate countries that find themselves in beijing s financial clutches before attempting to compete with china however the united states should study beijing s objectives which are often misunderstood the belt and road initiative is as much a domestic initiative meant to address structural weaknesses in the chinese economy as it is a grand foreign policy strategy given a combination of poor demographics growing international hostility to its trade policies and the specter of weakening domestic demand beijing cannot rely on homegrown supply and demand to solve its current and future economic problems the belt and road initiative represents an attempt to use china s enormous financial reserves to create new markets for chinese goods services and unskilled labor that s why the use of chinese labor to build belt and road infrastructure is so often part of the deal recipients of chinese investments are effectively financing beijing s efforts to manage its internal economic problems understood this way the belt and road initiative reveals chinese weakness rather than strength and that s why a judo strategy could be so effective washington should leverage these and other established norms of international development to isolate beijing the united states should start by using existing international norms set by multilateral institutions such as the world bank the international monetary fund imf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to constrain china s predatory lending practices and the political leverage they bring for example the oecd has long established norms against the use of tied aid funds that require recipients to use that foreign aid to purchase goods and services from the donor tied aid is frowned on because it forces recipient countries to spend their money inefficiently and even if belt and road funding which primarily takes the form of loans does not formally constitute foreign aid beijing often violates the spirit of that principle by mandating that infrastructure projects use chinese contractors washington should leverage these and other established norms of international development to isolate beijing china and the oecd s development assistance committee for example have formed a study group that gives china the ability to claim it is adopting best practices in foreign assistance if china continues to neglect such practices then the united states which is the largest contributor to the oecd should urge it to disband that group in a very public fashion washington should also pressure the heads of the world bank and imf two organizations that depend on its support to highlight beijing s lending activities much more vigorously than they have done to date a second part of washington s judo strategy should be to highlight corrupt belt and road payments beijing has shown no scruples about using corrupt practices abroad to further its economic and foreign policy agendas a january 2019 investigation by the wall street journal for example revealed how the chinese offered to bail out a troubled malaysian investment fund in return for infrastructure projects that would give their firms above market profitability more generally many belt and road partners including kazakhstan and laos suffer from endemic corruption so how should the united states respond the idfc could try to target local elites with financial inducements but that s a risky gambit the united states should never be in the position of trying to out bribe an adversary doing so is ethically reprehensible and in a society as transparent as america s the media would undoubtedly expose the story causing potentially irreparable harm to the idfc s reputation even if this weren t a danger beijing is also probably much better than washington at using corruption effectively it has the recent experience fortunately there is another option corruption is rarely popular among citizens whose long term economic health is being sacrificed to enrich corrupt officials by relentlessly publicizing corrupt practices when they come to light washington can make such practices difficult for both beijing and the recipient government to get away with if china s generosity is seen to come with the risk of political ruin beneficiaries will start thinking twice before accepting its largesse shining a harsh spotlight on those who profit from beijing s bribery is cheap especially compared with compromising u s principles it also draws on a long tradition in u s foreign policy one of the keys to washington s success after world war ii was its investment in elaborating international norms and standards that advanced its interests along with everyone else s and while the trump administration has largely eschewed multilateral norms as the basis for its america first foreign policy it s time for washington to recognize that these norms which were largely created by the united states serve the national interest no other economy can match the scale and inventiveness of u s financial markets the final aspect of a judo strategy relies on u s financial markets which can be exploited to release target countries from the onerous lending terms that china imposes on loan recipients already several countries including pakistan and the maldives are balking at the loan repayment schedules china has set and no one has overlooked the fact that in december 2017 sri lanka had to surrender a major port to beijing as compensation for its nonpayment on outstanding loans yet no single debtor country can realistically face off against china on its own this is where the united states can step in by using the idfc to help renegotiate agreements either on behalf of the debtor country or by buying up and then refinancing the debt with longer repayment terms something made possible by the depth and breadth of the west s financial markets a model here is provided by what the international community did with latin american debt during the 1980s led by the united states it created new financial instruments such as brady bonds named after former u s treasury secretary nicholas brady to restructure the massive debt reducing the payment burdens that countries such as brazil faced the idfc should also take advantage of the fact that no other economy can match the scale and inventiveness of u s financial markets it should begin working with the u s financial industry to figure out what would be needed to create a refinancing facility that would be attractive to both western lenders and debtor countries it should also use its capital to support early repayment of loans for sustainable projects already funded under the belt and road initiative in these ways the idfc can help loosen beijing s grip on its partners in confronting china s belt and road project the united states begins with several disadvantages washington lacks beijing s appetite to spend money as well as its ruthlessness in transactions to add to that the u s private sector does not have a compelling interest in deploying large sums of capital in the developing world given investment opportunities elsewhere taking these factors into account the united states needs to deploy a judo strategy and in so doing it can upend china s effort to throw its economic weight around

the international monetary fund imf has decided to consult the new economic czar of pakistan before sending its mission to islamabad to negotiate a bailout package which has left little space for dr abdul hafeez shaikh to make his first but closely watched move if the new adviser to the prime minister on finance takes longer than needed to decide calling the imf mission it could delay finalisation of the programme as well as the next budget former finance minister asad umar had promised to unveil the budget for fiscal year 2019 20 on may 24 this time the imf s executive board would approve pakistan s loan request only after the approval of the new tax measures by parliament even if both the sides reach a staff level agreement as it is the case with all imf missions the timing of the staff s visit is decided in consultation with the country s authorities we will consult with pakistani authorities on this matter in the upcoming days imf resident representative for pakistan teresa daban told the express tribune she had been requested to comment whether the removal of umar as the finance minister would affect the upcoming imf mission s visit to pakistan on monday the imf had announced to send a mission to pakistan before end of april to continue discussions from where umar had left during his five day trip to washington president dr arif alvi on friday approved the appointment of dr abdul hafeez shaikh as adviser to the prime minister on finance revenue and economic affairs with the status of federal minister with immediate effect according to a notification of the cabinet division shaikh arrived in pakistan on the same day from the united arab emirates he confirmed to the express tribune that he on friday resigned from the management of rivendell pe llc a private equity and capital venture firm shaikh would also divest his shares in the firm to avoid the question of conflict of interest the other day prime minister imran khan suddenly decided to remove umar from his position after months long lobbying by jahangir khan tareen the prime minister also appointed shahzad syed qasim as special assistant on power and nadeem babar as special assistant on petroleum shaikh has remained in the cabinet of former military dictator general retd pervez musharraf he also served as the finance minister from 2010 2013 in the last tenure of the pakistan peoples party sources in the finance ministry said the imf wanted to make sure that the new economic czar owned the commitments given by umar they said that shaikh also needed time to reconcile with the ground realities and assess the macroeconomic situation shaikh is expected to build on the imf programme from where umar had left in order to save time umar had announced that both the sides documented the agreement and an imf mission would arrive in islamabad this month to sort out technical details the expected size of the imf loan was estimated at be 7 5 billion to 8 billion by umar due to the difficult nature of the imf conditions and its long term political and economic consequences it was justifiable for the new adviser to fully assess the implications of the imf deal before inviting the mission to visit pakistan the conditions that the imf imposed in return for the bailout appeared stringent that would keep the pti government on its toes the imf is seeking a steep increase in tax revenues cut in expenditures to sow a primary balance flexible exchange rate regime full disclosure of all types of financial arrangements with china and increase in electricity and gas prices all this would require huge political capital and it will be a challenging task for the new finance adviser to fulfil all these conditions and at the same time make sure that inflation does not go up jobless rate does not increase and economic growth rate remains above 5 umar had managed to get some concession from the imf on federal board of revenue s tax to gdp ratio and primary balance level although both these areas were still open for further discussions pakistan s second last programme with the imf 2008 2010 ended prematurely on the watch of shaikh when he could not get reformed general sales tax bill passed from parliament a condition of the imf at that time the imf had not disbursed the remaining 3 2 billion out of a total of 11 4 billion deal due to weak economic management the imf in 2011 had recommended in post programme monitoring report that president of pakistan should sign future pacts to ensure its delivery there were also unconfirmed reports that prime minister imran may appoint an economic advisory board to keep a check on the new finance adviser it will have to been seen whether shaikh would like to have such an arrangement where a parallel arrangement exists any arrangement where there will be more than one finance minister would further slowdown the process of economic policymaking
the first 100 days of andrés manuel lópez obrador s government have passed although this is a relatively short space of time it is enough to know the fundamental features of his administration this article was originally published in spanish on the mexican website of the imt la izquierda socialista power state and government in a capitalist regime the real power resides with the big capitalists they are the ones who decide what happens and how the 16 richest men in mexico have around 150 billion dollars between them equivalent to a little over 60 percent of the state budget for this year one percent of the population owns almost half of the national wealth they control the economy but they are not a democratic body nobody votes for them and they have their positions because they were born rich or have become so by wheeling and dealing in the course of their lives the super rich make the decisions but to exercise their dominance requires a legal political structure which is obscured by rules that formally permit anyone to govern while in actuality preserving the present state of affairs to ensure that the capitalists can continue to augment their wealth this legal political and repressive structure is the state the process of depredation of the bourgeoisie was done at the expense of destroying the legitimacy of the state image world economic forum the mexican state defends capitalism it can assume repressive or democratic forms depending on the degree of consensus that exists in society but will never itself seek to modify existing relations of power one aspect of the rules of the state is the renewal of its governing bodies the executive and legislative branches formally anyone can apply to occupy these organs but in reality they are filled from the ranks of the elite when a revolution takes place the masses demand participation in the state overthrow governments and reconstruct laws in their image but as long as economic relations are not changed and unless a new state with a proletarian class character is built the oligarchy will always end up assimilating the new ruling caste this was what happened with the pri institutional revolutionary party which eventually ended up as a traditional right wing party in mexico the assimilation of the government by the bourgeoisie gathered pace after miguel alemán s administration but it was in the government of carlos salinas when it reached a peak since then in its eagerness to enrich itself as quickly as possible the bourgeoisie transferred the equivalent of a quarter of the gdp to the current gang of fat cats this is a different process but in essence very similar to what happened with the porfirio díaz dictatorship the process of depredation of the bourgeoisie was done at the expense of destroying the legitimacy of the state during the administration of calderón following rampant fraud and wastefulness the state had no power in either the territories or the economic sphere in this situation criminal groups in all spheres assumed control crony capitalism replaced the rules of state control with mafia rule 1 december 2018 the masses step forward the working masses instinctively defending themselves over the course of a historical phase lasting more than 30 years have led a ceaseless battle against the bourgeoisie which reached a high point on 1 december 2018 a rare event took place someone who was not part of the bourgeois elite entered the government with 30 million votes behind him this was a real cataclysm for the system since the people opted for an alternative to the policies of so called neoliberalism the working masses have led a ceaseless battle against the bourgeoisie for 30 years which reached a high point on 1 december 2018 with amlo s election image twitter jeremias ra andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo dominated the last elections his party has a majority in both the chamber of representatives and the senate so he doesn t need to give in to the blackmail of the parties of the old regime the movement was such that even today the masses do not miss the opportunity to show their repudiation of the pri or the pan national action party by booing them in amlo s presence end of the media monopoly even the traditional media has been overwhelmed by social networks for example one mainstream news programme s youtube channel has 900 000 subscribers the 10 channels run by amlo supporters with the same number of subscribers exceed 100 000 daily views while the aforementioned mainstream news channel fails to hit 2 000 or 3 000 the control of big television and radio stations over the spread of information has been broken at this point the productive forces have flooded the relations of production but this is only one aspect of the new situation the battle for a new trade unionism the masses desire for change is expressed in all fields an example of this is in the trade union movement a battle broke out on the northern border especially in matamoros in response to amlo s announcement of an increased minimum wage the masses quickly overtook the traditional unions and strikes broke out some legal and others not and won important victories in most cases such as 20 percent wage increases comparable victories were unheard of for 30 years with the exception of the workers of the mining union whom given their strategic position and combativeness have achieved similar increases in the past despite the wrecking role of their leadership it is necessary to clarify that the triumph of the workers of matamoros is a product of the current atmosphere of class struggle it is an example of proletarian militancy a victory exclusively for the workers given that the amlo government itself would have preferred to avoid the struggle in order to get along with the businessmen now the workers face repression from the bosses in the form of dismissals but the proletariat on the border is not intimidated it is pushing for more now that the amlo government says that there must be union democracy a struggle will be unleashed to build unions to replace the fragments of ctm confederation of mexican workers and the like this will be done with or without the consent of the government the process has only just begun over these last 100 days and will tend towards generalisation at the national level regional struggles with regard to other social sectors it is important to emphasise the masses feelings of confidence in fact their greatest advantage for the moment is that they are not subject to the will of the new government for example there is a plan to build a thermoelectric plant in the state of morelos against the will of the inhabitants and they continue to struggle against its construction similar events have occurred around projects such as the gold mine in baja california which had to be cancelled due to the clamor of the masses and we will probably see struggles against projects in the isthmus of tehuantepec and the mayan train in all these cases the way forward is through class struggle working class organisation and independent mobilisation government proposals will have to confront the will of the masses in all the towns and regions of mexico women s rights the battle against women s oppression cannot be left for an indeterminate future it must be fought now image peace news a similar militancy can be seen in women s struggles it is clear that there will be not government initiative to apply the right to abortion nationwide which is currently provided by health services in mexico city for example a mass campaign will be necessary to see that this is carried through especially in the more backward regions such as guanajuato and nuevo león the same goes for the fight against femicide and for the true equality of women on these issues the impetus must come from below and the fight must be both systematic and systemic it is not a question of government policy alone but of a society poisoned by capitalism from which racism sexism and violence against the oppressed inexorably arise these battles cannot be left for an indeterminate future they must be fought now given that lives are currently being lost we must not lose sight of the fact that capitalist society will revive all the scourges of oppression and barbarism while it continues to exist in short the masses plan to take their destiny into their own hands if amlo is a partner in this all the better but they ll fight with or without him the national guard violent crime is another symptom of the capitalist crisis the president s response has been to create a new military force which will have 80 000 members the initiative is viewed with sympathy by the majority of the population given that it sounds like action rather than the empty words and window dressing of previous governments of course the reaction of large sectors of the masses that felt abandoned to rampant violence is very natural it is likely that in the long run we will see some effect in terms of more criminals being arrested but the main matter of concern is the creation of a body of armed men who being isolated from the masses can be used against them by this or future governments it could also be used against amlo himself marx pointed out the french national assembly at the time of louis bonaparte was dissolved at the hands of the armed forces it had created both the pri and the pan finally gave their approval to this new body perhaps thinking who knows maybe we will have to use this national guard to crush lópez obrador the alternative is not to sing songs of peace and love to the criminals but rather the armament of the people in the form of local militias elected in popular assemblies and placed under their oversight with the power of revocability this could be an armed force not of 80 000 but of 2 or 3 million an authentic people in arms how to fight against neoliberalism there is no doubt that amlo is genuinely a well intentioned person he has repeatedly pointed out that it is necessary to overcome neoliberalism which he identifies with corruption and the use of government positions for personal enrichment that is he acknowledges the relationship between economic power and political power instead of using the state to strengthen the oligarchy amlo intends is to use the state to distribute the wealth for the benefit of the poorest with state support ranging from 800 6 000 pesos depending on the individual case of course there is no one who opposes increasing the income of the poor except the oligarchs who consider it a mortal sin to waste money by giving it away to the poor they would prefer the continue the tradition of giving it away to the rich to put it in other words amlo aims to move from a government centred on the rich to one focused on the poor state support for 8 million seniors and 10 million high school students is just one example to finance this social investment he intends to combat another feature of neoliberalism corruption there is no doubt that amlo is genuinely a well intentioned person but his programme to create a government for the poor cannot succeed on a capitalist basis image salvador alc when it comes to any economic problem there seems to be only one response from the new government fight corruption of course there is a lot of sense in this let us suppose that the fight against corruption is successful that we all behave ourselves and we achieve savings and a budget of 500 billion pesos annually to distribute to the poor this would be an increase of 60 million enough provide about 8 400 pesos a year each per person this is better than nothing but hardly comparable to a job with an annual salary of 144 000 pesos which is necessary to pay for the basics in summary even if the programmes of the new government are successful they would still be inadequate to actually reduce poverty these policies mark a huge change from the governments of the pri and the pan but are not enough to eradicate poverty nevertheless the masses optimism is reflected in the consumer confidence indicator cci which reached 48 81 the highest level in all history to the bafflement of the bourgeois experts el sol de méxico 6 03 19 there are reasons for the masses to be optimistic including the fact that inflation 3 9 annually is at one of the lowest levels in five years to top it off the dollar currently averages 19 pesos while 100 days ago it exceeded 20 pesos international turbulence of course these circumstances are due to external factors such as the fact that donald trump is dedicated to destroying trade agreements with the whole world russia turkey india the eu but especially with china with whom he is carrying out a genuine trade war this has led the trump administration to exert relatively little pressure on mexico which in the short term creates a relatively advantageous scenario for mexican foreign trade which still has a valid treaty with the states the world economy is heading towards the collapse of the dollar although this process may still take some time and while this is happening the mexican economy survives by treading water in the face of international turbulence however when the international crisis erupts there will be no shield to protect us the shackle of debt neither has the printing of money nor further debt been resorted to the latter has angered us banks which like vampires live by sucking the blood of entire countries through interest on unpayable loans enrique peña nieto was a hero to the us banks since he took total indebtedness internal and external from 30 percent of gdp to 50 percent today allowing the bankers to earn billions pemex alone the privatised state oil company took on debt worth almost 100 billion dollars this was so painful that amlo says there will be no further loans even so the mexican debt does not compare for example with us debt which is 104 percent of gdp nor countries such as germany with 70 percent of gdp italy with 135 percent or china with over 200 percent as we have said on other occasions debt is one of the mechanisms that the bourgeoisie uses to drain the wealth of workers without creating a penny of value setting limits is a good thing as is avoiding a deficit and rejecting the idea that state expenditures can be reduced without implying a reduction in social spending however even with these measures the real power structures in mexico have not changed investment and development lópez obrador is right when he says that neoliberalism results in corruption but this is not the essence of it if we look at the economic structure of the country in 1982 and compare it with that of 2018 we find the basis of this economic model and understand how to break it in mexico the total investment in 1981 was around 30 percent of gdp almost 11 percent of it was public cuamatzin 2006 for 2017 it was 22 percent of which 19 percent was private and 3 percent government in other words neoliberalism has meant a relative reduction of 8 percent of gdp of public investment without the private capitalists investing more in fact the opposite is true the bourgeoisie was not able to develop the economy and the state almost collapsed until this situation is reversed we will have a government that criticises neoliberalism while actually administering it the only way to start combating this would be expropriating the rich and putting the biggest companies banks and financial organisations under the democratic control of the workers some will say that the capitalists are allied internationally and we would no longer receive any loans we say that in fact we could ignore the government debt declare it illegitimate in short not pay it then we would have resources for development and neoliberalism would end surely workers in the states given their own situation would sympathise with ignoring the national debt some would say that refusing to pay would require a revolution in the united states we say well yes that s the idea the fourth transformation must know no boundaries pension schemes in practically all sectors of the economy similar conditions are evident the last 30 years of counter reforms have generated a scheme of capitalist reproduction that feeds itself at the cost of the misery of the masses it must be destroyed or else the government will end up as an agent of this scheme let s take an example pensions were privatised between 1997 imss social security and 2007 issste social security and services for state workers this means that pensions are not guaranteed on retiring workers will receive what they manage to save pension fund managers meanwhile embezzle the money and earn commissions whether the funds go up or down barefaced robbery the proposal by the amlo administration is not to renationalise pensions but to expand their investment faculties while leaving them privately owned in the long run this will become a source of social conflicts of monstrous proportions at the moment these problems have not risen to the surface given that it will be until the middle of the next decade when workers retire to realise they have nothing at this point it is not enough fight corruption we must renationalise the funds and build a state administration as a source of productive investment with guaranteed pensions this is how to genuinely overthrow neoliberalism not one step backwards amlo emphasises that it is important to arrive at social harmony as a mechanism for the fourth transformation to be consolidated we consider social harmony to be an end not a means when exploitation and violence ends then there will be room for harmony meanwhile you cannot appeal to the patience of the people the most positive thing about the current situation is that it creates space to free up the class struggle against the exploiting classes the first 100 days of the amlo government have shown that the real conflicts are only just emerging image fair use morena amlo s party is not an organ of social control like the pri was it has neither the mechanisms nor the strength to subdue a single directive of the trade union peasant or even youth movement this is an opportunity that must be taken advantage of in order not to place limits on the struggles throughout mexican society the main enemies are the bourgeoisie and imperialism as long as the masses take the initiative it will be possible to advance the demands of the people and these first 100 days of the amlo government have shown that the real conflicts are only just emerging
6 second take the marijuana industry is expected to grow in value over the next few years and promises high returns since the emergence of the marijuana marketplace in 2014 the number of dispensaries and growing facilities has skyrocketed the industry recently surpassed a market value of 10 billion dollars worldwide with the value expected to reach 146 4 billion by the end of 2025 according to a new report by grand view research in places like colorado where dispensary chains such as native roots green solution and livwell are setting up shop at multiple locations throughout the state it s increasingly evident that the cannabis business will continue to climb higher and higher currently 10 states and washington d c have legalized recreational marijuana use for adults according to the national conference of state legislatures ncsl in 2018 21 states considered bills that would also legalize it and many more states have mixed laws surrounding its use and distribution despite the continuing nationwide debate regarding the legality of its recreational usage investors and financiers are vying to get in on the ground floor of the marijuana marketplace and given it may not be long until it s legal at a federal level it s an investment certainly worth considering learn how to invest confidently download this free app what the marijuana marketplace looks like now you can currently buy marijuana stocks in a number of companies such as aurora cannabis canopy growth corporation and cronos group many of these companies are based in canada where legalization in 2018 paved the way for a marketplace far less regulated than that of its southern neighbor there are a few companies such as gw pharmaceuticals and innovative industrial properties whose diversified business dealings operate at the intersection of marijuana and pharmaceuticals gw or marijuana and property iip both are listed on the new york stock exchange besides stock ownership much of the marijuana marketplace investment within the united states occurs in the form of commodity purchases a commodity is a raw or agricultural product that can be traded such as coffee or oil says luca de la torre general partner at contender venture capital as such marijuana commodities are sold much like one would sell other agricultural products such as corn or wheat cannabis as a commodity the marijuana marketplace also facilitates transactions involving cannabis oils waxes and baked goods containing marijuana this is much the same as how orange juice crude oil beans sugar and other commodities have been traded at the chicago mercantile exchange since 1898 however unlike most commodities that are traded on an exchange marijuana does not have a futures instrument attached to it because it remains classified as a schedule 1 drug build your personalized portfolio in minutes start investing we produce a cash price or real live transactions says steve janjic ceo of amercanex based in denver colorado it s what we call spot daily transactions which happen in the moment not in the future over the past several years most commodities have dramatically underperformed in the stock market but when there is a turnaround in commodity prices there will be potential to earn good returns as a result commodities could be an interesting way to look for an alternative to just putting every dollar in equities according to steve cucchiaro chief investment officer of 3edge asset management in boston right now we have a synchronized global economy where no individual major economy is in recession cucchiaro says this could be good news for the demand for commodities the big risk however is that if there should be a sudden interruption in the global economy the demand for commodities would fall investing in commodities while economists are not predicting a global recession in the near future commodities including legal marijuana can still be a risky investment that being said there are ways of mitigating your risk one way to invest in commodities is to buy the shares of commodity producers cucchiaro says but if the stock market falls sharply then commodity producers share prices might fall along with the stock market rather than rise with the commodities market while commodities are known for being risky the good thing about that volatility is that it performs differently than stocks and bonds says morgan ranstrom cfa cfp and co founder of trailhead planners in minneapolis minnesota that s because prices of commodities are often negatively correlated with prices of stocks and bonds when the annual inflation rate in an economy is expected to rise a higher inflation rate pushes up commodity prices but brings down prices of equities and bonds this app makes managing your finances easy start budgeting today so use commodities for diversification purposes only and not for outperforming the stock market ranstrom adds most financial advisers recommend investing in an exchange traded fund etf that tracks a broadly based commodity index for its diversified investments cannabis etfs like etfmg alternative harvest and advisorshares vice are both exchange traded funds with a focus on legal marijuana these etfs protect against the risk of buying cannabis commodities from a singular dispensary or cultivator additional reporting by juliette fairley

the original access to the region s core arc project started with a semblance of consensus but ended its 15 year life in controversy its replacement gateway was proposed in february 2011 and has been surrounded by controversy for the entire eight years of its life so far the politicians and planners who are pushing the program consider it inevitable just as they considered the now defunct arc project inevitable almost until the day it was killed in 2010 some local advocates still view gateway as controversial even overpriced and they say it contains undesirable features one thing almost everyone knows about gateway is that it is expensive far more expensive than the former arc project which was canceled in large measure because it would have cost too much in this article we will examine the gateway program and its components the cost of building them what transit riders can expect if the project is built and prospects for obtaining the necessary funding gateway was unveiled at a press conference given by sen frank lautenberg d n j and amtrak president joseph boardman both of whom are deceased at the hilton gateway hotel across the street from penn station newark the event took place feb 7 2011 four months to the day after new jersey gov chris christie a republican killed the arc project officially not counting efforts by transportation secretary ray lahood and fta administrator peter rogoff to offer more favorable loan terms as an incentive to convince christie to change his mind and move forward with the project nobody from the christie administration or from new jersey transit njt participated in the gateway kickoff event gateway is not a single project but a number of projects aggregated into a program therefore the organization formed to promote it is the gateway program development corp a new jersey corporation with politically appointed members representing new jersey new york and amtrak as well as the u s department of transportation usdot originally it was incorporated in november 2016 through the efforts of the port authority of new york and new jersey the gateway board did not meet until jan 12 2017 and the representative appointed by the usdot left when that agency ceased its participation june 29 2017 this is understandable since the other gateway member agencies are asking usdot agencies for funds jeff davis of the eno center for transportation reported on www enotrans org this withdrawal puts official as well as symbolic distance between usdot and the gateway corporation a hybrid new york new jersey amtrak usdot entity established last year to develop a 24 billion plus of rail projects in new york and new jersey there are nine projects that comprise the gateway program and we will concentrate on three of the most controversial and most expensive ones later in this series those are the hudson tunnel project replacements for portal bridge and the proposed penn south station for njt the westernmost component would include platform and pedestrian circulation improvements at penn station newark moving east from newark toward new york the next project is addition of a fourth track at harrison n j sawtooth bridge which carries nec tracks over njt morris essex lines tracks to hoboken just before swift interlocking also known as the kearny connection which connects the two lines would be replaced and the line would be expanded from the current two tracks to four the portion of the railroad going east the high line would be rebuilt and expanded to four tracks the current portal bridge over the hackensack river would be replaced with two new bridges a two track high level fixed bridge designed portal north and allocated to resiliency and another two track fixed bridge designated portal south and allocated to additional capacity secaucus junction station would be expanded with additional tracks on the outside of the existing station boundaries and a loop track known as the bergen loop would be added so trains from njt s main bergen and pascack valley lines could go directly into new york city currently these trains terminate at hoboken the hudson tunnel project designated for resiliency would build two new tunnels under the river after those tunnels are completed the existing tunnels would be repaired resulting in four tunnels and four tracks the changes at penn station are designated for increased capacity there would be expansion into penn south a proposed station under 30th street for most njt trains and an optional project for future expansion of new tracks eastward under seventh avenue planning would also continue for a facility for the proposed high speed rail line that amtrak hopes to build in the future some advocates have questioned the need for a four track main line all the way from newark to new york njt midtown direct trains to new york penn station on the morris essex montclair and gladstone lines do not enter amtrak s northeast corridor nec until swift interlocking just west of the existing portal bridge therefore it is unclear that additional capacity is required on the high line west of swift especially since there are no stops between newark and secaucus the purported need for separate and new tracks at secaucus junction has been questioned and the bergen loop which would connect the lower level and the upper level at the station itself has drawn fire as unnecessary secaucus junction currently serves as a transfer point the upper level is on the nec and goes to penn station new york while the lower level is on the line to hoboken historically part of the erie railroad rockland county n y representatives have claimed that they need the loop to give them easy access to new york while other advocates question whether the short trains on those lines should be given valuable peak hour slots at penn station when riders can get there now by transferring at secaucus advocates have also questioned the cost effectiveness and even the basic utility of two portal bridges as proposed building two new tunnels before repairing the existing ones and adding the proposed penn south station funding for the gateway program is a major issue and some advocates do not see how there could be enough money available from all sources to build all of gateway as currently planned when the program was unveiled in 2011 the projected cost was 14 5 billion the high end of estimates for the arc project but including replacements for portal bridge it was expected at the time that all of it would be completed in 14 years by 2015 new york gov andrew cuomo and christie told the obama administration that the projected cost for the hudson tunnel project was 20 billion and requested that the federal government pay 50 on june 30 2017 jeff davis of the eno transportation center reported that the projected cost had risen to more than 24 billion and provided a project by project breakdown he said that phase i portal north bridge the new trans hudson tunnel rehabbing the existing tunnel and sawtooth bridge replacement would cost 10 7 billion phase 2 moynihan penn station including the penn south annex portal south bridge secaucus south annex bergen loop construction and the newark secaucus embankment would cost 11 2 billion this adds up to 21 9 billion plus 10 overage contingency for a total cost estimate of 24 1 billion one month later the cost of new tunnels and repair of the existing tunnels without any other elements of the program had risen to 12 9 billion according to the executive summary at s 10 of the draft environmental impact statement deis for the hudson tunnel project davis s own report on july 7 estimated the cost of the entire gateway program at 29 4 billion which includes phase 1 at 15 6 billion phase 2 at 11 2 billion and 2 6 billion previous estimates pegged the cost for the tunnel portions of the program at 7 10 billion but recent estimates remain in the 30 billion range a number that appears far beyond what could be found from any combination of known funding sources it s unclear where that money could come from the capital budgets at njt and the new york metropolitan transportation authority mta are not taking on the cost of the gateway projects the port authority has committed 2 75 billion but only for debt service that amount is the cap for their contribution and their commitment document states that they will take no further financial responsibility for the project local members of congress and other politicians are campaigning hard for additional funding for the various gateway projects but even with grants in the hundreds of millions of dollars the funding available so far comprises only a fraction of the full cost so where will the rest of the money come from no more than half of it will come from the usdot in a letter to the gateway trustees sent june 29 2018 acting fta administrator k jane williams said that the total federal contribution to any project which includes all grants and loans cannot exceed 50 of the entire cost and cannot count as part of the local share this means that the local share must comprise a majority of the overall cost that could include money from either or both of the states concerned the port authority or anybody else it cannot include usdot sources though and that includes the proceeds from loans as well as grants there may be an exception to that rule in the new statute enacted at the end of january to break the impasse that cause the recent federal shutdown loans from federal sources that will be paid back from local sources may count as local funding even if the railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing rrif loans that would be used for the hudson tunnel project were legally permissible there may still not be enough local money available to get approval from the fta in a competitive process that rates each project on its own merits gateway proponents claim that the obama administration had promised to pay half the cost of the complete program but it does not appear that there was any such promise that can be legally enforced nobody has yet been able to produce a written understanding to that effect and even gateway s strongest proponents claim that the alleged obama era deal was on a handshake there is an old saying in contract law a verbal contract is not worth the paper upon which it s not written even with its questionable grammar that maxim makes sense government grantors like the fta dole out their contributions on the basis of a record of decision rod followed by a full funding grant agreement ffga that sets out the conditions that apply to the grant and makes it clear to the recipient that local funding sources will need to pay the entire amounts of any cost overruns it is well known that president trump is not transit friendly and that he is feuding with senate minority leader charles schumer d n y while politics always rears its head in funding decisions especially about controversial projects the fta has a good reason for limiting the federal share of the pot many other transit systems are looking for grants too gateway would take up 62 of the past five years average funding for new starts grants nationally 1 63 billion in 2020 67 in 2021 and 58 in 2022 according to new york transit advocate joseph m clift s analysis of the project s proposed draw down of its 6 8 billion grant if gateway were to get so much there would be little left for los angeles san francisco seattle denver chicago new orleans and a number of other cities even if the democrats should sweep the elections in november 2020 and win the authority to appropriate transportation grants there would still not be enough money available to give every city that is also a democratic stronghold every dollar it wants for its own transit system clift told this writer about a more realistic proposal that he had studied he ran the financial numbers with the assumption that the gateway program would receive 25 of the entire draw for new starts grants rather the 58 to 67 that project sponsors propose still far more than any other project has ever received under that analysis the midpoint of grant funding would not occur until 2028 rather than 2022 as gateway proponents currently propose and grant funding would be complete in 2035 not 2030 according to clift extending the grant funding period for those extra years would add 1 0 to 1 5 billion to the financing costs which are already projected to be about 2 5 billion in the official gateway projection this would require project sponsors to find an additional 2 8 to 3 1 billion in construction financing to build the project on its currently proposed schedule davis mentioned another unpleasant political reality in his nov 26 2018 issue of eno transportation week the fact that there is more than 600 million in core capacity money just sitting around is a historical aberration and can be solely attributed to rep rodney frelinghuysen r n j the outgoing chairman of the house appropriations committee trying to stockpile money that will eventually be spent on the portal north bridge replacement part of the mammoth gateway program of passenger rail upgrades in new york and new jersey portal north which should be the next core capacity project in line to get a grant agreement wants an eventual federal cig capital investment grant share of 772 million for the project this amount has risen to 811 million frelinghyuysen is gone the last member of a political dynasty that stretched back more than 200 years he retired rather than face the impending sweep of new jersey s congressional delegation by democrats including in his district davis went on to say the new starts pipeline represents about 15 years worth of average annual appropriations and questioned the legality of promising funding so far into the future under the anti deficiency act 31 u s c 1341 which has prohibited promising money beyond existing appropriations since the 1870s and calls for criminal penalties if cig full funding grant agreements actually made legally binding promises of future federal funding the fta employee who signed the agreement could go to jail davis said even without these criminal penalties the federal government cannot be held to funds committed too far into the future as davis noted if congress decides to stop funding ffgas halfway through construction the local transit agency has no legal recourse the grant agreements clearly spell that out in legalese nevertheless the transit agency would be in a world of financial pain were such a thing to happen agencies are allowed to spend their own money in advance in anticipation of eventual federal reimbursement and the political consequences of such a thing happening have always been enough for congress to keep annual funding for the installments of signed ffgas more or less on schedule to make matters worse for gateway the trump administration considers it a local project not one of national importance in a report from march 11 by mark niquette for bloomberg news entitled trump s budget lacks money for critical nyc area gateway work deputy transportation secretary jeffrey rosen was quoted as saying that the 2020 budget does not earmark any money for gateway those transit projects are local responsibilities and elected officials from new york and new jersey are the ones accountable for them those are projects that those communities themselves have thus far chosen not to fund to make matters even worse the fta released ratings march 15 for infrastructure projects throughout the u s those ratings determine what funding sources are available to any given project the agency rated the hudson tunnel project medium low which gives the project the same rating the fta gave it months ago fta guidelines mandate that projects with a medium low rating are ineligible for capital investment grants gateway proponents and the federal government both have colorable arguments the tunnels between new york and new jersey have implications for interstate commerce which is a federal responsibility under the commerce clause of the u s constitution the tunnels carry amtrak riders from new york and points north like boston and new haven to other points south of new jersey among them philadelphia baltimore and washington d c some trains that use the tunnels go to places as far away as miami chicago and new orleans on the other hand the vast majority of passengers who go through the existing tunnels and new ones if they are built ride on njt trains to or from local destinations in new jersey in fall 2017 88 of rail riders who crossed under the hudson river did so it on njt trains even more 95 during peak commuting hours which is the only time that additional capacity into new york city is needed according to the bloomberg report rosen also raised the issue of the projects potential ineligibility for federal grants there is no reason for the federal government to have those projects jump the line and receive massive federal subsidies for projects that presently are ineligible and lack realistic plans and commitments he said probably referring to the current plan that would have a majority of funding come from federal sources a violation of fta policy in response to our inquiries to amtrak and the gateway program development corp amtrak spokesperson craig schulz spoke for both and told railway age on march 25 the current financial plan for both portal bridge and the hudson tunnel project calls for less than 50 federal funding commitments 49 4 portal north bridge 44 hudson tunnel he did not address penn south or any other gateway program components saying any cost estimates for the rest of the projects that comprise the gateway program are conceptual only schulz denied that there has been any cost increase adding the two projects that have full non conceptual cost estimates have not changed portal north bridge and the hudson tunnel projects are estimate to cost 1 6 billion and 12 7 billion respectively 11 1 for the new tunnel 1 6 for rehab of existing nrt north river tunnels schulz also provided a breakdown of the steps gateway plans to take to raise the needed funds stating detailed financial plans have been submitted to the fta for consideration portal north bridge project includes up to 600 million from the state of new jersey through nj economic development agency bonds more than 5 5 billion has been committed by the states of ny and nj and the port authority for the hudson tunnel project amtrak has built the first two sections of a concrete casing on the west side of manhattan using 235 million in sandy relief funds contributed 35 million toward preliminary engineering of the hudson tunnel project and is funding the nepa work led by njt on behalf of the gateway partners amtrak is also committed to funding the intercity share of the portal north bridge and hudson tunnel projects the balance is from federal grants and appropriations it appears that what schulz described depends on the feds for more than they would be willing to contribute while he did not specifically address any aspects of gateway besides portal north the hudson tunnel project and a concrete casing there are other aspects to the overall project that we will address in future articles in this series schulz mentioned roughly 6 4 billion of the entire project which is far broader in scope than only the portal north and hudson tunnel projects this is only slightly more than 20 of the long running estimate of 30 billion for the entire cost of the combined projects and even a smaller percentage of the latest estimate of 33 billion according a march 18 star ledger editorial so for the advocates the watchword is affordability and the mandate is to eliminate waste in an effort to bring the cost down to a sufficiently low level that local and federal funds can contribute enough to build the projects that are actually necessary we will explore that effort later in this series in theory at least amtrak and gateway agree schultz also told railway age there is no cost increase the two projects that have full non conceptual cost estimates have not changed while that may be true in the short term these are long term projects variations on projects that were originally proposed in the mid 1990s costs increase over time and the original access to the region s core arc project was canceled in 2010 primarily because it had become too expensive gateway proponents have left financing costs in their estimates as any project is built in the future the bills will be paid in year of expenditure yoe dollars which are future dollars for calculating costs dollars to be paid in the future have a lower value than today s dollars so costs will inevitably rise that is one reason why cost estimates for the entire gateway program have increased over the years schulz said the costs will only increase with delay and advocates agree schulz said that gateway managers are taking steps to reduce costs we continue to pursue the best value for money procurement strategy to contain and reduce costs for example working closely with the private sector on where to conduct borings to get the best possible information for the hudson tunnel project and using the on time on budget early work on portal north to reduce our contingency costs for the project in the latest financial plan submitted to the federal government these are the sort of best practices that usually make sense how much money they can actually save as a percentage of the overall cost of the entire set of gateway projects remains to be seen there is also inherent risk in pursuing early work on portal north there was similar early work on arc which was later canceled a rare event in the history of federal transit grants new jersey was required to give some of the money advanced on the project back to federal authorities and eventually there was a settlement if gateway projects are similarly not built the feds could demand their money back a similar scenario is now being played out over the california high speed rail project the about section of the gateway website www gatewayprogram org proclaims the gateway program is the most urgent infrastructure program in america not everybody shares that view because it appears highly unlikely that any combination of funding sources will contribute enough money to build all of it president trump a republican announced in his budget proposal on march 12 2019 that there would be no money earmarked for gateway elected leaders in new york and new jersey almost all democrats have denounced trump s budget generally and specifically about gateway but congress always has its say about the federal budget the same day officials from gateway amtrak nj transit the port authority and other local representatives met with the four u s senators from new jersey and new york to campaign for funds for the entire gateway program despite their efforts the estimated 30 billion to 33 billion cost of the entire gateway program still appears out of reach and about half of that would be used to build the hudson tunnel project as a comparison with europe it was reported on march 12 that 15 billion euros have been secured for a rail tunnel under the baltic sea between tallinn the capital of estonia and helsinki the capital of finland one euro is worth 1 13 u s so the current funding level for the tunnel is 16 95 billion u s or 56 5 of the current estimated cost for the entire gateway program the cities are 51 air miles apart the rail tunnel should be slightly longer the gateway hudson tunnels would be significantly shorter 13 500 feet or 2 6 miles long so the baltic sea tunnel would cost slightly more than half the estimated cost of the gateway tunnels for a tunnel about 20 times as long schulz said that gateway development corp is becoming a bi state commission so it can receive accept federal state and local grants and build out staff and budget he did not say that the restructured gdc would own enough assets to manage the project repay rrif or any other loans and pay any deficiencies if there should be any cost overruns if gdc does not have enough money on its own account for these purposes someone else would need to guarantee funding or the fta s failing grades from this year will not improve in other words they would not be able to jam on that rrif in the meantime the hudson tunnel project is being examined closely the momentum for the project at its original scope may be dissipating with potential success of the method for repairing the canarsie tunnels on the l train line of the new york city subway system a counter momentum in favor of this less invasive fix is growing april 2019 may be remembered as the month when the tide began to turn some new york officials are asking is it really necessary to build two new tunnels before repairing the existing ones especially when money is so scarce gateway officials are resisting change but they are also beginning to ask questions we will look at the hudson tunnel project including its history and its cost in the next article in this series david peter alan is chair of the lackawanna

dubai the slump in aramco bonds since its unprecedented debt sale this month makes one thing clear you can t take the saudi out of saudi aramco demand was so great with bids topping us 100 billion that the energy giant managed to raise us 12 billion at lower yields than the kingdom itself which is uncommon in corporate bond markets investors are now paying the price for that discrepancy all five maturities have fallen since trading started last week in some cases by more than two us cents on the dollar we view the company as more of a saudi risk rather than just an energy company said patrick wacker a fund manager at singapore based uob asset management ltd who dumped his holdings on the first day of trading to profit from the initial euphoria he predicts the debt will keep falling until it trades at a yield premium to the saudi government if he s right there s still a ways to go before the aramco bond selloff is over the company s us 3 billion of notes due in 2029 yielded 3 78 per cent on wednesday less than the 3 91 per cent on similar maturity saudi government debt sold in january given the order size at the sale many investors expected that the world s biggest oil producer known officially as saudi arabian oil co would get away with lower yields than the government and instead be compared with global peers such as london based bp plc whose notes due in 2028 yielded 3 51 per cent on wednesday that s not an unreasonable assumption with us 111 1 billion of net income in 2018 aramco ranks as the most profitable company in the world even moody s investors service said this month that it s a contender for its top aaa rating yet close interlinkages with the sovereign prompted it to grade aramco in line with the saudi government which is ranked four steps lower at a1 if it weren t for its postcode it would most likely have come even tighter anders faergemann a fund manager in london at pinebridge investments which oversees about us 90 billion and owns aramco bonds said of the pricing aramco is a bit of special case as it stirred interest from all types of investors not just your usual emerging market investors saudi jewel aramco is integral to the economy of saudi arabia which has been ramping up debt sales in recent years as falling oil prices left it with budget deficits the oil industry accounted for more than 60 per cent of the kingdom s revenue in 2017 and about half of aramco s board is comprised of government officials the money raised is also being used to finance saudi arabia s economic agenda after the state postponed until at least 2021 plans to sell a stake in aramco in an initial public offering some investors who spoke to bloomberg said a number of bondholders trimmed their positions because they had inflated the size of their initial orders to ensure they d get a slice of the offering others sold because their allocations were too small to make a difference to their portfolios they said the 2029 notes were trading at 97 67 us cents on the dollar on wednesday compared with an issue price of 99 516 we did not participate in the new deal as they priced inside the sovereign said wouter van overfelt a zurich based senior money manager at vontobel asset management while there may be good reasons for this to be the case we would generally prefer the sovereign in such cases still investors such as pinebridge in london and tcw group inc in los angeles say they are staying put expecting volatility will eventually ease the bonds were particularly vulnerable to the recent selloff in us treasuries but the long term fundamentals of the company make it worth the risk they say aramco s new bonds seem to be a victim of the roadshow s success said brett rowley tcw s managing director for emerging markets our view on aramco s debt remains constructive it s a world class oil producer which trades wide to international peers even so mr wacker at uob asset management which oversees about us 24 billion said the price drop could leave a bitter taste with investors given all the initial hype this may not have been the best way to start a capital markets relationship with bond investors he said bloomberg
kimberly clausing s central argument is that rather than blaming foreigners for the ills of society policymakers should tackle the root causes of stagnant wages and economic inequality open the progressive case for free trade immigration and global capital author kimberly clausing isbn 13 978 0674919334 publisher harvard university press guideline price 20 95 for all the often justified criticism it attracts globalisation has undeniably lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty over the last four decades international trade and investment have been central to the rise of china and many more emerging economies immigration meanwhile has allowed tens of millions more to escape oppression or abject poverty among advanced economies ireland has been unarguably one of the big winners at the same time globalisation has been blamed for premature deindustrialisation rising inequality stagnant wages financial crises and at least in part the emergence of populist politics at both ends of the political spectrum a cottage industry of worthy tomes has emerged to explain this phenomenon epitomized by brexit and the election of president donald j trump such a political backlash has yet to land on irish shores but as one of the most open economies in the world we stand in the cross hairs aimed squarely at self declared progressives in the us kimberly clausing s new book is an apparent attempt to influence debate within that country s democratic party as it selects its standard bearer to take on trump in the 2020 presidential election while acknowledging the need to improve trade investment and immigration policies and to introduce a range of other policies to mitigate any negative impact of globalisation she warns against the temptations of rejecting economic openness trade vs technology the author highlights the growing consensus among economists that technological advances have had a greater negative impact than trade on lower skill jobs and income inequality robots rather than imports this is not to say that trade has no negative effects on individuals or communities merely that societies as a whole are better off generating enough resources so that those who lose out can be compensated and every individual thereby be better off the author goes further however in implying that societies would be better off even if this compensation didn t take place and it doesn t or at least not fully read more clausing is an acknowledged expert on multinational corporations and their taxation it is on this theme that her analysis is deepest her critiques most cutting and her policy proposals most developed chiming with the recently published european parliament report which called out ireland as a tax haven the author uses similar language and dedicates a segment to the european commission ruling that apple should pay the irish government 13 billion in back taxes her proposals for unilateral and fundamental reforms to the us corporate tax regime would no doubt reduce the incentive for us firms to shift their profits overseas meaning less corporate tax revenue for ireland it is on immigration that clausing is most effusive while international trade and investment create winners and losers the author sees little evidence that immigration creates clear losers even studies showing a harmful impact on low skilled workers or secondary school dropouts are contested while the benefits to the high skilled and to immigrants themselves are beyond doubt cultural concerns are brushed aside blaming foreigners the central argument of open is that rather than pandering to populist impulses by blaming foreigners for the ills of society and shooting ourselves in the foot in the process policymakers should instead directly tackle the root causes of stagnant wages and economic inequality rather than being as bold as the author seems to think her proposed policy responses are a bare minimum that progressives should view as necessary for a more equitable globalisation better education investment in infrastructure community centric adjustment funds a more progressive tax system funding for scientific research and using competition policy to address concentrations of market power she leaves unexamined however truly bold policy ideas like universal basic income she laments the reduced bargaining power of workers and their trade unions but pays only lip service to redressing the balance clausing s writing is fluid engaging and accessible to the non specialist as such it is a worthy contribution in her eagerness to persuade however the author has a tendency to verge into hyperbole which could come across as tone deaf to the very people she is trying to convince at times she risks excessive reductionism as when calling on readers to

source xinhua 2019 04 20 17 30 26 editor zh video player close by bai xu zhou zihan pan xiangyue adelaide australia april 20 xinhua if he could travel back in time yuan shichao would go back to 2011 to thank himself for his crazy decision at that time he was applying for the wine business major in the university of adelaide in south australia not accepted he went directly to knock at the dean s door i struggled to use all the english words i knew about wine the 30 year old man recalled the dean was i think more surprised than persuaded but he agreed to let me have a try he said it was the start of yuan s story of wine now he is marketing officer with nova vita a wine group in adelaide hills of south australia in the past years he saw a boost of wine trade between china and australia according to wine australia australian wine producers exported 2 82 billion australian dollars worth of product to the world about 2 billion u s dollars last year of which 40 percent was sold to china an increase of 18 percent from the previous year no longer luxury wine which appeared more on the screen than on dinner tables in china s ordinary families three decades ago was once seen as an icon of petty bourgeois after china s reform and opening up people s living standard is improved and the population of middle class is on the rise with the increase of international exchanges wine became an ordinary drink with everyday dishes in many families yuan visited his father s friend in 2010 in adelaide i was attracted by the vineyard he said after graduation he found a job in nova vita when the wine company was about the march into chinese market in australia the demand of wine was not as high as the supply therefore more than half of the products would be exported as a chinese i joined the company at the right time he said nova vita was founded in 1999 now the company boasts more than 66 hectares of vineyard and could produce two million bottles of wine in the recent years our sales growth rate was about 80 percent yuan said during my first visit most of the inquiries are about entry level wine what i call everyday drinking wine about 3 australian dollars a bottle mark kozned managing director of nova vita said now most of the inquiries about wine are mid level something you can have at home with dinner or with good friends or for premium wine which people tend to use for gift giving especially around mid autumn festival or the chinese new year kozned said chinese bond growing kozned has visited china for more than 25 times since 2012 with the most recent visit the china international import expo ciie last year ciie last year was a fantastic event it was well put on both by the chinese government and the organizer he told xinhua i was impressed that the chinese business people from around china that visited really wanted to do some business he added our achievement from the ciie was that we gained three to four potential clients and during the event we actually signed contracts we discussed with three other parties post ciie to send the wine in the next three to four months he said since participation of the ciie nova vita has received orders for more than a dozen containers of wines to china according to the australian trade and investment commission china is the world s third largest market for imported wine behind the united states and germany the china australia free trade agreement further reduced the tariff of australian wine to china to zero it made australian wine in chinese market more and more competitive we are closing on france as the no 1 wine supplier in volume into the chinese market kozned said australia has also attached great importance to chinese market last year wine australia promoted australian wine in china with more than 100 companies involved australia wine reached not only metropolis like beijing and shanghai but also smaller cities currently nova vita has two branches in china in east china s zhejiang province and southwest china s chongqing municipality yuan whose hometown is in zhejiang spends several months each year in china doing business more chinese people joined in australian wine companies yuan said i graduated in 2013 when i was the only one of more than 10 chinese students to land a full time job now that the chinese students majoring in wine business haven t graduated yet but most of them have received job offers he said more than just a job the bond between china and australia wine is so close that chinese people are not satisfied with just becoming employees in wine companies guo song arrived in australia in 2007 two years later he bought the jarressa estate with friends in retrospect he said that in the past three years sales of wine in chinese market grows at a rate of about 50 percent in 2018 jarressa sold more than 10 million bottles of which 96 percent were sold to china he also said that china is also affecting the wine industry in australia chinese people prefer red wine to the white and the preference affected grape planting here he said with china s development and further opening up guo saw the wine industry as very promising whereas kozned believed that the wine like an important bridge between china and australia he has decided to attend the second ciie this year we will spend more time in preparation and put on better presentation he said the second time you will always do things better he added australia is to have the federal election in may however kozned said that no matter who wins and however the international trade environment changes the wine trade between china and australia will continue to boom we are like two brothers china and australia he said

it goes without saying how important it is to start saving at an early age it makes retirement planning so much easy however most of us donâ t get that wisdom in our 20s or even in 30s so many folks donâ t think or plan for retirement savings until they are well into their 40s but it s okay since you could still achieve your goals though the path will be a bit harder and may require more sacrifices for the purpose of this article letâ s assume a hypothetical couple john and lisa both are 50 years old right now they have saved about 200 000 in retirement savings in addition to some equity in the house it is not bad at all however in a short 12 years from now they will be 62 they may or may not retire at 62 but they would still like to make plans on what if they were to retire at 62 due to some forced situation they would like to accumulate retirement assets worth 1 million or more by the time they are 62 why retire at 62 frankly it s just a number besides so many people continue to work beyond 62 years of age however it s significant in many ways at 62 you become eligible to draw on your social security benefits even though your benefits are 25 lower than if you were to wait until the full retirement age between 66 and 67 moreover once you are 59 and a half you could withdraw money from your retirement saving vehicles like iras and 401ks without any penalty however please note that one does not qualify for medicare until the age of 65 so for many it may not be an option to retire prior to 65 just to have the medical benefits if one does decide to retire at 62 he she would have to buy their own medical insurance for the intervening period from 62 to 65 there may be other good reasons to plan for an early retirement even if you decide not to when the time comes many folks face situations like retrenchments or forced early retirements and they find it difficult to find suitable employment it may even be a voluntary retirement offer from your employer that s too good to pass up so it s just a matter of good planning to prepare for any eventuality is 1 million good enough to retire in the 1990s and until the early 2000s there used to be a consensus among financial planners that 1 million were sufficient to have a very comfortable retirement however not everyone agrees with this milestone anymore obviously 1 million is not the same as it used to be 20 years ago in spite of low inflation numbers during the last 20 years 1 million in the year 2000 would be the same as 1 45 million in 2019 due to inflation sure there would be folks who would argue that 1 million would not be enough to retire on in 2030 so without a doubt they would be better off to save more and keep some margin of error while setting their goals that said a one million dollar mark may not guarantee a very rich retirement but with some prudent strategic planning 1 million worth of savings can go a long way to fund a comfortable retirement for a couple provided we believe that the other pillars of retirement security like social security and medicare will remain intact on the other side of the fence there s an argument to be made that it s too high a target for so many folks who may have done everything right but invariably run into the tough times due to corporate layoffs constant shifts in the job market and age discrimination in later years of life this is why it s so important to have an emergency reserve of one year worth of living expenses start saving early is critical but itâ s not the endgame still we believe the most important factor that determines how rich you are going to be later in life has to do with how soon you are willing to start saving and paying yourself first in other words start saving for retirement the table below shows how early savings can impact the quality of life in later years steve starts contributing 6 000 a year 500 a month at age 30 and increases it by 3 every year until 62 however mark waits for another 10 years but starts saving the same amount as steve at age 40 assuming they both get 8 return annually steve would end up almost double what mark would accumulate to match steve mark will have to contribute double the annual amount starting from age 40 to 62 this is how their savings at age 62 stack up assuming 8 annualized return steve contributes 500 a month starting age 30 increase by 3 every year mark contributes the same amount as steve starting age 40 mark contributes double 2x the amount as steve starting age 40 at age 30 0 0 0 at age 40 122 782 0 0 at age 50 411 289 154 181 308 361 at age 62 1 299 000 632 121 1 264 000 click to enlarge you are 50 and have saved 200 000 according to the economic policy institute the national average of retirement savings for 45 49 year olds is 81 000 and 124 000 for 50 54 year olds so 50 being right in the middle would be about 100 000 considering that for a couple it should be twice that figure letâ s assume that you have saved 200 000 obviously it is an average and it is not enough if you are already 50 you need to realize you cannot delay the retirement planning any further sure you may have other pressing needs such as saving and paying for kidâ s college tuition fees if you can manage both good for you but saving for college tuition should not be at the cost of retirement savings if needed there are other ways to meet these needs like tuition loans at least partially also kids can work part time to fund their own education to some extent at this stage retirement savings have to become priority no 1 letâ s bring in our hypothetical couple john and lisa like in the past we will use our hypothetical couple john and lisa to help with the illustration this is where john and lisa stand today both of them are 50 years old their combined annual salary is modest at 130 000 they have 200 000 in their retirement accounts john and lisa want to be at least prepared to retire at 62 so they only have about 12 years left until retirement sure they can work longer but that may not always be their choice to be able to retire in 12 years john and lisa realize they will have to make some sacrifices in their current lifestyle to be able to have a comfortable retirement later john and lisa decide to save 16 of their salary toward their 401ks these savings will be tax deferred and reduce their tax liabilities until now they were saving only 6 of their incomes they are fortunate to get a good match from their employers for their 401k savings on average it works out to be 80 of their first 6 of the contributions they have had no iras until now they will put away 10 000 5 000 each toward iras since they qualify for tax deductible iras they will use this option instead of roth iras this will also help bring down their taxes they will also open a college education fund for their kid and deposit 5 000 every year however this will be after tax but the qualified tuition withdrawals including the growth will be tax free their target is to reach 1 million in retirement savings excluding the primary home with the above decisions and after accounting for the tax savings due to pre tax contributions their take home monthly income will reduce by about 1 550 even though they will be saving an extra 1 920 every month where to find an extra 1 550 a month there are several ways that they can cut down their monthly budget to save this extra 1 600 they are going to look at several options and choose the ones that are appropriate for them some of the options that they are going to look for are they could cut their spending budget drastically from every expense item and save 1 600 a month though doable it may seem difficult to achieve at first glance alternatively sell the current house and move to a smaller but newer house this will save quite a bit of money and reduce the need to cut down on other expense items sure there s a third way though there is no guarantee of achieving it they may look for new opportunities at work with added responsibilities and increase their earning power any success here will reduce their need to cut down the expenses with 130 000 combined income their current take home income is roughly as follows gross income 130 000 minus ss medicare 9 945 minus federal taxes 8 000 assuming there are no state taxes 401k deductions 6 7 800 minus other deductions 4 800 net take home income 99 455 net monthly take home income 8 287 this is a rough estimate for this couple based on income and two dependents but it could vary a great deal based on the individual situation first method based on their monthly take home income they work out the new household budget to make for additional savings of 1550 a month budget item before after new savings house mortgage 1150 1150 0 property taxes ins hoa 850 850 0 house maint 250 150 100 house upgrades 400 100 300 car payments gas maint 1200 800 400 groceries food 1500 1200 300 college fund 400 600 200 kids misc expenses 1000

their house is worth about 350 000 thanks to rising home prices in recent years however they still have a mortgage balance of 150 000 after mortgage payout and commissions they can get about 190 000 net if they move a little further out in the suburbs and buy a much smaller but a newer house they could get one for 250 000 if all that works out they can take only about 100 000 new mortgage on a 15 year term put 150 000 cash down on the house put 25 000 away as an emergency fund and still will be left with 15 000 they could use this 15 000 toward paying off one of the cars their monthly mortgage would be about 760 after adding property taxes insurance hoa etc their monthly expense would be approximately 1 400 to 1 450 they save about 600 a month in house payments plus they will immediately save 400 in car payments also the house is new and smaller so they would save about 150 a month in utilities they would still need to cut down their other budget items and save an additional 500 without much sacrifice with the budgeted savings of about 1 550 they can fund the college savings as well as fund the 16 pre tax contributions to 401k and 5 000 each to the iras retirement planning part ii investing successfully the first very important part of retirement planning is to save enough and save early and regularly it s best achieved when it s done on autopilot being on autopilot means your investment account always gets paid first before you get money into your checking account to spend on things that are essential and non essentials the second part of retirement planning is how well you invest the money saved this is equally important because after all you cannot get rich by just sitting on cash you have to protect your cash from inflation you also need to compound it over time growth and compounding will do wonders to your investment capital over time john and lisa decide to take charge of their investments and implement the following strategy lisaâ s 401k lisaâ s company provides a set of funds that she can choose from lisa decides the following combination of funds once this has been set up rest would really be on autopilot every paycheck her contributions will be invested in the proportions as selected by her since this portfolio is very balanced she hopes to get growth of about 8 annual for the next 12 years 20 in s p 500 fund 20 in the equal weighted s p 500 fund 20 in the developed international fund 5 in emerging markets fund 20 in bonds 10 in treasury funds johnâ s 401k john decides to deploy a risk adjusted strategy to ensure that he gets most of the gains of the market but at the same time he will hedge the risks in case of this bull market turns into a bear market this strategy is discussed in the later section iras since both john and lisa will be funding their iras every year to the extent of 5 000 each they will self manage these funds lisa is a fan of dgi dividend growth investing stocks and decides to implement a dgi portfolio described below investment portfolios lisaâ s dgi portfolio for the iras this is the portfolio that lisa will be building for johnâ s and her ira she decides to build a portfolio of about 20 30 blue chip stocks which in theory she could hold for the next 10 20 years obviously things will change over time and occasionally she may have to make changes all the stocks will generally meet the following conditions however exceptions can be made sometimes market cap 20 billion the company is either a dividend champion or a contender that means the company has paid and increased dividends for at least 10 years and never cut the dividend the yield at the time of buying is preferably 2 but some exceptions will be made based on dividend growth the average yield of the portfolio should be above 3 50 of the positions must have had a high dividend growth in the last five and 10 years the â averageâ price of the portfolio is at least 10 below the 52 week high keeping the above rules in mind she shortlists the following 25 stocks to start with the average dividend yield is roughly 4 the past five year dividend growth is 12 and as a group these stocks are trading roughly 12 below

model john and lisa exceeded their targets by about 30 even if they were to get slightly lower returns they would still hit their target some may question the constant rate of return in the above portfolios we agree it s almost guaranteed that some years they would have negative returns but then have high returns in some other years so we do expect them to balance out please note that john and lisa are not only diversifying in various stocks but also in the form of three very different strategies we particularly feel confident about the long term performance of the dgi portfolio and the rotational portfolio using spy vti tlt there s no doubt about the importance of a high rate of savings besides it s important to save early another message is the importance of the growth of investments growth is directly proportional to the time these investments have out of the final accumulated total 1 3 million their own contributions were just about 50 at 644 000 besides 664 000 from

chinese president xi jinping seems to be on a roll he has sent a rocket to the dark side of the moon built artificial islands on contested reefs in the south china sea and recently enticed italy to break ranks with its european partners and sign on to china s belt and road initiative meanwhile us president donald trump s unilateralist posture has reduced america s soft power and influence china s economic performance over the past four decades has been truly impressive it is now the main trading partner for more than a hundred countries compared to about half that number for the united states its economic growth has slowed but its official 6 annual rate is more than twice the american rate conventional wisdom projects that china s economy will surpass that of the us in size in the coming decade perhaps but it is also possible that xi has feet of clay no one knows what china s future holds and there is a long history of faulty predictions of systemic collapse or stagnation while i don t think either is likely the conventional wisdom exaggerates china s strengths westerners see the divisions and polarization in their democracies but china s successful efforts to conceal its problems cannot make them go away sinologists who know much more than i do describe at least five major long term problems confronting china first there is the country s unfavorable demographic profile china s labor force peaked in 2015 and it has passed the point of easy gains from urbanization the population is aging and china will face major rising health costs for which it is poorly prepared this will impose a significant burden on the economy and exacerbate growing inequality second china needs to change its economic model in 1978 deng xiaoping wisely switched china from maoist autarky to the east asian export led growth model successfully pioneered by japan and taiwan today however china has outgrown the model and the tolerance of foreign governments that made it possible for example us trade representative robert lighthizer is focusing on the lack of reciprocity subsidies to state owned enterprises soes and coerced intellectual property transfer that have allowed china to tilt the playing field in its favor europeans are also complaining about these issues moreover china s intellectual property policies and rule of law deficiencies are discouraging foreign investment and costing it the international political support such investment often brings and china s high rates of government investment and subsidies to soes disguise inefficiency in the allocation of capital third while china for more than three decades picked the low hanging fruit of relatively easy reforms the changes it needs now are much more difficult to introduce an independent judiciary rationalization of soes and liberalization or elimination of the hukou system of residential registration which limits mobility and fuels inequality moreover deng s political reforms to separate the party and the state have been reversed by xi that brings us to the fourth problem ironically china has become a victim of its success the leninist model imposed by mao in 1949 fit well with chinese imperial tradition but rapid economic development has changed china and its political needs china has become an urban middle class society but its ruling elites remain trapped in circular political reasoning they believe that only the communist party can save china and thus that any reforms must strengthen the party s monopoly on power but this is exactly what china does not need deep structural reforms that can move china away from reliance on high levels of government investment and soes are opposed by party elites who derive tremendous wealth from the existing system xi s anti corruption campaign can t overcome this resistance instead it is merely discouraging initiative on a recent visit to beijing a chinese economist told me that xi s campaign cost china 1 of gdp per year a chinese businessman told me real growth was less than half the official figure perhaps this can be countered by the private sector s dynamism but even there fear of losing of control is increasing the party s role finally there is china s soft power deficit xi has proclaimed a chinese dream of a return to global greatness as economic growth slows and social problems increase the party s legitimacy will increasingly rest on such nationalist appeals over the past decade china has spent billions of dollars to increase its attractiveness to other countries but international public opinion polls show that china has not gained a good return on its investment repressing troublesome ethnic minorities jailing human rights lawyers creating a surveillance state and alienating creative members of civil society such as the renowned artist ai weiwei undercut china s attraction in europe australia and the us such policies may not hurt china s reputation in some authoritarian states but modern authoritarianism is not ideologically based the way communism was decades ago young revolutionaries around the world were inspired by mao s teachings today although xi jinping thought on socialism with chinese characteristics has been enshrined in the party constitution few young people in other countries are carrying that banner china is a country with great strengths but also important weaknesses american strategy should avoid exaggerating either china will increase in importance and the us china relationship will be a cooperative rivalry we must not forget either part of that description no country including china is likely to surpass the us in overall power in the next decade or two but the us will have to learn to share power as china and others gain strength by maintaining its international alliances and domestic institutions america will have a comparative advantage joseph s nye jr is a professor at harvard university and author of is the american century

it s the world s biggest election and truly an event like no other the marathon vote in india more than 900 million people are eligible to vote more than 8 000 candidates are vying for a seat in the lower house and polling lasts for nearly six weeks or 39 days to be exact so needless to say an election in the second most populous country on earth is complicated and elaborate india has four times as many registered voters than the united states and it has higher voter turnout than the u s that s because the country s committed to polling every one of their voters and when i say committed i mean they re required by law to do it election rules say that there has to be a polling station within two kilometers of every dwelling that s true for the more than 20 million people that live in mumbai and for the sole human living in gir forest national park in gujarat who gets his own polling booth so in practice that s one million polling stations and 12 million polling officials these election workers go to all edges of the country literally 700 special trains will be deployed this year as well as boats planes elephants and teams of camels i did say elaborate didn t i key to this entire exercise is this contraption india has been using secure electronic voting machines for two decades each machine has three parts first there s the control unit that counts and stores the votes and there s the balloting units where voters pick their candidates by pressing a button the third piece is a secure printer that deposits a hard copy of each ballot into a sealed box and it s just that simple the electronic voting process has made it dramatically easier for indians to cast votes but it s also part of the reason why the process takes so long there are just 1 6 million control units but more than 900 million eligible voters that s roughly one unit for every 552 voters so what s at stake voters are choosing who will fill 543 seats in parliament s lower house the lok sabha the golden number is 272 seats that s how much a party or coalition needs to pick the next prime minister then in five years people start this process all over again
the rejection then retreat technique is not as complicated as first thought sure everyone conjures up images of a stereotypical deal maker making outrageous demands this is not wrong but the center of the power here is found in the concession you want the other party to feel like they are exercising control over the terms of the deal and that your good will backing down is a gift of sorts because gifts are powerful the initial position however does not need to be an outrageous one in a corporate setting for a teen is more likely to get 20 from their parents if they ask for 50 first and a parent is more likely to get their children to clean their rooms if they ask them to mow the lawn too the technique is a simple one that we can call the rejection then retreat technique suppose you want me to agree to a certain request one way to increase your chances would be first to make a larger request of me one that i will most likely turn down then after i have refused you would make the smaller request that you were really interested in all along provided that you have structured your requests skillfully i should view your second request as a concession to me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own the only one i would have immediately open to me compliance with your second request robert cialdini influence

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox many politicians on the left including beto o rourke have stated that they support reparations for african americans i would like to know how they would determine who is a descendent of slavery is a person s color going to be the determinant or does a person have to have documentation in order to be paid what about the irish italians polish and others forced to america as indentured servants i would like to know since my ancestors were forced to work in coal mines live in company houses and buy at company stores and received little or no pay for most of their lives they were de facto slaves to a coal company how will the leftists and democratic party justify reparations for blacks and not the rest of us with ancestors who were used as slaves my ancestors worked their way out of the situation they were in it is time the black community realizes the democrats are trying to use them in order to take over the government this is 2019 not 1819 slavery has been abolished for almost 200 years you have never been anyone s slave do not let anyone tell you otherwise you can go as far as your talent can take you the only person who can stop you is you john t watson north huntingdon climate activism not just for democrats regarding the article gore us getting close to political shift on climate change climate activism is not just for democrats however it has been associated with them the article implies that conservatives and moderates being pushed toward action are outsiders to climate change coming late to the party the liberals are in charge of my own work with conservatives concerned with climate change refutes this impression there is indeed legislation so partisan as the green new deal that troubles the more economically conservative but there is also bipartisan even free market legislation aimed at combatting climate change the energy innovation and carbon dividend act sets a fee for carbon emissions and that money instead of going to the government will go straight into the pockets of american citizens making up for whatever cost increases come from the fee with climate change such a polarizing an issue bipartisan efforts are given little attention so conservatives start to think they have no place in climate activism look into it and contact your members of congress so we can show that climate activism is for everybody kevin marston monroeville the writer is a member of the university of pittsburgh s chapter of citizen s climate lobby gov tom wolf s tax plan will hurt consumers gov tom wolf must enjoy groundhog day as his latest plan restore pennsylvania is simply the same attempt to tax and borrow on the backs of citizens like groundhog day wolf s plan is the same every year the only difference is that every year he masks his attempt to tax the natural gas industry with some new slick rhetoric the restore pennsylvania plan is simply the governor s way of achieving a campaign promise to tax an industry that has delivered affordable prices for consumers saved taxpayers money and provided economic growth for pennsylvania additionally the natural gas industry has paid nearly 1 5 billion in taxes already as pennsylvania continues to make good use of our natural resources for both economic and security gains the future of the industry may be impacted by yet another attempt by wolf to accomplish a severance tax five years ago he told us this tax would raise over 1 billion in pennsylvania the math simply did not support that rhetoric five years ago and today the governor s message that a tax can restore pennsylvania must also be rejected this tax will only hurt consumers and reverse pennsylvania s economic growth randi fowler bick upper st clair leaving the liberals i recommend that anyone who is a member of a minority homosexual black hispanic women et al

on in our country the influential radical left of the democratic party is aggressively promoting economic socialism as economist thomas sowell said socialism sounds great but simply has never worked socialist policies promise free college medical care housing and support so they attract poorly informed naive voters sounds great but the history of socialism tells us that soon taxes go up prices go up inflation skyrockets supplies run short theft increases unemployment goes up people start demonstrating and destroying property crime goes up and people actually start leaving their country as now is happening in venezuela years ago my grandparents left poland to come to the united states in search of work opportunity and freedom they told me socialism was ruining their country it was so bad that they continually had to send american dollars to support their families in europe young activists from kind hearts and limited life experiences favor big government programs and handouts people who have experienced life under both socialism and capitalism have lived the dangers of socialism and the successes of capitalism capitalism causes all economic boats to rise and creates more jobs that help the poor much more than government handouts ever could that s why sowell said socialism never works ron raymond buffalo township do democrats care about lower middle classes now that they

with big cuts to social security medicare and medicaid but they go on and on about how much we need to care about illegal immigrants and pay reparations because slavery existed in the 1800s democrats used to care about the economic and financial struggles of the lower and middle classes now you barely hear a sound from them about the problems faced by those who worked hard for their entire lives and tried to do the right things in life and now can t afford to pay for the prescription medications and health care they need the national democrats seem to care more about getting the votes of all minorities and the future votes of illegal immigrants than they care about the rest of us they figure we have no one else who we can vote for so all they have to do is pay a little lip service to our struggles while they pander to and kiss the hind ends of minorities and illegal immigrants stewart b epstein rochester n y the writer is a former squirrel hill resident who taught at west virginia and slippery rock universities reasons to legalize marijuana it s hard to resist commenting on c a ray s letter why legalize pot ray remarks that marijuana is much worse than tobacco but offers nothing to support that i believe no one has ever died from smoking pot cigarettes he asks the governor for a reason he is considering legalizing pot ok here are some reasons how many dollars do we spend locking up harmless people i wonder if ray would change his tune if it were his children going to jail because marijuana is illegal it can be dangerously contaminated it can also be a gateway drug because it is illegal the pusher says he s out of pot but has this other stuff instead the better question for me would be why is alcohol legal that is not victimless ever hear of someone coming home from a bar and beating up his wife alcohol encourages violent behavior conversely pot relaxes the spirit remember make love not war laws against drugs have been a dismal failure people will smoke pot regardless as it is the pushers are getting the profits and we waste money locking up harmless people wouldn t it be better if these citizens would be free and productive and the state get the profits mr ray please live and let live you probably do some things i wouldn t like but this is supposedly a free country maybe if you tried it you might even see why it appeals to others al duerig salem

the u s healthcare system is completely and utterly broken according to the world health organization who the u s system ranks 37th in the world all while spending dramatically more on healthcare than other wealthy countries tens of millions remain without any health insurance coverage for many medical bills can mean economic ruin some surveys show that up to 66 5 of all bankruptcies in the u s are a result of medical expenses on the front lines of this system are nurses and physicians individuals who by and large decided to go into the profession to help patients and communities are becoming more frustrated by their inability to do just that sometimes even causing providers to leave the profession while many inside the u s medical industrial complex have had enough nurses throughout new york city nyc are putting their collective foot down and showing us the way to fight for better outcomes for patients and better working conditions for providers in march members of the new york state nurses association nysna at new york s big four hospitals montefiore mount sinai new york presbyterian columbia and mount sinai west st luke s voted by an overwhelming 97 margin to authorize a strike the nurses fight centers around conditions for patient care including safer staffing ratios inside hospitals so that nurses can adequately care for each patient throughout nyc nurses are forced to work long shifts and are chronically understaffed the nurses who recently threatened to strike recognize that these working conditions are part of hospital executives push to squeeze greater and greater profits out of workers at the expense of patient health and they have had enough new york nurses are fighting just as teachers across the country did earlier this year including the tens of thousands of los angeles teachers who struck last january for better conditions for in schools they are discussing the strike option just as more than 31 000 stop shop workers in new england are striking against cuts to healthcare benefits and pensions and the camba legal services workers voted to walk off the job if their demands are not met the nurses are also taking up the example of healthcare workers around the world including the 40 000 irish nurses who recently struck nurses are recognizing they have the power to fight and win better patient care but while nurses across new york are standing up for themselves and their patients a big question remains where are the doctors and why are they not threatening to strike together with nurses why are the physicians on the sidelines physicians see first hand every day how our dysfunctional healthcare system is simply not built to adequately address patient and community health for many doctors these frustrations manifest in burnout and dissatisfaction within a field they once loved today there is an epidemic of burnout among physicians with some studies suggesting burnout affects up to half of all physicians after training for years with the desire to help others doctors come to experience medical system that values profit over all else and rarely gives them the tools to make a difference in the communities where they work this can leave doctors feeling hopeless and combined with other factors can lead to depression or even suicide today physicians are committing suicide at two times the rate of the population as a whole yet even at this moment of frustration and anger they continue to keep their heads down providing validity to this broken system we see nowhere among doctors a resistance like that now being organized by nurses in order to analyze why doctors are not throwing down their stethoscopes and finally saying enough is enough a review of the u s medical education process is in order as longtime public educator john taylor gatto highlights in his book the underground history of american education the education system is built to create tools for industry gatto points out that this system conditions those who pass through it to take direction well and to not question authority at the same time education aim to instill the importance of profit and continually reinforces the legitimacy of the capitalist system health care education is not excluded from this the fact that the medical industrial complex serves suffering human beings gives the system the guise of morally superiority but both patient and community health remains secondary to profit maximization nonetheless psychological conditioning data has shown that physicians typically come from the upper classes in the us it is not hard to see why medical school exams and applications alone can cost thousands of dollars and this doesn t even account for the cost of exam preparation courses or materials overall the admissions system selects for a particular type of upper middle class to bourgeois candidate some reports show the median family income for a matriculating medical student is around 100 000 per year at a time when close to half the american people do not earn enough afford an unexpected 400 expense the cost of becoming a physician is prohibitive for the vast majority students with families that can bear such costs tend to come from environments that have conditioned them from a young age to respect systems of authority and not question their legitimacy after all if the parents have benefited economically from doing so why would their children act any differently this rule is then reinforced throughout the experiences of undergraduate school medical school as i have written about in the past and residency education the young medical student or resident learns that getting close to and appealing to authority figures leads to better outcomes whether that means higher test scores letters of recommendation or better employment opportunities this makes the physician less and less likely to challenge much less disrupt the medical system he will soon be working within within the hospital doctors typically adopt an individualist mentality in which they consider only how they can personally make an impact on their patients health while ignoring the need for systemic change the direct work with individual patients can be personally rewarding but this method of practice does little to impact the larger factors that lead a patient to become sick in the the first place a physician sees a patient in a clinical setting and treats him without ever actually discussing or addressing the social conditions which have caused his illness they then send the patient directly back into the environment that is harming him this method of practice ultimately helps to uphold the exact structures making patients ill but no physician could accept this fact so instead they tell themselves they are doing important work and making a positive impact over time operating within the system of factory line health delivery the norm in the u s teaches the physician that change occurs on an individual basis if a physician ever thinks of organizing collectively to withhold her labor in order to demand better conditions for her patients employers declare that doctors are abandoning those in need of care the hippocratic oath taken by physicians to do no harm is cited this argument obviously disregards the fact that it is the employer and ownership class which is directly harming patients every day in pursuit of profit denying care pushing individuals into bankruptcy pursuing unnecessary treatments neglecting systemic causes of illness etc it also ignores the fact that by continuing to focus the treatment on narrow individualistic explanations for disease and illness the physician helps to redirect the patient s attention away from the larger issues that are truly causing his or her suffering it is clear why few physicians would think about striking after being psychologically conditioned in this way many simply believe the work they are doing is adequate and having a meaningful impact on patient and community health although many may work under a boss doctors also often have more autonomy over their work than those in other professions their distinct petty bourgeois positions which allows them the possibility of being their own employers reinforces their individualist conservative mentality though it is important to note physician control is ever decreasing as healthcare becomes more corporatized the individualist mindset created through medical and residency education is completely antithetical to the consciousness necessary to take action against an employer whether protesting organizing work slow downs or using the most powerful weapon the strike those who organize collectively to strike such as the new york nurses believe that change comes from masses of individuals standing together against the status quo this runs counter to the ideology continually drilled into the physician subtle psychological methods of coercion keep physicians in line and unknowingly supporting their own oppression and the continual harm of their patients this is combined with strong material conditions of coercion which we will discussed in the next section the material conditions of doctors physicians experience the truly sickening state of the u s medical system day after day they see first hand how the profits of health insurance companies hospitals pharmaceutical companies device manufacturers and other health care corporations are placed above patient health for those who truly wish to help the patients they work with this can be extremely frustrating and could even push the physician to want to resist these oppressive systems even after undergoing the multiple levels of psychological conditioning this is where material conditions of the physician comes into play to ensure doctors stay in line in general american physicians are more economically well off than the majority of the population the exorbitantly high pay that physicians find themselves earning after residency serves to support the status quo for the healthcare industry physicians become comfortable with their lifestyle and their positions of power in hospitals they begin to develop a stake in maintaining the system though the physician may see various ways the medical industrial complex damages patients he will be reluctant to put his comfortable position at risk by questioning the current state of affairs it is much easier for a physician to accept the lifestyle this system provides her than to accept she is being used as a cog inside of the medical industrial machine where the health of patients is only a secondary concern even before graduating from residency training the material conditioning of the physician begins becoming a physician is expensive physicians typically undergo a 4 year university education in addition to their four years of medical school this can easily leave a new physician entering residency a 3 to 8 year period of training after medical school with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt this debt which is part of the over 1 5 trillion of overall student loan debt in the us puts the physician in a precarious position in the workplace at the beginning of her career indebtedness makes the resident physician less likely to do anything to jeopardize her standing during residency where she is often used as cheap labor for hospitals and clinics since it could affect job opportunities later in her career the enormous debt facing a resident a term coined from the days when they would literally live or reside in the hospital then forces him to work exorbitant hours for little pay his workweek can extend to upwards of 80 hours when a residents pay is broken down to an hourly wage he often finds himself making just over 10 hour it is now a fad for hospitals to pretend to care about physician wellness one group tasked to structure residency programs the accreditation council for graduate medical education acgme has attempted to improve resident wellness by putting work limits in place for residents these have been set at 80 hours per week averaged over four consecutive weeks meaning that a resident could potentially work as many as 100 hours in a given week in this scenario overwork and exhaustion make physician organizing and resistance even less likely we must organize physicians are key actors in the medical industrial complex today they serve as conduits for profit extraction from sick and injured people until physicians begin to put individual endeavors aside and begin to organize collectively they will continue to see their patients harmed by the healthcare system how can physicians advance their collective organization they can start by pushing for unionization in all healthcare settings even if that means going against anti union contracts that hospitals and clinics often require doctors to sign change in this system will not come from hospital administrations device manufacturers health insurance companies or medical academies like as the american medical association ama all of these groups benefit from the existing system focused on endless profit maximization change will only come through collective action and resistance by healthcare workers physicians around the world have organized and withheld their labor for better conditions around patient care in the past in a system that continues to directly harm patients strikes or various other forms of work stoppages or slowdowns are an ethical imperative whether it is teachers in virginia or nurses in new york withholding one s labor and threatening profit production is by far the greatest tool any worker has against an employer these efforts by teachers have improved educational environments for children in schools in hospitals strikes have the potential to provide better staffing ratios and ultimately better care for patients the nurses who give their time and efforts to organize even while risking their own jobs are showing what it means to truly care for patient and community health physicians have much to learn from the nurses example before you

recent news about an increase in indian corporates and state entities issuing dollar bonds is welcome news especially since it clearly shows investor appetite for lending to credible indian business models however relatively easy liquidity and high investor appetite for lending in the international markets must be tempered by the fact that borrowing in foreign currencies is beneficial for businesses with certain specific balance sheet structures while relatively low interest rates abroad and increasing investor demand for relatively good quality debt assist in borrowing for indian businesses it is essential to realise that severe foreign exchange rate fluctuations can severely impact the debt servicing capacity of a company that relies excessively on foreign borrowings for businesses that have assets creating dollar cash flows borrowing in the currency makes sense for instance for an exporter of products or services to the united states with a dollar based stream of income financing greenback liabilities is more feasible while macro factors are beyond the control of a business understanding and creating a well balanced balance sheet is something that deserves attention not only is it essential for a balance between assets that can generate cash flows to match liability outflows in the case of multiple currencies it is vital that currency mismatches are avoided as far as possible for businesses looking to take on foreign currency denominated debt it is essential that there is a long term focus on how foreign exchange volatility will be dealt with for firms that do not have dollar based assets that generate foreign currency denominated cash flows prudence is advised on foreign currency borrowings while the appreciation of the indian rupee can lead to windfall gains by way of lower interest and principal payments a severe depreciation of the currency a factor beyond the control of a business can leave the company in a precarious position with debt servicing most importantly the company might be in the sectors of financial services energy or it services and therefore being exposed to the macro vagaries of the foreign exchange market for business success is not an ideal situation to be in the experiences of european and japanese financial institutions during the 2008 financial crisis are a good reminder of the perils of creating excessive dollar denominated liabilities while owning assets primarily in domestic currencies balance sheet imbalances and a shortage of dollar funding precipitated a crisis that severely damaged the financial systems and institutions in europe and japan one major takeaway from the 2008 crisis was that creating an imbalanced balance sheet renders the business exposed to risks managing which is inherently not the core objective of the company for instance an energy developer facing severe pressure to fund dollar liabilities isn t ideal the funding pressure may lead to a situation in which despite having a robust energy business the energy developer might be severely loss making due to a significant change in the cost of foreign liabilities that need to be paid off the decision of how much of liabilities must be in a foreign currency is no less important than the choice of how much debt a business must utilise while the decision around leverage is driven by the quality of cash flows that a company has to finance the future liability payments i e interest payments the decision around the currency to be utilised must also be factored in separately effectively the risk a business undertakes in using foreign currency debt must factor in the volatility in the currency pair that is applicable in terms of the cash flows and liability payments for instance if a business receives all incoming cash flows in indian rupees then the amount of dollar denominated debt ideal for the company needs to be carefully evaluated in a world with relatively low yields especially in the developed economies and a growing economy such as india the interest to lend to indian businesses by global investors is inevitable for any business the focus must be on creating a long term track record of utilising foreign currency denominated debt effectively to either take advantage of relatively low interest rates or potentially finance international growth however prudent usage of foreign debt by indian business is also vital to ensure that investor confidence builds up for both individual companies and indian firms in general judicious usage of foreign currency debt is critical for the long term goal of increased access to global capital markets for indian companies as with financial structures and balance sheet decisions there is no one size fits all solution for foreign currency borrowings a sustainable long term focused borrowing strategy will be the key differentiator for successful businesses
washington the u s trade deficit fell for the second straight month in february and the politically sensitive deficit in the trade of goods with china narrowed the commerce department said wednesday that the gap between the goods and services that the united states sells and what it buys from the rest of the world dropped 3 4 to 49 4 billion in february the lowest since june the deficit had slid 14 6 in january exports climbed 1 1 to 209 7 billion on a surge in shipments of civilian aircraft passenger cars and medicine imports rose 0 2 to 259 1 billion the goods deficit with china dropped 28 2 to 24 8 billion exports to china rose 18 2 to 8 4 billion while imports from china fell 20 2 to 33 2 billion president donald trump has imposed tariffs on 250 billion in chinese imports in a fight over u s allegations that china steals u s technology and forces foreign firms to turn over trade secrets in exchange for access to the chinese market china has retaliated by targeting 110 billion worth of american products trump campaigned on a pledge to reduce america s longstanding trade deficit with the rest of the world he sees the gap as a sign of economic weakness and as the result of bad trade deals and abusive practices by america s trading partners in addition to targeting chinese products trump has slapped tariffs on imported steel aluminum dishwashers and solar panels and he is threatening to tax imported cars too in fact the threat of u s auto tariffs and retaliatory tariffs by u s trading partners may have boosted american auto exports and improved the trade balance in february automakers may have been trying to rush u s made units to their destinations just in case the trump administration imposed tariffs on imported vehicles and set off a tit for tat motor vehicle trade war stephen stanley chief economist at amherst pierpont securities said in a research note a narrowing trade deficit adds to america s gross domestic product the broadest measure of economic output so after the trade numbers came out economists were upgrading the outlook for u s economic growth stanley said he was likely to push his forecast for the first quarter above an annual rate of 2 up from the 1 7 he d penciled in before commerce released the trade numbers mainstream economists view trade deficits as the result of an economic reality unlikely to yield to changes in trade policy americans buy more than they produce and imports fill the gap the strong u s economy also encourages americans to buy more foreign products u s exports are also hurt by the american dollar s role as the world s currency the dollar is usually in high demand because it is used in so many global transactions that means the dollar is persistently strong raising prices of u s products and putting american companies at a disadvantage in foreign markets the u s has been much more competitive in the trade of services such as banking and education than in the trade of goods such as appliances and clothing in february u s services exports hit a record 70 1 billion producing a services surplus of 22 6 billion but america ran 72 billion deficit in goods
some economists have described the deal as an acquisition of trophy assets seeing qatar s latest transactions as an effort to park its money in the west this comes amid the heightened volatility in global stocks while concerns of a slowdown in the global economy renders bonds and reserve currencies less of the safe haven assets they have traditionally been for us based vornado the deal appears to be an opportunity to raise cash while maintaining controlling stakes in all the properties involved in the transaction they vornado have over time offloaded various segments of the company it s their latest attempt to demonstrate the actual market value of their assets in an effort to close the gap between where the stock market is valuing those assets versus the private market jeffrey langbaum of bloomberg intelligence said the deal is structured to include 950 million in mortgage debt 1 83 billion in preferred equity held by vornado and 2 78 billion in common equity 51 percent of which is also held by vornado some say the transaction looks more like a qatari bailout of a struggling new york landlord read more qatari energy minister says many opec members regret doha exiting organization vornado will also continue to serve as the general manager of all said properties however the 1 2 billion in additional revenues which are expected to boost the company s 2q19 profit to 2 6 billion could diminish its say on what ultimately will happen to the properties the company also enjoyed a boost to its stock value which rose to 67 01 per share thursday but is still far below its all time high of roughly 93 posted in january 2015 our stock price for the last five years has been disappointing and in my mind disconnected from the value of our assets vornado chief executive steven roth said something is obviously wrong in light of this the qatari investment has helped to greatly improve vornado s positions on the market boosting its influence among other new york landlords in the commercial real estate segment for its part qatar which managed some 300 billion is assets across the globe added another piece of prime location real estate to its collection which it hopes will generate greater revenues over time qia said it will continue to focus on classic investment in europe and north america which they say includes properties and financial institutions such as banks qatar is also expected to boost investment in western technology and health care two highly profitable industries due to the ongoing rise in tech company throughput costs as well as the skyrocketing costs of medical services qatari officials believe such investments could bring larger and quicker profits as opposed to the low yielding government bonds and increasingly fragile stocks
for far too long wall street has wreaked havoc on people s personal financial stability and our economy as a whole i should know as a managing director at goldman sachs in the early 2000s i witnessed firsthand how the banking industry lined their pockets at the expense of customers not much has changed since then after the mortgage fraud crisis of 2007 08 the biggest banks were slapped with 216 billion in fines a drop in the bucket for firms that raked in a cool 237 billion last year alone infamously not a single banker went to jail today wall street banks continue to commit fraud enjoy front row lobbying seats in washington write legislation on their own behalf and maintain easy access to credit courtesy of the federal reserve the dodd frank act of 2010 placed some regulations on banks riskier bets but crucially that reform failed to divide banks into two entities one dealing with people s fdic insured deposits and the other able to create complex securities and engage in derivatives trading using our deposits as collateral ten years after the financial crisis our money is still very much at risk of being gambled away this isn t just about protecting individuals personal nest eggs state and city governments deposit their funds in these banks too this means that our own tax dollars are underwriting wall street s most reckless investments from the oil companies warming our climate to the private prisons jailing our kids to the gun manufacturers who have turned our schools into free fire zones this is why it is more important than ever to create public banks tasked with using state and local funds for public good not private profit and my home state of california is leading the way a new bill ab 857 backed by the california public banking alliance would give cities the freedom to start public banks accountable to the communities they serve based on north dakota s successful model now celebrating its 100th year these banks would reinvest public funds in their communities by offering low interest business and student loans investing in clean energy and supporting local infrastructure projects these socially responsible investments draw a sharp contrast with wall street s anything goes ethos these mega firms are not legally required to invest in local infrastructure provide reasonable loans or look out for the environment so they don t despite having received billions in federal aid the biggest banks have focused more on paying out ceo bonuses than supporting the customers and taxpayers who keep them in business more often than not they invest in projects that put us squarely in harm s way like the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines the wall street model privatizes profit while socializing harm from oil spills to mass shootings public banks would allow cities to professionally manage their money without sacrificing their values this is particularly true for californians who have experienced and will sadly likely continue to experience record wildfires and mudslides as a result of wall street financed climate change here on the front lines of the climate crisis it is crucial to have public banks that can divert funds to rebuilding homes and businesses and helping residents get back on their feet rather than relying on disaster relief funds from the trump administration or multinational banks that may not be forthcoming reconstruction would also be cheaper as it stands half of the total cost of some infrastructure projects goes toward paying wall street banks high interest rates and loan fees beyond disaster response states across our nation are sorely in need of better roads ports bridges and railways more affordable higher education and fully funded public schools public banks would lend financial support to these and other pro social endeavors providing community control over where and how these funds are allocated just as importantly they will challenge wall street to curb industry abuses right now the city of san jose is poised to waive its own policy against doing business with wage theft violators so it can contract with jpmorgan chase bank which had to pay 160 million in fines to settle 22 such cases of withholding appropriate wages from low level employees public banks would allow cities to professionally manage their money without sacrificing their values at its best california has been defined by its creativity progressive thought and entrepreneurial ingenuity joining north dakota in the public banking arena would be a testament to the historical strength and spirit of california and a vital economic blueprint for the rest of the nation before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of publishing truthout has been a stalwart independent

on april 10th china s premier li keqiang celebrated the completion of the 1st phase of the 2 5 kilometer chinese built pelgesac bridge in croatia across the bay of mali ston alongside croatian prime minister andrej plenkovic this ceremony marked a striking victory as the following day ushered in an important 16 1 heads of state summit that saw greece inducted as the newest member of a new alliance of central and eastern european nations who wish to cooperate with china at this summit held on april 12 greece s prime minister alexis tsipras stated that this was a very crucial moment for global and regional developments and we have to leave behind the crisis and find new models of regional and global cooperation of course greece s involvement in this alliance now renamed the 17 1 ceec has broadened its geographical boundaries to the west and is especially important as greece s port of piraeus is a strategic east west trade gate way for the belt and road initiative bri into europe centered on the china europe land sea express route greece is painfully aware that its survival depends upon china s bri as the eu programs for austerity privatization and bailouts have brought only death and despair with a collapse of youth employment crime rate spikes and suicide it is also not lost on anyone that this breakthrough follows hot on the heels of italy s joining of the belt and road initiative on march 26 and also serves as a precursor to the second belt and road summit which will take place in beijing at the end of april involving over 126 nations who have already signed mous with the bri and thousands of international businesses ten additional bri connected agreements were signed between croatia and china before the 17 1 summit including the modernizing of rail lines especially from zagreb to the adriatic port of rijeka telecommunications cooperation between huawei and croatian telecom and major port roads harbors education and cultural cooperation the belt and road initiative as tsipras aptly pointed out is not just another set of infrastructure programs designed to counterbalance western hegemony but is rather a new model of regional and global cooperation founded upon a principle of mutual development and long term thinking not seen in the west since the death of franklin roosevelt and the takeover of the anglo american deep state that ensued the fact that china formalized an economic and trade cooperation agreement with the russian led eurasian economic union in may 2018 is extremely relevant as it incorporated its five nation membership of russia belarus kazakhstan armenia and kyrgyzstan directly into the bri already china has invested 98 billion into the real economies of the eeu involving 168 bri connected projects the new model of development which has increasingly won over central and eastern eurasian countries as well as greece and italy have provided a breath of fresh air for citizens everywhere who are looking with despair upon a trans atlantic system which can do nothing but demand obedience to a defunct set of rules that commands only austerity hyperinflationary banking practices and no long term investment into the real economy thus the technocratic mobilization against the bri over the past days in response to this new paradigm can only be seen as an absurd attempt to save a system which has already failed the technocrats defend their new world disorder two recent counter operations against the bri and the new win win operating system it represents are worth mentioning the first is found in the formation of a trilateral alliance between the american based overseas private investment corporation opic canada s finance and development agency findev canada and fifteen members of the european union announced on april 11 a second counter operation was created several days earlier with the canada germany france japan alliance for multilateralism during the g7 meeting in france opic acting president and ceo david bohigian center signed a memorandum of understanding with findev canada managing director paul lamontagne right and edfi chairman nanno kleiterp left while opic was founded in 1971 its use as a subversive force against the bri was formalized on july 30 2018 when it created a trilateral alliance with japan and australia in order to finance infrastructure in the pacific basin added to this a second trilateral alliance was created on april 11 2019 when canada s paul lamontagne head of findev canada the european development finance institution s nanno kleiterp and opic president david bohigian signed a new agreement to create a parallel infrastructure financing mechanism taking aim at china the press release stated that the alliance will enhance transactional operational and policy related cooperation among participants and underscores their commitment to providing a robust alternative to unsustainable state led models at this signing bohigian stated we re trying to hold up an example for the world of the way development finance should work clearly attacking china s incompetent concept of development finance and thus ignoring the fact that over 800 million people have directly been lifted out of poverty by china s approach to investment bohigian was clearly hoping that the world would ignore the vast debt slavery and chaos spread by 50 years of imf world bank dominance that has produced no real growth of nations although the american build act has increased us government funding to opic from 29 billion to 60 billion over one year no serious integrated design for development has been presented and instead provides fodder for laughter at best the other anti bri operation mentioned is the german french japanese canadian alliance for multilateralism which saw canada s foreign minister chrystia freeland stating at a press conference in france that canada has formally joined a german french coalition armed at saving the international world order from destruction by various world dictators and autocrats while freeland didn t mention trump by name here france s ambassador to canada kareen rispal was more candid stating mr trump doesn t like to value multilateralism citing his withdrawal from cop21 and criticism of the wto un and nato the envoy continued it sends the wrong message to the world if we think that because mr trump is not in favor of multilateralism it doesn t mean we i mean countries like canada france and germany and many others are not still firm believers what exactly this alliance for multilateralism is remains another question entirely as no actual policy was put forth after the smoke had cleared it appears to be nothing more than a lemming like club of hecklers yelling at putin xi jinping trump and other bad people who don t wish to commit mass suicide under a green new deal and technocratic dictatorship commenting on these developments in an april 10 webcast from germany schiller institute president helga zepp larouche made the following apt observation geopolitics has to be thrown out of the window and the new silk road is the way to industrialize africa to deal with the middle east situation to get peace there to establish a decent working situation between the united states russia and china and that is for europe what we should demand and the best way to do that is that all of europe would sign mous with the belt and road initiative then that would be the single most important thing to stabilize world peace and get the world into a different domain with russia and china leading a new coalition of nations fighting to uphold the principles of sovereignty self development and long term credit generation under the framework of the belt and road initiative a great hope has presented itself as the titanic that is the city of london and wall street continues to sink ever faster into the icy waters of history
yeah yeah yeah bernie sanders castigator of the one percent is a millionaire now so are kamala harris and elizabeth warren big whoop there s a crucial difference between these candidates seeking the democratic presidential nomination and the super wealthy particularly 60 gigantic massively profitable u s corporations the candidates faithfully pay federal taxes the corporations don t that s right sixty profitable corporations paid no federal taxes in 2018 twice the number that typically paid nothing in the years before the 2017 tax breaks took effect in fact it s worse than that fifty seven of these corporations demanded rebates from the government which means taxpayers like you and me paid them to exist these are corporations on the dole they claim to hate socialism if it means medicare for all but they sure as hell love socialism when it s welfare for them sanders harris warren and other candidates seeking the democratic nomination paid their taxes because they are patriots most working americans pay a fair share to support their country true citizens pay so that their nation can thrive they pay so that the united states can afford to educate its citizens pave its roads operate its courts care for its vulnerable and sustain its military they pay because they understand they have a duty to the country that nurtured them that protects them and that they love but too many u s corporations which the u s supreme court has anointed with human rights refuse to acknowledge their concomitant obligations corporations and the super wealthy pushed hard for the tax breaks republicans bestowed on them in 2017 fat cats paid untold tens of millions to dark money groups that served as cash cows for gop candidates who once elected shepherded those tax breaks corporate front groups and gop apologists such as treasury secretary steven mnuchin insisted the tax cuts would pay for themselves mnuchin went even further contending the cuts would reduce the deficit by 1 trillion everything would be hunky dory it was a lie then and now the deceit is exposed for the grotesquerie it was the u s treasury reported that corporations paid 92 billion less in federal taxes in 2018 than they did in 2017 a 31 percent drop off to put that in perspective the decline is the second largest since 1934 which was during the great depression the only larger swoon was 55 percent at the outset of the great recession from 2008 to 2009 bad things happen when corporations shirk their obligations one is that workers end up bearing more of the cost last year individual taxpayers provided more than half of federal income tax revenue and corporations contributed only 7 percent just four years ago corporations accounted for 11 percent and individual taxpayers 47 percent another ill effect is that government debt balloons the u s treasury department reported that the deficit rose 113 billion or 17 percent in the first year of the tax cuts the largest one year increase since 2009 which was during the worst of the great recession that black hole is projected to occur every year the tax cuts remain in effect republicans take those deficit figures deficits they created by cutting taxes and use them to demand offsetting spending cuts that is cuts to social security cuts to medicare and medicaid cuts to food stamps and school lunch programs cuts to programs that are precious to workers and the poor the deficits grow like this amazon the online marketplace made nearly 11 billion last year and instead of paying the current low 21 percent corporate tax rate on that income it demanded that taxpayers give it 129 million which they did it wasn t a rebate since amazon paid no taxes it was a big fat gift withdrawn involuntarily from workers pockets wrapped in a fuzzy flocked amazon smiley bag and deposited directly into corporate coffers this is perverse wealth transfer from the poor and middle class to the rich and corporations and taxpayers didn t even get amazon prime in exchange of the 60 profitable corporations that paid no taxes 57 got payments like this from workers amazon s wasn t even the largest ten companies took more including duke energy which set an infamous record for itself by grubbing the most 647 million on about 76 billion in pretax income the 57 forced taxpayers to give them 4 3 billion if instead of exploiting every potential loophole and dodging every conceivable requirement these corporations had paid their taxes at the new low 21 percent rate the united states would have received 16 4 billion in revenue from them that s money the country needs and it s not like amazon and its fellow corporate welfare recipients don t deliver their goods on the roads that workers tax dollars construct or snap up software engineers educated in public schools that workers tax dollars build or argue their patent cases in courts that workers tax dollars maintain americans overwhelmingly support repairing the nation s crumbling roads bridges airports and water lines using u s made products and union workers in 2017 the american society of civil engineers gave the nation s infrastructure a d grade and estimated that the united states must spend 4 5 trillion by 2025 to upgrade the structures on which american commerce depends president donald trump and majorities in congress are all for infrastructure improvements too but it never happens and the reason is money there is no money to do it when so many u s corporations use this infrastructure to make boatloads of money pay no taxes and demand the government give them workers tax dollars workers use those roads and bridges and pipelines too but we pay yeah bernie sanders and elizabeth warren made a lot of money by writing and selling books in the past couple of years in 2018 sanders and his wife jane reported to the irs an adjusted gross income of 561 293 which included 393 000 from selling books they gave 19 000 to charities and paid a federal tax rate of 26 percent significantly higher than the 21 percent rate charged to corporations which don t pay it anyway bernie and jane gave the federal government 145 840 other democrats seeking the party s nomination for president released tax returns showing they paid their fair share as well they include kamala harris who reported earnings of about 1 9 million and paid at an effective tax rate of 37 percent last year sen warren with an adjusted gross income of 846 394 paid at a rate of 27 percent washington gov jay inslee who had the lowest adjusted gross income of the democrats who have released tax forms 202 912 also logically paid the lowest rate 15 percent each of them paid more money and at a higher rate than billionaire amazon not all wealthy people believe it s wise to sustain a system that does not require the 1 percent and profitable corporations to pay their fair share a group of them the patriotic millionaires as they call themselves met in washington d c this week to discuss better ways to assess taxes and what will happen to this country if nothing changes they believe the government should mandate tax payments from the rich and corporations to ensure survival of the very institutions and values that helped the one percent accrue millions and billions the crucial difference between you and amazon is that you paid your fair share and amazon took your tax dollars so no the roads and bridges won t get fixed this year either

greenpeace canada analyst hopes study serves as a wake up call for trudeau government but says you can t wake up a man who s only pretending to be asleep on climate change story transcript speaker it s the 21st century we know climate change is real we know that one of the challenges we have is that pollution has been free but we need to put a price on it dimitri lascaris this is dimitri lascaris reporting for the real news network from montreal canada earlier this week officials from environment and climate change canada a department of the canadian federal government presented the results of a study on warming in canada their study concluded that canada is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world and that northern canada is warming even more quickly nearly three times the global rate the officials also reported that three of the past five years have been the warmest on record in this country their study is the first of its kind entitled canada s changing climate report the study has been in the works for years and is the first of a series aimed at informing policy decisions and increasing public awareness and understanding of canada s changing climate now here to discuss this new study with us is keith stewart keith is a senior energy strategist with greenpeace canada and part time instructor at the university of toronto he has a ph d in political science from york university and has worked as a climate policy researcher and advocate for 19 years he joins us today from toronto thanks for coming back on the real news keith keith stewart thanks for having me dimitri lascaris so keith even with all of the warming that has occurred in this country since the beginning of the fossil fuels era we canadians continue to live in what is one of the world s relatively colder climates why should canadians be concerned about this report how is the warming of the atmosphere and of the oceans affecting their lives in practical terms and what practical effects should canadians anticipate as canada continues to warm keith stewart it s kind of a standard joke that oh in canada it would be nice if it was a little warmer the problem is the rate of change we haven t historically well in the geological record climate has changed a lot over time but we re trying to pack change that usually take 50 000 to 100 000 years into 50 years because we re burning fossil fuels and sort of increasing the greenhouse effect trapping heat which it then causes a whole bunch of other changes you might think oh a little bit warmer that would be nice but you re also changing rainfall patterns you re going to have drought in some places you are going to have more wildfires the kinds we ve seen in b c and alberta the last couple of years where people literally couldn t breathe walking outside in vancouver was like breathing eight packs smoking eight pack of cigarettes in urban areas one of the warnings in the report is we re going to see even more flooding in particular the kind of flash flooding which in one incident here in toronto back in 2013 we saw 960 million worth of damage in a couple of hours we saw street cars under water people had to be rescued from the go train by boat these kinds of severe impacts the heat waves the droughts the wildfires the flooding these cause enormous damage to our economy they cause enormous damage to our health and we re only seeing the thin edge of the wedge here when you look at this report a big part of the message in the report is what the future looks like depends a lot on what actions we take today in their low emissions scenario if canada warmed about one point seven degrees it would warm by another two degrees that s bad because it would have a whole bunch of negative impacts the negative impacts by far outweigh the positives in the high emissions scenario the one we re actually on the path to right now they re talking about warming by six degrees in canada on average even more than the far north by the end of the century that would make agriculture basically impossible in large chunks of the prairies they say oh you can just move further north well a lot of places in this country you move further north they don t have soil to be able to support agriculture here in ontario we have this thing called the canadian shield it s all granite you can t grow crops there and similarly forests which are suited for one climate system can t move themselves north 50 100 200 kilometers in the space of 20 years dimitri lascaris this study was released on april 1st keith which also happened to be the date on which a federal carbon tax of 20 a ton took effect in provinces that lack provincial pricing plans including the provinces of new brunswick ontario manitoba and saskatchewan the carbon tax as i m sure you know is the centerpiece of the trudeau government s strategy for fighting climate change in your view is this carbon tax adequate both from the perspective of the amount of the tax and the breadth of its application and if not what kind of a carbon tax do you think we need in this country given the urgency of the situation keith stewart i think one of the problems we have in this country right now is action on climate change has been narrowed to carbon tax no carbon tax and really we need a whole vast suite of efforts not just carbon taxes but also massive investments in things like public transit so people can get to where they need to go without having to drive a car we need to invest in better sewage stormwater systems so that we re not having these floodings we need to invest in rapidly transitioning to renewable energy a carbon tax is a key part of that raising the price of fossil fuels makes them less attractive relative to cleaner forms of energy it also brings in some cash that can be done to build things like great public transit systems or put up windmills and solar panels so in the u s we are talking about this as a green new deal kind of built on the new deal that roosevelt that the americans brought in to fight the great depression that s the kind of change we need this carbon tax is a component of that and i think it s kind of like the lowest possible measure 20 dollars a ton kicking in this year that s 4 4 cents per liter of gasoline when you look at the price of oil the price of gasoline goes up and down that s not a huge change that on its own is by no means enough they re also talking about increasing it 10 a year greenpeace would support that we also think the money should be invested back in renewables but that s got to be just one piece of a much bigger package the big problem we have right now is no one is treating the climate crisis really like a crisis we treat it more as kind of a messaging problem we do a few things it will go away or on one side of the political spectrum with the conservatives at the provincial level and federally who are fighting against even the small carbon tax that s being proposed they re proposing we do nothing that somehow if we ignore the problem it will go away one of my friends was asking me do you think this new report that just came is a wakeup call and was like well there s an old proverb that says you can t wake up a man who s only pretending to be asleep and that s the problem with a lot of the politicians in this country and around the world they re pretending to be asleep on this issue hoping they can get out of office and it will be someone else s problem down the road dimitri lascaris now at the same time as the trudeau government has raised alarms about the extent of warming in this country federal and provincial governments continue to subsidize fossil fuels to the tune of about 3 billion a year also as we ve reported extensively on the real news the trudeau government is spending billions of taxpayer dollars to buy its transmountain tar sands pipeline keith doesn t this new study i mean what justin trudeau did on monday was he held it up and said to the public and in particularly was addressing the conservatives and those who are opposed to the carbon tax this shows that we have to impose a carbon tax but doesn t it also highlight the recklessness of the trudeau government s continued defense of the fossil fuels industry its massive investments in the fossil fuels industry this perpetuation of our dependence on fossil fuels keith stewart absolutely subsidies in fossil fuels is basically like a negative carbon tax you re making them cheaper in order to get people to use more similarly the federal government yesterday was denying that in response were denying that the purchasing the pipeline was a subsidy to fossil fuels well it is and i think the trudeau government is trying to have it both ways they say we re going to do a carbon tax and we re going to promote expansion of the oil industry if you re serious about climate change that means getting off of fossil fuels as quickly as possible by mid century at the latest building a new tar sands pipeline that has to operate for 50 years to make the money back makes no sense at this point if you re seriously committed to achieving the paris climate goals to protecting the future of our economy of our communities of our ecosystems so it s not one step forward one step back which is kind of what we re seeing from the federal liberals it s got to be leaping forward and i think the big problem in canada and also similarly in the u s and many other places is that entrenched power of the fossil fuel interests in canada and particularly the oil lobby in the us it s also the coal lobby who are basically saying don t go too fast give us time to get our money out the canadian association of petroleum producers has launched an election campaign in alberta saying we want to double the rate of growth of oil production in alberta and here s all things you have to do to help us do that which is kill regulations get rid of carbon pricing build new pipelines that s basically asking people to vote for climate destruction and i think this is going to be a big issue in the federal election here in the fall as we have the conservatives who are saying do nothing about climate change and give more subsidies to the oil industry you have the liberals who are saying let s do stuff on climate change but not touch oil production so they are doing a coal phase out they re doing a bunch of other measures but basically oil is sacrosanct and what we really need is a push for this kind of a green new deal which actually we can make our lives better we can create great green jobs right across the country we can deal with all sorts of problems in this country by the kind of investments that are necessary putting people to work solving the climate crisis dimitri lascaris we ve been speaking to keith stewart of greenpeace canada about an important and alarming new study showing that the rate of warming in canada is far above the global average thank you very much for joining us today keith keith stewart thanks so much for having me on dimitri lascaris and this is dimitri lascaris reporting for the

by midcentury coal and natural gas could be erased from minnesota s electricity grid replaced by carbon free power sources particularly wind and solar that is the goal of gov tim walz who is pushing legislation for a totally clean grid by 2050 ditto for xcel energy with its target of 100 carbon free electricity in the same year reaching that target is a challenge though both because the technological path to completely carbon free energy isn t clear yet and because it may be expensive particularly the last mile from 80 clean energy to the total banishment of fossil fuels there s no doubt that the last 20 is the most difficult and probably the most expensive said doug scott a vice president at the great plains institute a nonprofit energy research group in minneapolis walz sees his goal as a way to ensure reliable affordable electricity while supporting a cleaner environment and the clean energy industry but a bill setting the 2050 goal has yet to get a senate hearing and opponents point to the uncertainties of cost and technology new battery technologies will likely be needed to meet the massive storage demands of a grid as energy sources shift from coal to resources such as wind turbines and solar panels plus minneapolis based xcel and government regulators will need to figure out how nuclear power might fit in the picture its reactor licenses with the federal government are set to expire by the mid 2030s xcel minnesota s largest utility is confident that 80 carbon free energy can be reached by 2030 using existing technology including nuclear beyond that the company is counting on advances that are largely on the drawing board today to reach goals it announced in december the way i look at the 2050 goal we have 30 years to get there said ben fowke xcel s ceo i am open to anything that works cost effectively coal is still king for electricity production in minnesota providing 40 of the state s electricity generation though it s retreating as utilities particularly xcel plan to close coal plants by the mid 2020s in at least one way minnesota has an advantage in the quest to replace coal and other fossil fuels compared with other states minnesota has some of the best wind resources in the country energy analysts said wind now provides about one fifth of electricity generation in the state plus new wind farms in minnesota appear to be as cheap as new gas fired power plants even without federal tax subsidies for renewable energy according to bloomberg new energy finance while solar power comprises about 1 of electricity generation in the state now and is more expensive than new gas power currently the cost is likely to fall the whole trend of all these technologies is that they get less expensive as time goes on scott said but since wind doesn t always blow and the sun doesn t always shine managing the grid becomes more difficult as constant power sources like coal fade away as wind and solar become more prominent however there is a need to make them more stable sources of power batteries will be necessary to store power until it s needed and that work has begun it helps that the benchmark price for battery storage as calculated by bloomberg new energy finance has declined 76 from 2012 35 from the beginning of 2018 utilities have begun planning large battery projects including xcel in colorado xcel also expects pilot projects in minnesota over the next few years the first fully commercial grid battery in minnesota was launched last year by the ramsey based electricity cooperative connexus energy grid batteries usually use the same chemical technology lithium ion as batteries for personal electronics and electric vehicles most lithium ion grid batteries store two to four hours of electricity but with a carbon free grid batteries will need to economically warehouse several days or even weeks of power particularly during seasonal lulls in sunshine and wind long duration storage needs to be an order of magnitude cheaper than lithium ion said jesse jenkins a postdoctoral fellow at harvard university s center for the environment betting exclusively on wind solar and battery storage to achieve a 100 carbon free grid would be a big mistake given the economic and technical challenges concluded a recent study co authored by jenkins in the scholarly journal joule another big hurdle for carbon free generation is the need for more electricity transmission and distribution capacity in 2016 a group of upper midwest utilities including xcel switched on the last leg of a 2 1 billion transmission megaproject called capx2020 it was aimed partly at freeing up power line capacity for more wind energy capx2020 is really not enough said sam gomberg senior energy analyst at union of concerned scientists the grid is fully subscribed it is at capacity the question of nuclear energy another 22 of minnesota s electricity is generated by nuclear energy now the country s largest source of carbon free electricity but it s still controversial among environmentalists notably for the longstanding problem of radioactive waste disposal plus some nuclear plants in states with deregulated electricity markets aren t competitive with generators fueled by cheap natural gas minnesota s electricity business is regulated and fowke said xcel s nuclear plants have been continually improving their operations and cost efficiency the federal licenses for xcel s three nuclear reactors one in monticello and two at prairie island near red wing expire in 2030 2033 and 2034 respectively to get an idea of the nuclear fleet s importance let s assume xcel achieves its goal of 80 carbon free energy in minnesota by 2030 the company would drop back to 60 carbon free power if all three reactors were closed by 2035 and not replaced by any new clean energy sources building large new nuclear plants is a nonstarter these days given the enormous expense and the huge cost overruns experienced by two projects under construction in the southeast new nuclear power technologies much smaller reactors with lower price tags are being developed but it s not clear if they will succeed commercially and they too produce radioactive waste the best bet for extending nuclear power s shelf life may be re licensing existing plants for several more years of operation if it can be done cost effectively and safely pushing nuclear licenses another 20 years is an option and one that a lot of companies are considering said jenkins of harvard s center for the environment count xcel among them i think we need to be open to it fowke said we have more work to do to see what the costs and benefits might be xcel s nuclear plants opened in the early 1970s and were originally licensed for 40 years in the late 2000s xcel petitioned the u s nuclear regulatory commission nrc to re license the plants for another 20 years many nuclear operators did the same xcel may signal its long term plans for the nuclear plants in a regulatory filing this summer carbon capture and sequestration as far as technology that s in the pipeline scientists and businesses are working on several concepts including one called carbon capture and sequestration like nuclear it s controversial among some environmentalists who see it as perpetuating fossil fuel industries the idea is to separate carbon dioxide created from fossil fuel generation and then store the stuff in underground rock formations it s technologically feasible but very challenging said frank wolak an economist at stanford university where he directs the program on energy and sustainable development you could sequester it but would it be cost effective carbon capture received a black eye from a 7 billion vastly overbudget power plant in mississippi which was supposed to burn coal and store about two thirds of its carbon dioxide emissions last year the utility that owns the plant scrapped coal and carbon capture and is instead just burning natural gas a 1 billion carbon capture facility at an existing coal plant near houston opened in 2016 and on budget the petra nova project which was funded partly with a 190 million federal grant is the only one of its kind in the country petra nova sells its captured carbon to a texas oil field operator oil companies have long used compressed carbon dioxide to scour out the last bits of petroleum in conventional wells in north dakota project tundra would build upon the success of petra nova according to its developers led by grand forks based minnkota power an electricity cooperative prominent in northwestern minnesota project tundra would entail an approximately 1 3 billion facility built next to a large minnkota coal fired power plant in central north dakota minnkota is applying for a 15 million engineering and design grant from the federal energy department xcel doesn t have any carbon capture projects in the works though the company is open to the technology if the numbers work yes i would like to see carbon capture work xcel s fowke said next steps there also are carbon free technologies that while nascent show long term promise one involves storage of the sun s heat energy solar panels utilize the sun s light another is the use of excess wind and solar power a likely occurrence in a totally clean grid to create hydrogen fuel through a process called electrolysis i am technology agnostic on how we get there said xcel s fowke walz and dfl legislators are pushing the 2050 plan this year at the capitol attempting to increase the state s existing goal of 80 carbon free power by 2050 the legislation is likely to pass the dfl controlled house but a carbon free by 2050 bill has not yet received a hearing in the republican senate if the legislation fails the clean grid issue isn t likely to go away amid alarm over climate change carbon free energy goals are being debated across the country with some states setting aggressive goals it s great to have that aspiration from companies like xcel and the governor said scott of the great plains institute mike hughlett 612 673 7003

unsustainable sooner rather than later but that has done nothing to make a long position in the coffee market anything but a highly frustrating trade the most direct route for a long or short position in the coffee market is via the futures and futures options provided by the intercontinental exchange the ipath series b bloomberg coffee subindex total return etn jo is an alternative tool for those who do not venture into the highly leveraged and volatile world of the futures arena the price of coffee probes below 90 cents per pound as may rolls into july the price of coffee broke below 1 per pound back in august 2018 when the september ice futures contract was rolling to the next active december contract the price recovered from a low at 92 cents per pound to a high at 1 2550 in october after the roll period was complete and the move to the upside began in mid september source cqg as the weekly chart highlights the brief price recovery that took nearby coffee futures 36 4 higher in only five weeks ran out of fuel on the upside and the price fell until it once again reached 92 cents in early april and fell to a new and lower low at 86 35 cents the weekly chart shows that both price momentum and relative strength metrics are now in oversold territory while historical volatility as the low level of 12 92 open interest the total number of open long and short positions in the ice coffee futures market was at 337 328 contracts on april 17 after reaching a high at a new all time peak at 357 447 contracts on april 1 rising open interest and falling prices are typically a technical validation of a bearish price trend in a futures market time will tell if another price recovery is in the cards for the coffee market as the focus shifts to the new active month july futures contract and the price action in september and october attempts a repeat performance as of april 13 the july futures contract was at the 93 cents per pound level and short term technical metrics were crossing higher the lowest price since 2005 coffee has been moving steadily lower since november 2016 when the price reached its last significant peak at 1 76 per pound even then the price had been making lower highs since 1977 when the soft commodity reached its record high at 3 3750 in 1997 coffee traded to a lower high at 3 18 followed by a lower peak at 3 0625 in 2011 since then coffee has not traded above the 3 per pound level and it has not ventured above 2 since 2014 when it reached 2 2550 source cqg the monthly chart shows that coffee is also in oversold territory on the longer term chart the recent low from the week of april 15 at 86 35 was the lowest in fourteen years and technical support now stands at the september 2005 bottom at 84 45 cents per pound the price action in the coffee market is telling us that abundant supplies are overwhelming demand in the short term one of the reasons for the low price is that brazil is the world s leading producer and exporter of arabica coffee beans and the brazilian real has been under pressure since early 2017 the brazilian real is not moving the election of jair bolsonaro as the president of brazil last october put a right wing candidate who campaigned on a platform to clean up corruption in the nation with south america s largest economy has yet to provide any significant support for the currency relationship between the brazilian real and the us dollar source cqg as the chart shows a series of scandals and economic woes in south america drove the brazilian currency from a high at 0 32815 against the dollar in early 2017 to a low at 0 23725 in august 2018 a decline of 27 7 over the same period the price of coffee futures declined from around 1 50 to its most recent low at 0 8635 or 42 4 while the price of coffee fell in brazilian currency terms the weak local foreign exchange instrument softened the blow of lower prices in real terms coffee fell by around 15 a far cry from the over 42 drop in dollar terms on thursday april 18 the real dollar relationship was at the 0 25315 level which was not far off its recent low therefore the low level of the brazilian real continues to be a bearish factor that weighs on the price of coffee futures the real rose to a high at 0 28035 in the immediate aftermath of the election of president bolsonaro but it will take time for new policies to clean up corruption in the nation if he can deliver on his campaign pledge even if coffee attempts to appreciate in the aftermath of the may july roll period it may need a stronger brazilian currency to make any significant upside progress over the immediate future the bottom of a pricing cycle could be unsustainable at the lowest price in almost a decade and a half and with the potential for a rise in the brazilian currency coffee at under 1 per pound could become unsustainable sooner rather than later before last summer coffee had not traded below the 1 level since 2006 as global demand for coffee beans has gone nowhere but higher increasing global population at the rate of almost 20 million per quarter and a shift from tea consumption to coffee in asia continues to provide support for the demand side of the fundamental equation moreover each year is a new adventure in the coffee market as the weather conditions in critical growing regions in the world like brazil columbia vietnam and other nations where the climate supports production is the most significant factor when it comes to the path of least resistance of the price of the soft commodity at the same time coffee plants are highly susceptible to crop diseases like leaf rust which always has the potential to wipe out supplies coffee can be one of the most volatile commodities and the price trend can turn on a dime when the weather does not cooperate with crops the current state of the forward curve in the coffee futures market reflects the current glut in the market with supplies greater than demand however contango which is the premium for coffee for deferred delivery dates shows that the market is highly sensitive to the fickle nature of supplies each year source ice rmb the forward curve as of april 18 shows that while coffee for may 2018 delivery is at the bargain basement price of 90 95 cents per pound next may it was at 1 058 and in may 2021 at 1 18 in march 2022 the price at 1 2770 or an over 40 premium to the current price level the 2021 and 2022 prices display the high degree of uncertainty that the current glut conditions will continue given the rising demand and unknowns associated with the weather and crop health history tells us that the current price level is likely unsustainable and that the price will eventually recover perhaps violently jo for those who do not venture into the coffee futures market just like an almost perfect bearish storm of ideal weather bumper crops and a falling brazilian real weighed on the coffee market over the past year sending it to the lowest price in fourteen years the current environment could give way to a bullish storm in the coming months one factor to always remember about the coffee market is that production is an annual affair liquidity for delivery dates further than the current crop declines dramatically with time which means consumers cannot lock in prices for next year and futures years coffee has been a highly frustrating trade from the long side and i have been buying dips and stopping out my most recent purchases have been at under the 90 cents per pound level i continue to believe that the price of coffee with recover and post significant percentage gains like we witnessed in october for those who do not trade in the ice arabica coffee futures market the ipath series b bloomberg coffee subindex total return etn provides an alternative the fund summary for jo states the investment seeks return linked to the performance of the bloomberg coffee subindex total return the etn offers exposure to futures contracts and not direct exposure to the physical commodities the index is composed of one or more futures contracts on the relevant commodity the ã â â index components and is intended to reflect the returns that are potentially available through 1 an unleveraged investment in those contracts plus 2 the rate of interest that could be earned on cash collateral invested in specified treasury bills source yahoo finance jo has net assets of 75 38 million and trades an average of 69 545 shares each day the expense ratio at 0 45 is not excessive for a soft commodity etn product while jo does an excellent job tracking the price action in the ico coffee futures market on a short term basis the cost of rolling from one active month to the next eats away at the etn because of the steep contango each period jo rolls its risk to the next active month which involves a cost that decreases the value of the product so timing is critical when trading or investing in the jo product it is always a challenge to trade against a trend in a commodities market it is virtually impossible to pick bottoms or tops in raw material markets from a fundamental perspective and technical indicators are still pointing to a test at under the 85 cents per pound level however i have found that the most rewarding trades and investments in commodities market come at times when they are at the bottom or top of a pricing cycle and coffee at the lowest price since 2005 certainly qualifies as a market that is at or near its fundamental bottom

by richard kozul wright and kevin gallagher geneva the green new deal gnd proposed by progressives in the united states cannot be achieved in isolation to tackle climate change and inequality together all countries will need to agree to new rules for international cooperation the start of such a rethinking began a decade ago in april 2009 the g 20 met in london and promised to deliver a coordinated response to the global financial crisis followed by a future of more robust growth then in december of that year world leaders meeting in copenhagen under the auspices of the united nations promised big cuts in carbon dioxide emissions to limit global warming to 2 c above pre industrial levels the first conference ended with british prime minister gordon brown announcing a new world order founded on a new progressive era of international cooperation the second ended in disarray yet looking back the false dawn of that new progressive era has proved to be the bigger obstacle to a secure and stable future for a decade now the post crisis recovery has oscillated between anaemic growth spurts and recurrent bouts of financial instability owing partly to advanced economies discordant mix of aggressively loose monetary policies and dogged fiscal austerity and this has all been supported by massive build up of debt which has increased by more than 70 trillion worldwide since the crisis but the recovery s sluggishness also owes something to the intertwining of corporate and political power under financialised capitalism as economic power has become increasingly concentrated inequality both within and among countries has reached grotesque heights with financial speculation now commonplace so too are fraud and instability meanwhile investment in public goods globally and nationally has stagnated and growth has become dependent on resource extraction and energy consumption both of which are proceeding at such a pace as to threaten human civilisation itself for all the ambitious talk in london a decade ago little has changed debates about improving global governance still revolve around ideas like corporate social responsibility public private partnerships and free trade agreements none of which will bring about a fairer and more stable economic order complicating matters further global environmental conditions have become increasingly fragile since 2009 and even before us president donald trump s truculent decision to abandon the 2015 paris climate agreement there was no clear path to keeping global temperatures below a level that scientists deem safe let alone to preventing a more catastrophic breakdown against this dismal backdrop bold proposals for a gnd have been gaining political traction notably in the us where the idea is to transform the economy through a harmonious marriage of economic justice social solidarity and environmental rehabilitation the gnd has already triggered a rich debate on policy options and provoked a predictable response from vested interests and their political retainers but the marriage green new dealers envision cannot be left to the benefaction of a global hegemon capital is mobile and carbon heavy growth is no longer the preserve of the advanced economies for the gnd to work it must also be globalised through international cooperation the problem is that multilateral rulemaking in recent decades has been subject to the same political pressures as domestic policymaking it is not a coincidence that the current framework for governing the global economy primarily benefits financial entities and large multinational corporations the original goal of post war multilateralism was to protect the weak from the strong so that they could grow yet its current version encourages strong countries to impose their preferred development model on the weak thereby promulgating a world of winner takes most outcomes under these conditions fine tuning existing arrangements simply will not do to make a global gnd work many of the multilateral programmes that have accumulated over decades will have to be culled and a new generation of smarter institutions will have to be established still the multilateral landscape itself would continue to resemble what us president franklin d roosevelt envisioned when he called for a mutual understanding that would secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants everywhere in the world what we need then is a new set of principles to replace those that have underpinned rulemaking in the age of hyper globalisation looking ahead global rules must be recalibrated toward the overarching goals of social and economic stability shared prosperity and environmental sustainability and rulemaking bodies must be protected from capture by the most powerful moreover the international community must decide upon common but differentiated responsibilities for collective action in order to ensure an adequate supply of global public goods and protect the commons across different domains at the same time individual countries should still be afforded the space to pursue national development strategies within the framework of global rules and norms embedded in that framework should be regulations to strengthen the international division of labour and to prevent countries from pursuing destructive unilateral actions that prevent others from realising common goals finally global public institutions will have to be more accountable to their full membership and to achieve that end should maintain balanced dispute resolution systems they also must be open to a greater diversity of viewpoints and at least cognizant of new voices when they emerge in global debates for a decade the international community has failed to heed winston churchill s advice to never let a good crisis go to waste unless that changes in the coming decade those looking back at the current period in 2029 will not get another chance

when michael johnson started shred it his orlando based mobile shredding company he knew he wanted the government as a customer the state spends an inordinate amount of money on shredders he says johnson recognized the virtually unlimited purchasing power of the government and so should other small business owners last year alone florida government agencies spent more than 12 6 billion procuring goods and services and that s just the state government the feds spend even more but many small business owners are cynical about dealing with the government they say the system is too political or too bureaucratic they re missing out it s the largest market out there and you know you re going to get paid says laura subel program manager for the florida procurement technical assistance center in pensacola but if you re easily frustrated forget it selling goods and services to the state is actually easier than one might expect authority for purchases lies within the executive branch in the department of management services division of purchasing the division has defined policies and procedures and can delegate purchasing authority to other state agencies for procurements of more than 15 000 the state is required to advertise usually in the florida administrative weekly bids are also solicited and advertised online in the vendor bid system so it s easy for potential bidders to determine which goods or services are in demand by state agencies for procurements of less than 15 000 formal notice is not required so vendors must develop relationships with agency end users to unearth opportunities your success depends on your marketing strategy says subel marketing to the state is similar to marketing to any private company we start with a list and call until we find the decision makers says shred it s johnson then he ll go in and do a presentation to show the agency how he will save it money the key to success is persistence get to know the users of your goods and services says edward g tolliver chief of purchasing standards for the department of management services it s a relationship driven process state government resources for government

florida atlantic university boca raton 561 362 5620 set aside shakeup a brief look at the program areas involved in gov bush s one florida initiative on nov 9 as part of his one florida initiative gov jeb bush issued an executive order prohibiting agencies under his control from using racial or gender set asides preferences or quotas when awarding state contracts the controversial move prompted a sit in by two state legislators that induced bush to hold public hearings on the matter around the state florida s procurement policies adopted in 1985 and slated says bush to sunset in 2001 established voluntary goals for minority contracts at each agency they also provided for race and gender based set asides and price preferences bush s proposals involve these areas the goal system bush claims voluntary goals can be manipulated and can actually reduce the number of minority contracts he proposes monitoring the total dollars spent with minority businesses and measuring that against the state s overall spending to track total minority spending bush proposes setting up a universal registration system that identifies all minority vendors not just those that are certified and the amount of state business they do certification bush says he wants to make it easier for more businesses to be certified as minority businesses he anticipates that universal registration will someday replace certification set asides and price preferences bush believes these programs haven t worked and are susceptible to constitutional challenge he proposes creating a race neutral urban hubzone program like that used by the small business administration to stimulate economic development in areas with high percentages of disadvantaged residents the minority business advocacy and assistance office bush wants this office to change its focus to encourage matchmaking between procurement agents and minority businesses at deadline bush said he was committed to the changes but it was unclear what effect input from the public hearings would have there is a tug of war going on and there will be some legal battles says vicky bledsoe manager of the procurement technical assistance center in tampa but the certification process itself is still very firmly in place and is moving forward until such time as things have been really and truly changed federal procurement selling to uncle sam barbara bradshaw president of estero based mesa machinery services inc loves dealing with the federal government they pay on time she says they are a very significant buyer of the commodity that i handle that commodity is metalworking machinery which bradshaw sells to the army navy and air force among other federal agencies about 60 of mesa s business is with uncle sam for small businesses the federal government offers a huge marketplace thousands of agencies purchase goods and services every day and it s all there for the taking if a business is willing to put up with some red tape the federal procurement process involves a lot more paperwork says laura subel program manager for the pensacola based florida procurement technical assistance center where with the state government you may have 100 agencies to deal with with the federal government you may have 100 000 it becomes mind boggling to a lot of people doing business with the feds requires some additional steps the department of defense for example requires vendors to register with the central contractor registry a database for all contractors once registered vendors can search for opportunities in commerce business daily the federal government s primary procurement publication also available on the internet bradshaw uses the internet extensively to check for new leads she also uses several commercial services that notify her of upcoming federal opportunities indeed the internet has leveled the playing field for many small businesses which can now easily find out about and compete for government contracts if you re not internet capable become so immediately recommends subel many agencies now particularly the federal government won t mail copies of the solicitation robyn a friedman the image of success miramar based ancicare finds a niche in medical imaging sometime after his 30th birthday in 1994 michael cabrera found a niche that would put him in the driver s seat of a 13 million managed care organization ancicare ppo in his old life cabrera worked for a private company that served the group healthcare market negotiating contracts for hmos and ppos there he spotted a neglected medical market in workers compensation claims i couldn t sleep all night just thinking about the idea he says i knew it couldn t fail cabrera and his wife donna formed managed care network inc now called ancicare ppo miramar based ancicare serves insurance companies and large employers like cna and winn dixie stores helping them handle medical imaging required by workers comp claimants when ancicare s clients have claims for injured workers requiring magnetic resonance imaging mri or cat scans adjustors contact an ancicare representative who makes patients appointments transfers the medical records contacts doctors offices and works with radiologists to interpret the findings ancicare www ancicare com has developed a network of 800 medical imaging facilities 145 in florida primarily in the southeast u s but now in 40 states across the nation that contract with ancicare to provide diagnostic testing at a reduced rate a typical mri and interpretation by a radiologist can cost around 1 000 but ancicare s mris cost the insurance company between 450 to 500 volume is supposed to make up the cost difference for the provider from that fee ancicare takes about 100 the cabreras worked out of their home for six months and then along with five employees moved into a 1 300 sq ft office where they stayed for three years after the second year they had to add a night shift to accommodate their growing staff in the limited space in 1998 ancicare transferred to its current 6 000 sq ft facility with 40 employees they still have a late shift to serve their west coast clients startup capital for the venture around 75 000 came from the cabreras family and friends along with the couple s savings that money didn t last long though four months after launching the business the cabreras felt they were close to success but the money was almost gone we had most of the state of florida covered in the metropolitan areas says michael cabrera referring to the imaging facilities in his network i knew it was going to work he borrowed another few thousand dollars from his family and the business took off ancicare generated 13 million in revenues in 1999 and cabrera projects revenues of 18 million in 2000 by 2002 he expects a whopping 60 million cabrera says that ancicare was profitable from the first year and his current profit margins are in the 5 to 6 range what s next cabrera is waiting for the florida legislature to pass a bill allowing managed care in the auto insurance environment he believes consumers will benefit from managed care in this industry and insurance companies will realize enormous savings cabrera says that if this happens in florida as it has in five other states ancicare will be ready small talk tampa bay licensing the university

labour could soon be back and a spending spree may trigger a rise in prices here s how to stop inflation burning up your cash american president ronald reagan famously described inflation to be as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man melodramatic words maybe but he feared the lasting damage rising prices can have on an individual s and a nation s wealth reagan had inherited a 1980s economy suffering stagflation with inflation in double digits while economic growth had stagnated or even gone into reverse here as the prospect of a corbyn led government raises the threat of a new inflationary surge we show what you can do to stop it burning away your wealth the prospect of a labour government raises the threat of a new inflationary surge the threat of inflation fortunately britain is not enduring the toxic cocktail of stagflation today in fact figures published last week show the main consumer prices index measure of inflation rising at a steady 1 9 per cent with uk economic growth at a similar level yet the menace of rising prices always lurks in the background a no deal brexit however unlikely that now is would trigger a fall in the pound pushing up the price of everything we import and jason hollands of investment firm bestinvest points to another threat the oil price he says prices could rise due to tightening supply as production is being hit by the political turmoil in both libya and venezuela sarah coles of broker hargreaves lansdown says if inflation starts to bite families will have to budget harder to cover the higher prices savers and investors must never be complacent as even modest levels of inflation can quickly erode their wealth mark atkinson of investment firm alliance trust says inflation might be low but interest rates on most cash deposits are even lower and markets do not expect them to rise far any time soon savers need to take action to avoid the slow confiscation of their wealth tom selby of broker aj bell says if you put 10 000 in an account paying no interest and inflation runs at the government s target rate of 2 per cent a year in five years time that money will buy you just over 9 000 of goods in the shops leave it to fester for ten years and it will buy you just over 8 000 of stuff while 20 years at the same rate of inflation the pot will have reduced in real value by a third to little more than 6 500 so generating a return in excess of inflation is the first base to reach with your savings and investments jason hollands says if you don t achieve a return which at least keeps pace with inflation then it isn t a real return at all give savings more spending power thousands of savers with national savings investments index linked certificates were recently dealt a blow the government backed savings bank announced that anyone renewing certificates after may 1 would see the rate of interest linked to the consumer prices index measure of inflation rather than the longer standing retail prices index rpi is currently rising at 2 4 per cent but historically it runs a whole percentage point above cpi so ns i customers will be paid millions of pounds less in interest assuming that cpi keeps rising at 2 per cent and rpi rises at 3 per cent someone with 10 000 invested in a five year certificate will miss out on about 550 over the term anna bowes of account scrutineer savings champion says although it is a blow these accounts are still tax free and guarantee to remain in line with inflation albeit at a lower rate therefore those who hold them should think carefully before cashing them in as they are not currently available to new customers only to those rolling them over savers looking for standard savings accounts can find 192 that match or beat 1 9 per cent though the best demand they tie up their cash the most accessible account is the secure trust bank 90 day notice account paying 1 9 per cent that compares with 1 5 per cent for the top easy access account and the measly 0 15 per cent average if you were to put 10 000 in today s five year account secure trust s bond paying 2 6 per cent a year your money would be worth 11 369 on paper or 10 304 in real terms assuming inflation stays at 2 per cent but if inflation does rise and savings rates with it you might find yourself stuck in a uncompetitive account and facing a hefty exit penalty to escape it preserve value with bonds bonds are ious made to governments or companies and they can be traded on the stock market many aim to deliver returns at least in line with inflation but they should not be confused with what banks and building societies call bonds which are a type of fixed term savings account with your money guaranteed by the financial services compensation scheme with bonds that can be traded your investment is at risk but the rewards can be greater tom stevenson of investment firm fidelity international says inflation linked bonds offer both an income stream that rises in line with inflation but also sometimes an inflation linked capital value too these bonds are particularly attractive if they are bought before inflation becomes an issue and before it is priced into their cost jason hollands of broker bestinvest says investors considering uk government bonds called index linked gilts can invest at a low cost in a fund such as the vanguard uk inflation linked gilt index he says this replicates the 29 index linked gilts currently in issue beat erosion with equities why pensions are no longer safe the impact of inflation is often most painful in retirement when there is not the same chance to boost your income through work those retired from jobs in the public sector have also had their inflation protection tampered with in the same way as holders of ns i index linked certificates tom selby of aj bell says in the 2010 emergency budget the government switched the inflation link from rpi to the lower cpi for public sector pensions saving the treasury billions of pounds with the arrival of pension freedoms where over 55s can tap into personal pension pots at any time many are also taking a risk one in three has dipped into their pension and simply moved sums to deposit accounts where inflation means they wither on the vine care is also needed if you buy an annuity a fixed income for life selby says if you buy one without inflation protection your spending power will decrease year on year but annuities that offer rising income to beat price increases are costly according to provider hargreaves lansdown a 65 year old with a pension pot of 100 000 could buy a fixed annual income for life of 5 302 but just 3 186 if it rises each year in line with rpi retirees who keep their pot invested drawing an income as and when must ensure the fund is in inflation beating investments investments that routinely pay an income are a popular way of smoothing the damaging impact of inflation this happens when dividends are paid for every share hold the yield of an investment the dividend divided by the share price can often beat inflation stevenson says high yielding shares are attractive in this regard making the uk stock market interesting to investors the yield on the ftse 100 is more than 4 per cent well above the income available on government bonds and cash with the potential to rise in time link asset services which publishes a dividend monitor says the most consistent dividend payers over the past decade have been shell hsbc and glaxosmithkline paying more than 200 billion to shareholders between them many investment trusts also pay rising dividends unlike funds they can put aside income in good years to enhance dividends in leaner times ian sayers head of the association of investment companies says this has enabled many to build up remarkable track records of dividend growth 20 investment companies have raised their dividends for over 20 years several have done so for more than 50 years including city of london bankers and alliance trust many investors in the equity income sector where trusts aim to produce both income and growth have enjoyed additional protection sayers says over the ten years to the end of march the average uk equity income investment trust delivered enough income alone to beat inflation in nine of the ten years and investors will have seen their capital investment grow too hollands adds there are also a handful of investment companies with a strong emphasis on capital preservation and delivering returns that beat inflation rather than a particular stock market index in particular the personal assets trust and ruffer investment company both invest in mixture of equities government bonds including index linked bonds and gold consider inflation beating infrastructure some big infrastructure projects from transport schools and hospitals to power networks offer good inflation proofing hollands says this is because contracts for such projects are very long term and predictable in nature and often incorporate annual adjustments to mitigate the effect of inflation his top picks of stock market listed infrastructure investment firms are hicl infrastructure 5 2 per cent yield and international public partnerships 4 7 per cent he says both invest globally but in the event of a corbyn led government there would be concern about exposure to uk public private sector projects as labour has vowed to terminate them he also likes greencoat uk wind 4 9 per cent it aims to raise dividends in line with inflation and half its revenue is effectively guaranteed by subsidies under the government s renewable obligation certificates scheme seek safe haven of gold gold does not pay an income but has historically protected wealth in periods of hyperinflation hollands says this is because supply is finite you can t print more gold investors no longer have to buy gold bars hollands says they can replicate a holding by investing in an exchange traded commodity backed by physical gold held in secure storage such as the london stock exchange listed invesco physical gold p etc shares
the right wing populist united conservative party ucp led by former federal cabinet minister jason kenney swept to power in tuesday s provincial election in alberta securing 63 out of the legislature s 87 seats this result was principally the outcome of popular opposition to the right wing record of the province s one term new democratic party ndp government and the recent big business promoted unification of alberta s right wing parties the progressive conservatives and wildrose under the ucp banner the coming to power of the ucp will be used to push not just alberta but canadian establishment politics as a whole still further right at the same time the triumph of the alberta first ucp will intensify regional tensions within the canadian ruling class and its federal state while posturing as a fighter for the little guy ravaged by the crisis wracking the province s energy sector kenney pledged to slash taxes and regulations for big business and impose a four year government spending freeze appeals to alberta and western regionalism and to anti quebec chauvinism were also central to the ucp campaign the corporate media has been quick to claim that the ucp was swept to power by a groundswell of support for its reactionary agenda this is a lie aimed at delegitimizing the resistance that will soon emerge within the working class to the government s austerity measures despite overwhelmingly favourable media coverage and the quasi unanimous support of the province s corporate elite kenney only won a modest gain in votes as compared with the combined total taken by the progressive conservatives and wildrose parties in 2015 in that election which brought an end to 44 years of progressive conservative rule the pcs took 27 8 percent of the vote while wildrose secured 24 2 percent for an overall total of 52 percent this time around kenney s ucp received the backing of 55 percent of voters in overall terms this equated to an increase of a little more than 100 000 votes the ucp s large parliamentary majority is attributable to the 8 percentage point drop in support for the trade union backed ndp the ndp s share of the vote fell from 40 6 percent in 2015 to 32 1 percent five cabinet ministers lost their seats as the party s representation in the legislature dropped by more than half from 54 to 24 seats the ndp secured a surprise victory in 2015 by posing as the defender of working people against alberta s multi billion dollar oil industry and by capitalizing on widespread hostility towards the corrupt pro corporate tory government in the 2015 campaign ndp leader rachel notley pledged to increase taxes on the oil companies invest more in social services and enforce tougher environmental standards on the province s tar sands oil producers these promises all proved to be worthless as premier notley and her ndp maintained the so called alberta advantage of ultra low taxes for the corporations and super rich imposed capitalist austerity including public sector wage freezes and cuts to education and healthcare and stoked its own form of alberta regionalism this reached a high point when notley threatened to temporarily block oil shipments to british columbia in protest of the bc ndp government s subsequently abandoned pledge to oppose the expansion of the trans mountain oil pipeline which will significantly increase the amount of untreated bitumen sent from alberta to the bc coast as a result of these right wing anti worker policies the way was left open for kenney and the ucp to pose as friends of ordinary hard working albertans who are suffering or so the story goes due to the ndp s climate change policies refusal to stand up to the trudeau liberals and its restrictions on the creative potential of big business the ndp s defeat had long been predicted in the polls with kenney s ucp enjoying a double digit lead for months in his victory speech tuesday night kenney made clear he would lead a hard right government committed to attacking the working class defending corporate interests and whipping up alberta first regionalism in line with ontario s right wing populist premier doug ford who has cut billions from public spending during his first year in power kenney declared alberta open for business there is a deep frustration in this province a sense that we have contributed massively to the rest of canada but that everywhere we turn we are being blocked in and pinned down claimed kenney today we begin to fight back the ucp s victory is not a simple return to traditional conservative rule in alberta as media outlets like the toronto star have suggested following ford s election victory last june and the coming to power of the coalition avenir quebec in quebec in october the ucp s victory marks a further turn to the right in canadian bourgeois politics the party s ties to far right and outright fascistic forces are well documented including the close ties of leading ucp members to the far right pro trump news outlet rebel media representatives of the white supremacist soldiers of odin have also appeared at several ucp events in recent months additionally ucp members were prominent participants in the far right protests held in several alberta towns and cities late last year under the banner of the yellow vests canada which demanded the federal liberal government reject the un refugee pact deport refugees and strengthen canada s borders on a whole range of issues from taxation policy and social spending to tailoring immigration even more closely to the needs of big business kenney will be at one with ford and quebec premier françois legault in pressing for the intensification of the class war assault on the working class the defeat of notley s ndp which aligned itself closely with the trudeau government including in the push for oil pipelines will further weaken the federal liberals ahead of this fall s federal elections heeding big business demands for a more aggressive assertion of canadian imperialist interests on the world stage and against the working class at home the trudeau government has lurched further right over the past six months illegalizing the postal workers strike further reducing corporate taxes assisting the us regime change drive in venezuela and attacking the rights of refugees kenney s alberta first tirade on election night underscored that his government will champion the demands of alberta big business for policy changes at the expense of rival sections of the ruling class thereby intensifying the regional tensions within canadian capitalist politics which have been exacerbated in recent decades by the globalization of production kenney s attacks on other provinces particularly quebec reflect long standing frustrations among alberta s oil barons over federal provincial fiscal arrangements energy and other policies alberta s energy corporations are angered at ottawa s failure to ram through the construction of new pipelines to tidal water under conditions in which the shale oil and gas boom in the united states has undermined alberta s main oil market and turned the us into a direct competitor the attacks on other provinces are bound up with the ucp s right wing drive to decimate what little remains of federal social spending and welfare programs and privatize healthcare and other public services this finds expression in the party s hostility towards equalization the system under which ottawa provides funds to provinces with a per capita income lower than the national average due to the multi billion dollar profits of alberta s energy sector which have overwhelmingly benefited the province s super rich and corporate elite alberta has for decades been a net loser from equalization to quebec and the atlantic provinces kenney has demagogically pledged to hold a referendum on equalization which he will use to agitate for radical changes to the constitutionally mandated program if not its abolition the goal of any renegotiation would be to gut any national standards for public services like healthcare and pave the way for their wholesale privatization along similar lines the ucp s election platform calls for the conversion of federal social and healthcare transfers into tax points which would enable alberta and other provinces to escape federal limits on healthcare privatization and rapidly undermine the ability of poorer provinces to maintain existing levels of public health insurance coverage kenney is also virulently opposed to the federal liberals environmental assessment bill c 69 which includes certain very limited environmental provisions as concessions to secure support from first nations leaders for resource development projects instead the ucp wants to give the oil corporations a free hand to press ahead with pipeline and resource exploration projects regardless of the environmental and social costs
this earth day it almost feels like we should be carving some turkey why because we have a lot to be thankful for since the first earth day event occurred 49 years ago we should be thankful that the gloom and doom predictions made throughout the past several decades haven t come true fear mongering about explosive population growth food crises and the imminent depletion of natural resources have been a staple of earth day events since 1970 and the common thread among them is that they ve stirred up a lot more emotions than facts by the year 2000 if present trends continue we will be using up crude oil at such a rate that there won t be any more crude oil ecologist kenneth watt warned around the time of the first earth day event you ll drive up to the pump and say fill er up buddy and he ll say i am very sorry there isn t any watt also warned of global cooling and nitrogen buildup rendering all of the planet s land unusable the issue however is that present trends do not continue they change dramatically for a number of reasons innovation happens consumer behavior changes importantly price signals play a huge role in communicating information to energy producers as well as consumers higher prices at the pump encourage companies to extract and supply more oil expensive gas prices meanwhile motivate entrepreneurs to invest in alternatives to oil whether that s batteries natural gas vehicles or biofuels drivers will examine their consumption options as well whether carpooling finding alternative modes of transportation or over time purchasing a more fuel efficient vehicle here we are 19 years past watt s arbitrary deadline and drivers are pulling up to the pump saying fill er up buddy figuratively speaking as watts also didn t foresee self service stations without any cause for concern thanks to human ingenuity and the entrepreneurial drive of energy producers the united states is now the world s largest oil producer according to the u s energy information administration and continually breaking records while global energy poverty and food insecurity remain a pressing challenge the problems are getting much better not worse world bank and united nations data show extreme poverty and global hunger has noticeably dropped since 1970 and according to the international energy agency the number of people without access to electricity fell to below 1 billion people for the first time clearly there s work to be done but signs are pointing in the right direction in the united states the common perception is that the country s environmental state is deteriorating on the contrary through investment in new technologies and through legislation environmental trends have improved significantly in the united states pollutants known to cause harm to public health and the environment are declining according to the environmental protection agency s latest air quality trends report the combined emissions of the six common air pollutants have decreased 73 percent between 1970 and 2017 we should be thankful for economic liberties that provide people with the means to protect the environment as a country grows economically it increases the financial ability of its citizens and businesses to care for the environment and reduce pollutants emitted from industrial growth countries with greater economic freedoms have cleaner environments and greater environmental sustainability the heritage foundation s index of economic freedom and yale university s environmental performance index show a highly positive correlation between a country s environmental performance and its economic freedom freer economies have access to more products and technologies that make our lives healthier and the environment cleaner for instance the availability of simple products such as soaps cleaners and detergents makes our homes dramatically cleaner and healthier the development of sanitation systems and availability of garbage collection greatly reduce many types of diseases and curb toxins in the air and water these products and services may not be what immediately come to mind on earth day but they ve have an enormous impact on cleaning up the planet and we should be thankful for clearly defined and protected private property rights one of the first lessons i learned in economics is that nobody washes a rental car because you don t care for what you don t own property rights are a central hallmark in the united states and around the world for improved environmental stewardship conservation and health of species wildlife habitats forests and other resources the absence of enforced private property rights in developing countries remains one of the largest barriers to improved prosperity and environmental well being catastrophic but unlikely gloom and doom predictions will continue to grab media headlines but free societies with the protection of property rights are tried and true pathways to a healthier cleaner world as we reflect on the progress we ve made as a free society let s celebrate and be thankful nicolas loris is the herbert and joyce morgan fellow in energy and environmental policy center for free markets and regulatory reform at the heritage foundation

when you re in debt it can feel like you re fighting an uphill battle you need to manage your money so that you always have enough to make your payments on time you need to decide which debts you should prioritize and every month interest charges cut into any progress you ve made getting out of this situation requires that you understand how to pay off debt in the most efficient way possible to help with that we re going to cover all the tools and strategies you can use to both get rid of debt and prevent it going forward what is debt debt is something that one party known as the debtor owes to another party known as the creditor in most cases the debtor owes money to the creditor and must pay it back over time there are many forms of debt if you purchase more on your credit card than you can pay back then you ll have credit card debt if you purchase a home with a mortgage then you ll have mortgage debt how much debt do you have before you start figuring out how to pay off debt you need to know the total amount of debt you have your first step should be to gather the following information about each of your debts type of debt credit card personal loan mortgage etc amount owed interest rate minimum payment amount next you should calculate your disposable income this is the money left over each month after you ve paid all your necessary expenses make sure to include the minimum payment amounts of all your debts when adding up your necessary expenses your disposable income will be extra money you can put toward paying off your debt related use the ascent s debt snowball calculator to see which debts you should pay off first how does debt affect your credit score debt affects your credit score because it determines your credit utilization ratio which is the percentage of your available credit that you re using if you have 20 000 in available credit across all your credit cards and combined balances of 16 000 then your credit utilization would be 80 a high credit utilization negatively impacts your credit score with the most widely used type of credit score the fico score 30 of your score is based on your credit utilization although there s no specific safe zone to target it s best if you don t use more than 20 to 30 of your available credit debt repayment strategies there are several popular debt repayment strategies the debt snowball the debt avalanche debt consolidation and a debt management plan by understanding how these different strategies work you can pick the one that s right for you debt snowball with the debt snowball method you always put your extra money toward the debt with the smallest balance here s an example you have a credit card with a 400 balance another with a 2 000 balance and a third with a 5 000 balance you make the minimum payments on each card and any money left over would go toward the card with the 400 balance once you pay off that card you d put your extra money toward the card with the 2 000 balance mathematically the debt snowball method isn t optimal you d save more money on interest by prioritizing debts with the highest interest rates but this method is extremely popular because it works from a psychological perspective when you prioritize your smallest debt you get one of your debts eliminated as quickly as possible that gets a win under your belt which is often just what people need to stay on track debt avalanche the debt avalanche method involves putting your extra money toward the debt with the highest interest rate after you pay it off you progress to the debt with the next highest interest rate and so on the obvious benefit of this method is that it saves you more money on interest compared to the debt snowball it can also help you pay off your total debt more quickly the downside is that it will likely take you longer to start eliminating the debts on your list which could make it hard to stay motivated debt consolidation debt consolidation is combining multiple debts into one the most common ways to do this are by getting a personal loan or a balance transfer credit card and then using that to pay off all your debts since you ll have only one monthly payment to make after debt consolidation this makes debt repayment much simpler and reduces the odds of a missed due date in many cases debt consolidation can also result in a lower interest rate debt consolidation isn t available to everyone because you usually need good credit to qualify for either a balance transfer credit card or a debt consolidation loan with a reasonable interest rate debt management plan if you decide to work with a credit counseling agency one option it may present is a debt management plan the agency would then negotiate your debts with each of your creditors and arrange a payment plan that you can afford once the plan is set up you make one payment to the credit counseling agency per month and it distributes your payment to each of your creditors a debt management plan simplifies your debt repayment because you ll have only one payment to make although credit counseling agencies typically won t negotiate the amount of your debt with your creditors they can negotiate other items such as your monthly payment amount or fee waivers for any fees you ve been charged debt repayment options there are several options that could help with getting rid of your debt balance transfers and personal loans are both popular and effective if used properly but if your debt is too much to handle debt settlement and bankruptcy can work as last resorts here s a closer look at each debt repayment option balance transfer a balance transfer involves moving a balance from one credit card to another this allows you to consolidate your debt and potentially get a lower interest rate if you have credit card debt and a good credit score it makes sense to look at balance transfer cards the best cards offer 0 intro aprs and that can save you quite a bit of money on interest personal loan you can apply for a personal loan and then use it to pay off existing debt this is another way to consolidate your debt so that you have only one monthly payment depending on your credit you may also be able to get a loan with a lower interest rate than your debt debt settlement debt settlement is when either you or a third party negotiates with a creditor to pay off your debt for less than you owe for example if you owe 5 000 you could try to settle the debt for 4 000 you ll need to be ready to pay the full settlement amount if the creditor agrees to it after the settlement is complete the creditor will likely report the debt as settled which can cause your credit score to drop significantly bankruptcy there are two common types of bankruptcy that consumers can file to discharge debt chapter 7 and chapter 13 in chapter 7 bankruptcy you liquidate your assets and in return you re able to discharge most types of debt in chapter 13 bankruptcy you set up a payment plan follow this plan to repay as much of your debt as possible and then you can discharge remaining debts after completing that plan payment plans generally last from three to five years the type of bankruptcy you qualify for depends on your financial situation if you make enough money to pass what s known as the means test then you ll likely need to file chapter 13 bankruptcy and follow a payment plan although filing bankruptcy can be beneficial because it allows you to discharge debt it will also impact your credit score for several years what is your debt to income ratio your debt to income dti ratio is your combined monthly debt payments divided by your monthly income the reason your dti ratio is important is because creditors look at it when deciding whether to approve applications for new credit if your dti ratio is too high you could have trouble getting approved for credit cards mortgages or other types of loans how can you stay out of debt to stay out of debt you need to adopt the right financial habits that includes avoiding excessive monthly expenses budgeting and tracking what you spend prioritizing your savings and building an emergency fund avoid excessive monthly expenses ideally your essential monthly expenses should be no more than 50 of your income although this may not be realistic for everyone you should try to avoid taking on too much the consumers who get the fanciest homes and cars they can afford tend to be the ones who end up in debt by being conservative with your fixed expenses you ll have a comfortable buffer in case of a financial emergency if you spend too much even a relatively small expense can require you to borrow money budget and track what you spend there are many different budgeting systems out there but what s important is finding one that you like no matter how you set up your budget it should have clear limits on how much you ll spend each month to ensure you follow these limits you should also track your spending a budgeting app such as mint or you need a budget can help with that prioritize your savings the best financial habit you can start is saving money first before you do anything else with your paycheck simply choose an amount and set up an automatic transfer to your savings account after each pay period pro tip set up automatic savings so you don t have to think about the transfer each month check out the ascent s empower review to see if their automated saving tool is right for you build an emergency fund your first goal with your savings should be building an emergency fund when you have any sort of unexpected expense an emergency fund can cover it so that you don t need to borrow money and go into debt which debt strategy is right for you we ve gone over quite a few ways to pay off debt now we ll cover how you can choose the best option for your situation this depends on the answers to two questions can you make at least minimum payments on all your debts do you have good credit a credit score of at least 670 here s what debt strategy to choose based on your answers you can make all your payments and you have good credit apply for either a balance transfer credit card or a personal loan to consolidate your debt a balance transfer card is a better choice if you have only credit card debt because you could get a 0 intro apr if you have multiple types of debt then you should get a personal loan you can make all your payments but you don t have good credit use either the debt snowball or the debt avalanche method since the debt avalanche method saves money you should choose that one if you re confident you can stay on track with all your payments if you prefer a method that will keep you motivated then go with the debt snowball you can t make all your payments contact a nonprofit credit counseling agency for assistance it may be able to help you adjust your spending and free up enough money to make all your payments if not you can ask a counselor about negotiating a debt management plan or debt settlement
newport s blue wave has become an economic tsunami unfortunately last week the residents of newport experienced what electing progressive politicians would cost them a surprise last minute docket item was placed for a vote with less than a week for voters to react to it the proposal was for a new 2 percent conveyance tax on home sales the city manager and mayor hoped to sneak the vote through with little fanfare however the city hall meeting that night was packed with home and business owners objecting to the senseless and regressive tax in her campaign mayor jamie bova promised more government transparency this sleight of hand indicates that was just an empty campaign slogan quickly discarded when she sets her sights on more tax revenue our progressive officials worked diligently to confuse the public they used a fancy and ambiguous term for what is in reality just another damaging real estate tax these disingenuous officials tried to sneak it through with little time for those affected to analyze its impact because the bottom line is they want more money and this is the target they are plundering this time they are running out of easier options in truth they simply don t care about its impact on working class folks this new real estate conveyance tax will extract roughly 11 260 from the average single family homeowner that s a daunting sum for middle class families already struggling to secure their future in the hostile newport economic climate so what s going on here the real elephant in the room is that despite our grand mansions and strong seasonal tourist trade newport is broke where did the money go middle class exodus the lifeblood for any community is year round middle class families that dynamic is all but gone in newport 98 of all current home sales are to part time out of state residents with wealth made in our nations biggest cities they pay exorbitant amounts to have second and or retirement homes in our city by the ocean homes in once working class family neighborhoods such as the point and the fifth ward that sold for 200 000 or less a short 20 years ago are selling for close to a million now however the wages of full time residents have not kept up with real estate costs newport s average income is under 60 000 and dropping each year the high cost of homes and soaring rents have been forcing the middle class and elderly out by record numbers in the last five years working class newporters are an endangered species with them has gone the thriving tax base necessary to make the city work well for all instead newport is becoming a city built on two opposite population dynamics the part time wealthy residents and the full time poor poor political leadership has watched this two headed monster grow with no plan to address its pitfalls the result is a city scrambling for revenue that is no longer there a city where middle class workers can no longer afford to buy a home work locally and enjoy a thriving year round community one side of the population are wealthy part time residents it might seem a blessing that real estate values are climbing and that the summer months bring bustling tourist activity however the reality of a city with a growing part time population and seasonal employment is the disappearance of year round revenue for the city in the winter those part timers are elsewhere and newport resembles a ghost town not only the tax collectors but also workers searching for the wages to care for themselves and their families feel winter s economic vacuum this cycle hurts small businesses and working families who are leaving because there is no consistency in income a public housing boom the other side of the population dynamic are our poor residents newport aggressively pursued an effort to be a leader in public housing unfortunately it outstrips our ability to pay for the associated costs because subsidized housing pays a much reduced property tax and the residents pay fewer taxes the situation now resembles a small tug boat trying to pull a large ship through stormy waters with 19 public housing the city is experiencing demands from infrastructure public safety education without the resources to pay for them that sends them scrambling to squeeze extra money out of the shrinking middle class through ever more inventive and damaging tax schemes swamped by schools the costs of the daily operation of our public schools is by far the biggest money issue the city is facing 90 percent of newport s students are from low income housing not only are buildings dilapidated and overcrowded but these students bring more educational challenges with them compared to other communities our schools require more teachers must provide for additional language and health needs and supply full breakfast and lunch programs the costs are staggering and the disappearance of a year round economy through a strong middle class is the reason the city does not have it unfortunately elections matter last november the city saw a progressive trifecta occur where far left candidates took all aspects of city government from city hall to our state delegation to the school board they won on narrow social issue platforms not economic solutions as a result they are ill equipped to understand and solve the problems facing our beautiful city instead of making a course correction that will bring the ship to calmer waters and accommodate middle class residents it appears they have decided to plow ahead with their tax and spend agenda squeeze working class residents for more of their hard earned money and ignore the storms on the horizon the cure is not more new taxes and costs that tactic drives out the glue that keeps a community together the middle class families and small businesses the 2 conveyance tax has been opposed by city and business leaders on all sides of the political spectrum it will have continued devastating effects unfortunately our elected officials are all progressives and they prefer to ignore economic reality instead of seeking more taxes and fees that without thoughtful solutions will only lead to more taxes and fees let s work to elect political leaders who will bring plans for a new way forward our city desperately needs new innovative thinking from our city leaders we can no longer suffer with liberal politicians with no experience or understanding of home or small business ownership politicians who ignore the economic reality of middle class life as they pander to the left wing allies we need political leaders who understand what it takes to build a city with an economy where everyone can live and thrive year round the commonality that newport shares with other near bankrupt cities is unchecked wasteful spending partied with unending requests for more taxes and fees hopefully other communities can learn from this mike smith a republican is a former candidate for both the rhode island house and senate in newport related

many watches hold a special significance for their owners some timekeepers may be a powerful emotional reminder of an esteemed person place or event others the long searched for keystone in a valued collection there are watches that can change your mood and generate a smile just by thinking about them there are even watches that have changed lives the holy grail and above even those hallowed timepieces there is the holy grail the watch i am chronicling here didn t just change someone s life it changed my life while i somewhat egotistically feel part of the horological landscape now the online part of it at least i m really a relative newcomer compared to many of my illustrious colleagues though i ve long had an interest in watches of all shapes and sizes including and please keep this to yourself quartz watches i really only began developing a passion for high end mechanical wristwatches around the turn of the millennium as is my nature though when i take an interest in something i often take it to extremes so it wasn t too long before my interest became much more than that and in fact my interest in horology eventually developed into journalism a full time business a company a great many friendships and last but certainly not least the incredible adventure with elizabeth joshua and garyg that is quill pad and it all started with a watch once upon a time in 2003 i was an active participant in thepurists now known as puristspro i can t remember what drew me to the independent forum in particular but it was likely a mix of the knowledgeable and diplomatic moderator curtis thomson a generally more thoughtful community from my perspective at least than some of the more popular brand forums at the time and no doubt the fact that the wildest and most interesting wristwatches were being developed at that time by the independent brands and watchmakers the early 2000s was the dawn of philippe dufour at least to a wider public thanks to the internet vianney halter urwerk f p journe and the opus series and for me the a h c i stand was by far and away the most exciting place at baselworld i had no emotional attachment to any of the large traditional brands at that time and as far as i was concerned watchmaking just didn t get any better than the independents look but don t touch although i then lived and still live in switzerland within a stone s throw though admittedly you d need a good arm of many well known independent watchmakers i never thought or dared to actually call any up and say you don t know me and i can t afford to buy your watch but i d love to waste an afternoon chatting in atrocious french and take a few photos for a watch discussion forum my boundless arrogance has advanced by leaps and bounds since then i was happy ravenously consuming the content of others and it just never crossed my mind to use the advantage my location provided to give something back but then in early 2004 i received an email it was after i d commented on thepurists independent discussion forum about philippe dufour s duality something along the lines of theoretically wouldn t it be more effective to incline the two balances which were both flat in the duality at 45 i e 90 to each other so they are affected by gravity and shocks in significantly different ways over a decade later no doubt having read my comment and taken it seriously greubel forsey presented the double balancier along the lines i had in mind following my question i received an email from a british collector i knew from the forums as maxh which read something like ian i have one of philippe dufour s dualities and will be visiting him in a few weeks to pick up a simplicity would you like to come up to le sentier with me to ask your question to the man himself i immediately jumped at the opportunity and suggested to max that we spend a few days visiting as many watchmakers as we could he already had a good list in mind watch heaven lo and behold it came to pass in a fantastic few days we visited the les ambassadeurs boutique in geneva f p journe very new then the de grisogono boutique i believe i referred to one of their watches as more like a weapon of war than a wristwatch antiquorum audemars piguet philippe dufour urban jürgensen dining very congenially with the late peter baumberger and the hero of this story mr daniel roth i use mr to differentiate the man from his eponymous brand roth had parted ways with the brand he created in 2001 and at 55 years of age decided to start all over again after a lifetime working for brands audemars piguet launching them virtually from scratch breguet and from scratch daniel roth he reinvented himself as an independent watchmaker working alone except for his wife nicole and son jean daniel for the first time in his life a little background on daniel roth to fully appreciate the beautifully finished handcrafted timepieces daniel roth is currently making we need to know more about the horological journey he took to get where he is today both daniel roth s grandfather and great grandfather were watchmakers in the region of la chaux de fonds switzerland his grandfather understandably decided to swap the cold jura mountains for the sunny mediterranean and moved to nice in the south of france where he opened a watch clock repair business as a young boy roth first played then worked in the shop and then enrolled in and completed a three year watchmaking course in nice le sentier and audemars piguet as an ambitious young watchmaker roth moved to the vallée de joux which was then and still is considered by many to be the center of the world for complicated watchmaking he landed a prized position at audemars piguet which numbered just 50 people at the time roth sometimes found life difficult because the older watchmakers were so demanding but they were very knowledgeable in traditional skills and techniques and he absorbed everything he could learn like a sponge roth had been at audemars piguet for seven years when he learned of an opportunity that excited him an advertisement that read situation vacant watchmaker wanted for breguet breguet the chaumet brothers jacques and pierre were parisian jewelers who had bought the very run down breguet brand and planned to restore it to its former glory this was 1973 the time of the quartz crisis that decimated swiss watchmaking and breguet was virtually nothing but a name on a shop in paris the brand contracted out the few orders for pocket watches they received each year as they were not equipped to produce them on their own the chaumets envisioned breguet s future in switzerland and they needed a talented chief watchmaker to release their dream the successful candidate would possess the energy and skills needed to revitalize the brand and to start a manufacturing capability from scratch but would also have to be a visionary someone who could immerse himself in the long history and culture of breguet to find and instill all of that in a new generation of wristwatches i can t do everything but however talented and experienced he was or thought he was the confident young daniel roth still in his twenties did not have the multitude of qualities needed for such a demanding position what won the chaumets over was roth s honesty and openness he submitted a simple two page resumé the first page highlighting his experience and areas of expertise the second page listing the skills he thought he would need but lacked skills however he believed he could learn if given the chance jacques and pierre decided that both they and breguet had found their man and offered young roth the position la chaux de fonds thanks but no thanks the chaumets had initially planned to set up a new workshop for breguet in la chaux de fonds however roth made it clear that he wasn t interested in moving from le sentier so they left it to him to find something suitable closer to home with the chaumets support roth first went back to watch school in le sentier for a year to get a solid technical and academic base in complications at the same time he studied all he could from the breguet archives and absorbed everything about abraham louis breguet lifework company and watches while studying in le sentier roth made a perpetual calendar pocket watch which was then sold under the breguet name it generated sufficient profits to reimburse the chaumets investment and expenses for his year of education roth began designing and building watches for breguet at a small rented atelier in le brassus before breguet was able to buy its own premises he introduced the perpetual calendar and tourbillon into breguet s new wristwatch collection a move that prompted other brands to produce these complications themselves abraham louis breguet 1747 1823 had created timepieces of varying styles and it was roth who selected what we now think of as the classic breguet look from the diverse elements guilloche dial blued steel pomme hands and coin edge case band the iconic breguet 3130 inspired by a vintage breguet pocket watch roth designed and developed the now iconic 3130 however to complete the task he had to work through his holidays when he told the chaumet brothers they magnanimously granted him an extra three days off for his troubles roth spent 14 rewarding years with breguet and stamped his imprint on both the watches and the company however the chaumets went bankrupt tax problems so in 1987 breguet was sold to the investment company investcorp with the chaumet brothers at the helm roth would have been happy to stay with breguet for the rest of his working life but once the business was sold he decided it was time for a new challenge investcorp sold breguet to swatch group in 1999 in 1987 roth left breguet to embark upon his next big adventure daniel roth the brand in 1989 roth launched daniel roth his own brand began with a plethora of ideas a completely original oval style case shape and a focus on quality and innovation for a watchmaker launching one s own brand was quite an undertaking to put the scale of this project in perspective it had been many decades since a watchmaker launched a serious brand not only did roth do this he also helped pave the way for franck muller who launched his eponymous brand two years later the daniel roth brand was so respected that it was accepted to exhibit at the prestigious salon international de la haute horlogerie sihh in geneva going going gone with so much going for the daniel roth brand what could have possibly gone wrong well quite a bit actually it turned out that roth was a better watchmaker than businessman an unfortunate buyout of the brand s main distributor siber hegner led to a withdrawal of bank funding the hour glass in singapore then purchased a majority stake in daniel roth but eventually sold it to bulgari in 2000 which later completely absorbed the daniel roth name into the bulgari branded collection the circle closes at long last i hear you mumble this finally closes the circle and brings us back to 2001 when roth left the company that bore his name and began working as an independent and then to 2004 when max and i visited roth in the attic workshop located in his le sentier home the attic has been outfitted with all the tools and machines necessary it turns out you don t need that many to create incredible wristwatches from a few raw metal bars and a lot of skill and hard work max by now my friend was so impressed with roth s work that he ordered one of the first jean daniel nicolas two minute tourbillons christened according to an amalgamation of the names of roth s wife nicole son jean daniel and himself however this watch would not be the first timepiece in the series roth was already in the process of constructing no 1 the numeral max coveted so badly in a flash of inspiration max asked if he could have number 0 and roth agreed as max spoke no french and roth no english i became their translator and visited the roths many times over the following two years it took for the watch s completion roth has now managed to reduce the time it takes him to make one watch to around four months so can make a maximum of three per year if he doesn t take any time off or a holiday i went up to le sentier every month or so to follow and record the progress of the creation of this magical tourbillon as it was slowly being brought to life i saw a master of the art applying guilloche in geneva waves to the silver dial roth transforming bars of metal into gears wheels and pinions and the hands being blued and the movement being assembled and cased following the creation of that two minute tourbillon was akin to a two year horological master class for me and the roth family became and i m happy to say still are good friends what makes this tourbillon so special the jean daniel nicolas two minute tourbillon is a very special timepiece for far too many reasons for me to list here and that s saying something in an article this long but here are a few it is hand crafted like few watches are today using traditional watchmaking techniques that abraham louis breguet himself would easily recognize the high arches of the bat wing tourbillon bridge are an example of form following function they are necessary so you can see the 0 and 60 second section of the second scale that bat wing tourbillon bridge is one of the largest flat polished also know as black polish pieces of steel you are ever likely to see and the difficulty in achieving that level of finish grows exponentially with surface area the seconds displayed by tiny arrow shaped hands on the tourbillon cage look to be retrograde because of the two minute rotation one of the hands is blued steel the other gold roth has used the different masses of the metals to balance the cage without having to add more weight which is detrimental to precision the full mainplate visible through the display back is unusual for the vallée de joux where finger bridges are more common however roth closed this because he wanted a relatively sober back to contrast with the more detail rich dial side the waves on that full movement plate on the back are not j shaped geneva waves but u shaped waves roth saw the finish on an old pocket watch and spent weeks teaching himself how to make them i ve not seen them on any other watch the two minute tourbillon doesn t just look good roth regulates his watches to observatory class precision the three piece cases are not screwed together that would be too easy and the screw heads would mar the purity of the case shape they are clipped together as fine watch cases traditionally were a method requiring much higher levels of precision in manufacture my first published article as i got to know daniel roth better over that time i thought what a fascinating life he had and was disappointed not to be able to find more information about him on the internet this led to me thinking that i probably knew as much about roth as anyone so i decided to write an article about him for thepurists some of which i have purloined for the history section of this tome thepurists independent forum moderator curtis d thomson and site founder thomas mao were already writing occasionally for iw magazine in america and thanks to recommendations by them i received a call from then iw editor gary girdvainis now editor of wristwatch magazine who asked if he could publish my daniel roth article in iw my first shaky baby steps as a watch journalist had begun that roth article led to another piece about an up and coming brand making some waves at the time and continues to do so greubel forsey before i knew it i was iw s swiss correspondent elizabeth doerr was long a regular contributor to iw at that time as well one thing led to another and i began writing for a number of magazines and even wrote a book with peter speake marin for the 25th anniversary of the a h c i called hands of time a business it isn t easy making a living as a full time watch journalist as i m sure any of my colleagues will attest especially when you spend far too much time watching and talking to watchmakers and less time writing about them so i began writing press releases and website texts for independent watchmakers and small brands and that led to a small communications business called underthedial which is now my main day job and that special jean daniel nicolas watch when i met max back in 2004 i wasn t by any means a serious collector or even a casual collector i still would not consider myself a serious collector now because the watches i was most passionate about were far beyond my financial means after two years the no 0 jean daniel nicholas two minute tourbillon was finally ready but max s life was going through a few changes after he picked his watch up he asked if i would keep the watch in switzerland until he had more stability so i put the watch that i had spent two years following and chronicling the watch that was responsible for my budding career as a watch journalist in my bank safe deposit box and basically forgot about it seriously and then and there the jdn two minute tourbillon remained for two years until i received a call from max his life had returned to a more even keel but unfortunately the watch that had meant so much to both of us would have to be sold i casually asked how much he was asking not for me but in case i came across any potential buyers max replied with a fair figure based on how much the watch had cost him at the time i mentally translated max s figure from pounds to swiss francs the gods of international exchange rates must have been in a good mood because when max paid for the watch years before the pound was strong against the swiss franc and now it was weak this meant that although it was still an eye wateringly large sum for somebody who had never spent even 5 000 on a watch the jean daniel nicolas two minute tourbillon no 0 that had changed my life in so many ways including leading to the opportunity to launch quill pad with elizabeth was just barely within my reach and with the help and required blessing of my wife became mine many watches hold a special significance for their owners some timekeepers may be a powerful emotional reminder of an esteemed person place or event others the long searched for keystone in a valued collection there are watches that can change your mood and generate a smile just by thinking about them there are even watches that have changed lives and there is one that has done all of the above and more for me the jean daniel nicolas two minute tourbillon no 0 quick facts jean

source wall street on parade by pam martens and russ martens april 17 2019 on july 21 2011 when the gao released its audit of the federal reserve s secret 16 1 trillion in bank loans during the financial crisis a foreign bank ranked number 9 on the list of the largest borrowers the loans went not just to the largest banks on wall street but to foreign derivative counterparties to the wall street banks the foreign bank that ranked 9 on the list of the largest borrowers was germany s largest bank deutsche bank which took 354 billion in revolving loans from the u s federal reserve according to an article in the financial times last week germany s federal and state governments have spent 70bn on bailing out banks since the financial crisis according to an estimate by gerhard schick head of lobby group finance watch the figure of 70bn is about 79 billion u s dollars why did the u s fed throw 364 billion at one german bank when its country of origin has only reached in its pocket to the tune of 79 billion for all of its troubled banks read on for the answer during 2018 the serially troubled deutsche bank which still has a vast derivatives footprint in the u s as counterparty to some of the largest banks on wall street trimmed its exposure to derivatives from a notional 48 266 trillion to a notional 43 459 trillion 49 trillion u s dollars according to its 2018 annual report a derivatives book of 49 trillion notional puts deutsche bank in the same league as the bank holding companies of u s juggernauts jpmorgan chase citigroup and goldman sachs which logged in at 48 trillion 47 trillion and 42 trillion respectively at the end of december 2018 according to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ see table 2 at this link deutsche bank s feeble 10 percent reduction in mind numbing derivatives stands in stark contrast to the reduction in deutsche bank s share price last year on the first trading day of 2018 deutsche bank opened at 19 27 on the last trading day of the year december 31 2018 deutsche bank closed at 8 15 a reduction in shareholder value of 58 percent what that did to deutsche bank s market capitalization was this with 2 066 773 131 shares outstanding at both the start of the year and at the end of the year shareholders lost an enormous 23 billion in market cap in 2011 when the gao released the list of the banks that had received the 16 1 trillion in secret loans from the fed during the financial crisis two other foreign banks ranked in the top ten of those receiving this strange largesse from the u s central bank the u k mega bank barclays ranked number 5 with 868 billion in cumulative borrowings and the royal bank of scotland group plc also of the u k ranked number 8 with 541 billion in revolving loans from the fed see chart below with those numbers in mind now study this chart provided by the financial crisis inquiry commission which issued subpoenas and took testimony from more than 700 witnesses the chart lists goldman sachs derivatives counterparties as of june 2008 and the dollar amount of exposure between deutsche bank barclays and the royal bank of scotland goldman had a cumulative derivatives exposure to just those three foreign banks of 7 2 trillion notional face amount goldman is just one investment bank add in the derivatives exposure to these foreign banks by citigroup jpmorgan chase morgan stanley merrill lynch and one can begin to understand why the federal reserve wanted to keep its 16 1 trillion in revolving loans to both domestic and foreign banks a big secret from the american people that s because the federal reserve is not just the u s central bank but it is also a regulator of bank holding companies which includes the largest banks on wall street it had allowed this stockpile of financial weapons of mass destruction to grow exponentially in the years leading up to the 2008 wall street collapse according to phil angelides the chair of the financial crisis inquiry commission the notional value of over the counter derivatives grew from 88 trillion in 1999 to 684 trillion in 2008 and it grew in a dark and mostly unregulated market rather than stripping away the regulatory powers of such an incompetent regulator as the fed congress succumbed to the demands of wall street lobbyists and gave the crony fed broadened supervisory powers over the wall street banks in the 2010 financial reform legislation known as dodd frank those expanded powers continue to this day despite one of its own bank examiners carmen segarra blowing the whistle on how she was fired because she wouldn t bow to pressure to change her examination of goldman sachs one of the fed s enhanced regulatory powers was to conduct stress tests of the big banks effectively to convince the american people that the banks were safe and sound again but in 2016 when researchers at the office of financial research looked at how the fed was conducting these stress tests they concluded that the fed was doing it all wrong we think this wasn t a bug but a feature of how the fed was pretending to oversee the wall street banks while allowing the dangerous derivative markets to continue the ofr researchers who conducted the study jill cetina mark paddrik and sriram rajan determined that the fed s stress tests are measuring counterparty risk for the trillions of dollars in derivatives held by the largest banks on a bank by bank basis the real problem according to the researchers is the contagion that could spread rapidly if one big bank s counterparty was also a key counterparty to other systemically important wall street banks the researchers wrote a bhc may be able to manage the failure of its largest counterparty when other bhcs do not concurrently realize losses from the same counterparty s failure however when a shared counterparty fails banks may experience additional stress the financial system is much more concentrated to and firms risk management is less prepared for the failure of the system s largest counterparty thus the impact of a material counterparty s failure could affect the core banking system in a manner that ccar may not fully capture the black hole surrounding derivatives is just as dark today as it was in 2008 and just as dangerous the financial crisis inquiry commission had this to say about the crash the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutions unseen and unknown in this unregulated market added to uncertainty and escalated panic helping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions there is not one federal or state regulator today who could tell you which counterparty has the most concentrated risk to derivatives nor is there one wall street bank who has clarity on this issue because the majority of the over the counter derivative contracts are secret contracts between one party and another we know that deutsche bank s derivative tentacles extend into most of the major wall street banks according to a 2016 report from the international monetary fund imf deutsche bank is heavily interconnected financially to jpmorgan chase citigroup goldman sachs morgan stanley and bank of america as well as other mega banks in europe the imf concluded that deutsche bank posed a greater threat to global financial stability than any other bank as a result of these interconnections and that was when its market capitalization was tens of billions of dollars larger than it is today until these mega banks are broken up until the fed is replaced by a competent and serious regulator of bank holding companies and until derivatives are restricted to those that trade on a transparent exchange the next epic financial crash is just one counterparty blowup away like this like loading

labour could soon be back and a spending spree may trigger a rise in prices here s how to stop inflation burning up your cash american president ronald reagan famously described inflation to be as violent as a mugger as frightening as an armed robber and as deadly as a hit man melodramatic words maybe but he feared the lasting damage rising prices can have on an individual s and a nation s wealth reagan had inherited a 1980s economy suffering stagflation with inflation in double digits while economic growth had stagnated or even gone into reverse here as the prospect of a corbyn led government raises the threat of a new inflationary surge we show what you can do to stop it burning away your wealth the prospect of a labour government raises the threat of a new inflationary surge the threat of inflation fortunately britain is not enduring the toxic cocktail of stagflation today in fact figures published last week show the main consumer prices index measure of inflation rising at a steady 1 9 per cent with uk economic growth at a similar level yet the menace of rising prices always lurks in the background a no deal brexit however unlikely that now is would trigger a fall in the pound pushing up the price of everything we import and jason hollands of investment firm bestinvest points to another threat the oil price he says prices could rise due to tightening supply as production is being hit by the political turmoil in both libya and venezuela sarah coles of broker hargreaves lansdown says if inflation starts to bite families will have to budget harder to cover the higher prices savers and investors must never be complacent as even modest levels of inflation can quickly erode their wealth mark atkinson of investment firm alliance trust says inflation might be low but interest rates on most cash deposits are even lower and markets do not expect them to rise far any time soon savers need to take action to avoid the slow confiscation of their wealth tom selby of broker aj bell says if you put 10 000 in an account paying no interest and inflation runs at the government s target rate of 2 per cent a year in five years time that money will buy you just over 9 000 of goods in the shops leave it to fester for ten years and it will buy you just over 8 000 of stuff while 20 years at the same rate of inflation the pot will have reduced in real value by a third to little more than 6 500 so generating a return in excess of inflation is the first base to reach with your savings and investments jason hollands says if you don t achieve a return which at least keeps pace with inflation then it isn t a real return at all give savings more spending power thousands of savers with national savings investments index linked certificates were recently dealt a blow the government backed savings bank announced that anyone renewing certificates after may 1 would see the rate of interest linked to the consumer prices index measure of inflation rather than the longer standing retail prices index rpi is currently rising at 2 4 per cent but historically it runs a whole percentage point above cpi so ns i customers will be paid millions of pounds less in interest assuming that cpi keeps rising at 2 per cent and rpi rises at 3 per cent someone with 10 000 invested in a five year certificate will miss out on about 550 over the term anna bowes of account scrutineer savings champion says although it is a blow these accounts are still tax free and guarantee to remain in line with inflation albeit at a lower rate therefore those who hold them should think carefully before cashing them in as they are not currently available to new customers only to those rolling them over savers looking for standard savings accounts can find 192 that match or beat 1 9 per cent though the best demand they tie up their cash the most accessible account is the secure trust bank 90 day notice account paying 1 9 per cent that compares with 1 5 per cent for the top easy access account and the measly 0 15 per cent average if you were to put 10 000 in today s five year account secure trust s bond paying 2 6 per cent a year your money would be worth 11 369 on paper or 10 304 in real terms assuming inflation stays at 2 per cent but if inflation does rise and savings rates with it you might find yourself stuck in a uncompetitive account and facing a hefty exit penalty to escape it preserve value with bonds bonds are ious made to governments or companies and they can be traded on the stock market many aim to deliver returns at least in line with inflation but they should not be confused with what banks and building societies call bonds which are a type of fixed term savings account with your money guaranteed by the financial services compensation scheme with bonds that can be traded your investment is at risk but the rewards can be greater tom stevenson of investment firm fidelity international says inflation linked bonds offer both an income stream that rises in line with inflation but also sometimes an inflation linked capital value too these bonds are particularly attractive if they are bought before inflation becomes an issue and before it is priced into their cost jason hollands of broker bestinvest says investors considering uk government bonds called index linked gilts can invest at a low cost in a fund such as the vanguard uk inflation linked gilt index he says this replicates the 29 index linked gilts currently in issue beat erosion with equities why pensions are no longer safe the impact of inflation is often most painful in retirement when there is not the same chance to boost your income through work those retired from jobs in the public sector have also had their inflation protection tampered with in the same way as holders of ns i index linked certificates tom selby of aj bell says in the 2010 emergency budget the government switched the inflation link from rpi to the lower cpi for public sector pensions saving the treasury billions of pounds with the arrival of pension freedoms where over 55s can tap into personal pension pots at any time many are also taking a risk one in three has dipped into their pension and simply moved sums to deposit accounts where inflation means they wither on the vine care is also needed if you buy an annuity a fixed income for life selby says if you buy one without inflation protection your spending power will decrease year on year but annuities that offer rising income to beat price increases are costly according to provider hargreaves lansdown a 65 year old with a pension pot of 100 000 could buy a fixed annual income for life of 5 302 but just 3 186 if it rises each year in line with rpi retirees who keep their pot invested drawing an income as and when must ensure the fund is in inflation beating investments investments that routinely pay an income are a popular way of smoothing the damaging impact of inflation this happens when dividends are paid for every share hold the yield of an investment the dividend divided by the share price can often beat inflation stevenson says high yielding shares are attractive in this regard making the uk stock market interesting to investors the yield on the ftse 100 is more than 4 per cent well above the income available on government bonds and cash with the potential to rise in time link asset services which publishes a dividend monitor says the most consistent dividend payers over the past decade have been shell hsbc and glaxosmithkline paying more than 200 billion to shareholders between them many investment trusts also pay rising dividends unlike funds they can put aside income in good years to enhance dividends in leaner times ian sayers head of the association of investment companies says this has enabled many to build up remarkable track records of dividend growth 20 investment companies have raised their dividends for over 20 years several have done so for more than 50 years including city of london bankers and alliance trust many investors in the equity income sector where trusts aim to produce both income and growth have enjoyed additional protection sayers says over the ten years to the end of march the average uk equity income investment trust delivered enough income alone to beat inflation in nine of the ten years and investors will have seen their capital investment grow too hollands adds there are also a handful of investment companies with a strong emphasis on capital preservation and delivering returns that beat inflation rather than a particular stock market index in particular the personal assets trust and ruffer investment company both invest in mixture of equities government bonds including index linked bonds and gold consider inflation beating infrastructure some big infrastructure projects from transport schools and hospitals to power networks offer good inflation proofing hollands says this is because contracts for such projects are very long term and predictable in nature and often incorporate annual adjustments to mitigate the effect of inflation his top picks of stock market listed infrastructure investment firms are hicl infrastructure 5 2 per cent yield and international public partnerships 4 7 per cent he says both invest globally but in the event of a corbyn led government there would be concern about exposure to uk public private sector projects as labour has vowed to terminate them he also likes greencoat uk wind 4 9 per cent it aims to raise dividends in line with inflation and half its revenue is effectively guaranteed by subsidies under the government s renewable obligation certificates scheme seek safe haven of gold gold does not pay an income but has historically protected wealth in periods of hyperinflation hollands says this is because supply is finite you can t print more gold investors no longer have to buy gold bars hollands says they can replicate a holding by investing in an exchange traded commodity backed by physical gold held in secure storage such as the london stock exchange listed invesco physical gold p etc shares
thanks to politicians carbon taxes are now a moral cause if you want to save the planet you ll sign on otherwise catastrophe will ensue warns our radiant environment minister catherine mckenna ridiculous argues ontario s portly populist premier doug ford carbon taxes will create a carbon tax recession inflicted on us by our evil central government both are blasting their message at the electorate to persuade us that their side is right neither statement is remotely true of course at 4 4 cents more per litre of gas the new federal carbon tax is big enough to notice but much too small to pry people from their cars even so a lot of people like it it shows that canada is serious about climate policy they figure that even if a carbon tax doesn t buy us the solution to climate change it seems like a good first step unfortunately the evidence is mounting that they don t work the idea behind a carbon tax or carbon price as it s more accurately described is simple if you raise the price of something such as fossil fuels then people will use less of it economists and policy wonks say carbon taxes are the most efficient way to cut greenhouse gas emissions without affecting growth in canada the federal carbon tax is also supposed to be revenue neutral so that people get their money back through a rebate but carbon taxes are on a losing streak too many people don t like them no matter how revenue neutral they re supposed to be the central problem is that they are either too low to be effective or they re so high that the politicians responsible for introducing them will get booted out of office as david leonhardt writes in the new york times the record isn t encouraging barack obama tried to pass a climate bill and failed the australian labor party introduced a carbon tax and was swiftly kicked out france s emmanuel macron s gas tax increase was rolled back after it led to a general uprising u s democrats sweeping green new deal proposal doesn t even mention carbon taxes one often cited exception is british columbia which introduced a carbon tax in 2008 for several years the province s emissions fell as the economy grew does a carbon tax work just ask british columbia gushed the times along with many others b c gets glowing reviews from carbon tax enthusiasts but in fact the b c government has abandoned its famous revenue neutrality and ghg emissions have started going up again b c is now stuck with the highest gas prices of any province in the country and little to show for it because of this dismal record some climate activists have begun to change their strategy mr leonhardt writes instead of emphasizing a negative higher costs they re trying to focus on a positive for example even many conservatives are willing to buy into a climate plan that would increase the use of clean energy when the debate is about the cost of living mr leonhardt writes climate activists are in trouble when it s about clean energy or people s health they have a much better chance another skeptic is jeffrey ball a former energy reporter for the wall street journal who s written a similar piece for foreign affairs like mr leonhardt he believes climate change is a huge and urgent problem but he also thinks the facts should drive the policies even under the rosiest of circumstances carbon pricing will produce only a fraction of the emission cuts needed to put the world onto a sufficiently low carbon path he writes he thinks there s much more to be gained in phasing out coal plants emphasizing nuclear energy slashing fossil fuel subsidies and toughening energy efficiency requirements if there were easy ways to tackle climate change we d have results by now instead the world s carbon emissions reached a record in 2017 canada s emissions were up too that is not an excuse for doing nothing it s simply an admission of the facts we don t yet have the tools we need in fact carbon taxes have a downside because they give you the illusion that you re actually doing something that will make a difference a policy prescription widely billed as a panacea is acting as a narcotic mr ball writes it s giving politicians and the public the warm feeling that they re fighting climate change even as the problem continues to grow and that s what prime minister justin trudeau s climate policy amounts to a warm and fuzzy feeling dressed up as action its effect on carbon emissions will be non existent its effect on interprovincial relations is already awful and likely to get worse on top of that mr trudeau could soon have five premiers battling him in court in what amounts to the greatest federal provincial split in recent times a carbon tax is better than doing nothing people say or is it
this article is more than 4 years old 2018 bloomberg finance lp america should stop providing aid to pakistan which ends up supporting the country s rich and powerful it should let china and saudi arabia do it providing financial aid to poor countries around the world makes a great deal of sense for america both on humanitarian and geopolitical grounds the trouble is that in some cases american foreign aid ends up supporting the lifestyles of the elite rather than the lives of the poor pakistan is a case in point for decades washington has been very generous to that south asian nation according to akbar zaidi a karachi based political economist and columbia university visiting scholar it helped the country deal with chronic debt crisis washington support is often reflected in its endorsement of pakistan s applications for aid from international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and the world bank says zaidi it helps to have the united states as an ally when it comes to seeking assistance from multilateral sources koyfin koyfin like back in december 2001 when washington brokered a 12 billion imf debt relief package for islamabad in exchange f or support to fight islamic militancy in the region so w hy pakistan is running into debt problems that require foreign aid to solve them because the country s elite is refusing to pay its fair share of taxes according to zaidi these problems are perennial it would be incorrect to call them a crisis largely because of the pakistani elite s ability to avoid taxing itself says zaidi instead successive governments have preferred to leverage islamic militancy ignoring the risks of doing so while relying on financial aid from outside countries with geopolitical interests in the region from international financial institutions the pakistani elite he continues frightens foreigners into proving funds to stabilize the country against a self created false threat of extremists taking over a nuclear state meanwhile foreign aid allows the country s elite to live a lavish life this is a classic moral hazard problem the luxury of always being bailed out has allowed the pakistani elite to live with great impunity beyond responsibility in cocoons of lavish unaccountability they feel little need to undertake structural reforms of the economy and institutions that would result in a fairer more just and more equitable form of government and representation instead they prefer london new york and dubai more than they do karachi when it comes to investing and partying with their money that is that s according to the former director of united nations development programme undp for pakistan marc andré franche you cannot have an elite that takes advantage of very cheap and uneducated labour when it comes to making money and when it is time to party is found in london when it s time to buy things in dubai and when it s time to buy property it invests in dubai or europe or new york the elite needs to decide do they want a country or not franche stated in an interview with the business recorder

in the ongoing u s debate about immigration the central american countries of honduras el salvador and guatemala are mainly in the news because many of those crossing our border from mexico are from these nations why isn t costa rica experiencing a similar mass exodus i put the question to president carlos alvarado quesada in an email response he writes in part 8 percent of our gdp is dedicated to education and our main resource is the human talent and well being of the people who live in our country next monday for example we will celebrate 150 years of primary education for free for all kids in the country many of those fleeing other central american countries claim to feel threatened by gangs and crime costa rica has had a lower crime rate than others in the region but that may be about to change according to the costa rica star newspaper the government and tourism industry started paying more attention to crime when two female foreign tourists were killed in two days last year and a third was raped a week later all near tortuguero national park the costa rican homicide rate has been rising steadily there were 603 murders in 2017 although figures are lower than in other central american countries costa rica is experiencing its own immigration challenge the new york times reported last september since mid april when nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse some fleeing a crackdown by president daniel ortega against his opponents others newly unemployed desperately looking for work many thousands have headed to costa rica in fact writes qcostarica com costa rica has the highest percentage of immigrants in central america according to the study labor market and social policies of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd tourism is the main economic driver here the government is concerned any perception it is unsafe to visit might cause serious financial harm the heritage foundation s 2018 economic freedom rankings place costa rica 61st under the category moderately free although president alvarado references the economist which ranks his country among the strongest 20 democracies in the world while acknowledging the economist s ranking anthony kim of the heritage foundation comments the country needs deeper institutional reforms for more dynamic development of a broader private sector despite progress excessive government bureaucracy still discourages entrepreneurial activity slowing the pace of privatization and fiscal reform widening budget deficits have put public debt on an upward trend just to name a few economic policy shortcomings costa rica can do more in terms of implementing pro growth policies and needed economic reforms not many people are leaving costa rica it has the lowest emigration rate in central america and one of the lowest in latin america and the caribbean and though the unemployment rate is 9 30 percent and about 20 percent of the population lives in poverty costa ricans stay put part of the reason may be a new anti poverty program introduced by the previous president luis guillermo solis its goal is to pull at least 54 600 targeted families out of poverty the plan combines previous welfare benefits that have been reports the tico times distributed through 30 separate programs administered by 20 different agencies families are to be assessed according to their needs and not a one size fits all formula job training and education scholarships are part of the plan so that poverty doesn t become a life sentence president alvarado 39 and a center leftist has different priorities the major issue in the last election was same sex marriage the former president opposed it while mr alvarado supports it mr alvarado is also a disciple of the climate change movement his goal is to achieve zero net carbon emissions by 2020 how a small country like costa rica or even a larger one like the united states can affect the globe s naturally changing temperatures especially when major polluters like china india and yes the united states aren t doing much to reduce carbon emissions is never addressed for the left intentions count not results crime control and maintaining a vibrant tourist industry seem to be better and more attainable goals than changing the climate and promoting same sex marriage this year marks cal thomas 35th year as a syndicated columnist readers may email cal thomas at tcaeditors tribpub com
almost nobody seems to report the positive side of our recent climate change action it s remarkable what we ve done in two years which gives us much hope that we can indeed rise to the challenge i have never in my life seen such a coming together of nations worldwide to solve a problem three years ago after the slow progress of the kyoto protocol agreement all this would have seemed impossible there is a lot of publicity about what we aren t doing yet but hardly anyone talks about what we have already done that s the key to success to build on what we already have and what we have already done the young particularly are driving action as in greta thunberg who started the movement of school striking children in sweden standing outside the swedish parliament greta thunberg august 2018 as she started her school strike for the climate here is her emotional speech to eu leaders click to watch in youtube longer video here she is speaking at a critical time as part of the paris agreement countries are expected to increase the ambitions year on year the eu is already better than 3 c compatible but not yet 2 c compatible however its ambitions can make it 1 5 c compatible it if goes through on them amongst those listening as you can tell from the questions many are in support of her climate change is likely to play a major role in the next eu elections this may for a summary of how the eu is doing on climate change see the eu page on climate tracker however there is much understandable fear and even hysteria in some responses which doesn t seem to be strongly based on science as an example the extinction rebellion are disrupting services throughout london right now with the aim to get the uk government to commit to zero carbon emissions by 2025 government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 our demands extinction rebellion but where does that figure come from they don t say i ve looked on their website and there is no explanation of it anywhere it isn t in the 2018 ipcc report which says we need to reach that level by 2050 for the 1 5 c goal click to watch in youtube i d like to focus in this article on what the climate scientists themselves say also on what we are already doing and what they say we need to do in the future for instance how many of you know that the eu reduced emissions by 22 from 1994 to 2017 it is on track to meet its 2020 target 20 cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels 20 of eu energy from renewables 20 improvement in energy efficiency progress made in cutting emissions climate action european commission it s long term strategy is zero emissions by 2050 and if it achieves that it makes it 1 5 c compatible in the uk our emissions are now the lowest since 1920 china and india are often criticized because their emissions are still increasing but they start off with much lower emissions per person especially india with only 1 8 tons per capita well below world average of 4 2 tons per capita they are rapidly industrializing yes but they aim to peak emissions well below the european levels and then reduce rapidly to zero india remains on track to overachieve on its 2 c compatible target and 1 5 c is within reach india climate action tracker see also guest post why india s co2 emissions grew strongly in 2017 carbon brief china faces the biggest challenge of all it is expected to meet its commitments which include 20 non fossil fuel by 2030 and to peak emissions before 2030 but it has to increase its commitments for us to have a chance to say within 1 5 c china climate action tracker this is another article i m writing to support people we help in the doomsday debunked group on facebook that find us because they get scared sometimes to the point of considering suicide by such stories you can see this blog post with a table of contents on my website add table of contents to this page on my website blog post on science 2 0 without the toc need for urgent action but measured based on science there s a pervasive idea in our society of an almost impossible situation that we can t do anything about climate change or that nobody is doing anything or that we are headed for a doomsday scenario and it is almost over already none of that is true not remotely so myles allen a lead author for the ipcc report in 2018 spoke out about this in why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric in the conversation today s teenagers are absolutely right to be up in arms about climate change and right that they need powerful images to grab people s attention yet some of the slogans being bandied around are genuinely frightening a colleague recently told me of her 11 year old coming home in tears after being told that because of climate change human civilisation might not survive for her to have children in doomsday debunked we encounter young kids like this all the time scared sometimes to the point of being suicidal that they will not live to adulthood and young adults who feel they shouldn t have children because they have read that they would be bringing them into a future uninhabitable earth a fair few are receiving therapy and drugs to treat ptsd and gad and other anxiety disorders and have panic attacks and vomit in fear many times a day out of fear of an uninhabitable earth as well as other nonsense such as the constant fake nasa asteroid warnings in the sensationalist press the sad thing is that much of what scares them so much is out and out junk science exaggerated stories or these over simplified climate slogans myles allen continues the problem is as soon as scientists speak out against environmental slogans our words are seized upon by a dwindling band of the usual suspects to dismiss the entire issue even when the climate scientists do speak out as they do sometimes their views do not get the publicity a story is far more likely to be shared on social media or run in the mainstream news if it says that all the insects will die civilization end or humans become extinct there is much that does need climate action and our situation is indeed serious in many ways however none of the expert projections of the ipcc and others of a similar high quality are of an uninhabitable earth or a literal collapse of civilization also though many individual species do risk extinction and are going extinct when it comes to ecosystems many are actually becoming more species diverse due to human effects with new habitats and species brought in from other parts of the world the corals are the only complete ecosystem highlighted as at risk of near extinction see below myles allen continues in his why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric using the world meteorological organisation s definition of global average surface temperature and the late 19th century to represent its pre industrial level yes all these definitions matter we just passed 1 c and are warming at more than 0 2 c per decade which would take us to 1 5 c around 2040 that said these are only best estimates we might already be at 1 2 c and warming at 0 25 c per decade well within the range of uncertainty that would indeed get us to 1 5 c by 2030 12 years from 2018 but an additional quarter of a degree of warming more or less what has happened since the 1990s is not going to feel like armageddon to the vast majority of today s striking teenagers the striving taxpayers of 2030 and what will they think then as he says the ipcc projections are the best estimates they are based on review of the academic literature at the highest level but they always have a range of uncertainty he says that it s not impossible that we reach 1 5 c by 2030 that it s within the range of uncertainty but this is not an uninhabitable earth or anything resembling it if we do hit this level the world will feel much as it does today to the majority of the population of the earth the expected time to reach 1 5 c is between 2040 and 2050 but there is enough uncertainty so that 2030 is not impossible he goes on to say that the ipcc does not draw a planetary boundary at 1 5 c beyond which lie climate dragons so please stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030 bad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters but the ipcc does not draw a planetary boundary at 1 5 c beyond which lie climate dragons why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric by myles allen climate slogans journalist exaggerations and out and out junk science how many of you have seen or shared myles allen s post why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric i expect nobody how many of you have seen or shared that study that was on tv saying that we are headed for a world without insects in 40 years did you know that that study had only one data point for the whole of china for the domestic honeybee it s like using sheep in a study on declines of mammals most of the map is blank and the few studies they do include come from a literature search for declin this is what the insect ecologist manu saunders had to say about it the key take home is the amount of white space on this map of available data showing local regional declines most countries have no data n b the single data points in australia china are both managed honey bees not wild insects pic twitter com pnnlz7ygar dr manu saunders manusaunders february 3 2019 those purple bars in australia and china are for the domestic honeybee yet nobody shared the much more thorough study from the un released just a week later which concluded that the situation is mixed some increasing some decreasing and some stable and also went into detail about the many measures being taken to protect insect biodiversity see below or you may heard that humans are going to go extinct in 2026 if so you have probably been duped by one of the arctic news blog posts by sam carana these are often shared on social media with graphs that project a sudden increase of temperature by many degrees in the next few years readers are impressed by his about page which lists a host of distinguished professors who he thanks for contributing however that is because he credits as contributors every professor whose video he embeds under the youtube embedding license most of them probably don t even know that he has done this as the license doesn t require him to ask permission he uses a quadratic or other polynomials to extrapolate you may see the absurdity if i extend his graph both ways in the blue inset below such a graph always decreases from an infinite temperature in the past and increases to an infinite temperature in the future that s just what quadratics do unless they decrease to minus infinity both ways see below or what about guy mcpherson s blog posts and videos many are impressed by him because he used to be a professor but sometimes professors lose their way and fall into junk science too he uses sam carana s absurd polynomial extrapolations as a source nuf said or you may have heard of jem bendell s deep adaptation the paper that is driving people to therapy it failed peer review not for the views expressed but because it didn t meet academic standards see below or uninhabitable earth the sensationalist book by the generalist journalist david wallace wells who has only been interested in climate science for two years see below or the often repeated journalistic claim that the ipcc report said that the only way to stop global warming is a tax leading to 240 a gallon for fuel see below or the claim of a runaway feedback from a methane bomb see below or from the siberian permafrost see below that our agricultural land is going to run out of topsoil in 40 years see below that nearly all species will go extinct this century see below or that the amazon jungle will soon burn down and be gone see below or the 1972 supercomputer that predicted an end of civilization in 2040 see below or adam frank s model that supposedly showed our civilization will end in one of three horrible ways see below or perhaps you have heard that we are going to run out of oxygen to breathe see below or that we risk a cascade of tipping points leading to a hothouse earth see below i expect almost everyone with an interest in the topic has come across most of those stories and more you may be surprised to learn how much of that is based on misunderstandings exaggerations sensationalism climate slogans and junk science if only the journalists and bloggers would heed his warning some probably do however it would take some major change or initiative for all journalists to stop doing the click bait titles for as long as some do those are the ones that will be shared and rise in google results it would also take some major change for the bloggers junk science to no longer be shared widely in social media perhaps social media initiatives to flag fake news may help but so far nothing seems to be done about them meanwhile the bloggers have freedom of speech they are not doing anything illegal by publishing nonsense even if they know that what they say is false it is hard to know what to do when faced with what seems an onslaught of fake and exaggerated climate change news most weeks nowadays we get a virally shared fake or exaggerated climate catastrophism or climate slogan story on social media and sometimes in the mainstream news or on mainstream tv too i do have a petition to google news and other news aggregates asking them to stop promoting fake and junk science news stories and to journalists to be more responsible in their reporting which you may want to sign and share and any suggestions do say in the comments what can you do tell the truth meanwhile the main thing one can do is to tell the truth as clearly and succinctly as one can if you are a blogger or journalist please do the same and anyone please do more sharing of the posts that present the true situation and less sharing of the junk science try checking a climate change story against reliable sources first our doomsday debunked group may help you as we now have a fair few members with a decent scientific understanding of climate change also if you are a climate scientist or expert you may like to consider joining our group and giving a bit of your time to help the scared people who constantly panic about climate change and other doomsday scenarios anyway i d like to focus in this article on what the climate scientists themselves say rather than the climate action slogans also i will cover what we are already doing and what they say we need to do in the future key to the paris agreement countries set policies they know they can achieve at each stage and constantly step up their ambitions as far as i can see the demands of the extinction rebellion are not based on any report by climate scientists by pushing for nearly impossible demands they risk a future where we commit to things that we can t achieve instead of committing to things that are possible the thing that has made the paris agreement such a success is that nations are able to set policies they know they can achieve at every stage and then increase their pledges year on year as they gain experience and develop new industries to make it all possible i think we need to continue in the same spirit be ambitious but make sure our goals can be achieved when we commit to them the uk government s plan is to reduce emissions by 80 in 2050 that s not enough yet but if it steps up in its pledge to a 100 reduction it would then be 1 5 c compatible to save the corals uk steps towards zero carbon economy this is something we can pressurize them to do and then to be even more ambitious once they do that according to the ipcc report in 2018 we lose 99 of the corals after just a decade or so at 2 c and the reefs probably do not recover if we don t go much above 1 5 c then 10 30 of them remain and they can recover though this may take a long time they can recover because they can adapt to warmer temperatures as well as migrate and set up reefs in places that used to be too cold for them but at 2 c the warming is too rapid for this to work so well they do caution that these projections are not certain and that it s possible that corals are more resistant than this or that we can do things to help them adapt see box 3 4 page 230 of their chapter 3 they found that no other major ecosystem on earth is so sensitive either in the sea or on land the corals are the only entire ecosystem we risk losing at 2 c humans for sure are not at any risk of extinction under any of the scenarios there is a risk of severe impacts on other ecosystems however in this map the regions marked in red risk severe impact at 2 c and the dark red regions at 1 5 c figure 3 16 of chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 the coloured regions highlight risks of sever impact the gray scale regions correspond to moderate impacts at those various temperatures this doesn t mean that the ecosystems vanish rather they change to other ecosystems for instance the melting permafrost will lead to a radically different ecosystem in northern canada alaska and siberia in a 2 c warmer world but this warmer world would be more habitable for humans in the far north with far more vegetation and letting us grow crops using conventional agriculture that never could grow there before the pace of the change is the main issue it is important to stay within 1 5 c for these and many other reasons however our future is a habitable world for humans in all the scenarios indeed it has been greening as a result of the co 2 fertilization effect so far rising co 2 has greened world s plants and trees carbon brief this should continue through to 2050 at least with increasing crop yields and faster growing trees see below it s the transition and the speed of transition that matters far more than the end state even at an increase of 12 c then the world is still very habitable for humans as we ll see what s more we have already averted a possible ice age 20 000 years from now and are headed to a future where there won t be any ice ages for hundreds of thousands of years that is good because interglacials are far more stable than ice ages when there are often wild swings in temperature the ipcc do project tens or hundreds of millions of climate refugees and other serious effects at 2 c of warning at that temperature point we may get population densities quadrupling in some places in the sub tropics due to the migrants from the tropics that is a serious societal impact in anyone s books however there is nothing in the report about collapse of society or an end of civilization those predictions are all embellishment by journalists which sadly are often just believed as is by their readers especially young children here is what they say about climate migrants in chapter 3 displacement at 2 c of warming there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics tropical populations may have to move distances greater than 1000 km if global mean temperature rises by 2 c from 2011 2030 to the end of the century a disproportionately rapid evacuation from the tropics could lead to a concentration of population in tropical margins and the subtropics where population densities could increase by 300 or more page 245 3 4 10 2 the changing structure of communities migration displacement and conflict from chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 this summary table shows the numbers affected at various temperature increases we are currently headed for 3 c the last column figure 3 4 page 246 of chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 habitat degradation and crop yield change are particularly vulnerable to the difference from 1 5 c to 2 c our achievements in just two years the situation is undoubtedly serious however it is remarkable what we have achieved and are achieving and can do in the future especially when you look back to before the paris agreement in 2016 back then admittedly things were dire the earlier kyoto protocol agreement based on carbon trading was a flop leading to only modest commitments but then we had this truly major breakthrough what you need to know is that the paris agreement only came into place in 2016 they agreed the rulebook for the first time in december 2018 an essential step before implementing it properly when the us decided to leave this made only a small dent indeed trump may well have galvanized the other countries into more action as well as many cities companies states and individuals in the us itself in two years worldwide we have already implemented policies to knock an entire degree off the temperature projected for 2100 from around 4 c to around 3 c this shows what we can do if we work together if we keep up this momentum for the next decade who knows what we can achieve might we not be able to knock another 1 5 c off the projection for 2100 with our actions in the next twelve years after all the whole idea of the agreement is that pledges increase year on year it is important to keep up the momentum however the ipcc made it clear in their report that 1 5 c is scientifically possible is affordable and is achievable the main thing required is the political will to do it you so often hear that politicians are not doing anything this also is not true some countries already target below 2 c the most populous of those is india with a population of 1 339 billion not far off that of china it is not far from achieving a 1 5 c compatible target according to climate action tracker populations of india china and the world showing how india s population is not far off that of china now using world data via google that is a substantial chunk of the world population that is already well on its way to 1 5 c many of the smaller countries are doing even better and are already below 1 5 c compatible for more on this see below the journalists just about always hopelessly exaggerate the ipcc reports and add numerous embellishments even the mainstream news such as the new york times have their share of exaggerations and misinformation a good example here is the mistake the new york times made about carbon pricing they confused the future mitigation costs of sea wall defences of climate migrants etc with the incentive tax to prevent emissions of that co 2 as part of an integrated program the mitigation costs could rise to 27 000 a ton by 2100 but the aim of a carbon pricing incentive tax is to prevent us getting into this situation at all this is estimated at various values of 5 upwards as part of a mixed program of many measures if this succeeds then of course we never have to pay the mitigation costs they weren t the only ones to make this mistake the hill also ran a story based on this claiming that the ipcc was saying that gas petrol would cost 240 a gallon this is such a major misunderstanding the passage they got the figure from is crystal clear if you are used to reading scientific papers it s hard to know how the confusion arose but this is just one of many confusions in even the mainstream press instead of going by what the co chairs said the journalists went through the report misread a few passages and riffed on their misunderstandings without running them past anyone another major misunderstanding was the claim that the ipcc pathways required vast amounts of co 2 sequestration using technology we don t have yet far from it the pathway to zero emissions by 2050 only had a practical amount of reafforestation as a carbon negative measure to offset a small part of the emissions the ny times title was also click bait major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040 that possible crisis was for coral reefs as early as 2040 not for humanity also the central message of the report was that this can be averted with policies to stay within 1 5 c and that this is scientifically possible affordable and just needs the political will that is the positive side of the report which was not highlighted in headlines and barely mentioned in the articles either try watching the videos by the co chairs and the press conference for the ipcc report in 2018 watch the original press conferences and compare with the new york times report and others in the mainstream press at the time and you wonder if they went to the same event expect co 2 levels and even year on year emissions to continue to rise for a while on all scenarios climate activists often make a big deal of this giving the impression that our climate policies can t be working for as long as we have increasing emissions yes our yearly co 2 emissions are still rising but that s not surprising all the scenarios project a rise for at least a few more years even the ones with 1 5 c targets our current policies and unconditional pledges will lead to reduced emissions year on year within a few years also long after our yearly emissions have declined we should expect co 2 levels in the atmosphere to keep increasing it is only when the emissions reach zero that our co 2 levels and temperature stabilizes which even with the 1 5 c compatible paths doesn t happen until the mid century with current policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c with a 2 3 chance of staying within 3 2 c see summary graphic that s just a start we are bound to get to lower targets than that as they ramp up the pledges the bloggers and journalists who share graphs and say look we haven t achieved anything yet are looking at them with the wrong kind of analysis this is not a reason to be disheartened what is it we have to do by 2030 many of the journalists reported that we have a decade to avoid disaster and the more sensationalist accounts say that we risk human extinction within a decade that s not what the ipcc said it was widely misreported and i think the journalists have a lot of the responsibility for the current hysteria due to the way they mislead the public by not summarizing what they said accurately the report actually said that the best way to 1 5 c is to reduce co 2 emissions by 45 by 2030 so we have twelve years to reduce emissions by 45 nothing much will happen in 2030 but unless we are already down to a 45 reduction by then it will become increasingly harder to remain within 1 5 c by the middle of the century after that we reduce to zero by 2050 however if we don t start those reductions until 2030 we can still stay within 1 5 c but we have to reduce much more rapidly after that and reach 0 c by 2045 five years earlier that s for the 1 5 c pathway if we want to stay within 2 c then it s much easier for that pathway we need to reduce 20 by 2030 and reach net zero by 2075 also reaching zero emissions by 2050 or 2045 was only one of four ways to stay within 1 5 c we can also overshoot a little not all the way to 2 c and then use negative emissions to get back again for instance global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 1 figure 1 4 even if we don t manage that and the temperature briefly reaches 2 c it is possible to get back down to 1 5 c if we remove co 2 for the rest of the century to compensate this shows conceptually the idea of the two approaches the best approach is the one to the right this is a good summary of some of the main points in the agreement have done so much already and this is hardly utopian as a vision we have done so much already this graph gives an idea of what we have done already our current policies are already well below the no climate policies orange region remember most of this has been achieved in only two years we have another ten years to get onto the 1 5 c track first we need to stop our current increase in co 2 emissions year on year then we need to do the 45 reduction which is the start of the easier p1 pathway we can definitely do it that was the conclusion of the ipcc report it s a matter of politics not science whether we do this of course the us plan to withdraw but they are not the largest emitter china is and they are the most important of all to reduce quickly they are responsible for half of the extra emissions that caused emissions to rise again in 2017 after plateauing for a couple of years there the bars show the increases or decreases as you can see half the increase from 2016 to 2017 is from china graph from here as we ll see they are fulfilling their pledges under the paris agreement which is not to stop increasing yet they only committed to peak some time before 2030 but that much is really ambitious for a rapidly industrializing country and they seem on track to do it we need more ambitious pledges from them to stay within 1 5 c but they have fulfilled their pledges so far they have a strong incentive as they are amongst the most affected with business as usual then parts of china would get so hot that farmers can t work in their rice fields any more during heat waves and coastal cities are vulnerable to flooding so they are very motivated to do something about it also as major contributors to the carbon emissions they are also in a position to be able to make a big impact on climate change just by themselves see this graph graphs from co₂ and other greenhouse gas emissions within the us too then there is strong support for the paris agreement in many sectors the united states climate alliance accounts for 16 states as well as the territory of puerto rico committed to upholding the paris agreement within their borders amongst those sixteen california if they were a separate country would be the fifth largest economy in the entire world cal facts 2002 economy major cities around the world have committed to build only zero carbon buildings by 2030 and to make existing buildings zero carbon by 2050 in the us that includes new york city and san francisco new york which has 60 of the california economy and the us may well return to the paris agreement in the future at some point before 2030 trump could change his mind and the next president in 2022 or 2026 may well return to it especially with increasingly clear symptoms of climate change and its effects in the us that is time enough for the us government to join in reducing emissions to zero by 2050 and remember most of this has happened in the last two years so how much can we achieve in the next ten years what about david attenborough saying we risk societal collapse you can watch it here attenborough presents climate change the facts it may sound frightening but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies we are running out of time but there is still hope i believe that if we better understand the threat we face the more likely it is that we can avoid such a catastrophic future attenborough climate show a call to arms this is another example of climate change slogans strictly speaking it is not literally true the ipcc report did not say we have to take dramatic action in the next decade they said that immediate action is the easiest way ahead scientifically feasible and affordable and that there are increasingly more dramatic measures needed if we postpone action the ipcc report also says nothing about societal collapse at least not large scale collapse david attenborough s program focuses on local communities severely impacted by climate change such as the climate migrants impacted by flooding and those whose houses burnt down in the california fires in that sense it is a collapse of local communities which will become much more widespread in a warming world that may be what he meant on a larger scale though we have a lot of climate change resilience there is also much work being done on increasing that for more on the research into climate change resilience see below dealing with some popular misconceptions right away before getting to more details about climate change i d like to debunk some of the popular misconceptions there are many stories you may have read and believed that are just false here is a youtube video of some young women who are so scared that they feel they can t bring a child into the world and as i said in the intro much of what scares the general public is false or junk science click to watch in youtube i will start with one of the most widely shared a junk sociology paper that failed peer review that climate scientists say is just crap but is widely believed by the general public jem bendell s deep adaptation many have been scared by jem bendell s deep adaptation he is a sociologist who relies extensively on wasdell s never published non peer reviewed article this in turn depends on the now disproved clathrate gun hypothesis this is the article that is supposedly so depressing it s driving its readers to therapy i can well believe that this happens from the panicked and scared pm s i get but the article itself is grounded in junk science that it makes people depressed doesn t mean it is correct the distinguished climate scientist michael mann director of the earth system science center at pennsylvania state university had only one word in comment just four letters crap see the other responses to his tweet too his tweet is here later in the conversation he amends this to hogwash tweet here sorry hogwash michael e mann michaelemann march 6 2019 i cover this in detail in my article uninhabitable earth others have been scared by this article and then book by david wallace wells he doesn t write like a scientist he says himself that he is a general journalist who has only been interested in climate change for one to two years his book is just a scrap book of the scariest stories he has found not a systematic survey he misunderstands things exaggerates and misses important nuances in the stories he covers the evidence that climate change is a serious problem that we must contend with now is overwhelming on its own there is no need to overstate the evidence particularly when it feeds a paralyzing narrative of doom and hopelessness i m afraid this latest article does that that s too bad the journalist is clearly a talented one and this is somewhat of a lost opportunity to objectively inform the discourse over human caused climate change michael e mann for more about this see my aren t humans going to go extinct in 2026 or 2030 these are fake news stories one of the worst of the junk blogs is sam carana and his arctic news blog he uses quadratic equations and other polynomials to project an utterly bizarre idea to a mathematician this image may be enough for you to see how ridiculous his posts are in the blue inset i have extrapolated his quadratic or one very close to it both ways so you can see how it will always predict an increase to infinity in the future and decrease from infinity from the past unless it s the other way around increase from absolute zero and decrease to absolute zero it is a ridiculous way to extrapolate another one here from how long do we have to back up his nonsense he does stuff like this there is no basis for it it s all make believe in his diagram on that page he says that between 2025 and 2026 there will be a sudden 8 c increase in temperature due to cloud feedback that s not based on any science just that he needed some gobbledygook to put in his graph to add a sudden 8 c because that s what his polynomial does presumably it s meant to be about the cloudless skies study which is based on co2 levels of 1400 to 2200 ppm a level we can t reach until the 22nd century even with business as usual it is not even remotely relevant to the conditions we are in right now in see below if we instantly stopped anthropogenic emissions then it would lead perhaps to a bump by 0 15 c for 20 years see below the methane bomb is disproved see below and the siberian permafrost effect is minute for this century on the path we are on see below this blog sadly impresses readers because the credentials of the contributors on his deceptive about page seem impressive it goes on and on 33 contributors professors and emeritus professors however click through to the linked names on his about page and you realize he will credit as a contributor any of the people talking in embedded youtube videos in any of his blog posts he surely hasn t asked permission of any of them and there would be no reason for them to even know that the video is on his blog he just includes this material under the youtube license for embedding content others are included because he quotes a short paragraph from them or includes an article they released under a creative commons license sadly many people do believe his blog at least partly because they believe the about page and think he must have something going for him to attract posts from so many distinguished professors just nonsense the other junk scientist who scares many people is guy mcpherson a retired professor of ecology who has lost contact with the scientific method you can tell how far he has gone in the direction of junk science when you discover he uses sam carana s blog with its daft polynomial projections as a source for his own predictions guy mcpherson keeps saying the average temperature of earth is going to increase rapidly by several degrees in a few months none of it ever happens because it is based on junk science like this see my absurd blog post at arctic news predicting a ridiculous 10 c rise in global temperatures by 2026 using a polynomial to extrapolate you are not at risk of extinction in any of the climate scenarios the worst that happens is that the world gets so hot perhaps you start to grow coconuts in the mediterranean and oranges in the uk not that you have coconuts growing in canada or that humans can t survive at all didn t a 1972 computer model say we would soon be extinct by 2040 limits to growth this is a computer program that simulated the world as five numbers for everything in 1972 it needed a computer that filled a room today it would run in a fraction of a second on your mobile phone it is just a coincidence it predicted the number of children would stop going up because we could no longer find the resources needed to bring up children any more by now but it s the opposite the number of children is almost the same as it was a decade ago that s true however it is because we have food and other resources for our children and have good medicine to prevent children dying and as a result people are having fewer children worldwide it is in a background of greatly increasing life expectancy ten to 20 years in the last 50 years see here is a graph from that page the countries with decreasing populations are places like japan which have a the highest standards of living japan population 1950 2018 data chart calendar forecast news all this is the opposite of what their model predicted fewer children because of poverty and not being able to bring them up and a situation of scarcity and hardship and short lives it is just a coincidence we should use the un population division and other modern well tested and thoroughly researched projections and modern computers and programs not this ancient 1972 program that uses only 5 numbers to represent the entire world my article about it is here debunked no we are not on track for end of world by 1972 computer model this is another similar one from appendix d they have a parameter w for wellbeing and they assume that as the well being of a population increases the population growth rate increases becoming superexponential that would seem sensible from studies of animal populations but humans don t do this as our well being increases our population has leveled out the opposite of what their model suggests we have already almost reached peak child we are living a lot longer and our birth rate has gone right down to less than replacement in some of the wealthiest countries such as japan which already has a declining population the only major region of our world which still has a high birthrate is the least prosperous africa as it becomes more prosperous with better health care higher education particularly of women and reduce child mortality its birthrate is expected to fall down to around 2 children per family as parents become more confident that their children can survive to adulthood and be healthy the population is expected to level off also our final world population depends a lot on how rapidly africa develops towards these conditions of higher education reduced child mortality better health etc when will the world reach peak child a sociology author has used this simple model which doesn t match what is happening to us to predict that society would collapse on the science he says to find out more to read david waltham s book which is awful my debunk of it is here quoting from his article the continued growth for much of this period as well as the very slowly decline in the latter part is mostly due to the increasing birth rate only after a few decades when the world is approaching global societal collapse does the death rate overtake the increasing birth rate in the present situation famines tend to be very local problems as much of the planet can import food in case local production is insufficient but this won t be the case in a world in which food shortages are no longer local but worldwide and in which global trade is breaking down on the fragility of civilization but the fundamental premise there is flawed there isn t an increasing birthrate it is decreasing rapidly worldwide what about adam frank s model predicting our civilization will end in one of three horrible ways this is a first paper in what they hope to be a long term study it s an interesting project but it should not be used to predict what will happen to earth in the future their research is at far too early a stage to be relevant to any of that it makes many simplifying assumptions that do not apply to earth as it is now but their aim wasn t to predict what would happen to earth it was to try to get a general picture of what can happen to all possible exoplanet civilizations a huge project that they are just making a start on first let s look at some of its simplifying assumptions none of which apply to our earth no surprise one of its assumptions is that populations grow to carrying capacity via the logistic equation as we ve seen the population is going to level off due to prosperity instead having plenty of resources is leading to a reduction rather than an increase of population paradoxically we reached close to peak child a decade or so ago and the population is now growing mainly because people are living longer with each year as we ve seen the population is going to level off due to prosperity instead having plenty of resources is leading to a reduction rather than an increase of population paradoxically we reached close to peak child a decade or so ago and the population is now growing mainly because people are living longer with each year they do however assume that renewables can sustain the same population as the non green power supply e g fossil fuels that does apply to earth however arguably long term the potential power supply from renewables is vaster than from fossil fuels a small fraction of the sahara desert can provide enough solar power to power the entire world at its current levels some people object to this idea based on energy return on energy invested eroei well solar power has proved to be superb as have some other renewables that does apply to earth however arguably long term the potential power supply from renewables is vaster than from fossil fuels a small fraction of the sahara desert can provide enough solar power to power the entire world at its current levels some people object to this idea based on energy return on energy invested eroei well solar power has proved to be superb as have some other renewables it also assumes that the non renewable power source can make the planet uninhabitable in a runaway effect through a heating term perhaps this is inspired by james hansen s venus hothouse idea if so it is disproved see below no amount of degradation of earth s environment would make earth uninhabitable for humans indeed it is becoming more habitable if anything as we ll see it s the transition that s the problem but i in their model they assume infinite reserves of the non renewable environment damaging resource this might seem strange but it is a common simplification if you don t want to have to deal with the complexities of a finite item of fixed size just assume it is infinite and leave the complication of a finite resource to a later study of course if there were infinite reserves of oil or coal eventually as you burn enough then you would get a runaway greenhouse for sure if extra terrestrials have more fossil fuel than us or a more sensitive environment it might apply to them so what is actually going to happen to earth as we are now we are on target to feed everyone by 2100 using conventional agriculture with the population predicted to level off at 11 billion according to the un population division there are challenges but it is well within our capability with higher standards of living and better medical care most families are content to have two children once you take account of the childless and single that leads to populations that drop below replacement through social changes in a situation of resource abundance rather than resource scarcity japan already have a rapidly declining population we can feed everyone too according to experts so long as we continue with the measures we are doing already such as starting a new green revolution in africa that got missed out in the 50s through to 70s it s not going to happen automatically but we can do it with food security and we can do it while ramping up power levels too and bringing everyone up to the quality of life we enjoy in the more developed countries this is not pie in the sky it is the view of leading scientists and hard nosed politicians as we ll see as i get into the details according to the un population division there are challenges but it is well within our capability with higher standards of living and better medical care most families are content to have two children once you take account of the childless and single that leads to populations that drop below replacement through social changes in a situation of resource abundance rather than resource scarcity japan already have a rapidly declining population we can feed everyone too according to experts so long as we continue with the measures we are doing

while ramping up power levels too and bringing everyone up to the quality of life we enjoy in the more developed countries this is not pie in the sky it is the view of leading scientists and hard nosed politicians as we ll see as i get into the details we can ramp up power as well while keeping everything headed towards a carbon neutral eventual future that is not pie in the sky it is feasible it s what the paris agreement is all about and hard nosed politicians have signed up for it in every country worldwide except the us which also was signed up for it before the current president withdrew actually technically the us is still in it to the end of his current term so yes we can have a decent standard of living for everyone too what could happen even longer term the carrying capacity of earth is rather soft using the technology proposed for space habitats we could have the equivalent of the population of four new planets from floating sea cities covering just 0 5 of the pacific growing all their food and getting all their water just using sea water and the air and not exploiting anything else we could do that for far less technology per person than a space colony growing all their food and getting all their water just using sea water and the air and not exploiting anything else we could do that for far less technology per person than a space colony we also have the possibility of vast amounts of power in the future either from nuclear fusion if we manage to develop it by then and it is easy to use or space based solar power which japan is exploring or maybe some other power source including possibly ideas we haven t thought of yet it could increase by orders of magnitude they never claimed any direct relevance to earth and expect future studies to be more detailed exploring the range of futures for extra terrestrial civilizations as they do so perhaps they may find trajectories resembling the one we ourselves are on but at present it is just too simple a model to apply to earth for more on this see my what about cascades of tipping points leading to a hothouse earth the article is mainly about things that could happen centuries to thousands of years into the future it doesn t really conflict with the ipcc who have already concluded that these tipping points may have significant but probably minor effects before 2100 because it is a meta study and it is just looking at ideas for future research there are no dates in it and there is no new fundamental research the press release didn t give timescales and many of the news stories just riffed off the press release and the authors don t read the paper itself when you read the paper they still don t give timescales but it becomes clear that for most of this they are talking about things that could happen over centuries to millennia they are not conflicting with the ipcc which does climate projections mainly through to 2100 it is more that they are looking at a much longer future timescale also they don t have any proof and no new data or research it s more like a meta study a result of looking at many other papers and then drawing up a hypothesis for other scientists to study as they say in their conclusion our initial analysis here needs to be underpinned by more in depth quantitative earth system analysis and modeling studies to address three critical questions i is humanity at risk for pushing the system across a planetary threshold and irreversibly down a hothouse earth pathway ii what other pathways might be possible in the complex stability landscape of the earth system and what risks might they entail iii what planetary stewardship strategies are required to maintain the earth system in a manageable stabilized earth state indeed there is not a single future date in the article it is all qualitative the diagrams in it are just sketches with an arrow indicating time but no markers along the time axis of centuries or millennia it isn t really adding anything new over the previous studies it is more of a meta study this is one of their diagrams they are saying there are things we can do in the next couple of decades that can get the earth into a good state one in which it will neither get too hot nor too cold for hundreds of thousands of years they call this earth system stewardship we are currently in that stabilized earth region of the chart if we stay well within 2 c which is the ideal target of the paris agreement to stay within 1 5 c then we are good for hundreds of thousands of years into the future to have a stable temperature without the huge fluctuations of the ice ages however they say we are at a kind of decision point where the things we do for the next several decades could tip us into the hothouse earth cycle that then could lead to earth getting a lot hotter centuries to more like thousands of years into the future other scientists are skeptical of this report it is not proved and there are no actual future dates in the article it is all qualitative about things that might happen mostly centuries to millennia into the future it has good news however if we do manage to avoid the higher business as usual which we are already doing we have also avoided the next ice age too and we are headed for the optimal stabilized earth so this is good news for future generations so long as we manage to avoid excessive temperature rises we can avoid the hothouse earth and even thousands of years into the future our climate will be stable see my also see later in this page next ice age postponed aren t we all going to run out of oxygen to breathe in a warmer world no not true at all there is plenty of oxygen in the atmosphere for many thousands of years and so there is nothing to worry about of that nature it s not only us that will be fine there is enough oxygen there for all the animals in the world to breathe for the foreseeable future even if impossibly photosynthesis ceased completely world wide this is also taking account of all the natural processes that remove it we are fine for oxygen for thousands of years no matter what happens are we headed for a world without insects are we headed for a world without insects this featured as main story on the tv with a claim that we risked all insects vanishing in 40 years but this is not true at all it is a case of low quality research with a dramatic and scary conclusion being promoted through the roof by the press and high quality research with the opposite conclusion quietly ignored or not even noticed this research was immediately criticized by ecologists it was a not a systematic survey for one the researchers just did a search for articles with declin in the title so of course they mainly found articles about declining populations they also found very few studies outside of europe and the us for the whole of china and for australia the only articles they found were about honey bees a domesticated insect this is like including reports of declining numbers of sheep in an article on declining numbers of mammals most of their world map was a complete blank those purple bars in australia and china are for the domestic honeybee there were some points in it of interest to academic readers who knew how to evaluate its limitations but it should never have got so much publicity a week or so later the un biodiversity in agriculture report came out their section on insects was systematic and thorough based on sent in reports by experts in many countries reporting to the un found a mixed picture some stable some with mixed trends some countries reported increases of pollinators such as nepal and also parts of europe due to a policy encouraging flower rich field margins they reported that the german study which found decreased insect numbers in nature reserves had lead to a new organization to do something about it it is probably due to insecticides and agricultural practices reducing field margins so there is much one can do the only habitats they identified with a significant decreasing trend in insects worldwide were for pastures grazed by livestock we can pollinate the few crops that need pollination using domesticated insects such as honey bees and the tropical stingless bees but wild insects add to the diversity and increase crop yields they reported on many projects to help improve pollinator diversity more on this later see below do we risk a runaway to a venus hothouse don t we risk making the world as uninhabitable as venus by triggering a runaway greenhouse effect by burning all the fossil fuels this is not true it was a theory due to james hansen who though he is a climate scientist has a reputation of exaggerated statements about climate change he published this idea without any calculations to back it up in a popular book with no peer review he did not cite any published work on the subject in is book stephen hawking also believed this and promoted it in an interview with the bbc it was soon disproved as soon as the theorists set to work to run the calculations carefully to do that we would have to burn ten times the total reserves of oil gas and coal in the world more on this later see below what about the methane bomb clathrate gun others will tell you that the methane below the ocean floor in the arctic will cause a rapid temperature increase of several degrees there were scientists skeptical of this from the beginning and it is now effectively disproved the methane has been leaking for millions of years since before there was ice in the arctic the warming temperatures only affect the top 1 6 meters which are indeed very slowly destabilizing in summer months only and they are not able to contribute significantly to global warming more on this later see below melting of polar ice others say that when we have an ice free summer in the arctic this will lead to rapid melting of all the ice at the poles no that is not true the sun is always low near the horizon in the arctic region and it is dark for half the year sun never rises at all the extra albedo from ice melting there has a feedback effect locally leading to more ice melt in summer than otherwise but not globally also this is sea ice floating on the sea and it melting makes no difference to sea levels worldwide this is taken account of in the models used by climate change and is a minor effect siberian and canadian permafrost nor can the siberian permafrost melting do this if the temperature goes up a bit they start destabilizing and add to the co 2 long term but they can t warm up the climate enough to significantly increase their own effects i it s a result of something else us warming the climate then a bit extra added not a runaway and it can go both ways on the 3 c pathway we are on now it could be a carbon sink through peat and vegetation growing we can also encourage vegetation to help make it more carbon negative by irrigation on our present pathway the range of co 2 emissions is enough for something between a temperature rise by a small fraction of a degree by 2200 and a temperature drop by the same amount most of it after 2100 both less than a tenth of a degree total more on this later see below no known runaway effects the sensationalist press make a lot of this that there are some effects that are not included in the models such as the arctic permafrost what they ignore is the reasoning that gives justification for leaving them out in a systematic review by the royal society they concluded that there are no known runaway effects nothing that acts like a gun or bomb yes if we warm the climate and that can lead to some additional warming over long timescales but nothing that exhibits threshold behaviour i go into all of these in more detail with cites in the section delayed effects below the ipcc say that whenever we stop co 2 emissions if we ramp down all the way to carbon neutral then whatever temperatures we reached by the those are the temperatures we are at from then on apart from a tiny fraction of a degree there may be some temperature rise baked in as a result of the masking effect of so2 aerosols from coal burning and the like which cool the planet down slightly but if so it s only a fraction of a degree around 0 15 c and if we stop the co 2 and remove the black soot which has a warming effect at the same time as we reduce the so2 we can prevent even that global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 1 figure 1 5 if we stop all aerosol emissions yellow line there is a short term bump in temperature by 0 15 degrees and returning to the previous temperatures in 20 years and ending with a reduction to 0 25 c below the present by 2100 temperatures go down slowly as soon as we reach carbon neutral depending how you define carbon neutral if you define carbon neutral as continuing to produce enough co 2 to exactly match the natural negative emissions from all co 2 sinks including the sea then temperatures stay more or less level rising slightly the blue line if it means a net zero anthropogenic emissions they go down because the excess co 2 in the atmosphere is gradually removed over time by natural processes with the yellow and purple lines current policies a little over 3 c according to climate action tracker our current policies keep us within 3 3 c while the unconditional pledges and targets keep us within 3 0 c with a 66 or greater chance of remaining within 3 2 c this is their summary graphic in the absence of policies global warming is expected to reach 4 1 c 4 8 c above pre industrial by the end of the century current policies presently in place around the world are projected to result in about 3 3 c warming above pre industrial levels the unconditional pledges and targets that governments have made including ndcs 2 as of december 2018 would limit warming to about 3 0 c above pre industrial levels or in probabilistic terms likely 66 or greater chance limit warming below 3 2 c temperatures climate action tracker as soon as we stop emissions that s it as far as temperature increases go but the temperature reached whatever it is persists for centuries from the ipcc here yes there are some lingering minor effects such as the siberian permafrost or removal of masking effect of anthropogenic emissions the climate doomsdayers make a lot of those minor effects and claim they are major but there is no basis for that as we ll see the ipcc report is not rewritten by governments this is something that is often said to discredit the ipcc but it is not true at all it arises from a confusion over the review process for the summary for policy makers this is indeed scrutinized line by line by the governments worldwide as a final stage but only to ensure that the report has been summarized accurately for the general public they do not rewrite the report itself this is done at the end after the report has been finished by the scientists there are three stages first the experts review the entire report then experts together with the governments and the final stage focuses only on the overview chapter the governments are involved to make sure that the overview chapter is is accurate well balanced and presents the findings of the underlying report clearly it is most helpful for non scientists anyway and won t make much difference to those interested in the background science who will probably focus on the main report it does also give you an index into the rest of the report helping you to find relevant material they give the chapter headings and sections in the overview so you can then go to the sections written by the scientists in the original report to check what it is they are summarizing the ipcc do not do any research themselves rather they are a review body that looks over the climate change literature of the last several years and scrutinize it carefully assessing things not just by the number of studies but their scientific merit and the amount of certainty in their conclusions they are widely respected by the climate scientists yes we can stay within 1 5 c in the 2018 report the ipcc said in their review that we can stay within 1 5 c if we act right away they were clear about this in both the report itself and the speeches made by the co chairs in the extended press conference we need to increase the pledges for the paris agreement considerably by 2030 but we can do it there is a mechanism in place to increase pledges every year so this is certainly possible if there is the political will the graph that came with the report shows this 1 5 c pathway it reaches 1 5 c at 2040 and then levels off graph here this was hugely misrepresented in the press even in the mainstream press co 2 pricing misunderstanding in the new york times i ve already touched on the new york times report which said that we need carbon pricing at 27 000 per ton by 2100 confusing mitigation costs with incentive pricing this is what they said for instance the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions perhaps as high as 27 000 per ton by 2100 would be required major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040 this has been taken up by many other media outlets and blogs in support of climate catastrophism and the idea that it is hopeless or that the measures are politically impossible to implement however this is completely mistaken the section they got that number from says in its intro the price of carbon assessed here is fundamentally different from the concepts of optimal carbon price in a cost benefit analysis or the social cost of carbon 2 5 2 1 price of carbon emissions from global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 2 page 152 in the rest of the intro they explain that what they are referring to here is the cost of mitigating the effects of that extra ton of co 2 to unpack this a bit more then for instance if our co 2 emissions lead to a sea level rise that 27 000 would include a contribution to the cost of all the sea barriers to contain the rising sea through to 2100 it is a completely different idea from the pricing you need to use as an incentive to stop emitting the co 2 which is only one of many measures you might use in a combined program some countries use carbon pricing others don t later in that very same section from the ipcc that the ny times misquoted they talk about an incentive price and they make various suggestions mostly in the range of 5 to 50 or so depending on whether it is used on its own or as part of a larger program of measures taking the us electrical sector as an example they say furthermore a mix of stringent energy efficiency policies e g minimum performance standards building codes combined with a carbon tax rising from 10 per ton in 2020 to 27 per ton in 2040 is more cost effective than a carbon tax alone from 20 to 53 per ton to generate a 1 5 c pathway for the u s electric sector likewise a policy mix encompassing a moderate carbon price 7 per ton in 2015 combined with a ban on new coal based power plants and dedicated policies addressing renewable electricity generation capacity and electric vehicles reduces efficiency losses compared with an optimal carbon pricing in 2030 2 5 2 1 price of carbon emissions from global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 2 page 153 to make it more readable i removed cites and rewrote usd2010 to and tco 2 t ¹ to per ton the ny times journalist just cherry picked one paragraph with that high number in it without understanding its context at all yet this has been taken up by so many other blogs and articles search google and this is the top result a search snippet highlighted by google s algorithm the hill reports it the same way as the nytimes the ipcc claims in its latest report that action must be taken to avert global warming of 1 5 degrees celsius by the end of the century a benchmark it says comes with costly climate consequences its recommendation a carbon tax of as much as 200 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 to an astonishing 27 000 per ton by 2100 for america families this could mean the price of gasoline soaring to 240 per gallon remember when we thought 4 per gallon was high gas at 240 per gallon ipcc report lays out high cost of carbon taxes and a google search turns up many more articles and blog posts saying the same thing this is all completely mistaken as you can see from the quotes from the ipcc report itself that i just gave four ways to get to 1 5 c what they actually said is that if we cut co 2 emissions rapidly in the next 12 years then we can achieve a 1 5 c rise easily if we don t do that it is hard to avoid 2 c by 2050 to 2060 though we can still get back to 1 5 c by burning lots of biofuel and capturing the co 2 from burning it for the rest of the century and other forms of carbon capture and storage they looked at four different ways of staying within 1 5 c the best is to cut emissions quickly especially since coral reefs are nearly extinct after just two years at 2 c and delayed reductions mean a few years at 2 c these are the four main pathways the cover in the report in their investigation of ways to remain within 1 5 c that s the goal of the paris agreement and they were tasked with both finding out what was needed to remain within this and what the difference is between effects at 1 5 c and 2 c the p1 pathway assumes rapid reduction by 45 by 2030 and then a reduction to to 0 emissions by 2050 it never requires a negative emissions in total but some of the co 2 is offset by negative emissions through afforestation shown in brown in the diagram which is already going on china particularly is doing a lot of afforestation the yellow in these diagrams is active removal by continually recycling the trees in forests by burning biofuels and capturing the co 2 i shared this graph before but let s look at it again which shows conceptually the idea of the two approaches the p1 path is like the one on the right and the other ones have increasing amounts of temporary excess like the one on the left the other main alternative they discussed involves reaching 2 c at around 2050 2060 but then for the rest of the century we use carbon capture and storage however they were widely misrepresented in the press with a claim that they required as yet unproven expensive methods for taking carbon directly from the atmosphere this is not what they said instead they said we could do it by growing vast forests for fuel and then burning that fuel in plants that capture the co 2 emissions from the fuel burning this works because the trees as they grow take co 2 from the atmosphere and as they are burnt the co 2 is then captured and the next generation of trees repeats the process it would be a huge challenge to do that but it is known technology the main thing would be scaling up the carbon capture and storage for the emissions from the wood burning power stations but that s far easier than taking it out of the atmosphere with several plants already doing this the main disadvantages of this second approach apart from the expense and complexity is that it means that the corals are nearly extinct at 2 c and it just takes a couple of years at that temperature to kill most of them to the extent that recovery is difficult the other two ways they discuss in the report are a mix of some early reductions and some reafforestation and biofuels with later carbon capture and storage with more capture needed if the early reductions are less they didn t find any other ecosystems that are as sensitive as the corals not even the mangrove swamps which was one of the other ones they looked at for climate sensitivity the 2018 report was actually a little more optimistic than expected if anything they raised the co 2 emissions level needed to stay within 1 5 c due to re examining of past data see thick layers of ice take a very long time to melt centuries to millennia when our emissions reach a net zero no more added than is removed then the temperature increases stop and then start to go down as the co 2 levels reduce however the world does continue to change and there is a lot of lag there mainly because of the ice and the ocean the permafrost would continue to melt as would the ice in western antarctica and greenland that s a slow process because ice has huge thermal inertia icebergs can spend months and longer in warm water before they melt there are lakes in new zealand that often gets icebergs from glaciers and once there they continue for ages bizarrely you get ice bergs in warm water in summer click to watch in youtube those are icebergs in the full sunlight of a new zealand summer day so think how slowly ice must melt in the far colder conditions at the poles the poles will still experience the six month polar winter every year and only glancing sunlight even in the arctic or antarctic summer so yes the ice in greenland and antarctica will melt eventually until it reaches whatever level of cover is in equilibrium with the climate but this is an immensely long process the greenland and antarctic ice will persist for a long time in a warmer world for much longer than the year or two of those new zealand icebergs indeed both will be covered in kilometers thick layers of ice for tens of thousands of years in any of the future scenarios it just takes that long to melt so much ice in a slightly warmer world the sea level continues to rise partly from this ice melting and partly also from the sea warming up the sea has a huge thermal capacity and will gradually take up heat from the atmosphere but that s another thousands of years process the warmer sea expands for the smaller sea level rises about half the sea level rise is from the sea expanding rather than ice melting all that would continue if we stopped emissions right away but at a lesser rate than if we were going to a warmer world about 15 40 of the emitted carbon remains in the atmosphere for 1000 years however none of this changes the situation that the world slowly starts to cool as soon as emissions stop in the 1 5 c scenario on most scenarios that end up with zero emissions even as the ice melts the world is cooling down as co 2 gradually comes out of the atmosphere dissolved in the sea taken up in peat bogs swamps and salt marshes in the soil as it builds up and so on removing co 2 through re afforestation we can also remove co 2 from the atmosphere more rapidly by burning wood and then using carbon capture on the co 2 produced every time you do that it takes some co 2 from the atmosphere we can also remove co 2 by re afforestation and reversing desertification improving the soil also takes co 2 out of the atmosphere as does making forests more species rich if eventually for instance we regreen the sahara desert back to the way it was 5000 bc when it was pastureland rather than desert that would take large amounts of co 2 from the atmosphere the sahara dust fertilizes the amazon massive amounts of saharan dust fertilize the amazon rainforest but 11000 to 5000 bc then the sahara was green green sahara african humid periods paced by earth s orbital changes so the amazon jungle can manage fine without the sahara dust or less of it we are already doing afforestation as part of the measures to deal with climate change china planted nearly 79 million hectares by 2015 under the bonn challenge 56 countries from central and south america mainly are pledged to restore 350 million hectares of forest by 2030 all four of the ipcc s scenarios for remaining within 1 5 c involved some measure of afforestation in a recent study reported in scientific american researchers who planted a mix of trees rather than a single species found that they removed 32 tons per hectare instead of the more usual 12 tons reverting non forest land to forests globally could offset around 253 billion tons of co 2 between 2018 and 2100 which is equivalent to seven years of global co 2 emissions at current levels carbon brief have a map of where reafforestation is happening around the world and with a summary of the research and the opportunities and challenges here mapped where afforestation is taking place around the world effect of co 2 on plant growth trees and plants grow faster in a world with more co 2 due to the co 2 fertilization effect trees increase in productivity by around 23 percent over pre industrial and crops boosted by 11 5 percent for most like wheat and rice but some like corn which use a more efficient form of photosynthesis can t benefit so much from the extra co 2 because they are so efficient at fixating co 2 already and are only boosted by 8 4 percent a downside is that food crops can lose a significant amount of zinc and iron in a warming world and grains also lose protein ask the experts does rising co 2 benefit plants there s a likely increase of productivity of trees by 23 to 28 until 2050 but the responses are more pronounced in young trees also a study of european trees in 2018 found that though the volume increased by 29 to 100 up to a doubling of the volume added the density decreased by 8 to 12 percent so they produce much more wood but it tends to be lighter offsetting some of the gains trees and climate change faster growth lighter wood grasses also increase in productivity with more co 2 but it depends on the species one study for instance found that the optimal levels of co 2 for grass depend on the species we found that the optimal co 2 concentrations occurred at 945 915 and 1151 ppm for the aboveground biomass of tall fescue perennial ryegrass and kentucky bluegrass respectively the optimal co 2 concentrations for the growth of three perennial grass species overview of some of the research through to 2012 here the effect can also be seen from orbit with satellite measurements leaf area is increasing this greening is a combination of new leaves on existing plants as well as an increase in the amount of land covered by plants and shrubs only a few areas less than 4 show a browning effect many areas have an increase of more than 50 rising co 2 has greened world s plants and trees carbon brief the researchers estimated that 70 of the extra growth is due to rising co 2 in the atmosphere another 8 is due to climate shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns especially for high latitudes like the tibetan plateau and the sahel region in africa the arctic is getting greener of course because of the melting permafrost and the amazon jungle areas are too however interestingly then the rest is due to effects such as more nitrogen in the soil from fertilizer changes in forest cover grazing and intensive farming this is a video summary click to watch in youtube soil improvement it is possible that soil improvement also could make a big difference as the soil is improved co 2 is taken up from the atmosphere the amount that can be removed in this way is hard to estimate but it could remove 200 gt by 2100 which could increase to 500 gt by techniques such composting rather than burning soil revenues limited tilling and mixing biochar currently human activities are running at just under 37 gt in 2017 so soil improvement could take up between 5 and 13 years of emissions at 2017 levels i got those figures of co 2 emissions from here this is a summary in a recent review from 2018 of co 2 removal methods in addition to mixing biochar into soils recent studies have focused on replenishing or enhancing organic carbon in cultivated soils through various agricultural practices such as limiting tilling and composting rather than burning crop residues earlier studies suggested a very limited possible role for soil enrichment however more recent analyses suggest a physical removal potential of 200 gt co 2 by 2100 and this could possibly be increased up to 500 gt co 2 by practices such as soil carbon enrichment at greater depths evaluating climate geoengineering proposals in the context of the paris agreement temperature goals no we are not going to lose all the world s soil in 40 years this is a much shared old scientific american article from 2013 at the early stages of the food and agricultural organization s global soil partnership the article itself is here as we ll see it is hyperbole and click bait even the scientific american does do occasional click bait titles it never was literally true however it was the beginning of the fao soil health initiative which has continued and is making a big difference to soil health worldwide subtitle generating three centimeters of top soil takes 1 000 years and if current rates of degradation continue all of the world s top soil could be gone within 60 years a senior un official said it was followed up by a big report in 2015 that confirmed that preserving the health of world soils is very important and mapping out the problems and solutions this has been followed by global action and co ordination focused on world soil health this has been going on for a long time back in 1996 glasod gave this summary the global assessment of human induced soil degradation glasod has shown that damage has occurred on 15 percent of the world s total land area 13 percent light and moderate 2 percent severe and very severe mainly resulting from erosion nutrient decline salinization and physical compaction however during this period agricultural productivity has increased and food security increased so while some of the soil is degrading in other places we are doing things right and finding ways to increase productivity hugely through a four fold increase in the global population though soil degradation is a serious matter there s a lot being done to reverse desertification and improve soils here is an example of what you can achieve at a local level a rather dramatic greening the desert in the jordan using only the methods of permaculture they didn t extract water from any subsurface aquifers just used the natural rainfall that fell on their plot in winter and techniques of permaculture to improve the soil health click to watch in youtube here is his ted talk click to watch in youtube there are many initiatives underway to reverse desertification such as the sahara great green wall project it started as an idea of a literal wall of trees but this was not successful and it has evolved into a vision of a mosaic of many practices such as incorporating trees into the agriculture they are doing already and other methods of reversing desertification depending on the local situation for instance in many places then shrubs and grass may grow better than the trees you can also grow food without soil that s what aquaponics and aeroponics does a world without soil is not a world without agriculture we could have a civilization on the moon according to the dreams of space colonists growing crops with no soil at all or making soil directly from lunar basalt this is a frame from a charming russian movie about the moon made in 1965 before humans landed there looking out on the lunar surface from inside a moon city in a frame from the 1965 russian film luna and here is a section of the movie itself with the peaches a few seconds in click to watch in youtube you can also watch the full movie in restored colour with machine translation subtitles for part of it there has been a lot of research on this since then and it does seem feasible to have agriculture on the moon for more about this see my in my why humans on mars right now are bad for science includes astronaut gardener on the moon but we can also keep our soils in good condition for more on this see my what is the worst can happen we continue to have winter and summer in all the scenarios this does nothing to the tilt of earth which leads to the changes of temperature between summer and winter where i live on the isle of mull we have less than seven hours of daylight in the middle of winter while in the middle of summer it gets so light at night that the entire night counts as twilight never reaching complete darkness that won t change we will still have six month long winters of total darkness at the poles the himalayas are also always going to be cold in all the scenarios even with no climate policies at all tibet mongolia the high andes the alps these are all going to remain cold in all scenarios if warmer than before the ice in greenland and antarctica is still there for thousands of years in a warming world as it takes that long to melt it all the arctic sea ice can melt in summer at the highest temperatures but in winter when the sun never rises at all it will still be very cold in the arctic it s a world of less ice and fewer glaciers but not no ice so clearly not an uninhabitable world on any scenario james hansen s venus hothouse syndrome can t happen the idea that even the worst of climate changes would make humanity extinct is utterly ridiculous it often comes from james hansen s exaggeration in his book storms of our grandchildren published in 2008 and still available to buy at amazon it says incorrectly after the ice has gone would the earth proceed to the venus syndrome a runaway greenhouse effect that would destroy all life on the planet perhaps permanently while that is difficult to say based on present information i ve come to conclude that if we burn all reserves of oil gas and coal there is a substantial chance we will initiate the runaway greenhouse if we also burn the tar sands and tar shale i believe the venus syndrome is a dead certainty page 236 james hansen is a climate scientist but he is well known for his hugely exaggerated statements not based on any peer reviewed research this is an example it was just speculation which he could publish in a book without going through peer review after his book was published researchers quickly disproved it but his book is still on sale and still quoted even though everyone in the topic of climate change knows it is wrong for the background to this see my debunked climate change will make the world too hot for humans especially search the page for the section could it be possible to turn earth into a second venus stephen hawking made a similar claim he s a brilliant physicist everyone agrees noted for his work in general relativity and black holes and he is the theorist behind hawking radiation and his work is careful and meticulous in this topic area and brilliant however he has never done any research in climate change afaik the bbc interviewed him on his birthday asking what his views are on trump s withdrawal and he said in the interview here we are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible trump s action could push the earth over the brink to become like venus with a temperature of 250 degrees and raining sulfuric acid climate change is one of the great dangers we face and it s one we can prevent if we act now he is so famous that whatever he says just gets reported straight as is not only by the bbc by top papers too some famous people respond to fame like this by making pronouncements in areas that are way outside their sphere of expertise on topics that they have never studied academically stephen hawking often does this towards the end of his life he took to making predictions of the future saying that we are doomed in one way or another it s not true he does not present the facts he exaggerates things and some of his predictions are frankly just bizarre i ve had to debunk him six times so far to help scared people see debunked stephen hawking s predictions of the world ending this was just not true see my the hurricanes heat waves fires and flooding are not global events i d like to do a bit of an aside here to help people who are panicking about this i often get people contact me scared of things that couldn t possibly do anything to them this may be obvious once i say it but it needs to be said for some people who are really scared and not thinking clearly also for very young children you will get natural hazards like the fires heat waves flooding and hurricanes and we ll get more of those as a result of climate change but don t think of them as covering the entire world that just can t happen for instance you are not going to get a heat wave at all if you live somewhere really cold like lose to the arctic circle you aren t going to get a proper hurricane if you live in europe because hurricanes cross the atlantic from west to east and never make landfall in europe strong winds yes hurricanes proper no you aren t at risk of a forest fire if you live in a place without trees the sea in worst case rises meters by 2100 the ipcc talks about it being feet but it is possible it could be higher than their estimate because they caution that the science is not yet well settled on this but not tens of meters for sure and not the kilometers rise needed to swamp the entire world there isn t enough ice to melt to do that ever for instance this is what happens to florida with a three meters sea level rise this is much higher than the ipcc projection for 2100 of two to four feet and although that is regarded as conservative it s not likely it s as much as three meters florida before and after a 3 meter sea level rise due to melting ice from the antarctic and greenland ice sheets image made using the eustatic sea level change tool from virtual earth system laboratory vesl florida is a low lying state yet most of florida also is untouched at a three meters rise if you live in the florida keys or miami yes you may have to move house florida is especially vulnerable because the land is porous limestone for new york or netherlands they can build higher flood barriers for these low lying areas in florida the worst case is you move out or build upwards e g artificial islands or get used to miami having flooded streets at extreme high tides so yes that can happen but i get people worried about sea level rise who live nowhere near the sea it doesn t mean that the entire surface of the earth is covered in water to a depth of one meter you are only at risk if you are in a city that is already close to being flooded also for people who do live close to sea level just a meter or so above the high tide mark it is only a risk of flooding at the highest tides with storm surges to start with even with a one meter rise or more you are not going to be flooded at low tide or indeed any time except the highest spring tides once a lunar month with assistance of storms the worst case is you have to evacuate miami or convert it into a city that is a bit like venice during the occasional high tide storm surges with sea filling the streets everyone else then it s just like normal flood warnings wildfire warnings heat wave warnings and hurricane warnings but maybe more of those in the future the wildfires are only a risk if you are in a place like california already at risk of fires it s not talking about fires and flooding sweeping over the entire world or of a global hurricane that affects everyone worldwide no such thing is even possible the rcp s targeting 1 5 c 2 4 c 3 c and 4 9 c let s look at the rcp s or recognized concentration pathways these are detailed scenarios worked out so that climate modelers can run their models on the same projections for comparing them if it weren t for them everyone would use different scenarios and it would be almost impossible to either compare models or aggregate them together for statistical results rcp 2 6 reach 1 5 c 490 ppm co 2 rcp 4 5 reach 2 4 c 650 ppm co 2 rcp 6 reach 3 c 850 ppm co 2 with existing policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c with existing policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c rcp 8 5 reach 4 9 c 1370 ppm co 2 business as usual we are already well within this one by existing policies alone for details this shows how the co 2 levels vary with the different rcp s and the emissions which are the inputs to the models they are all pretty much indistinguishable up to 2020 i got these graphs here if you look at the latest data we are on the same curve as rcp 6 0 but it s also on rcp 4 5 and 2 6 the 2 c and 1 5 c pathways we just can t tell them apart yet from the graphs but by analysing policies we are on the path for a 3 c rise by 2100 from analysis why the ipcc 1 5c report expanded the carbon budget carbon brief this shows how the atmospheric co 2 and the temperature and sea level rises over a longer time period through to 2500 with the four scenarios in the rcp 8 5 then there just aren t enough fossil fuel reserves to keep burning them for ever which is why that curve is shown as leveling off at 2000 ppm in 2200 for business as usual notice how when the atmospheric co 2 levels stop rising the temperatures almost immediately level off in all the scenarios however the sea levels continue to rise in all the scenarios except low co 2 for centuries those sea level rises are difficult to model and could be up to several times larger so anyway that s what the ipcc say in their summary of the research on the topic for the last few years 1 5 c is definitely in reach if we have the political will it requires ramping up pledges rapidly in the next several years through to 2030 but the aim is to ramp up if we stop co 2 emissions then whatever temperature it is is where we level out if we could stop all co 2 emission today then we would level of at 1 c above pre industrial and then it would gradually decline we are not going to be able to stop instantly that isn t going to happen but it shows that the rise is not inevitable until we actually reach those temperatures that is the conclusion of the ipcc delayed effects so now let s look at those delayed effects that the doomsday sayers climate catastrophists make so much of methane bomb clathrate gun hypothesis effectively disproved many of those posts that say we have a much higher temperature rise baked in rely on the clathrate gun hypothesis which is effectively disproved now this is how it is supposed to work the clathrates are a form of ice with methane locked inside it on the floors of the arctic ocean it floats in water like ordinary ice so any that remains on the sea floor has to be bound to the sediment it s stable at higher temperatures than ordinary ice up to a few degrees depending on pressure there are thick deposits frozen into the sea bed below the arctic ocean the only ones that matter are the ones within 100 meters of the surface any deeper and the methane dissolves out of the bubbles into sea water on the way up to the surface as the sea is very undersaturated in methane however it s now known that only the top layers of the clathrates are warm enough to start to destabilize only the top 1 6 meters and they do so only very slowly centuries because they are only warmed sufficiently for less than half the year and this doesn t seem to be enough for fast destabilizing there have been skeptics all along it is thermodynamically difficult because it s an endothermic reaction the opposite of the idea of an explosion you get from the word gun if you try to get it going some will dissociate absorb the heat and that will cool down the rest and it just stops carolyn ruppel lead author of the usgs metastudy puts it like this click to watch in youtube so the deposits locally can t explosively dissociate it would need a huge feedback into the global climate to do this but the metastudies show that this just isn t present instead it is a very slow burner over thousands of years not even much affected by the increasing temperatures since they have been warm enough to destabilize already for thousands of years the usgs metastudy in 2017 by the usgs gas hydrates project concluded our review is the culmination of nearly a decade of original research by the usgs my coauthor professor john kessler at the university of rochester and many other groups in the community said usgs geophysicist carolyn ruppel who is the paper s lead author and oversees the usgs gas hydrates project after so many years spent determining where gas hydrates are breaking down and measuring methane flux at the sea air interface we suggest that conclusive evidence for release of hydrate related methane to the atmosphere is lacking gas hydrate breakdown unlikely to cause massive greenhouse gas release that s from the big usgs review in 2017 and the royal society did one too and then in 2018 the big gas hydrates research project cage finally proved that the methane has been leaking gradually for millions of years and is not a new thing it is pretty much settled it s not even a consideration at all for climate modeling now for more about this see this my update of the wikipedia article which is now very dated on this topic and sadly they don t seem likely to update it any time soon so i ve done my own update of it in our doomsday debunked wiki to include the latest research from 2017 though to 2018 siberian and canadian permafrost more recently those who say that the ipcc have left out big unknown effects have switched to the siberian permafrost this is nothing to do with the clathrate gun hypothesis indeed it is not about methane clathrates at all there is some methane locked into the permafrost already but not a lot instead it s just ordinary ground filled with frozen grass other vegetation bodies of animals including mammoths in siberia and other creatures that have been frozen for thousands of years also a lot of it is just frozen peat as the climate warms up then gradually the permafrost melts it s a slow process as that happens those organics are exposed to liquid water and the atmosphere parts that are dry produce co 2 but can also take up co 2 from the new vegetation that grows on them also as the permafrost melts peat will start to grow over large areas and peat growth takes up a lot of co 2 parts that are wet not well drained can produce methane because in wet conditions somewhat blocked off from the surface without access to air then decomposing microbes tend to produce methane instead of co 2 they do that just because there isn t any oxygen available to make the co 2 so it attracts different kinds of microbes that produce methane instead because the methane is produced below the surface most of it gets converted to other organics and to co 2 as it gradually percolates towards the surface figure taken from this paper showing some of the processes the methane is produced deep underground it gets involved in many chemical reactions

johannesburg miningweekly com three years ago orion minerals was trading at an eighth of an australian cent a share it had a market capitalisation of 4 milllion and set out to find something that could be turned into a mine the good news is that the company found that opportunity in south africa and its share price has since had a 4 5 times value uplift advertisement the opportunity came in the form of the sydney and johannesburg listed company encountering nelson mosiapoa and his partners who had put together a company called repli repli had acquired the prospecting rights around the old prieska copper mine which the former south african mining major anglovaal had closed in 1991 and had also bought the original company that owned the defunct mine also watch attached creamer media video advertisement this company had spent quite a few years looking at tailings retreatment and in situ leaching possibilities but was struggling to find money in south africa where junior mining generally battles to make headway when orion minerals ceo and geologist errol smart was shown the prieska opportunity he realised that it had huge potential the upshot was that mosiapoa s partners sold out to orion and mosiapoa stayed in repli to serve as orion s black economic empowerment bee partner and doing a great job to ensure that the australian company obtained government permitting and developed strong community relations as in junior mining the world over geologists see an opportunity raise funds drill holes and convince investors that they need more money to drill more holes all this has a one in ten chance of mineral discovery and a one in twenty chance of reaching feasibility study stage every step of the way requires the raising of more money and every time more shares are sold to raise cash founding funders suffer dilution unless they invest still more generally the big value of junior mining is that the shares owned can be openly traded with the share value increasing as it ascends but in south africa the story is different for particularly bee shareholders who are locked in which creates unfair disparity at this stage as orion now approaches the completion of its bankable feasibility study bfs into the redevelopment of the zinc and copper mine in prieska the exploration company has found itself on the brink of becoming a mine development company on a site that has a long horizon with that the cheques that need to be written grow in financial magnitude and more funding has to be found during this period smart began exchanging notes with former rio tinto south africa head billy mawasha and lamenting together about the way bees are straightjacketed and the need to find a better way in canada and australia mines produce more minerals than south africa with a third of the people and very few fatalities the difference is that south africa has old mines that use outdated mining methods that have resulted in local mining entering a shrinking cycle smart has set out to reverse that cycle by ensuring that foreign and local investors are on an equal footing as risk and reward contributors and participants at the listed company level along with mining charter 3 compliance needed in the next year is equity capital ranging from r500 million to r1 billion with incoming bees needing to shoulder the responsibility of finding 20 of that this led to mosiapoa exchanging his shares at project level for listed orion shares and a new group of bee investors entering the fray brought together is a mix of seasoned executives rising star entrepreneurs who never take no for an answer and owners of engineering expertise that can help to contain construction costs in this way orion has ended up clinching a potent and new style partnership with new bee company prieska resources which will own 20 of orion s mining businesses in south africa prieska resources which is majority women owned includes kimberley legal firm accountant sharon matthews and prieska born jowell tobias who has extensive project finance experience their company has large engineering and steel fabrication workshops which are being positioned for involvement in the prieska project these bee partners have invested at a premium to market which puts them on a par with international investors at listed company level to which the original founding bee partnership has also been elevated all are shareholders at the top level putting all investors on a par this coincided with a move to strengthen the orion board involving the appointment of former anglo american executive godfrey gomwe and former bhp billiton executive tom borman as nonexecutive directors foreign investors are backing the bee team and the company s plans to develop a significant if not giant mine it is anticipated that the capital structure will migrate from australia to south africa where the orion share price is trading at a 25 premium to the australian price with the latest placement about 8 to 10 of orion s shares are in trading accounts on the johannesburg securities exchange jse there are 670 south africans on orion s share register and there is a growing appetite for the share i think more and more people are going to see success stories like orion and there are others there are currently eight australian mining companies active in south africa that are to some extent following in our track and people are seeing that there is an equity return which is what drives the junior mining sector it s not about dividend yield you don t invest your whole pension fund in junior mining it s a high risk business what you do is you invest a small proportion of it on the expectation that if you re very selective in your investment you can make ten times your money smart said in response to mining weekly online at this week s media roundtable there s always a risk in mining but we re probably plotting a new path in south africa but there s still no base metals board on the jse and we re counted with the gold counters it s a crazy situation but we re getting there he added as announced last month the anglo american sefa mining fund aasmf will become a shareholder of orion through the issue of shares to aasmf in consideration of preference shares held by the fund in repli these were issued to aasmf as part of a seed capital investment that funded early drilling and engineering work in the latest share issue 8 million worth of shares have been issued to the new placees including the new bee grouping in the last 12 months the orion share has traded as high as 50c a share on the jse and also as at a low of 29c a share the low was caused by australian shareholders who bought at one australian cent a share and 1 5c a share more than three years ago opting to take their money home at what equated to 3c and 4c australian economic growth catalyst orion is holding thumbs that the mine will serve as an economic growth catalyst for the prieska area where a special economic zone is being contemplated we can t create a job for every person in prieska but we can drive an economy that can create a lot of jobs for the people prieska and the surrounding district we re there to be the growth catalyst said smart whose orion is being held back from refining in the area by the high eskom tariffs and the present energy insecurity the modernised prieska mine will be a continuous mechanised operation with an employment complement of 850 people these employees will work on a rotating shift arrangement so that there will always be one group working day shift another group working night shift and a third group on leave four hundred people have been selected for the first training programme and last week the training of the first 80 people was completed it s not about working at the rockface any more machines being used to do the hard dangerous work for us as the next generation miners we ve got to find a safe working environment that can deliver the minerals then you ve got a win that s where we re at then you ve got the multiplier effect of all the personnel providing the engineering services and maintaining the machines that keep the rock coming out of the ground smart said what i want to do is to stimulate business people to have engineering businesses that supply the services to us become a supplier to the mine and you will outlive the mine which is the first seed he added to mining weekly online energy outlook most of south africa s renewable energy development has taken place in the northern cape and orion has juwi renewable energies south africa investigating renewable energy potential for its prieska mine the preliminary scope of the collaboration is to assess the feasibility of a dedicated 35 mw solar and wind hybrid power plant for the project the results of this work will inform the long term power supply strategy for prieska in line with local government integrated development plans the northern cape region has the highest irradiance levels in the country with a hot and dry climate suitable for solar farms and it is also well situated for wind farms with its wide open spaces we can finance that ourselves and use the energy ourselves the government doesn t have to finance that for us with our own energy generation we can look at beneficiation trying to beneficiate without reliable low cost energy is a huge problem by harvesting the combination of renewable energy fantastic geology and skills we can unlock value smart added in the last two years orion has acquired and drilled out a 30 million tonne resource at a cost of less than a dollar a tonne and taken that resource within a hair s breadth of bfs stage which demonstrates what can be done in south africa
source xinhua 2019 04 20 16 34 42 editor li xia video player close by xinhua writer ma qian new york april 19 xinhua china s buoyant economic expansion for the first quarter q1 has been largely propelled by the country s fiscal stimulus as well as energetic reform and opening up a u s scholar has said the greater emphasis on both fiscal measures and on supply side measures in contrast to purely demand management measures is somewhat of a break with the past and deserves to be highly applauded sourabh gupta a senior fellow at the washington based institute for china america studies told xinhua in an interview on friday china s gross domestic product gdp growth notched a rate of 6 4 percent year on year in the first quarter topping market forecasts and on par with that of the previous quarter the national bureau of statistics nbs reported wednesday the sturdy expansion was mainly driven by a striking 8 3 percent growth in retail sales of consumer goods year on year which constitutes an overwhelming 65 1 percent in the quarterly gdp among major indicators that fared better than expectations meanwhile a 7 percent increase in the tertiary sector marking the strongest growth in added value and a significant 6 5 percent upswing in industrial output for the first quarter also indicated improving economic conditions especially an expanding manufacturing sector which gupta viewed as a very good sign such indicators showed that the darkening cloud over the chinese economy is passing and it is once again headed for a period of sustained and self sustaining private sector led growth the scholar said to reach such an encouraging growth gupta believed that the chinese authorities have struck a delicate and correct balance between introducing supply side measures such as tax incentives and reduction of fees and demand management measures such as loosening credits he added that the balance between excess stimulus and policy passivity has also been well maintained by the central government in the face of downside risks amid market concerns over domestic growth trade tensions with the united states and a potential global economic slowdown the chinese economy was always capable of weathering its impact and these macroeconomic numbers show that this is indeed the case said the china expert in targeted moves to energize market entities china has implemented massive tax and fee cuts for both enterprises and individuals so as to ease corporate burdens and spur market vitality following colossal tax and fee cuts of around 194 billion u s dollars in 2018 china will reduce the tax burdens and social insurance contributions of enterprises by approximately over 298 billion dollars in 2019 first quarter tax revenue growth dropped 11 9 percentage points year on year owing to the tax exemption policies according to the ministry of finance on tuesday the second reason for china s robust growth is the liberalizing measures that have been introduced over the past year particularly china s solid efforts to further reform and open up gupta noted this was best encapsulated by the passage of the foreign investment law this march these liberalizations have given the economy a lift said the long time china watcher the scholar believed that china s consistent focus on reform and opening up would continue to empower its economic trajectory upward in a sustainable way i believe china is in an actively reformist policy phase right now and has been energetically seized of the imperative to transition from an investment led growth model to a more productivity led and consumption based model he said this will keep china s robust growth on a sustainable footing as the nbs set china s gdp growth rate at a range of 6 6 5 percent for 2019 gupta expected the growth pace for the next two quarters to be within the mid range of the new target and to close out the year near the high range gupta said china s economic performance in the first quarter has injected optimism into global markets as china has been a disproportionately large contributor to global growth since the 2008 global financial crisis considering that the cyclical growth prospects in advanced economies is decidedly mixed the robust growth in q1 in china will certainly buoy market expectations said the scholar
during his first three plus months in office gov tony evers deserves high marks for laying out plans to right the ship that former gov scott walker and the mischief making right wingers in the legislature ran onto the shoals his proposed 2019 21 budget seeks to restore education cuts put scientists back in the mix when making environmental decisions repeal the labor killing right to work law end voting restrictions and expand medicaid an action that should have been taken eight years ago all of it unfortunately stands little chance with this legislature run by a couple of ideologues assembly speaker robin vos and senate majority leader scott fitzgerald who worry more about their political power than the fortunes of the state but evers is giving it a shot plus he proposes to finally do something about the state s sorry transportation system an embarrassment that walker and his fellow republicans wouldn t touch their dereliction of duty has saddled the state with roads and highways now proclaimed among the worst in the country where once wisconsin was a model of good roads and transportation infrastructure it has become an example of neglect evers has taken the bull by the horns and proposed in his biennial budget to add 8 cents a gallon to the state s gas tax that still isn t enough to restore local transportation aid and to bring all state roads and bridges up to snuff but at least it s a start and it will provide some relief to cash strapped local governments to fix their roads where he gets it wrong though is his proposal to do a quid pro quo in return for the 8 cent hike in the state tax he proposes to repeal the application of the state s 80 year old unfair sales act popularly called the minimum markup law to gasoline sales to supposedly help offset the 8 cent tax increase in so doing evers becomes the second democratic wisconsin governor to fall for the big business and free market propaganda that the law artificially inflates the cost to consumers former democratic gov jim doyle fell for it too some experts who work for every conservative business group in the state from the wisconsin institute for law and liberty to the maciver foundation claim that wisconsin consumers actually pay up to 14 cents more per gallon because of the law what absolute nonsense anyone who travels by car knows full well that gas prices are seldom lower in states without minimum markup laws the price differentials are more a function of the gasoline taxes the state collects and distances from refineries than they are of a law that helps protect small business folks from national predators who used their economic clout to drive little competitors out of business prompting the legislature to pass the law in the first place american economic history is full of examples of what happens to the little guy in these scenarios whether it was john d rockefeller and standard oil that commandeered oil markets or the walmarts and other big box stores that can use gas pumps as loss leaders it raises the question why would we want to make it easier for these already noncompetitive conglomerates to force the mom and pop operations out of business unfair sales acts like wisconsin s help protect consumers in the long run without a minimum markup law it is next to impossible for small merchants to compete on prices the big guys can afford to take losses until their little competitors cry uncle then guess what the conglomerates can charge whatever they want and frequently do forbidding businesses from selling gasoline for less than they pay for it at least provides some help for the little guy to survive in an economy that already directs most of the wealth to the big guys how many tax breaks and government subsidies does big business need republican state sen alberta darling one of the legislative crusaders against the minimum markup law complains that the law still exists because legislators are convinced by vocal special interests that repeal will put them out of business this from a legislator who has spent her career in government doing the bidding of every big business special interest that sent her campaign donations evers needs to understand that repeal of any element of the minimum markup law isn t good for many small family businesses that still exist in wisconsin but awfully good for those who want to put them out of business he shouldn t trade that protection away for a small gas tax increase that should have been passed long ago
a century after the very successful bank of north dakota proved the model the time has finally come to apply it across the country as public banking gains momentum across the country policymakers in california and washington state are vying to form the nation s second state owned bank following in the footsteps of the highly successful bank of north dakota founded in 1919 the race is close with state bank bills now passing their first round of hearings in both states senates in california the story begins in 2011 when then assemblyman ben hueso filed his first bill to explore the creation of a state bank the bill which was for a blue ribbon committee to do a feasibility study sailed through both legislative houses and seemed to be a go that is until gov jerry brown vetoed it not on grounds that he disapproved of the concept but because he said we did not need another blue ribbon committee the state had a banking committee that could review the matter in house needless to say nothing was heard of the proposal after that so when now sen hueso filed sb 528 earlier this year he went straight for setting up a state bank the details could be worked out during the two to three years it would take to get a master account from the federal reserve by a commission drawn from in house staff that had access to the data and understood the issues sen hueso also went for the low hanging fruit a proposal to turn an existing state institution the california infrastructure and development bank or ibank into a depository bank that could leverage its capital into multiple loans by turning the 400 million ibank currently has for loans into bank capital it could lend 4 billion backed by demand deposits from the local governments that are its clients the ibank has a 15 year record of success experienced staff and detailed procedures already in place low risk customers consisting solely of government entities and low interest loans for infrastructure and development that are in such high demand that requests are 30 times current capacity the time is also right for bringing the bill as a growing public banking movement is picking up momentum across the u s over 25 public bank bills are currently active and dozens of groups are promoting the idea advocates include a highly motivated generation of young millennials who are only too aware that the old system is not working for them and a new direction is needed banks now create most of our money supply and need to be made public utilities following the stellar precedent of the bank of north dakota which makes below market loans for local communities and businesses while turning a profit for the state the bank of north dakota was founded in 1919 in response to a farmers revolt against out of state banks that were foreclosing unfairly on their farms since then it has evolved into a 7 4 billion bank that is reported to be even more profitable than jpmorgan chase and goldman sachs although its mandate is not actually to make a profit but simply to serve the interests of local north dakota communities along with hundreds of public banks worldwide it has demonstrated what can be done by cutting out private shareholders and middlemen and mobilizing public revenues to serve the public interest the time is right politically to adopt that model the newly elected california governor gavin newsom has expressed strong interest both in a state owned bank and in the ibank approach in los angeles the city council brought a measure for a city owned bank that won 44 of the vote in november and city council president herb wesson has stated that the measure will be brought again where there is the political will policymakers generally find a way advocates in eight golden state cities have formed the california public banking alliance which co sponsored another public banking bill filed just last month introduced by assembly members david chiu and miguel santiago assembly bill 857 would enable the chartering of public banks by local california governments the bill which has broad grassroots support would authorize the lending of public credit to public banks and authorize public ownership of stock in public banks for the purpose of achieving cost savings strengthening local economies supporting community economic development and addressing infrastructure and housing needs for localities the first hearing on hueso s senate bill 528 was held in sacramento last week before the senate committee on governance and finance where it passed the bill goes next to the senate banking committee with momentum growing california could be the first state in the 21st century to form its own bank but it is getting heavy competition in that race from washington state washington s public bank movement the virtues of persistence like sen hueso washington state sen bob hasegawa filed his first bill for a state owned bank nearly a decade ago the measure is now in its fifth iteration along the way his senate state banking caucus has acquired 23 members just three votes short of a senate majority as sen patty kuderer explained at an informational forum held by the caucus in october their bills kept getting stalled with the same questions and concerns and they saw that a different approach was needed so in 2017 they advised the state to hire professional banking consultants to address the concerns and to draft a business plan that would move the concept forward from the theoretical to the concrete so that legislators would have a solid idea of what they would eventually be voting on they could bypass the studies and go straight to a business plan that laid out the nuts and bolts the maneuver worked senate bill 6375 was the first public banking bill to be advanced out of the policy committee with bipartisan support it got stalled in the ways and means committee but another bill sb 5959 was filed this year in yet another bill sb 6032 supplemental budget the fiscal ways and means committee committed 480 000 to assessing risk and developing a business plan for the effort the form of the proposed bank was also modified a bank that simply would have received the state s tax funds as deposits evolved into a co op that would be open to membership not just by the state but by all political subdivisions that have a tax base opening the co op bank s membership would allow it to generate substantially more credit than could be made from the state s revenues alone since it would have the ability to hold as deposits the combined revenues of cities counties ports and utility districts as well as of the state itself those entities would also be able to borrow at below market rates from the co op bank and to leverage the tax dollars they collected the concept was similar to that being advanced in california s sb 528 which would allow the ibank to expand its lending capacity to local governments by taking the demand deposits of those same governments and affiliated public entities the washington state business plan is due no later than june 30 2019 and legislators expect to vote on the bill no later than 2020 whenever it happens says sen hasegawa i see a public bank as almost inevitable because of the current financial structures we re required to live under state infrastructure needs are huge and the existing funding options raising taxes cutting services and increasing debt levels have been exhausted newly created credit directed into local communities by publicly owned banks can provide the additional funding that local governments critically need whichever state wins the race for the next state bank the implications are huge a century after the very successful bank of north dakota proved the model the time has finally come to apply it across the country
almost nobody seems to report the positive side of our recent climate change action it s remarkable what we ve done in two years which gives us much hope that we can indeed rise to the challenge i have never in my life seen such a coming together of nations worldwide to solve a problem three years ago after the slow progress of the kyoto protocol agreement all this would have seemed impossible there is a lot of publicity about what we aren t doing yet but hardly anyone talks about what we have already done that s the key to success to build on what we already have and what we have already done the young particularly are driving action as in greta thunberg who started the movement of school striking children in sweden standing outside the swedish parliament greta thunberg august 2018 as she started her school strike for the climate here is her emotional speech to eu leaders click to watch in youtube longer video here she is speaking at a critical time as part of the paris agreement countries are expected to increase the ambitions year on year the eu is already better than 3 c compatible but not yet 2 c compatible however its ambitions can make it 1 5 c compatible it if goes through on them amongst those listening as you can tell from the questions many are in support of her climate change is likely to play a major role in the next eu elections this may for a summary of how the eu is doing on climate change see the eu page on climate tracker however there is much understandable fear and even hysteria in some responses which doesn t seem to be strongly based on science as an example the extinction rebellion are disrupting services throughout london right now with the aim to get the uk government to commit to zero carbon emissions by 2025 government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025 our demands extinction rebellion but where does that figure come from they don t say i ve looked on their website and there is no explanation of it anywhere it isn t in the 2018 ipcc report which says we need to reach that level by 2050 for the 1 5 c goal click to watch in youtube i d like to focus in this article on what the climate scientists themselves say also on what we are already doing and what they say we need to do in the future for instance how many of you know that the eu reduced emissions by 22 from 1994 to 2017 it is on track to meet its 2020 target 20 cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels 20 of eu energy from renewables 20 improvement in energy efficiency progress made in cutting emissions climate action european commission it s long term strategy is zero emissions by 2050 and if it achieves that it makes it 1 5 c compatible in the uk our emissions are now the lowest since 1920 china and india are often criticized because their emissions are still increasing but they start off with much lower emissions per person especially india with only 1 8 tons per capita well below world average of 4 2 tons per capita they are rapidly industrializing yes but they aim to peak emissions well below the european levels and then reduce rapidly to zero india remains on track to overachieve on its 2 c compatible target and 1 5 c is within reach india climate action tracker see also guest post why india s co2 emissions grew strongly in 2017 carbon brief china faces the biggest challenge of all it is expected to meet its commitments which include 20 non fossil fuel by 2030 and to peak emissions before 2030 but it has to increase its commitments for us to have a chance to say within 1 5 c china climate action tracker this is another article i m writing to support people we help in the doomsday debunked group on facebook that find us because they get scared sometimes to the point of considering suicide by such stories you can see this blog post with a table of contents on my website add table of contents to this page on my website blog post on science 2 0 without the toc need for urgent action but measured based on science there s a pervasive idea in our society of an almost impossible situation that we can t do anything about climate change or that nobody is doing anything or that we are headed for a doomsday scenario and it is almost over already none of that is true not remotely so myles allen a lead author for the ipcc report in 2018 spoke out about this in why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric in the conversation today s teenagers are absolutely right to be up in arms about climate change and right that they need powerful images to grab people s attention yet some of the slogans being bandied around are genuinely frightening a colleague recently told me of her 11 year old coming home in tears after being told that because of climate change human civilisation might not survive for her to have children in doomsday debunked we encounter young kids like this all the time scared sometimes to the point of being suicidal that they will not live to adulthood and young adults who feel they shouldn t have children because they have read that they would be bringing them into a future uninhabitable earth a fair few are receiving therapy and drugs to treat ptsd and gad and other anxiety disorders and have panic attacks and vomit in fear many times a day out of fear of an uninhabitable earth as well as other nonsense such as the constant fake nasa asteroid warnings in the sensationalist press the sad thing is that much of what scares them so much is out and out junk science exaggerated stories or these over simplified climate slogans myles allen continues the problem is as soon as scientists speak out against environmental slogans our words are seized upon by a dwindling band of the usual suspects to dismiss the entire issue even when the climate scientists do speak out as they do sometimes their views do not get the publicity a story is far more likely to be shared on social media or run in the mainstream news if it says that all the insects will die civilization end or humans become extinct there is much that does need climate action and our situation is indeed serious in many ways however none of the expert projections of the ipcc and others of a similar high quality are of an uninhabitable earth or a literal collapse of civilization also though many individual species do risk extinction and are going extinct when it comes to ecosystems many are actually becoming more species diverse due to human effects with new habitats and species brought in from other parts of the world the corals are the only complete ecosystem highlighted as at risk of near extinction see below myles allen continues in his why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric using the world meteorological organisation s definition of global average surface temperature and the late 19th century to represent its pre industrial level yes all these definitions matter we just passed 1 c and are warming at more than 0 2 c per decade which would take us to 1 5 c around 2040 that said these are only best estimates we might already be at 1 2 c and warming at 0 25 c per decade well within the range of uncertainty that would indeed get us to 1 5 c by 2030 12 years from 2018 but an additional quarter of a degree of warming more or less what has happened since the 1990s is not going to feel like armageddon to the vast majority of today s striking teenagers the striving taxpayers of 2030 and what will they think then as he says the ipcc projections are the best estimates they are based on review of the academic literature at the highest level but they always have a range of uncertainty he says that it s not impossible that we reach 1 5 c by 2030 that it s within the range of uncertainty but this is not an uninhabitable earth or anything resembling it if we do hit this level the world will feel much as it does today to the majority of the population of the earth the expected time to reach 1 5 c is between 2040 and 2050 but there is enough uncertainty so that 2030 is not impossible he goes on to say that the ipcc does not draw a planetary boundary at 1 5 c beyond which lie climate dragons so please stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030 bad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters but the ipcc does not draw a planetary boundary at 1 5 c beyond which lie climate dragons why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric by myles allen climate slogans journalist exaggerations and out and out junk science how many of you have seen or shared myles allen s post why protesters should be wary of 12 years to climate breakdown rhetoric i expect nobody how many of you have seen or shared that study that was on tv saying that we are headed for a world without insects in 40 years did you know that that study had only one data point for the whole of china for the domestic honeybee it s like using sheep in a study on declines of mammals most of the map is blank and the few studies they do include come from a literature search for declin this is what the insect ecologist manu saunders had to say about it the key take home is the amount of white space on this map of available data showing local regional declines most countries have no data n b the single data points in australia china are both managed honey bees not wild insects pic twitter com pnnlz7ygar dr manu saunders manusaunders february 3 2019 those purple bars in australia and china are for the domestic honeybee yet nobody shared the much more thorough study from the un released just a week later which concluded that the situation is mixed some increasing some decreasing and some stable and also went into detail about the many measures being taken to protect insect biodiversity see below or you may heard that humans are going to go extinct in 2026 if so you have probably been duped by one of the arctic news blog posts by sam carana these are often shared on social media with graphs that project a sudden increase of temperature by many degrees in the next few years readers are impressed by his about page which lists a host of distinguished professors who he thanks for contributing however that is because he credits as contributors every professor whose video he embeds under the youtube embedding license most of them probably don t even know that he has done this as the license doesn t require him to ask permission he uses a quadratic or other polynomials to extrapolate you may see the absurdity if i extend his graph both ways in the blue inset below such a graph always decreases from an infinite temperature in the past and increases to an infinite temperature in the future that s just what quadratics do unless they decrease to minus infinity both ways see below or what about guy mcpherson s blog posts and videos many are impressed by him because he used to be a professor but sometimes professors lose their way and fall into junk science too he uses sam carana s absurd polynomial extrapolations as a source nuf said or you may have heard of jem bendell s deep adaptation the paper that is driving people to therapy it failed peer review not for the views expressed but because it didn t meet academic standards see below or uninhabitable earth the sensationalist book by the generalist journalist david wallace wells who has only been interested in climate science for two years see below or the often repeated journalistic claim that the ipcc report said that the only way to stop global warming is a tax leading to 240 a gallon for fuel see below or the claim of a runaway feedback from a methane bomb see below or from the siberian permafrost see below that our agricultural land is going to run out of topsoil in 40 years see below that nearly all species will go extinct this century see below or that the amazon jungle will soon burn down and be gone see below or the 1972 supercomputer that predicted an end of civilization in 2040 see below or adam frank s model that supposedly showed our civilization will end in one of three horrible ways see below or perhaps you have heard that we are going to run out of oxygen to breathe see below or that we risk a cascade of tipping points leading to a hothouse earth see below i expect almost everyone with an interest in the topic has come across most of those stories and more you may be surprised to learn how much of that is based on misunderstandings exaggerations sensationalism climate slogans and junk science if only the journalists and bloggers would heed his warning some probably do however it would take some major change or initiative for all journalists to stop doing the click bait titles for as long as some do those are the ones that will be shared and rise in google results it would also take some major change for the bloggers junk science to no longer be shared widely in social media perhaps social media initiatives to flag fake news may help but so far nothing seems to be done about them meanwhile the bloggers have freedom of speech they are not doing anything illegal by publishing nonsense even if they know that what they say is false it is hard to know what to do when faced with what seems an onslaught of fake and exaggerated climate change news most weeks nowadays we get a virally shared fake or exaggerated climate catastrophism or climate slogan story on social media and sometimes in the mainstream news or on mainstream tv too i do have a petition to google news and other news aggregates asking them to stop promoting fake and junk science news stories and to journalists to be more responsible in their reporting which you may want to sign and share and any suggestions do say in the comments what can you do tell the truth meanwhile the main thing one can do is to tell the truth as clearly and succinctly as one can if you are a blogger or journalist please do the same and anyone please do more sharing of the posts that present the true situation and less sharing of the junk science try checking a climate change story against reliable sources first our doomsday debunked group may help you as we now have a fair few members with a decent scientific understanding of climate change also if you are a climate scientist or expert you may like to consider joining our group and giving a bit of your time to help the scared people who constantly panic about climate change and other doomsday scenarios anyway i d like to focus in this article on what the climate scientists themselves say rather than the climate action slogans also i will cover what we are already doing and what they say we need to do in the future key to the paris agreement countries set policies they know they can achieve at each stage and constantly step up their ambitions as far as i can see the demands of the extinction rebellion are not based on any report by climate scientists by pushing for nearly impossible demands they risk a future where we commit to things that we can t achieve instead of committing to things that are possible the thing that has made the paris agreement such a success is that nations are able to set policies they know they can achieve at every stage and then increase their pledges year on year as they gain experience and develop new industries to make it all possible i think we need to continue in the same spirit be ambitious but make sure our goals can be achieved when we commit to them the uk government s plan is to reduce emissions by 80 in 2050 that s not enough yet but if it steps up in its pledge to a 100 reduction it would then be 1 5 c compatible to save the corals uk steps towards zero carbon economy this is something we can pressurize them to do and then to be even more ambitious once they do that according to the ipcc report in 2018 we lose 99 of the corals after just a decade or so at 2 c and the reefs probably do not recover if we don t go much above 1 5 c then 10 30 of them remain and they can recover though this may take a long time they can recover because they can adapt to warmer temperatures as well as migrate and set up reefs in places that used to be too cold for them but at 2 c the warming is too rapid for this to work so well they do caution that these projections are not certain and that it s possible that corals are more resistant than this or that we can do things to help them adapt see box 3 4 page 230 of their chapter 3 they found that no other major ecosystem on earth is so sensitive either in the sea or on land the corals are the only entire ecosystem we risk losing at 2 c humans for sure are not at any risk of extinction under any of the scenarios there is a risk of severe impacts on other ecosystems however in this map the regions marked in red risk severe impact at 2 c and the dark red regions at 1 5 c figure 3 16 of chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 the coloured regions highlight risks of sever impact the gray scale regions correspond to moderate impacts at those various temperatures this doesn t mean that the ecosystems vanish rather they change to other ecosystems for instance the melting permafrost will lead to a radically different ecosystem in northern canada alaska and siberia in a 2 c warmer world but this warmer world would be more habitable for humans in the far north with far more vegetation and letting us grow crops using conventional agriculture that never could grow there before the pace of the change is the main issue it is important to stay within 1 5 c for these and many other reasons however our future is a habitable world for humans in all the scenarios indeed it has been greening as a result of the co 2 fertilization effect so far rising co 2 has greened world s plants and trees carbon brief this should continue through to 2050 at least with increasing crop yields and faster growing trees see below it s the transition and the speed of transition that matters far more than the end state even at an increase of 12 c then the world is still very habitable for humans as we ll see what s more we have already averted a possible ice age 20 000 years from now and are headed to a future where there won t be any ice ages for hundreds of thousands of years that is good because interglacials are far more stable than ice ages when there are often wild swings in temperature the ipcc do project tens or hundreds of millions of climate refugees and other serious effects at 2 c of warning at that temperature point we may get population densities quadrupling in some places in the sub tropics due to the migrants from the tropics that is a serious societal impact in anyone s books however there is nothing in the report about collapse of society or an end of civilization those predictions are all embellishment by journalists which sadly are often just believed as is by their readers especially young children here is what they say about climate migrants in chapter 3 displacement at 2 c of warming there is a potential for significant population displacement concentrated in the tropics tropical populations may have to move distances greater than 1000 km if global mean temperature rises by 2 c from 2011 2030 to the end of the century a disproportionately rapid evacuation from the tropics could lead to a concentration of population in tropical margins and the subtropics where population densities could increase by 300 or more page 245 3 4 10 2 the changing structure of communities migration displacement and conflict from chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 this summary table shows the numbers affected at various temperature increases we are currently headed for 3 c the last column figure 3 4 page 246 of chapter 3 of the ipcc report in 2018 habitat degradation and crop yield change are particularly vulnerable to the difference from 1 5 c to 2 c our achievements in just two years the situation is undoubtedly serious however it is remarkable what we have achieved and are achieving and can do in the future especially when you look back to before the paris agreement in 2016 back then admittedly things were dire the earlier kyoto protocol agreement based on carbon trading was a flop leading to only modest commitments but then we had this truly major breakthrough what you need to know is that the paris agreement only came into place in 2016 they agreed the rulebook for the first time in december 2018 an essential step before implementing it properly when the us decided to leave this made only a small dent indeed trump may well have galvanized the other countries into more action as well as many cities companies states and individuals in the us itself in two years worldwide we have already implemented policies to knock an entire degree off the temperature projected for 2100 from around 4 c to around 3 c this shows what we can do if we work together if we keep up this momentum for the next decade who knows what we can achieve might we not be able to knock another 1 5 c off the projection for 2100 with our actions in the next twelve years after all the whole idea of the agreement is that pledges increase year on year it is important to keep up the momentum however the ipcc made it clear in their report that 1 5 c is scientifically possible is affordable and is achievable the main thing required is the political will to do it you so often hear that politicians are not doing anything this also is not true some countries already target below 2 c the most populous of those is india with a population of 1 339 billion not far off that of china it is not far from achieving a 1 5 c compatible target according to climate action tracker populations of india china and the world showing how india s population is not far off that of china now using world data via google that is a substantial chunk of the world population that is already well on its way to 1 5 c many of the smaller countries are doing even better and are already below 1 5 c compatible for more on this see below the journalists just about always hopelessly exaggerate the ipcc reports and add numerous embellishments even the mainstream news such as the new york times have their share of exaggerations and misinformation a good example here is the mistake the new york times made about carbon pricing they confused the future mitigation costs of sea wall defences of climate migrants etc with the incentive tax to prevent emissions of that co 2 as part of an integrated program the mitigation costs could rise to 27 000 a ton by 2100 but the aim of a carbon pricing incentive tax is to prevent us getting into this situation at all this is estimated at various values of 5 upwards as part of a mixed program of many measures if this succeeds then of course we never have to pay the mitigation costs they weren t the only ones to make this mistake the hill also ran a story based on this claiming that the ipcc was saying that gas petrol would cost 240 a gallon this is such a major misunderstanding the passage they got the figure from is crystal clear if you are used to reading scientific papers it s hard to know how the confusion arose but this is just one of many confusions in even the mainstream press instead of going by what the co chairs said the journalists went through the report misread a few passages and riffed on their misunderstandings without running them past anyone another major misunderstanding was the claim that the ipcc pathways required vast amounts of co 2 sequestration using technology we don t have yet far from it the pathway to zero emissions by 2050 only had a practical amount of reafforestation as a carbon negative measure to offset a small part of the emissions the ny times title was also click bait major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040 that possible crisis was for coral reefs as early as 2040 not for humanity also the central message of the report was that this can be averted with policies to stay within 1 5 c and that this is scientifically possible affordable and just needs the political will that is the positive side of the report which was not highlighted in headlines and barely mentioned in the articles either try watching the videos by the co chairs and the press conference for the ipcc report in 2018 watch the original press conferences and compare with the new york times report and others in the mainstream press at the time and you wonder if they went to the same event expect co 2 levels and even year on year emissions to continue to rise for a while on all scenarios climate activists often make a big deal of this giving the impression that our climate policies can t be working for as long as we have increasing emissions yes our yearly co 2 emissions are still rising but that s not surprising all the scenarios project a rise for at least a few more years even the ones with 1 5 c targets our current policies and unconditional pledges will lead to reduced emissions year on year within a few years also long after our yearly emissions have declined we should expect co 2 levels in the atmosphere to keep increasing it is only when the emissions reach zero that our co 2 levels and temperature stabilizes which even with the 1 5 c compatible paths doesn t happen until the mid century with current policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c with a 2 3 chance of staying within 3 2 c see summary graphic that s just a start we are bound to get to lower targets than that as they ramp up the pledges the bloggers and journalists who share graphs and say look we haven t achieved anything yet are looking at them with the wrong kind of analysis this is not a reason to be disheartened what is it we have to do by 2030 many of the journalists reported that we have a decade to avoid disaster and the more sensationalist accounts say that we risk human extinction within a decade that s not what the ipcc said it was widely misreported and i think the journalists have a lot of the responsibility for the current hysteria due to the way they mislead the public by not summarizing what they said accurately the report actually said that the best way to 1 5 c is to reduce co 2 emissions by 45 by 2030 so we have twelve years to reduce emissions by 45 nothing much will happen in 2030 but unless we are already down to a 45 reduction by then it will become increasingly harder to remain within 1 5 c by the middle of the century after that we reduce to zero by 2050 however if we don t start those reductions until 2030 we can still stay within 1 5 c but we have to reduce much more rapidly after that and reach 0 c by 2045 five years earlier that s for the 1 5 c pathway if we want to stay within 2 c then it s much easier for that pathway we need to reduce 20 by 2030 and reach net zero by 2075 also reaching zero emissions by 2050 or 2045 was only one of four ways to stay within 1 5 c we can also overshoot a little not all the way to 2 c and then use negative emissions to get back again for instance global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 1 figure 1 4 even if we don t manage that and the temperature briefly reaches 2 c it is possible to get back down to 1 5 c if we remove co 2 for the rest of the century to compensate this shows conceptually the idea of the two approaches the best approach is the one to the right this is a good summary of some of the main points in the agreement have done so much already and this is hardly utopian as a vision we have done so much already this graph gives an idea of what we have done already our current policies are already well below the no climate policies orange region remember most of this has been achieved in only two years we have another ten years to get onto the 1 5 c track first we need to stop our current increase in co 2 emissions year on year then we need to do the 45 reduction which is the start of the easier p1 pathway we can definitely do it that was the conclusion of the ipcc report it s a matter of politics not science whether we do this of course the us plan to withdraw but they are not the largest emitter china is and they are the most important of all to reduce quickly they are responsible for half of the extra emissions that caused emissions to rise again in 2017 after plateauing for a couple of years there the bars show the increases or decreases as you can see half the increase from 2016 to 2017 is from china graph from here as we ll see they are fulfilling their pledges under the paris agreement which is not to stop increasing yet they only committed to peak some time before 2030 but that much is really ambitious for a rapidly industrializing country and they seem on track to do it we need more ambitious pledges from them to stay within 1 5 c but they have fulfilled their pledges so far they have a strong incentive as they are amongst the most affected with business as usual then parts of china would get so hot that farmers can t work in their rice fields any more during heat waves and coastal cities are vulnerable to flooding so they are very motivated to do something about it also as major contributors to the carbon emissions they are also in a position to be able to make a big impact on climate change just by themselves see this graph graphs from co₂ and other greenhouse gas emissions within the us too then there is strong support for the paris agreement in many sectors the united states climate alliance accounts for 16 states as well as the territory of puerto rico committed to upholding the paris agreement within their borders amongst those sixteen california if they were a separate country would be the fifth largest economy in the entire world cal facts 2002 economy major cities around the world have committed to build only zero carbon buildings by 2030 and to make existing buildings zero carbon by 2050 in the us that includes new york city and san francisco new york which has 60 of the california economy and the us may well return to the paris agreement in the future at some point before 2030 trump could change his mind and the next president in 2022 or 2026 may well return to it especially with increasingly clear symptoms of climate change and its effects in the us that is time enough for the us government to join in reducing emissions to zero by 2050 and remember most of this has happened in the last two years so how much can we achieve in the next ten years what about david attenborough saying we risk societal collapse you can watch it here attenborough presents climate change the facts it may sound frightening but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies we are running out of time but there is still hope i believe that if we better understand the threat we face the more likely it is that we can avoid such a catastrophic future attenborough climate show a call to arms this is another example of climate change slogans strictly speaking it is not literally true the ipcc report did not say we have to take dramatic action in the next decade they said that immediate action is the easiest way ahead scientifically feasible and affordable and that there are increasingly more dramatic measures needed if we postpone action the ipcc report also says nothing about societal collapse at least not large scale collapse david attenborough s program focuses on local communities severely impacted by climate change such as the climate migrants impacted by flooding and those whose houses burnt down in the california fires in that sense it is a collapse of local communities which will become much more widespread in a warming world that may be what he meant on a larger scale though we have a lot of climate change resilience there is also much work being done on increasing that for more on the research into climate change resilience see below dealing with some popular misconceptions right away before getting to more details about climate change i d like to debunk some of the popular misconceptions there are many stories you may have read and believed that are just false here is a youtube video of some young women who are so scared that they feel they can t bring a child into the world and as i said in the intro much of what scares the general public is false or junk science click to watch in youtube i will start with one of the most widely shared a junk sociology paper that failed peer review that climate scientists say is just crap but is widely believed by the general public jem bendell s deep adaptation many have been scared by jem bendell s deep adaptation he is a sociologist who relies extensively on wasdell s never published non peer reviewed article this in turn depends on the now disproved clathrate gun hypothesis this is the article that is supposedly so depressing it s driving its readers to therapy i can well believe that this happens from the panicked and scared pm s i get but the article itself is grounded in junk science that it makes people depressed doesn t mean it is correct the distinguished climate scientist michael mann director of the earth system science center at pennsylvania state university had only one word in comment just four letters crap see the other responses to his tweet too his tweet is here later in the conversation he amends this to hogwash tweet here sorry hogwash michael e mann michaelemann march 6 2019 i cover this in detail in my article uninhabitable earth others have been scared by this article and then book by david wallace wells he doesn t write like a scientist he says himself that he is a general journalist who has only been interested in climate change for one to two years his book is just a scrap book of the scariest stories he has found not a systematic survey he misunderstands things exaggerates and misses important nuances in the stories he covers the evidence that climate change is a serious problem that we must contend with now is overwhelming on its own there is no need to overstate the evidence particularly when it feeds a paralyzing narrative of doom and hopelessness i m afraid this latest article does that that s too bad the journalist is clearly a talented one and this is somewhat of a lost opportunity to objectively inform the discourse over human caused climate change michael e mann for more about this see my aren t humans going to go extinct in 2026 or 2030 these are fake news stories one of the worst of the junk blogs is sam carana and his arctic news blog he uses quadratic equations and other polynomials to project an utterly bizarre idea to a mathematician this image may be enough for you to see how ridiculous his posts are in the blue inset i have extrapolated his quadratic or one very close to it both ways so you can see how it will always predict an increase to infinity in the future and decrease from infinity from the past unless it s the other way around increase from absolute zero and decrease to absolute zero it is a ridiculous way to extrapolate another one here from how long do we have to back up his nonsense he does stuff like this there is no basis for it it s all make believe in his diagram on that page he says that between 2025 and 2026 there will be a sudden 8 c increase in temperature due to cloud feedback that s not based on any science just that he needed some gobbledygook to put in his graph to add a sudden 8 c because that s what his polynomial does presumably it s meant to be about the cloudless skies study which is based on co2 levels of 1400 to 2200 ppm a level we can t reach until the 22nd century even with business as usual it is not even remotely relevant to the conditions we are in right now in see below if we instantly stopped anthropogenic emissions then it would lead perhaps to a bump by 0 15 c for 20 years see below the methane bomb is disproved see below and the siberian permafrost effect is minute for this century on the path we are on see below this blog sadly impresses readers because the credentials of the contributors on his deceptive about page seem impressive it goes on and on 33 contributors professors and emeritus professors however click through to the linked names on his about page and you realize he will credit as a contributor any of the people talking in embedded youtube videos in any of his blog posts he surely hasn t asked permission of any of them and there would be no reason for them to even know that the video is on his blog he just includes this material under the youtube license for embedding content others are included because he quotes a short paragraph from them or includes an article they released under a creative commons license sadly many people do believe his blog at least partly because they believe the about page and think he must have something going for him to attract posts from so many distinguished professors just nonsense the other junk scientist who scares many people is guy mcpherson a retired professor of ecology who has lost contact with the scientific method you can tell how far he has gone in the direction of junk science when you discover he uses sam carana s blog with its daft polynomial projections as a source for his own predictions guy mcpherson keeps saying the average temperature of earth is going to increase rapidly by several degrees in a few months none of it ever happens because it is based on junk science like this see my absurd blog post at arctic news predicting a ridiculous 10 c rise in global temperatures by 2026 using a polynomial to extrapolate you are not at risk of extinction in any of the climate scenarios the worst that happens is that the world gets so hot perhaps you start to grow coconuts in the mediterranean and oranges in the uk not that you have coconuts growing in canada or that humans can t survive at all didn t a 1972 computer model say we would soon be extinct by 2040 limits to growth this is a computer program that simulated the world as five numbers for everything in 1972 it needed a computer that filled a room today it would run in a fraction of a second on your mobile phone it is just a coincidence it predicted the number of children would stop going up because we could no longer find the resources needed to bring up children any more by now but it s the opposite the number of children is almost the same as it was a decade ago that s true however it is because we have food and other resources for our children and have good medicine to prevent children dying and as a result people are having fewer children worldwide it is in a background of greatly increasing life expectancy ten to 20 years in the last 50 years see here is a graph from that page the countries with decreasing populations are places like japan which have a the highest standards of living japan population 1950 2018 data chart calendar forecast news all this is the opposite of what their model predicted fewer children because of poverty and not being able to bring them up and a situation of scarcity and hardship and short lives it is just a coincidence we should use the un population division and other modern well tested and thoroughly researched projections and modern computers and programs not this ancient 1972 program that uses only 5 numbers to represent the entire world my article about it is here debunked no we are not on track for end of world by 1972 computer model this is another similar one from appendix d they have a parameter w for wellbeing and they assume that as the well being of a population increases the population growth rate increases becoming superexponential that would seem sensible from studies of animal populations but humans don t do this as our well being increases our population has leveled out the opposite of what their model suggests we have already almost reached peak child we are living a lot longer and our birth rate has gone right down to less than replacement in some of the wealthiest countries such as japan which already has a declining population the only major region of our world which still has a high birthrate is the least prosperous africa as it becomes more prosperous with better health care higher education particularly of women and reduce child mortality its birthrate is expected to fall down to around 2 children per family as parents become more confident that their children can survive to adulthood and be healthy the population is expected to level off also our final world population depends a lot on how rapidly africa develops towards these conditions of higher education reduced child mortality better health etc when will the world reach peak child a sociology author has used this simple model which doesn t match what is happening to us to predict that society would collapse on the science he says to find out more to read david waltham s book which is awful my debunk of it is here quoting from his article the continued growth for much of this period as well as the very slowly decline in the latter part is mostly due to the increasing birth rate only after a few decades when the world is approaching global societal collapse does the death rate overtake the increasing birth rate in the present situation famines tend to be very local problems as much of the planet can import food in case local production is insufficient but this won t be the case in a world in which food shortages are no longer local but worldwide and in which global trade is breaking down on the fragility of civilization but the fundamental premise there is flawed there isn t an increasing birthrate it is decreasing rapidly worldwide what about adam frank s model predicting our civilization will end in one of three horrible ways this is a first paper in what they hope to be a long term study it s an interesting project but it should not be used to predict what will happen to earth in the future their research is at far too early a stage to be relevant to any of that it makes many simplifying assumptions that do not apply to earth as it is now but their aim wasn t to predict what would happen to earth it was to try to get a general picture of what can happen to all possible exoplanet civilizations a huge project that they are just making a start on first let s look at some of its simplifying assumptions none of which apply to our earth no surprise one of its assumptions is that populations grow to carrying capacity via the logistic equation as we ve seen the population is going to level off due to prosperity instead having plenty of resources is leading to a reduction rather than an increase of population paradoxically we reached close to peak child a decade or so ago and the population is now growing mainly because people are living longer with each year as we ve seen the population is going to level off due to prosperity instead having plenty of resources is leading to a reduction rather than an increase of population paradoxically we reached close to peak child a decade or so ago and the population is now growing mainly because people are living longer with each year they do however assume that renewables can sustain the same population as the non green power supply e g fossil fuels that does apply to earth however arguably long term the potential power supply from renewables is vaster than from fossil fuels a small fraction of the sahara desert can provide enough solar power to power the entire world at its current levels some people object to this idea based on energy return on energy invested eroei well solar power has proved to be superb as have some other renewables that does apply to earth however arguably long term the potential power supply from renewables is vaster than from fossil fuels a small fraction of the sahara desert can provide enough solar power to power the entire world at its current levels some people object to this idea based on energy return on energy invested eroei well solar power has proved to be superb as have some other renewables it also assumes that the non renewable power source can make the planet uninhabitable in a runaway effect through a heating term perhaps this is inspired by james hansen s venus hothouse idea if so it is disproved see below no amount of degradation of earth s environment would make earth uninhabitable for humans indeed it is becoming more habitable if anything as we ll see it s the transition that s the problem but i in their model they assume infinite reserves of the non renewable environment damaging resource this might seem strange but it is a common simplification if you don t want to have to deal with the complexities of a finite item of fixed size just assume it is infinite and leave the complication of a finite resource to a later study of course if there were infinite reserves of oil or coal eventually as you burn enough then you would get a runaway greenhouse for sure if extra terrestrials have more fossil fuel than us or a more sensitive environment it might apply to them so what is actually going to happen to earth as we are now we are on target to feed everyone by 2100 using conventional agriculture with the population predicted to level off at 11 billion according to the un population division there are challenges but it is well within our capability with higher standards of living and better medical care most families are content to have two children once you take account of the childless and single that leads to populations that drop below replacement through social changes in a situation of resource abundance rather than resource scarcity japan already have a rapidly declining population we can feed everyone too according to experts so long as we continue with the measures we are doing already such as starting a new green revolution in africa that got missed out in the 50s through to 70s it s not going to happen automatically but we can do it with food security and we can do it while ramping up power levels too and bringing everyone up to the quality of life we enjoy in the more developed countries this is not pie in the sky it is the view of leading scientists and hard nosed politicians as we ll see as i get into the details according to the un population division there are challenges but it is well within our capability with higher standards of living and better medical care most families are content to have two children once you take account of the childless and single that leads to populations that drop below replacement through social changes in a situation of resource abundance rather than resource scarcity japan already have a rapidly declining population we can feed everyone too according to experts so long as we continue with the measures we are doing already such as starting a new green revolution in africa that got missed out in the 50s through to 70s it s not going to happen automatically but we can do it with food security and we can do it while ramping up power levels too and bringing everyone up to the quality of life we enjoy in the more developed countries this is not pie in the sky it is the view of leading scientists and hard nosed politicians as we ll see as i get into the details we can ramp up power as well while keeping everything headed towards a carbon neutral eventual future that is not pie in the sky it is feasible it s what the paris agreement is all about and hard nosed politicians have signed up for it in every country worldwide except the us which also was signed up for it before the current president withdrew actually technically the us is still in it to the end of his current term so yes we can have a decent standard of living for everyone too what could happen even longer term the carrying capacity of earth is rather soft using the technology proposed for space habitats we could have the equivalent of the population of four new planets from floating sea cities covering just 0 5 of the pacific growing all their food and getting all their water just using sea water and the air and not exploiting anything else we could do that for far less technology per person than a space colony growing all their food and getting all their water just using sea water and the air and not exploiting anything else we could do that for far less technology per person than a space colony we also have the possibility of vast amounts of power in the future either from nuclear fusion if we manage to develop it by then and it is easy to use or space based solar power which japan is exploring or maybe some other power source including possibly ideas we haven t thought of yet it could increase by orders of magnitude they never claimed any direct relevance to earth and expect future studies to be more detailed exploring the range of futures for extra terrestrial civilizations as they do so perhaps they may find trajectories resembling the one we ourselves are on but at present it is just too simple a model to apply to earth for more on this see my what about cascades of tipping points leading to a hothouse earth the article is mainly about things that could happen centuries to thousands of years into the future it doesn t really conflict with the ipcc who have already concluded that these tipping points may have significant but probably minor effects before 2100 because it is a meta study and it is just looking at ideas for future research there are no dates in it and there is no new fundamental research the press release didn t give timescales and many of the news stories just riffed off the press release and the authors don t read the paper itself when you read the paper they still don t give timescales but it becomes clear that for most of this they are talking about things that could happen over centuries to millennia they are not conflicting with the ipcc which does climate projections mainly through to 2100 it is more that they are looking at a much longer future timescale also they don t have any proof and no new data or research it s more like a meta study a result of looking at many other papers and then drawing up a hypothesis for other scientists to study as they say in their conclusion our initial analysis here needs to be underpinned by more in depth quantitative earth system analysis and modeling studies to address three critical questions i is humanity at risk for pushing the system across a planetary threshold and irreversibly down a hothouse earth pathway ii what other pathways might be possible in the complex stability landscape of the earth system and what risks might they entail iii what planetary stewardship strategies are required to maintain the earth system in a manageable stabilized earth state indeed there is not a single future date in the article it is all qualitative the diagrams in it are just sketches with an arrow indicating time but no markers along the time axis of centuries or millennia it isn t really adding anything new over the previous studies it is more of a meta study this is one of their diagrams they are saying there are things we can do in the next couple of decades that can get the earth into a good state one in which it will neither get too hot nor too cold for hundreds of thousands of years they call this earth system stewardship we are currently in that stabilized earth region of the chart if we stay well within 2 c which is the ideal target of the paris agreement to stay within 1 5 c then we are good for hundreds of thousands of years into the future to have a stable temperature without the huge fluctuations of the ice ages however they say we are at a kind of decision point where the things we do for the next several decades could tip us into the hothouse earth cycle that then could lead to earth getting a lot hotter centuries to more like thousands of years into the future other scientists are skeptical of this report it is not proved and there are no actual future dates in the article it is all qualitative about things that might happen mostly centuries to millennia into the future it has good news however if we do manage to avoid the higher business as usual which we are already doing we have also avoided the next ice age too and we are headed for the optimal stabilized earth so this is good news for future generations so long as we manage to avoid excessive temperature rises we can avoid the hothouse earth and even thousands of years into the future our climate will be stable see my also see later in this page next ice age postponed aren t we all going to run out of oxygen to breathe in a warmer world no not true at all there is plenty of oxygen in the atmosphere for many thousands of years and so there is nothing to worry about of that nature it s not only us that will be fine there is enough oxygen there for all the animals in the world to breathe for the foreseeable future even if impossibly photosynthesis ceased completely world wide this is also taking account of all the natural processes that remove it we are fine for oxygen for thousands of years no matter what happens are we headed for a world without insects are we headed for a world without insects this featured as main story on the tv with a claim that we risked all insects vanishing in 40 years but this is not true at all it is a case of low quality research with a dramatic and scary conclusion being promoted through the roof by the press and high quality research with the opposite conclusion quietly ignored or not even noticed this research was immediately criticized by ecologists it was a not a systematic survey for one the researchers just did a search for articles with declin in the title so of course they mainly found articles about declining populations they also found very few studies outside of europe and the us for the whole of china and for australia the only articles they found were about honey bees a domesticated insect this is like including reports of declining numbers of sheep in an article on declining numbers of mammals most of their world map was a complete blank those purple bars in australia and china are for the domestic honeybee there were some points in it of interest to academic readers who knew how to evaluate its limitations but it should never have got so much publicity a week or so later the un biodiversity in agriculture report came out their section on insects was systematic and thorough based on sent in reports by experts in many countries reporting to the un found a mixed picture some stable some with mixed trends some countries reported increases of pollinators such as nepal and also parts of europe due to a policy encouraging flower rich field margins they reported that the german study which found decreased insect numbers in nature reserves had lead to a new organization to do something about it it is probably due to insecticides and agricultural practices reducing field margins so there is much one can do the only habitats they identified with a significant decreasing trend in insects worldwide were for pastures grazed by livestock we can pollinate the few crops that need pollination using domesticated insects such as honey bees and the tropical stingless bees but wild insects add to the diversity and increase crop yields they reported on many projects to help improve pollinator diversity more on this later see below do we risk a runaway to a venus hothouse don t we risk making the world as uninhabitable as venus by triggering a runaway greenhouse effect by burning all the fossil fuels this is not true it was a theory due to james hansen who though he is a climate scientist has a reputation of exaggerated statements about climate change he published this idea without any calculations to back it up in a popular book with no peer review he did not cite any published work on the subject in is book stephen hawking also believed this and promoted it in an interview with the bbc it was soon disproved as soon as the theorists set to work to run the calculations carefully to do that we would have to burn ten times the total reserves of oil gas and coal in the world more on this later see below what about the methane bomb clathrate gun others will tell you that the methane below the ocean floor in the arctic will cause a rapid temperature increase of several degrees there were scientists skeptical of this from the beginning and it is now effectively disproved the methane has been leaking for millions of years since before there was ice in the arctic the warming temperatures only affect the top 1 6 meters which are indeed very slowly destabilizing in summer months only and they are not able to contribute significantly to global warming more on this later see below melting of polar ice others say that when we have an ice free summer in the arctic this will lead to rapid melting of all the ice at the poles no that is not true the sun is always low near the horizon in the arctic region and it is dark for half the year sun never rises at all the extra albedo from ice melting there has a feedback effect locally leading to more ice melt in summer than otherwise but not globally also this is sea ice floating on the sea and it melting makes no difference to sea levels worldwide this is taken account of in the models used by climate change and is a minor effect siberian and canadian permafrost nor can the siberian permafrost melting do this if the temperature goes up a bit they start destabilizing and add to the co 2 long term but they can t warm up the climate enough to significantly increase their own effects i it s a result of something else us warming the climate then a bit extra added not a runaway and it can go both ways on the 3 c pathway we are on now it could be a carbon sink through peat and vegetation growing we can also encourage vegetation to help make it more carbon negative by irrigation on our present pathway the range of co 2 emissions is enough for something between a temperature rise by a small fraction of a degree by 2200 and a temperature drop by the same amount most of it after 2100 both less than a tenth of a degree total more on this later see below no known runaway effects the sensationalist press make a lot of this that there are some effects that are not included in the models such as the arctic permafrost what they ignore is the reasoning that gives justification for leaving them out in a systematic review by the royal society they concluded that there are no known runaway effects nothing that acts like a gun or bomb yes if we warm the climate and that can lead to some additional warming over long timescales but nothing that exhibits threshold behaviour i go into all of these in more detail with cites in the section delayed effects below the ipcc say that whenever we stop co 2 emissions if we ramp down all the way to carbon neutral then whatever temperatures we reached by the those are the temperatures we are at from then on apart from a tiny fraction of a degree there may be some temperature rise baked in as a result of the masking effect of so2 aerosols from coal burning and the like which cool the planet down slightly but if so it s only a fraction of a degree around 0 15 c and if we stop the co 2 and remove the black soot which has a warming effect at the same time as we reduce the so2 we can prevent even that global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 1 figure 1 5 if we stop all aerosol emissions yellow line there is a short term bump in temperature by 0 15 degrees and returning to the previous temperatures in 20 years and ending with a reduction to 0 25 c below the present by 2100 temperatures go down slowly as soon as we reach carbon neutral depending how you define carbon neutral if you define carbon neutral as continuing to produce enough co 2 to exactly match the natural negative emissions from all co 2 sinks including the sea then temperatures stay more or less level rising slightly the blue line if it means a net zero anthropogenic emissions they go down because the excess co 2 in the atmosphere is gradually removed over time by natural processes with the yellow and purple lines current policies a little over 3 c according to climate action tracker our current policies keep us within 3 3 c while the unconditional pledges and targets keep us within 3 0 c with a 66 or greater chance of remaining within 3 2 c this is their summary graphic in the absence of policies global warming is expected to reach 4 1 c 4 8 c above pre industrial by the end of the century current policies presently in place around the world are projected to result in about 3 3 c warming above pre industrial levels the unconditional pledges and targets that governments have made including ndcs 2 as of december 2018 would limit warming to about 3 0 c above pre industrial levels or in probabilistic terms likely 66 or greater chance limit warming below 3 2 c temperatures climate action tracker as soon as we stop emissions that s it as far as temperature increases go but the temperature reached whatever it is persists for centuries from the ipcc here yes there are some lingering minor effects such as the siberian permafrost or removal of masking effect of anthropogenic emissions the climate doomsdayers make a lot of those minor effects and claim they are major but there is no basis for that as we ll see the ipcc report is not rewritten by governments this is something that is often said to discredit the ipcc but it is not true at all it arises from a confusion over the review process for the summary for policy makers this is indeed scrutinized line by line by the governments worldwide as a final stage but only to ensure that the report has been summarized accurately for the general public they do not rewrite the report itself this is done at the end after the report has been finished by the scientists there are three stages first the experts review the entire report then experts together with the governments and the final stage focuses only on the overview chapter the governments are involved to make sure that the overview chapter is is accurate well balanced and presents the findings of the underlying report clearly it is most helpful for non scientists anyway and won t make much difference to those interested in the background science who will probably focus on the main report it does also give you an index into the rest of the report helping you to find relevant material they give the chapter headings and sections in the overview so you can then go to the sections written by the scientists in the original report to check what it is they are summarizing the ipcc do not do any research themselves rather they are a review body that looks over the climate change literature of the last several years and scrutinize it carefully assessing things not just by the number of studies but their scientific merit and the amount of certainty in their conclusions they are widely respected by the climate scientists yes we can stay within 1 5 c in the 2018 report the ipcc said in their review that we can stay within 1 5 c if we act right away they were clear about this in both the report itself and the speeches made by the co chairs in the extended press conference we need to increase the pledges for the paris agreement considerably by 2030 but we can do it there is a mechanism in place to increase pledges every year so this is certainly possible if there is the political will the graph that came with the report shows this 1 5 c pathway it reaches 1 5 c at 2040 and then levels off graph here this was hugely misrepresented in the press even in the mainstream press co 2 pricing misunderstanding in the new york times i ve already touched on the new york times report which said that we need carbon pricing at 27 000 per ton by 2100 confusing mitigation costs with incentive pricing this is what they said for instance the report says that heavy taxes or prices on carbon dioxide emissions perhaps as high as 27 000 per ton by 2100 would be required major climate report describes a strong risk of crisis as early as 2040 this has been taken up by many other media outlets and blogs in support of climate catastrophism and the idea that it is hopeless or that the measures are politically impossible to implement however this is completely mistaken the section they got that number from says in its intro the price of carbon assessed here is fundamentally different from the concepts of optimal carbon price in a cost benefit analysis or the social cost of carbon 2 5 2 1 price of carbon emissions from global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 2 page 152 in the rest of the intro they explain that what they are referring to here is the cost of mitigating the effects of that extra ton of co 2 to unpack this a bit more then for instance if our co 2 emissions lead to a sea level rise that 27 000 would include a contribution to the cost of all the sea barriers to contain the rising sea through to 2100 it is a completely different idea from the pricing you need to use as an incentive to stop emitting the co 2 which is only one of many measures you might use in a combined program some countries use carbon pricing others don t later in that very same section from the ipcc that the ny times misquoted they talk about an incentive price and they make various suggestions mostly in the range of 5 to 50 or so depending on whether it is used on its own or as part of a larger program of measures taking the us electrical sector as an example they say furthermore a mix of stringent energy efficiency policies e g minimum performance standards building codes combined with a carbon tax rising from 10 per ton in 2020 to 27 per ton in 2040 is more cost effective than a carbon tax alone from 20 to 53 per ton to generate a 1 5 c pathway for the u s electric sector likewise a policy mix encompassing a moderate carbon price 7 per ton in 2015 combined with a ban on new coal based power plants and dedicated policies addressing renewable electricity generation capacity and electric vehicles reduces efficiency losses compared with an optimal carbon pricing in 2030 2 5 2 1 price of carbon emissions from global warming of 1 5 ºc chapter 2 page 153 to make it more readable i removed cites and rewrote usd2010 to and tco 2 t ¹ to per ton the ny times journalist just cherry picked one paragraph with that high number in it without understanding its context at all yet this has been taken up by so many other blogs and articles search google and this is the top result a search snippet highlighted by google s algorithm the hill reports it the same way as the nytimes the ipcc claims in its latest report that action must be taken to avert global warming of 1 5 degrees celsius by the end of the century a benchmark it says comes with costly climate consequences its recommendation a carbon tax of as much as 200 per ton of carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 to an astonishing 27 000 per ton by 2100 for america families this could mean the price of gasoline soaring to 240 per gallon remember when we thought 4 per gallon was high gas at 240 per gallon ipcc report lays out high cost of carbon taxes and a google search turns up many more articles and blog posts saying the same thing this is all completely mistaken as you can see from the quotes from the ipcc report itself that i just gave four ways to get to 1 5 c what they actually said is that if we cut co 2 emissions rapidly in the next 12 years then we can achieve a 1 5 c rise easily if we don t do that it is hard to avoid 2 c by 2050 to 2060 though we can still get back to 1 5 c by burning lots of biofuel and capturing the co 2 from burning it for the rest of the century and other forms of carbon capture and storage they looked at four different ways of staying within 1 5 c the best is to cut emissions quickly especially since coral reefs are nearly extinct after just two years at 2 c and delayed reductions mean a few years at 2 c these are the four main pathways the cover in the report in their investigation of ways to remain within 1 5 c that s the goal of the paris agreement and they were tasked with both finding out what was needed to remain within this and what the difference is between effects at 1 5 c and 2 c the p1 pathway assumes rapid reduction by 45 by 2030 and then a reduction to to 0 emissions by 2050 it never requires a negative emissions in total but some of the co 2 is offset by negative emissions through afforestation shown in brown in the diagram which is already going on china particularly is doing a lot of afforestation the yellow in these diagrams is active removal by continually recycling the trees in forests by burning biofuels and capturing the co 2 i shared this graph before but let s look at it again which shows conceptually the idea of the two approaches the p1 path is like the one on the right and the other ones have increasing amounts of temporary excess like the one on the left the other main alternative they discussed involves reaching 2 c at around 2050 2060 but then for the rest of the century we use carbon capture and storage however they were widely misrepresented in the press with a claim that they required as yet unproven expensive methods for taking carbon directly from the atmosphere this is not what they said instead they said we could do it by growing vast forests for fuel and then burning that fuel in plants that capture the co 2 emissions from the fuel burning this works because the trees as they grow take co 2 from the atmosphere and as they are burnt the co 2 is then captured and the next generation of trees repeats the process it would be a huge challenge to do that but it is known technology the main thing would be scaling up the carbon capture and storage for the emissions from the wood burning power stations but that s far easier than taking it out of the atmosphere with several plants already doing this the main disadvantages of this second approach apart from the expense and complexity is that it means that the corals are nearly extinct at 2 c and it just takes a couple of years at that temperature to kill most of them to the extent that recovery is difficult the other two ways they discuss in the report are a mix of some early reductions and some reafforestation and biofuels with later carbon capture and storage with more capture needed if the early reductions are less they didn t find any other ecosystems that are as sensitive as the corals not even the mangrove swamps which was one of the other ones they looked at for climate sensitivity the 2018 report was actually a little more optimistic than expected if anything they raised the co 2 emissions level needed to stay within 1 5 c due to re examining of past data see thick layers of ice take a very long time to melt centuries to millennia when our emissions reach a net zero no more added than is removed then the temperature increases stop and then start to go down as the co 2 levels reduce however the world does continue to change and there is a lot of lag there mainly because of the ice and the ocean the permafrost would continue to melt as would the ice in western antarctica and greenland that s a slow process because ice has huge thermal inertia icebergs can spend months and longer in warm water before they melt there are lakes in new zealand that often gets icebergs from glaciers and once there they continue for ages bizarrely you get ice bergs in warm water in summer click to watch in youtube those are icebergs in the full sunlight of a new zealand summer day so think how slowly ice must melt in the far colder conditions at the poles the poles will still experience the six month polar winter every year and only glancing sunlight even in the arctic or antarctic summer so yes the ice in greenland and antarctica will melt eventually until it reaches whatever level of cover is in equilibrium with the climate but this is an immensely long process the greenland and antarctic ice will persist for a long time in a warmer world for much longer than the year or two of those new zealand icebergs indeed both will be covered in kilometers thick layers of ice for tens of thousands of years in any of the future scenarios it just takes that long to melt so much ice in a slightly warmer world the sea level continues to rise partly from this ice melting and partly also from the sea warming up the sea has a huge thermal capacity and will gradually take up heat from the atmosphere but that s another thousands of years process the warmer sea expands for the smaller sea level rises about half the sea level rise is from the sea expanding rather than ice melting all that would continue if we stopped emissions right away but at a lesser rate than if we were going to a warmer world about 15 40 of the emitted carbon remains in the atmosphere for 1000 years however none of this changes the situation that the world slowly starts to cool as soon as emissions stop in the 1 5 c scenario on most scenarios that end up with zero emissions even as the ice melts the world is cooling down as co 2 gradually comes out of the atmosphere dissolved in the sea taken up in peat bogs swamps and salt marshes in the soil as it builds up and so on removing co 2 through re afforestation we can also remove co 2 from the atmosphere more rapidly by burning wood and then using carbon capture on the co 2 produced every time you do that it takes some co 2 from the atmosphere we can also remove co 2 by re afforestation and reversing desertification improving the soil also takes co 2 out of the atmosphere as does making forests more species rich if eventually for instance we regreen the sahara desert back to the way it was 5000 bc when it was pastureland rather than desert that would take large amounts of co 2 from the atmosphere the sahara dust fertilizes the amazon massive amounts of saharan dust fertilize the amazon rainforest but 11000 to 5000 bc then the sahara was green green sahara african humid periods paced by earth s orbital changes so the amazon jungle can manage fine without the sahara dust or less of it we are already doing afforestation as part of the measures to deal with climate change china planted nearly 79 million hectares by 2015 under the bonn challenge 56 countries from central and south america mainly are pledged to restore 350 million hectares of forest by 2030 all four of the ipcc s scenarios for remaining within 1 5 c involved some measure of afforestation in a recent study reported in scientific american researchers who planted a mix of trees rather than a single species found that they removed 32 tons per hectare instead of the more usual 12 tons reverting non forest land to forests globally could offset around 253 billion tons of co 2 between 2018 and 2100 which is equivalent to seven years of global co 2 emissions at current levels carbon brief have a map of where reafforestation is happening around the world and with a summary of the research and the opportunities and challenges here mapped where afforestation is taking place around the world effect of co 2 on plant growth trees and plants grow faster in a world with more co 2 due to the co 2 fertilization effect trees increase in productivity by around 23 percent over pre industrial and crops boosted by 11 5 percent for most like wheat and rice but some like corn which use a more efficient form of photosynthesis can t benefit so much from the extra co 2 because they are so efficient at fixating co 2 already and are only boosted by 8 4 percent a downside is that food crops can lose a significant amount of zinc and iron in a warming world and grains also lose protein ask the experts does rising co 2 benefit plants there s a likely increase of productivity of trees by 23 to 28 until 2050 but the responses are more pronounced in young trees also a study of european trees in 2018 found that though the volume increased by 29 to 100 up to a doubling of the volume added the density decreased by 8 to 12 percent so they produce much more wood but it tends to be lighter offsetting some of the gains trees and climate change faster growth lighter wood grasses also increase in productivity with more co 2 but it depends on the species one study for instance found that the optimal levels of co 2 for grass depend on the species we found that the optimal co 2 concentrations occurred at 945 915 and 1151 ppm for the aboveground biomass of tall fescue perennial ryegrass and kentucky bluegrass respectively the optimal co 2 concentrations for the growth of three perennial grass species overview of some of the research through to 2012 here the effect can also be seen from orbit with satellite measurements leaf area is increasing this greening is a combination of new leaves on existing plants as well as an increase in the amount of land covered by plants and shrubs only a few areas less than 4 show a browning effect many areas have an increase of more than 50 rising co 2 has greened world s plants and trees carbon brief the researchers estimated that 70 of the extra growth is due to rising co 2 in the atmosphere another 8 is due to climate shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns especially for high latitudes like the tibetan plateau and the sahel region in africa the arctic is getting greener of course because of the melting permafrost and the amazon jungle areas are too however interestingly then the rest is due to effects such as more nitrogen in the soil from fertilizer changes in forest cover grazing and intensive farming this is a video summary click to watch in youtube soil improvement it is possible that soil improvement also could make a big difference as the soil is improved co 2 is taken up from the atmosphere the amount that can be removed in this way is hard to estimate but it could remove 200 gt by 2100 which could increase to 500 gt by techniques such composting rather than burning soil revenues limited tilling and mixing biochar currently human activities are running at just under 37 gt in 2017 so soil improvement could take up between 5 and 13 years of emissions at 2017 levels i got those figures of co 2 emissions from here this is a summary in a recent review from 2018 of co 2 removal methods in addition to mixing biochar into soils recent studies have focused on replenishing or enhancing organic carbon in cultivated soils through various agricultural practices such as limiting tilling and composting rather than burning crop residues earlier studies suggested a very limited possible role for soil enrichment however more recent analyses suggest a physical removal potential of 200 gt co 2 by 2100 and this could possibly be increased up to 500 gt co 2 by practices such as soil carbon enrichment at greater depths evaluating climate geoengineering proposals in the context of the paris agreement temperature goals no we are not going to lose all the world s soil in 40 years this is a much shared old scientific american article from 2013 at the early stages of the food and agricultural organization s global soil partnership the article itself is here as we ll see it is hyperbole and click bait even the scientific american does do occasional click bait titles it never was literally true however it was the beginning of the fao soil health initiative which has continued and is making a big difference to soil health worldwide subtitle generating three centimeters of top soil takes 1 000 years and if current rates of degradation continue all of the world s top soil could be gone within 60 years a senior un official said it was followed up by a big report in 2015 that confirmed that preserving the health of world soils is very important and mapping out the problems and solutions this has been followed by global action and co ordination focused on world soil health this has been going on for a long time back in 1996 glasod gave this summary the global assessment of human induced soil degradation glasod has shown that damage has occurred on 15 percent of the world s total land area 13 percent light and moderate 2 percent severe and very severe mainly resulting from erosion nutrient decline salinization and physical compaction however during this period agricultural productivity has increased and food security increased so while some of the soil is degrading in other places we are doing things right and finding ways to increase productivity hugely through a four fold increase in the global population though soil degradation is a serious matter there s a lot being done to reverse desertification and improve soils here is an example of what you can achieve at a local level a rather dramatic greening the desert in the jordan using only the methods of permaculture they didn t extract water from any subsurface aquifers just used the natural rainfall that fell on their plot in winter and techniques of permaculture to improve the soil health click to watch in youtube here is his ted talk click to watch in youtube there are many initiatives underway to reverse desertification such as the sahara great green wall project it started as an idea of a literal wall of trees but this was not successful and it has evolved into a vision of a mosaic of many practices such as incorporating trees into the agriculture they are doing already and other methods of reversing desertification depending on the local situation for instance in many places then shrubs and grass may grow better than the trees you can also grow food without soil that s what aquaponics and aeroponics does a world without soil is not a world without agriculture we could have a civilization on the moon according to the dreams of space colonists growing crops with no soil at all or making soil directly from lunar basalt this is a frame from a charming russian movie about the moon made in 1965 before humans landed there looking out on the lunar surface from inside a moon city in a frame from the 1965 russian film luna and here is a section of the movie itself with the peaches a few seconds in click to watch in youtube you can also watch the full movie in restored colour with machine translation subtitles for part of it there has been a lot of research on this since then and it does seem feasible to have agriculture on the moon for more about this see my in my why humans on mars right now are bad for science includes astronaut gardener on the moon but we can also keep our soils in good condition for more on this see my what is the worst can happen we continue to have winter and summer in all the scenarios this does nothing to the tilt of earth which leads to the changes of temperature between summer and winter where i live on the isle of mull we have less than seven hours of daylight in the middle of winter while in the middle of summer it gets so light at night that the entire night counts as twilight never reaching complete darkness that won t change we will still have six month long winters of total darkness at the poles the himalayas are also always going to be cold in all the scenarios even with no climate policies at all tibet mongolia the high andes the alps these are all going to remain cold in all scenarios if warmer than before the ice in greenland and antarctica is still there for thousands of years in a warming world as it takes that long to melt it all the arctic sea ice can melt in summer at the highest temperatures but in winter when the sun never rises at all it will still be very cold in the arctic it s a world of less ice and fewer glaciers but not no ice so clearly not an uninhabitable world on any scenario james hansen s venus hothouse syndrome can t happen the idea that even the worst of climate changes would make humanity extinct is utterly ridiculous it often comes from james hansen s exaggeration in his book storms of our grandchildren published in 2008 and still available to buy at amazon it says incorrectly after the ice has gone would the earth proceed to the venus syndrome a runaway greenhouse effect that would destroy all life on the planet perhaps permanently while that is difficult to say based on present information i ve come to conclude that if we burn all reserves of oil gas and coal there is a substantial chance we will initiate the runaway greenhouse if we also burn the tar sands and tar shale i believe the venus syndrome is a dead certainty page 236 james hansen is a climate scientist but he is well known for his hugely exaggerated statements not based on any peer reviewed research this is an example it was just speculation which he could publish in a book without going through peer review after his book was published researchers quickly disproved it but his book is still on sale and still quoted even though everyone in the topic of climate change knows it is wrong for the background to this see my debunked climate change will make the world too hot for humans especially search the page for the section could it be possible to turn earth into a second venus stephen hawking made a similar claim he s a brilliant physicist everyone agrees noted for his work in general relativity and black holes and he is the theorist behind hawking radiation and his work is careful and meticulous in this topic area and brilliant however he has never done any research in climate change afaik the bbc interviewed him on his birthday asking what his views are on trump s withdrawal and he said in the interview here we are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible trump s action could push the earth over the brink to become like venus with a temperature of 250 degrees and raining sulfuric acid climate change is one of the great dangers we face and it s one we can prevent if we act now he is so famous that whatever he says just gets reported straight as is not only by the bbc by top papers too some famous people respond to fame like this by making pronouncements in areas that are way outside their sphere of expertise on topics that they have never studied academically stephen hawking often does this towards the end of his life he took to making predictions of the future saying that we are doomed in one way or another it s not true he does not present the facts he exaggerates things and some of his predictions are frankly just bizarre i ve had to debunk him six times so far to help scared people see debunked stephen hawking s predictions of the world ending this was just not true see my the hurricanes heat waves fires and flooding are not global events i d like to do a bit of an aside here to help people who are panicking about this i often get people contact me scared of things that couldn t possibly do anything to them this may be obvious once i say it but it needs to be said for some people who are really scared and not thinking clearly also for very young children you will get natural hazards like the fires heat waves flooding and hurricanes and we ll get more of those as a result of climate change but don t think of them as covering the entire world that just can t happen for instance you are not going to get a heat wave at all if you live somewhere really cold like lose to the arctic circle you aren t going to get a proper hurricane if you live in europe because hurricanes cross the atlantic from west to east and never make landfall in europe strong winds yes hurricanes proper no you aren t at risk of a forest fire if you live in a place without trees the sea in worst case rises meters by 2100 the ipcc talks about it being feet but it is possible it could be higher than their estimate because they caution that the science is not yet well settled on this but not tens of meters for sure and not the kilometers rise needed to swamp the entire world there isn t enough ice to melt to do that ever for instance this is what happens to florida with a three meters sea level rise this is much higher than the ipcc projection for 2100 of two to four feet and although that is regarded as conservative it s not likely it s as much as three meters florida before and after a 3 meter sea level rise due to melting ice from the antarctic and greenland ice sheets image made using the eustatic sea level change tool from virtual earth system laboratory vesl florida is a low lying state yet most of florida also is untouched at a three meters rise if you live in the florida keys or miami yes you may have to move house florida is especially vulnerable because the land is porous limestone for new york or netherlands they can build higher flood barriers for these low lying areas in florida the worst case is you move out or build upwards e g artificial islands or get used to miami having flooded streets at extreme high tides so yes that can happen but i get people worried about sea level rise who live nowhere near the sea it doesn t mean that the entire surface of the earth is covered in water to a depth of one meter you are only at risk if you are in a city that is already close to being flooded also for people who do live close to sea level just a meter or so above the high tide mark it is only a risk of flooding at the highest tides with storm surges to start with even with a one meter rise or more you are not going to be flooded at low tide or indeed any time except the highest spring tides once a lunar month with assistance of storms the worst case is you have to evacuate miami or convert it into a city that is a bit like venice during the occasional high tide storm surges with sea filling the streets everyone else then it s just like normal flood warnings wildfire warnings heat wave warnings and hurricane warnings but maybe more of those in the future the wildfires are only a risk if you are in a place like california already at risk of fires it s not talking about fires and flooding sweeping over the entire world or of a global hurricane that affects everyone worldwide no such thing is even possible the rcp s targeting 1 5 c 2 4 c 3 c and 4 9 c let s look at the rcp s or recognized concentration pathways these are detailed scenarios worked out so that climate modelers can run their models on the same projections for comparing them if it weren t for them everyone would use different scenarios and it would be almost impossible to either compare models or aggregate them together for statistical results rcp 2 6 reach 1 5 c 490 ppm co 2 rcp 4 5 reach 2 4 c 650 ppm co 2 rcp 6 reach 3 c 850 ppm co 2 with existing policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c with existing policies and unconditional pledges we are headed for around 3 c rcp 8 5 reach 4 9 c 1370 ppm co 2 business as usual we are already well within this one by existing policies alone for details this shows how the co 2 levels vary with the different rcp s and the emissions which are the inputs to the models they are all pretty much indistinguishable up to 2020 i got these graphs here if you look at the latest data we are on the same curve as rcp 6 0 but it s also on rcp 4 5 and 2 6 the 2 c and 1 5 c pathways we just can t tell them apart yet from the graphs but by analysing policies we are on the path for a 3 c rise by 2100 from analysis why the ipcc 1 5c report expanded the carbon budget carbon brief this shows how the atmospheric co 2 and the temperature and sea level rises over a longer time period through to 2500 with the four scenarios in the rcp 8 5 then there just aren t enough fossil fuel reserves to keep burning them for ever which is why that curve is shown as leveling off at 2000 ppm in 2200 for business as usual notice how when the atmospheric co 2 levels stop rising the temperatures almost immediately level off in all the scenarios however the sea levels continue to rise in all the scenarios except low co 2 for centuries those sea level rises are difficult to model and could be up to several times larger so anyway that s what the ipcc say in their summary of the research on the topic for the last few years 1 5 c is definitely in reach if we have the political will it requires ramping up pledges rapidly in the next several years through to 2030 but the aim is to ramp up if we stop co 2 emissions then whatever temperature it is is where we level out if we could stop all co 2 emission today then we would level of at 1 c above pre industrial and then it would gradually decline we are not going to be able to stop instantly that isn t going to happen but it shows that the rise is not inevitable until we actually reach those temperatures that is the conclusion of the ipcc delayed effects so now let s look at those delayed effects that the doomsday sayers climate catastrophists make so much of methane bomb clathrate gun hypothesis effectively disproved many of those posts that say we have a much higher temperature rise baked in rely on the clathrate gun hypothesis which is effectively disproved now this is how it is supposed to work the clathrates are a form of ice with methane locked inside it on the floors of the arctic ocean it floats in water like ordinary ice so any that remains on the sea floor has to be bound to the sediment it s stable at higher temperatures than ordinary ice up to a few degrees depending on pressure there are thick deposits frozen into the sea bed below the arctic ocean the only ones that matter are the ones within 100 meters of the surface any deeper and the methane dissolves out of the bubbles into sea water on the way up to the surface as the sea is very undersaturated in methane however it s now known that only the top layers of the clathrates are warm enough to start to destabilize only the top 1 6 meters and they do so only very slowly centuries because they are only warmed sufficiently for less than half the year and this doesn t seem to be enough for fast destabilizing there have been skeptics all along it is thermodynamically difficult because it s an endothermic reaction the opposite of the idea of an explosion you get from the word gun if you try to get it going some will dissociate absorb the heat and that will cool down the rest and it just stops carolyn ruppel lead author of the usgs metastudy puts it like this click to watch in youtube so the deposits locally can t explosively dissociate it would need a huge feedback into the global climate to do this but the metastudies show that this just isn t present instead it is a very slow burner over thousands of years not even much affected by the increasing temperatures since they have been warm enough to destabilize already for thousands of years the usgs metastudy in 2017 by the usgs gas hydrates project concluded our review is the culmination of nearly a decade of original research by the usgs my coauthor professor john kessler at the university of rochester and many other groups in the community said usgs geophysicist carolyn ruppel who is the paper s lead author and oversees the usgs gas hydrates project after so many years spent determining where gas hydrates are breaking down and measuring methane flux at the sea air interface we suggest that conclusive evidence for release of hydrate related methane to the atmosphere is lacking gas hydrate breakdown unlikely to cause massive greenhouse gas release that s from the big usgs review in 2017 and the royal society did one too and then in 2018 the big gas hydrates research project cage finally proved that the methane has been leaking gradually for millions of years and is not a new thing it is pretty much settled it s not even a consideration at all for climate modeling now for more about this see this my update of the wikipedia article which is now very dated on this topic and sadly they don t seem likely to update it any time soon so i ve done my own update of it in our doomsday debunked wiki to include the latest research from 2017 though to 2018 siberian and canadian permafrost more recently those who say that the ipcc have left out big unknown effects have switched to the siberian permafrost this is nothing to do with the clathrate gun hypothesis indeed it is not about methane clathrates at all there is some methane locked into the permafrost already but not a lot instead it s just ordinary ground filled with frozen grass other vegetation bodies of animals including mammoths in siberia and other creatures that have been frozen for thousands of years also a lot of it is just frozen peat as the climate warms up then gradually the permafrost melts it s a slow process as that happens those organics are exposed to liquid water and the atmosphere parts that are dry produce co 2 but can also take up co 2 from the new vegetation that grows on them also as the permafrost melts peat will start to grow over large areas and peat growth takes up a lot of co 2 parts that are wet not well drained can produce methane because in wet conditions somewhat blocked off from the surface without access to air then decomposing microbes tend to produce methane instead of co 2 they do that just because there isn t any oxygen available to make the co 2 so it attracts different kinds of microbes that produce methane instead because the methane is produced below the surface most of it gets converted to other organics and to co 2 as it gradually percolates towards the surface figure taken from this paper showing some of the processes the methane is produced deep underground it gets involved in many chemical reactions

job seekers and recruiters gather at techfair in los angeles california reuters the new north american free trade pact would modestly boost the us economy especially auto parts production but may curb vehicle assembly and limit consumer choice in cars a hotly anticipated analysis from the us international trade commission showed the itc report is a crucial step in the push for congress to consider ratification of the us mexico canada agreement signed by president donald trump and the leaders of the other two countries last year to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement the report estimates that us real gross domestic product would increase by 0 35 per cent or 68 5 billion on an annual basis compared to a nafta baseline and would add 176 000 us jobs while raising us exports the itc s estimates are for year six of the trade deal once it is fully implemented the trade deal s success or failure in congress could be determined by how it is expected to affect the us auto industry a sector that steadily drained jobs to mexico under nafta the usmca deal contains much tighter regional content rules requiring that 75 per cent of a vehicle s value be sourced in north american versus 62 5 per cent currently and 40 45 per cent produced in high wage areas namely the united states and canada auto industry employment would rise by 30 000 jobs for parts and engine production but us vehicle assembly would decline us vehicle prices would rise up to 1 6 per cent causing consumption to fall by 140 000 units per year or about 1 25 per cent of 2017 sales the report said the report overall was more positive than initially anticipated by economists who said the traditional economic models used by the itc to measure previous trade deals would result in minimal gains for the united states white house economic adviser kevin hassett told reuters that he was pleasantly surprised by the results which used different modeling methods that he called accurate and well done their estimate is a lot closer to what we think usmca will do than i expected hassett in a telephone interview this is very strong argument for passing the usmca the us trade representative s office had prepared a separate analysis of the usmca s automotive benefits that was described as a rosier alternative analysis aimed at limiting any potential damage from the itc report ustr estimated that the trade deal would create 76 000 automotive sector jobs within five years as automakers invest some 34 billion in new plants to comply with the pact s regional content rules the total includes about 15 billion in projects already announced ustr officials said their analysis was based on plans disclosed by automakers to the trade agency for compliance with the new agreement s tighter rules of origin they have verbally committed to us that they intend to comply with the rules a senior ustr official said and they have told us that this is not going to have significant upward pressure on vehicle prices but the itc report said some automakers may decide not to offer vehicles that would be too expensive to bring into compliance with the deal reducing consumer choice in the us auto market discrepancies between the two reports could provide ammunition for lawmakers to oppose usmca democrats who control the house of representatives have greeted the trade deal coolly due to concerns about the enforceability of new labour provisions that aim to drive up wages in mexico and concerns that data protections for biologic drug makers could drive up health care costs the itc report said mexican union wages would rise by 17 2 per cent if the labour provisions agreed in the usmca are enforced even so mexican factory wages remain far lower than those in the united states the deal will lead to new access for us exports of dairy poultry and egg products to canada and us imports of sugar and sugar containing products from canada the itc said ustr touted the dairy and poultry sectors as key beneficiaries of the deal when it was announced last year the itc s forecast estimated total us dairy product output would increase by 226 8 million or 0 1 per cent us agriculture and food exports overall would increase by 435 million senator chuck grassley a republican from iowa a top farming state who chairs the senate finance committee praised the report for recognizing the deal s benefits many of the significant improvements in usmca are reducing non tariff barriers and implementing rules and fair practices that will help us workers jobs and businesses tremendously over the coming years grassley said in an emailed statement the us trade deficit in february fell to its lowest level in eight months thanks in part to rising aircraft and auto exports according to government data recently the trade deficit which fell for the second month in a row after hitting a 10 year high in december also was helped by record exports of us services according to the commerce department reuters

april 19 2019 indicative forward looking sofr term rates erik heitfield and yang ho park on june 12 2020 a technical correction was made to more accurately model certain sofr futures contracts as a result some forward looking term rates published after this date may differ slightly from those published previously in addition publication of compound average term rates data was discontinued on may 2 2018 1 month july 2 2018 3 months and october 1 2018 6 months more recent compounded average term rate data are available at on november 8 2019 the realized term rates data were extended back to september 22 2014 and the ordering of data in the csv file was changed so that the most recent observations appear first on september 23 2019 a technical correction was made to more accurately model certain sofr futures contracts as a result some term rates published after this date may differ slightly from those published previously on may 3 2019 titles for the variables labeled â backward looking term ratesâ were changed to â compound average term ratesâ to better match the definition of the variables this note presents indicative forward looking term rates derived from end of day sofr futures prices the accompanying data file also includes compound averages of daily sofr rates these rates are presented for informational purposes only and are not appropriate for use as reference rates in financial contracts the rates and the process by which they were calculated do not comply with the data quality methodology governance and other principles for financial benchmarks established by the international organization of securities commissions these rates may differ materially from any forward looking term rates or averages of sofr that may be produced in the future by any administrator including any such rate that may be endorsed by the alternative reference rates committee the authors of this note may cease updating the rates presented in the data file at any time if you choose to use one of the term rates presented here as a reference rate in a financial contract notwithstanding that the rates are not appropriate for this purpose and should not be used in commercial contracts the authors of this note and the board of governors of the federal reserve system will not be liable to you or any other person for damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with use of or inability to use the rate data rates file csv and rates data definition file txt updated may 14 2021 on may 26 2021 the authors discontinued updating this data series the alternative reference rates committee arrc announced it selected cme group as the administrator that it plans to recommend for a forward looking secured overnight financing rate sofr term rate once market indicators for the term rate are met more information 1 introduction in 2017 the alternative reference rate committee arrc a group of private sector financial market participants convened by the federal reserve with support from other u s financial regulators selected the secured overnight financing rate sofr as the recommended replacement for u s dollar libor unlike libor which is reported daily for a variety of tenors ranging from overnight to one year sofr is an overnight rate and hence adjustments will need to be made to contracts and systems designed to incorporate term rates adapting new interest rate derivatives to reference sofr rather than libor should be relatively straightforward since participants in derivatives markets already have substantial experience with overnight index swaps ois referencing rates such as the effective federal funds rate effr and sofr futures and ois contracts are already being offered in the market however financial regulators have recognized that for certain users of cash products that currently reference term interbank funding rates new term rates derived from liquid markets may be beneficial financial stability board 2018 for many loan products tied to term libor it may be possible to use term rates derived from compound or simple averages of observed sofr rates these types of averaged rates are less volatile than overnight rates can be readily calculated from published data and do not depend on the liquidity of any underlying market save the overnight repo market that underpins sofr itself in other cases such as some business loans borrowers with systems that cannot be easily adapted to backward looking rates may prefer to use forward looking term rates based on sofr that are conceptually more similar to the term libor rates they currently use while libor rates are determined by a mix of limited interbank transaction data and various judgmental approaches forward looking term sofr rates can be derived from transactions prices for sofr futures contracts the use of derivatives prices to infer forward interest rates is a common practice that is well understood by market participants although sofr derivatives markets have just begun to develop both the cme and ice now offer sofr futures contracts and there are already more transactions underlying sofr futures than are estimated to underlie libor trading volume on sofr derivatives markets seems likely to continue to grow this note describes an approach to computing forward looking term reference rates based on sofr futures contracts that is similar to that described by the alternative reference rate committee 2017 and developed in greater detail by heitfield and park 2019 prices from futures contracts that reference sofr are used to estimate market implied forward sofr rates at a given point in time these forward rates are then compounded to produce forward looking term rates although the analysis presented here relies solely on closing prices from cme sofr futures contracts this approach is quite general and could easily be adapted to incorporate data from a variety of sofr based derivatives contracts including futures traded on ice or other exchanges and sofr ois trading volume in sofr futures has grown at a rapid pace since the cme first offered contracts in may 2018 figure 1 and there is considerable headroom for liquidity to continue to improve as markets transition away from libor based products however at current levels of liquidity it is not possible to create a robust forward looking term rate based on intra day sofr futures prices the term rates presented here are derived from end of day futures prices and as such would not be appropriate reference rates in commercial contracts nonetheless they provide a good indication of how futures implied sofr term reference rates would likely perform in practice figure 1 average daily trading volume in cme sofr futures contracts 2 using futures prices to infer forward looking term rates term rates can be computed from overnight rates such as sofr by applying a simple geometric compounding formula the difference between these compound averages and forward looking term rates lies in whether observed overnight rates or expected future overnight rates i e expected forward rates are used forward looking term rates are considerably more difficult to estimate because they require that one infer market expectations from a limited set of available information invariably such inference involves imposing some assumptions that restrict the shape of the path of forward rates in our model expected forward sofr rates are assumed to potentially jump up or down on scheduled federal open market committee fomc policy rate announcement dates but remain constant during the periods between fomc meetings this assumption allows one to pin down expected forward rate paths by estimating the size of rate changes on a relatively small number of fixed calendar dates although several alternative functional forms for the forward rate path have been applied in the literature all such approaches necessarily require that one impose some simplifying assumptions because available derivatives prices do not provide enough information to identify forward rates with daily granularity figure 2 which plots sofr rates over time provides some justification for our modeling assumption while realized sofr rates do fluctuate on a daily basis they generally move within narrow bands near the effective federal funds rate with some exceptions day to day changes in sofr rates do not appear to be very predictable so it seems reasonable to assume that market expectations do not typically reflect forecasts of such fluctuations sofr rates sometimes experiences large spikes at quarter ends when repo markets must accommodate balance sheet adjustments by regulated financial institutions and treasury coupon settlements but these transitory shifts dissipate within a day or two in contrast persistent shifts in the level of sofr rates coincide with changes in the effr on fomc announcement dates figure 2 secured overnight financing rate and effective federal funds rate over time for a given estimation date the size and direction of forward rate jumps on future fomc announcement dates can be estimated by choosing values such that the implied prices of derivatives whose settlement values depend on the forward rate path match observed prices as closely as possible generally speaking in order to estimate forward rates out to a specific horizon one needs to observe prices for several contracts whose settlement windows collectively span the time horizon the term rates presented here rely on closing prices for cme futures contracts for this purpose though other sofr futures or sofr ois may also be suitable cme group began listing one month and three month sofr futures in may 2018 3 forward looking sofr term rates from june 2018 to february 2019 the accuracy of term rates derived from futures prices depends critically on the extent to which contract prices accurately capture market participants expectations about forward rates ideally prices should be timely and should not embed distortions that can arise when markets are illiquid trading volume for one month futures is concentrated in near dated contracts while three month contracts are often used to take positions on sofr rates at a one year horizon in this analysis we estimate term rates out to a six month horizon where both one month and three month contract prices provide information about market expectations end of day futures prices are used throughout this analysis but the methodology could accommodate use of intra day prices instead given sufficient trading volume figure 3 shows futures implied one three and six month sofr term rates and the overnight sofr rate from june 10 2018 to february 12 2019 the term structure for forward looking sofr term rates has generally been upward sloping though it became nearly flat around the turn of the year much of the day to day fluctuation in daily sofr rates appears to reflect idiosyncratic factors that tend to average out over time as a result term rates are considerably less volatile than the overnight rate in particular it is notable that the term rates were largely unaffected by the transitory spike in the sofr rate at the end of 2018 figure 3 forward looking sofr term rates over time figure 4 compares the one three and six month term sofr rates with federal funds ois and libor rates for reference the federal funds effective rate is also shown term sofr rates closely track federal funds ois rates over the last eight months sofr term rates typically printed within a couple of basis points of federal funds ois rates during our sample period sofr term rates were on average about two basis point above comparable ois rates and more than 90 percent of observed daily differences were less than five basis points on most days the spreads between sofr term rates and federal funds ois rates are considerably smaller than the spread between the overnight sofr rate and the federal funds effective rate like federal funds ois term sofr rates which do not embed credit risk premiums are consistently lower than term libor rates the fomc s september 19 and december 12 policy rate hikes were largely anticipated by sofr futures markets for example in early august sofr futures prices implied about an 80 percent chance of a 25 basis point hike at the september meeting and a 50 percent chance of a 25 basis point hike at the december meeting accordingly as can be seen in figure 4 the one month sofr term rate began rising about a month ahead of each of the two effr rate increases while the three and six month rates began moving upward considerably earlier figure 4 sofr ois and libor term rates over time 4 conclusion futures prices can be used to infer forward looking sofr based term rates that are conceptually similar to the forward looking term libor rates currently used in a broad range of loan contracts comparisons of futures implied sofr term rates with other interest rates over the eight months since sofr futures began trading are encouraging sofr term rates are considerably less volatile than overnight sofr rates track comparable federal funds ois rates quite closely and smoothly transition upward ahead of anticipated policy rate hikes because of the relatively short time span over which sofr futures have been trading it is not possible to directly evaluate the performance of forward looking sofr term rates over a broad range of interest rate environments however as detailed in heitfield and park 2019 application of the approach described in this note to federal funds futures produces term rates that closely track federal funds ois rates from 2000 to 2019 and accurately predict realized federal funds rates during most periods the term rates presented here are derived from end of day futures prices rather than intra day transaction prices and as such are not appropriate reference rates for commercial contracts given sufficient market liquidity it would be desirable to use intra day prices over a relatively narrow trading window to ensure that prices are as timely as possible in addition as sofr derivatives markets continue to evolve a number of extensions to the approach described here could be considered while only cme contract prices are used in this analysis the methodology could readily accommodate integration of prices from additional futures contracts offered on ice or other exchanges or even over the counter sofr swaps in estimating forward rates our model weights all futures prices equally if a broader set of derivatives contracts were used one might consider weighting contracts by measures of market depth or trading volume finally more robust trading of longer dated sofr derivatives could facilitate estimation of sofr term rates of tenors beyond six months references alternative reference rate committee 2018 second report financial stability board 2019 interest rate benchmark

trump s nafta changes would lead to modest boost in growth and jobs report says changes to the north american free trade agreement would modestly boost u s economic and jobs growth according to a report from the international trade commission trump is pushing congress to ratify the agreement which he calls the united states mexico canada agreement a revised north american free trade agreement would lead to a modest boost in economic growth and u s auto jobs according to a report released thursday the united states mexico canada agreement struck by the three north american countries last year would increase real u s gross domestic product by an estimated 68 2 billion or 0 35 according to the u s international trade commission it would raise employment by about 176 000 jobs or 0 12 the report says the agreement which the countries legislatures still need to ratify would boost u s exports to canada and mexico by 5 9 and 6 7 respectively the model estimates that the agreement would likely have a positive impact on all broad industry sectors within the u s economy manufacturing would experience the largest percentage gains in output exports wages and employment while in absolute terms services would experience the largest gains in output and employment the itc said in a news release the report comes as president donald trump pushes congress to ratify the revised trade deal despite reservations from both democrats and republicans the president has spent his time in office trying to rework trade relationships with major partners saying changes such as the ones made to nafta will encourage american manufacturing and job creation in the u s while the itc study shows the deal would have positive benefits for jobs and economic growth it underscores that the deal is hardly the largest trade agreement ever as trump has boasted even some republicans in congress have called the usmca more of a tweak to nafta than a major overhaul the miniscule projected gains in this long awaited official government assessment of the revised nafta contradict donald trump s grandiose claims that it will lead to cash and jobs pouring into the u s and reinforces congressional democrats views that absent more improvements the revised deal won t stop nafta s ongoing damage lori wallach director of public citizen s global trade watch said in a statement to cnbc story continues a separate report from the u s trade representative part of the executive branch projected the deal would have bigger effects on the auto industry specifically while the itc estimated 28 000 job gains in the auto sector the ustr thinks the trade deal would create 76 000 auto jobs in the next five years a roughly 7 5 percent increase for the industry some industries cheered the itc report both the national association of manufacturers and the computer communications industry association encouraged congress to approve usmca following its release democrats who hold the house and the power to slow ratification of the deal have raised concerns about labor and environmental provisions contained in the deal some gop lawmakers have also pushed trump to drop tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico before moving forward with the agreement the deal would not come without its downsides for consumers under the provisions of the agreement auto costs would rise and sales would fall the itc estimated cnbc s mary catherine wellons contributed to this report subscribe to cnbc on youtube more from cnbc
federal reserve graphic concept photo adobestock what s the biggest problem with the federal reserve the obvious answer is that the central bank is susceptible to keynesian monetary policy which results in a harmful boom bust cycle for instance the fed s artificially low interest rates last decade played a key role along with deeply misguided fannie mae freddie mac subsidies is causing the 2008 crisis and let s not forget the fed s role in the great depression today though let s focus on a narrower topic as norbert michel explains for the heritage foundation the central bank is trying to expand its power in the financial system one of the potential actions the fed board is considering is to develop its very own real time settlement system this approach makes many private sector actors anxious because no private company wants to compete with the feds since its inception the fed has been heavily involved in the u s payments system and one can easily argue that the system has lagged behind precisely because the fed has been too involved the fed also effectively took over the check clearing business even though the economic case for such a move was highly suspect private firms were doing fine in fact there is a long history of the fed usurping the private market here are some details on the fed s most recent power grab the government is once again angling to take over a function that private firms are already providing the clearinghouse a private association owned by 25 large banks launched its own system real time payments rtp in november 2017 the private sector is better than the government at providing more goods and services to more people in the private sector competitive forces and the need to satisfy customers create constant pressure to innovate and improve government entities are wholly insulated from these pressures the government should not provide a good or service unless there is some sort of clear market failure where the private sector has failed to provide it this type of failure clearly does not exist in the payments industry norbert is right competition is the way to get better outcomes for consumers as such it s rather absurd to think a government operated monopoly will produce good results look for instance at its cronyist behavior during the financial crisis now let s zoom out and consider the big picture richard rahn has a column in the washington times that raises questions about the fed s role in a modern economy is there a need for the fed the fed has an extensive history of policy mistakes too long to even summarize here the problem has been the assumption that the fed had better information and tools than it had at times it was expected to lean against the wind as if it had information not available to the market or smarter people in hayekian terms it suffered from the pretense of knowledge at this point it may be beyond fixing several very knowledgeable economists who have held high level positions at the fed including regional bank presidents have begun discussions about setting up a new commission to rethink the whole idea of a fed and its activities the structure that now exists is a jerry built concoction that has been assembled in bits and pieces for more than a century and increasingly appears to be past its expiration date i ve written about the need to clip the fed s wings but richard s column suggests even bolder action is needed larry white and john stossel also have questioned the role and power of the federal reserve in any event one thing that should be clear is that the fed hasn t used its existing powers either wisely or effectively thomas sowell is right don t reward a bureaucracy s poor performance by giving it even more power
power couple the imf s christine lagarde with david attenborough at its annual meeting next month bp will bow to pressure from city shareholders to explain clearly how it plans to combat climate change it is a moment that matters to every saver and pensioner in britain the oil giant and its arch rival royal dutch shell between them pay out around 20pc of all ftse 100 dividends so we all rely on their performance but if companies like these fail to play a part in moving to a low carbon economy they risk contributing to an environmental and financial catastrophe if the war to save the planet is going to be won then the victory is more likely to be achieved by pin striped executives in boardrooms than by a bunch of yogic hippies it s an inconvenient truth as far as the eco zealots in london at the protests orchestrated by extinction rebellion are concerned the corporate world is neither oblivious nor uncaring but is abundantly aware of climate risks this is not for bleeding heart reasons or for the sake of conforming to a new social orthodoxy but because it makes financial sense the bank of england this week told lenders and insurers they risk huge losses which could include loans to companies in dirty industries that go out of business and are unable to repay their debts a sudden drop in asset values due to climate change could lead to trillion pound losses some banks including rbs and hsbc are no longer financing extreme fossil fuels such as tar sands and they are likely to be screening assiduously for climate risks in future sir david attenborough s appearance at the international monetary fund in washington this month where he was interviewed by managing director christine lagarde is another gauge of how seriously economists and financiers are taking the issue the nonagenarian broadcaster whose series our planet is showing on netflix painted a bleak picture of the economic social and human costs if we fail to act on climate change and hurtle towards a spendthrift suicide shifting to a more sustainable model will be an enormous undertaking for businesses and governments the corporate world is neither oblivious nor uncaring but is abundantly aware of climate risks this is not for bleeding heart reasons but because it makes financial sense lagarde said 4trillion has been spent globally since 2015 on fossil fuel subsidies to industry much of it in the developing world removing those subsidies could cause job losses and hardship in the short term even if the long term benefits are clear individual countries often are reluctant to cut subsidies or to impose carbon taxes if rival nations refuse to do the same for fear of damaging their ability to compete the natural world is so delicate at the moment it needs all the protection it can get attenborough said sometimes that will mean governments will have to take decisions that are painful and cost money the reason companies are responding to climate change fears comes down to cash the fear of losing it and the fact big city shareholders are telling them to clean up their act legal general one of the uk s biggest investors with 1trillion under management has been assessing more than 80 of the world s largest businesses on their responses to climate change it has banned eight from a fund for those seeking to invest in environmentally conscious shares including china construction bank the world s largest backer of coal mining and russian oil giant rosneft there is a positive side the need to come up with greener energy solutions also creates opportunities for business the uk is reducing the amount of carbon it produces relative to the size of our economy faster than any other country in the g20 and has generated 430 000 jobs in low carbon businesses indeed innovations are likely to do more to help combat climate change than any number of wellmeaning people supergluing themselves to railings it may not fit the narrative of the protesters but those industrialists investors and financiers so heartily despised by your average eco warrior are actually doing their share to save the planet

frances stead sellers the washington post lovely ky when the well water here turned brown and started tasting salty heather blevins parents hooked their property on dead man s curve into the municipal supply it seemed like a blessing until new hazards emerged today blevins says the tap water smells of bleach occasionally takes on a urine colored tinge and leaves her 7 and 8 year old children itching every time they take a bath the way the water is now i d rather have well water said blevins 44 who keeps a constant eye on the county water district s facebook page to watch for pipe breaks and boil water advisories blevins who says her water rates rocketed recently from 19 to almost 40 a month sets aside money from her 980 social security check for bottled drinking water and chemical free baby wipes to keep her allergy prone children clean it shouldn t be like that she said it s been like that for decades here in martin county as it has in other pockmarked parts of coal country the water crisis peaked last year when service to many residents was shut off members of the water board quit and the attorney general opened a criminal investigation into allegations of mismanagement the kentucky house recently passed a resolution asking gov matt bevin r to declare a state of emergency and free up resources to fix the dilapidated system on saturday bevin held a community forum with residents in inez the county seat where he said he had not decided about the state of emergency but pledged to channel state and federal dollars toward the problem we ve done more in the last three months than was done in the previous three years bevin said the water board s new chairman jimmy don kerr has taken a lead role in trying to reverse the downward trend but state rep chris harris d who advocated for the state of emergency warned that martin county s problems could soon be everyone s as the infrastructure deteriorates around the country we are going to see more and more martin counties he said the challenges are monumental here in appalachia and beyond the american society of civil engineers gave the nation s drinking water system a d grade in its quadrennial report card the network of more than 1 million miles of pipes includes many that are a century old and have a 75 year life expectancy across the country 14 percent of treated water is lost through leaks and here in martin county that figure has at times reached more than 70 percent the american water works association estimates that it will take 1 trillion to support demand over the next 25 years in martin county repairs carry a price tag exceeding 10 million president donald trump like president barack obama before him touted the economic importance of repairing the country s crumbling infrastructure neither has succeeded among the 2020 presidential candidates sen amy klobuchar d minn stands out for her emphasis on improving infrastructure as a major policy proposal calling for 1 trillion in federal and state funds to be spent in seven areas including updating bridges and internet connectivity and ensuring clean water drinking water which is typically funded by local rates is a particularly tough sell with little to show for investment that is largely spent underground updating small systems such as martin county s presents additional problems experts say because they lack economies of scale and have limited technical and managerial resources greg scott the water district s new general manager sounds optimistic as he speaks from an office at the treatment plant where he stores stacks of bottled water handouts for residents whose supply fails only two of the three giant blue clarifier tanks at the plant are operable and the district is deeply in debt we can climb out of the hole he said it is a heady goal for this coal fueled county where lyndon b johnson launched his war on poverty 55 years ago forty percent of the 12 000 residents still live below the poverty line and the unemployment rate is well above the national average the closure of coal mines has taken away jobs and also the coal severance funds that companies pay to mining communities for all of the money that came out of those hills they should have the best water system the best schools and colleges said gail brion a professor of engineering at the university of kentucky i don t see that they have gotten their fair share hilly terrain carved by rivers and punctuated by springs exacerbates the technical challenges as water has to be forced under high pressure to reach families up in the mountains leaks create a vacuum that sucks in the surrounding dirt and can create a hazardous concoction with disinfecting chemicals for years customers utility bills warned that prolonged exposure to contaminants could lead to problems with the liver kidneys or central nervous system and an increased risk of cancer and for years according to the kentucky public service commission psc which regulates utilities and has conducted investigations into martin county the water board failed to take the politically unpopular step of raising rates to make improvements if you don t keep up infrastructure costs balloon out of control said andrew melnykovych a psc spokesman who described the recent rate increase as a necessary catch up mike schmitt chairman of the psc called martin county by far the worst water district in my opinion in the state of kentucky a few residents kept a close eye on the mounting crisis posting news of pipe breaks and photos of filthy water online as well as bird dogging local officials after nina mccoy of martin county concerned citizens started working with the appalachian citizens law center the attorney general opened his inquiry into the whereabouts of a 3 million grant from the coal severance fund among other things any potential criminal findings andy beshear s office said will be presented to a martin county grand jury former judge executive kelly callaham who used to appoint the board denied that money had been misspent but acknowledged that there had been mismanagement he said it stemmed from board members unwillingness to cut off people who did not pay their bills when you live in a small town these people you re going to see them at the store at the post office callaham said kerr who said he drinks the local water promises transparency but decades of mistrust have tainted attitudes toward any development prime among them the construction of a high school that is almost complete but lacks on site water the project has been beset by delays over the route the water lines should take and a request for a much larger water tank than the school needed callaham and james booth a former coal baron and chairman of the martin county economic development authority said that they requested the tank to provide for a new industrial park as well critics including mccoy worry that the added demand will put more pressure on a system strained to the breaking point and that the person likely to profit most is booth who owns gas stations convenience stores and other commercial enterprises in the county for now tanker trucks fill up in inez and drive uphill to the construction site where they disgorge the water into smaller tanks larry james the schools superintendent declined an interview booth did not respond to calls or emails asked whether he saw potential conflicts of interest callaham said i guess it could kind of be but would you rather not have nothing than developing these good jobs kerr said he has decided to look forward it doesn t bother me maybe it should but it doesn t he said he is the one guy in town who can provide future economic development kerr has secured two federal grants totaling nearly 5 million and says more than 3 million could be on the way the water district is now paying its bills and has repaid about 150 000 of its more than 1 million debt the health warnings are gone from utility bills following changes in the chlorination process he has set priorities starting with the hydraulics we re steering the ship not just plugging the leaks kerr said literally he is also trying to engage local activists and has asked mccoy to join the water board even if he finds money to pay for repairs a rate based system depends on customers using the water i don t know how we change people s minds kerr said that s what keeps me up how do we get people to trust the water again dementia dementia dementia says barbiann maynard pointing to her neighbors houses one by one from her front window at 62 her father has neurological symptoms she can t explain and she wonders whether the central nervous system problems she used to read about on her water bills have anything to do with them every 10 days maynard drives about 30 minutes from her home in huntleyville to fill one gallon plastic jugs from a hose that spews spring water toward a four lane highway scientists from virginia tech have told her that the water tests positive for e coli and coliform bacteria but maynard said she would rather boil it than drink her tap water since a neighbor died in a house fire she worries that firefighters might not be able to help others such as jess taylor who lives on a mountainside across the road where the water pressure is low so she collects rainwater in buckets for her goats and to flush toilets many people such as blevins buy bottled water others hope for donations which flow in on small rented trucks and vast 18 wheelers in early april lydia coffey and cathy carter both retired teachers drove four hours in a u haul to deliver bottled water collected through the informational group kentucky teachers in the know they unloaded cases onto a trailer then paused to chat with local residents carter s voice broke as she rested in the back of the now empty u haul it makes me emotional that people have to deal with this in the 21st century she said in the country that s supposed to be so great
prentiss smith the system is rigged that was the familiar theme articulated during the 2016 presidential election from the current occupant of the white house and from bernie sanders who was hillary clinton s rival during that election the president to be was railing against the system because he believed it was rigged against he and the american people mr sanders was railing against that same system because he felt it was rigged against the american people in favor of the big banks big pharma and corporations in general in their own ways both were right therefore this president was able to win in the industrial midwest because people believed he was going to do something about the rigged system that he had railed so vociferously against a system that left so many white working class americans and others behind in ohio michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania the system had not worked for them for a long time and they were willing to try anything to change that reality they elected the current occupant of the white house to shake things up but many of them are still not enjoying the benefits of this so called booming economy the system which are the institutions of government business and industry is rigged against working class americans that sounds like complaining and whining but it s not it is just a statement of fact for far too many years working class americans have come up on the short end of the economic stick corporations are making more profit than they ever have in the past and sharing less of it with their employees than ever before the ruling class of life time politicians big business and big media become wealthier by the hour not by the day working class americans have long felt that the system was not working for them and their families they see their jobs going away to technology and innovation they see the scourge of opioid addiction encompassing their neighborhoods and they see their healthcare costs climbing precipitously all of this happening in what is supposed to be a booming economy but there are millions of americans who are not seeing their wages rise nor an increase in their upward mobility as one of those working class americans who experienced the ebbs and flows and whims of big corporations i got lucky because i was able to work for one company for thirty years which afforded me a decent pension and benefits but i am a dinasour jobs with pensions still exist but they are far and few between workers must now rely on their 401k s or other types of retirement savings many of the benefits that were fought for by unions are no longer available to the working class americans for many americans in the industrial belt unions were the gold standard and used to be the difference between a good job with a pension and benefits or just a job today unions are less than 10 of the american work force unions have become remnants of a forgotten past when working class americans had dignity and security that s not the case anymore i am grateful that i had a union job today the words unions and pensions are not a part of most working class americans daily conversations there was once a time when everybody who worked with their hands and showered after work could look forward to a decent pension and health benefits that is history now and it has led to the hollowing out of the middle class the system is not working for everyone but it is working well for the connected and well connected the rich keep getting richer and unfortunately the poor keep getting poorer and the middle class keeps getting squeezed there is certainly nothing wrong with being rich in fact there are more millionaires in america than ever before in its history almost 11 million americans that s a good thing but even though there is a record number of millionaires the middle class continues to shrink it is part of the american dream to strike it rich and it s very possible in america for anyone who has a good idea and works hard to develop that idea to become wealthy that is the american way but it is a pipe dream for most of us who have to punch a clock and do it the old fashion way work hard save your money and hope that you live long enough to enjoy what you worked so hard for a recent pew research center study found that the middle class has slipped from 55 in 2000 to 52 in 2016 that may not see like a lot but it is significant that same study found that a growing number of americans are living paycheck to paycheck one in three say reveal that they couldn t come up with 2000 dollars if faced with an emergency like a needed home repair a medical crisis or a car accident those are stunning statistics that should concern all of us but especially policy makers and politicians who are constantly saying that the middle class is under economic stress this was confirmed during the recent government shutdown which revealed the pressure on working class people to make ends meet everything costs and the prices are not going down they are going up americans live in a country where the president is a billionaire and all of his cabinet secretaries are billionaires and millionaires the laws are created and passed by the congress and senate of which the majority are millionaires and those laws are found to be constitutional or not by millionaire judges who have lifetime tenures almost every network television anchorman woman or reporter who reads the news is a millionaire or close to being one in the final analysis it is obvious that the president and mr sanders were right the system is rigged in favor of

power couple the imf s christine lagarde with david attenborough at its annual meeting next month bp will bow to pressure from city shareholders to explain clearly how it plans to combat climate change it is a moment that matters to every saver and pensioner in britain the oil giant and its arch rival royal dutch shell between them pay out around 20pc of all ftse 100 dividends so we all rely on their performance but if companies like these fail to play a part in moving to a low carbon economy they risk contributing to an environmental and financial catastrophe if the war to save the planet is going to be won then the victory is more likely to be achieved by pin striped executives in boardrooms than by a bunch of yogic hippies it s an inconvenient truth as far as the eco zealots in london at the protests orchestrated by extinction rebellion are concerned the corporate world is neither oblivious nor uncaring but is abundantly aware of climate risks this is not for bleeding heart reasons or for the sake of conforming to a new social orthodoxy but because it makes financial sense the bank of england this week told lenders and insurers they risk huge losses which could include loans to companies in dirty industries that go out of business and are unable to repay their debts a sudden drop in asset values due to climate change could lead to trillion pound losses some banks including rbs and hsbc are no longer financing extreme fossil fuels such as tar sands and they are likely to be screening assiduously for climate risks in future sir david attenborough s appearance at the international monetary fund in washington this month where he was interviewed by managing director christine lagarde is another gauge of how seriously economists and financiers are taking the issue the nonagenarian broadcaster whose series our planet is showing on netflix painted a bleak picture of the economic social and human costs if we fail to act on climate change and hurtle towards a spendthrift suicide shifting to a more sustainable model will be an enormous undertaking for businesses and governments the corporate world is neither oblivious nor uncaring but is abundantly aware of climate risks this is not for bleeding heart reasons but because it makes financial sense lagarde said 4trillion has been spent globally since 2015 on fossil fuel subsidies to industry much of it in the developing world removing those subsidies could cause job losses and hardship in the short term even if the long term benefits are clear individual countries often are reluctant to cut subsidies or to impose carbon taxes if rival nations refuse to do the same for fear of damaging their ability to compete the natural world is so delicate at the moment it needs all the protection it can get attenborough said sometimes that will mean governments will have to take decisions that are painful and cost money the reason companies are responding to climate change fears comes down to cash the fear of losing it and the fact big city shareholders are telling them to clean up their act legal general one of the uk s biggest investors with 1trillion under management has been assessing more than 80 of the world s largest businesses on their responses to climate change it has banned eight from a fund for those seeking to invest in environmentally conscious shares including china construction bank the world s largest backer of coal mining and russian oil giant rosneft there is a positive side the need to come up with greener energy solutions also creates opportunities for business the uk is reducing the amount of carbon it produces relative to the size of our economy faster than any other country in the g20 and has generated 430 000 jobs in low carbon businesses indeed innovations are likely to do more to help combat climate change than any number of wellmeaning people supergluing themselves to railings it may not fit the narrative of the protesters but those industrialists investors and financiers so heartily despised by your average eco warrior are actually doing their share to save the planet
