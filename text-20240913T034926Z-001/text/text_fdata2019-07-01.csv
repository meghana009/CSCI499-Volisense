while on the surface the g 20 outcome appears positive and poised to give risk assets a short term boost the agreement did not by itself signal any major breakthrough in resolving the fundamental trade conflict patrick wacker a fund manager for emerging markets fixed income at uob asset management in singapore we are likely to see a similar pattern following the g 20 in buenos aires a truce followed by further escalation it s a concern echoed by international monetary fund managing director christine lagarde who warned that unresolved issues between the u s and china on trade pose serious risks to the future of global economies which are already going through a rough patch read more china traders gear up for relief rally though caution prevails still a return to the negotiating table ends a six week stalemate that had raised fears the two nations were headed into a cold war trump told reporters he wouldn t put new duties on china for the time being after xi s administration agreed to buy a tremendous amount of agricultural products for analysts the biggest breakthrough was the decision to allow huawei technologies co to buy some products from u s suppliers after the commerce department last month blacklisted the company for national security reasons the huawei news was a surprise that the market should take constructively said bipan rai the toronto based north american head of foreign exchange strategy at canadian imperial bank of commerce the setup is there for risk to perform well to start this week in the currency market the chinese yuan and the australian dollar should be the biggest near term beneficiaries of the trade ceasefire rai said despite global trade tensions easing financial markets are unlikely to significantly reduce their expectations for federal reserve rate cuts said mansoor mohi uddin a senior macro strategist at natwest markets in singapore thus risk assets stocks commodities and emerging markets are set to rally while the safe haven dollar yen and swiss franc underperform read more investors may rethink fed rate cut bets after u s china truce currencies in developed markets may also rebound especially those with exposure to china according to valentin marinov the head of g 10 currency research at credit agricole the australian and new zealand dollars the japanese yen and the euro may rise he said and even though the outcome of the meeting between trump and xi was largely expected there could be a rebound in carry trade optimism with long dollar versus the euro and swiss franc as the best picks he added meanwhile khiem do the head of great china investments and global markets at barings in hong kong said a 50 basis point interest rate reduction in the u s is unlikely because the truce is going to dominate sentiment toward trade talks in the short term st louis federal reserve president james bullard on tuesday said a cut of that magnitude would be overdone below are more comments from investors and strategists credit agricole s marinov in london the implication is that further easing of u s conditions stemming from stock market optimism following the g 20 summit should reduce the need for imminent fed rate cut in july this makes the upcoming u s payrolls and ism data very important to the near term rates outlook sean callow senior currency strategist at westpac banking corp in sydney overall a win for china seems likely to be taken as a positive for global equities asian currencies and the australian dollar but probably only in a relatively short lived response the tariff threat will linger for some time weighing further on u s business investment plans this will concern the fed at the july meeting but confirmation of the talks resuming should help further reduce market pricing for a 50 basis point rate cut then trump s back down to both china and u s tech firms over sales to huawei is a mild surprise that should add support to tech sensitive asian equities it might even help the canadian dollar a little nader naeimi the head of dynamic markets at amp capital in sydney overall plenty of ritual positive empty language no tariffs rolled back and no resolution time frame so no clearing of the air for global corporations where to produce invest hire or source and leaves the us china economic issues unresolved the truce in may 2018 lasted just 10 days he said naeimi is taking the following actions for his fund he s closing long duration in u s bonds adding to u s curve steepener positions closing defensive bond proxy positions utilities in particular in favor of cyclicals such as securities in the energy materials and energy industries adding longs in emerging market currencies shifting from emerging market bonds to stocks olivier d assier the head of applied research for asia pacific at axioma in singapore these guys didn t really give investors much to go on we might see some short covering from a few overzealous hedge funds but overall sentiment was neutral and nothing in this outcome is likely to give investors the confidence they need to raise their risk appetite kerry craig global market strategist at jpmorgan asset management in melbourne the lifting of ban on the sale of technology to chinese companies was a step beyond expectations and the market reaction come monday will likely be positive markets are likely to breathe a collective sigh of relief given the highly anticipated outcome of the meeting however the reprieve may be short lived and there is still no guarantee that a deal can be reached or even that any deal would completely address all of the differences that have driven investor anxieties particularly when it comes to technology and the enforcement of a possible deal hao hong a strategist at bocom international in hong kong while most expected that both sides will calm down to agree to further discussion lifting ban on huawei is a surprise lifting the ban for now shows progress in the negotiation and sincerity to discuss further it would appear that the ban on huawei is really more about the trade disputes than national security masanari takada a strategist at nomura securities co in tokyo we retain our risk on view ahead of the july market and expect global equity and 10 year u s treasury yields to rebound through end july we keep our strategy even after g20 bullish in july but bearish in august stephen innes managing partner at vanguard markets in bangkok the reset button being hit on trade talks was the markets base case scenario and this is supportive for risk but the lack of a timeline for progress may cap bullish topside ambitions with no news reading algorithms to steamroll the markets on saturday traders will have a 36 hour cooling off period to quantify their next move and i would expect the markets to be very orderly on monday open the extensive lists of demands from both sides may be a bridge too far underlying sentiment remains quite bearish in terms of the medium term outlook for a u s china trade deal as well the global growth outlook chris weston head of research at pepperstone financial in melbourne i can t see this meeting doing risk assets any harm but there is still a lot of work to do to convince central banks they don t need to act to keep the economic expansion in check a few weak shorts may look to close out on monday given the tariff reprieve prospects for negotiations to restart and the fact that both sides actually appear more united than expected raymond yeung chief china economist at anz in hong kong the outcome similar to last december s still does not convince us that the trade tensions have been resolved china and the u s have not made any progress on key issues namely intellectual property rights and technology transfer trump s softer stance seems to be driven by u s corporate interests as billion dollar contracts for us farmers and huawei suppliers are involved it suggests that future negotiations could be characterized by u s stepping back in exchange for china s purchases but as china has said it is prepared for a long march the u s needs to compromise further to reach a real deal before the next presidential election alfonso esparza a senior market analyst at oanda in toronto everybody played their part without any additional drama and until more details emerge we are back at square one gold will be pressured as trade optimism reduces the appeal of the yellow metal as a safe haven jean charles sambor the deputy of head of emerging market fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in london this is of course good investors have been generally negative on both the probability of a meeting and the probability of a positive outcome following this meeting high yield spreads should do well china high yield remains very cheap especially and emerging market currencies should continue to rally on the news david page senior economist at axa investment managers in london

america slows english pdf 168 kb global issues oda flows should increase significantly to achieve the 2030 agenda to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the international community must embark on a path of collective efforts including providing support to many developing countries to increase investment in numerous fields both upgrading and diversifying productive capacities and advancing communication energy and transportation infrastructure remain priorities several countries especially among the least developed countries ldcs remain heavily reliant on international assistance to advance these efforts in order to channel the financing needed to close existing investment gaps concrete actions are needed at the global level in line with sdg 17 strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development estimates of the total annual financing needs to reach the sdg targets range between 4 6 trillion and 7 9 trillion at the global level the total annual investment gap in key sustainable development sectors is estimated at 2 5 trillion by unctad and many states must double their current infrastructure investment levels given the fragility of investment in many developing economies meeting these daunting targets requires stable and steady flows of investment finance investment growth slowed sharply in many developing countries in 2014 2015 especially in low income countries see figure 1 this deterioration is partially explained by the commodity price cycle exacerbated by the escalation of conflict in yemen the ebola crisis and other security issues and political instabilities since 2016 some positive trends have been observed especially in east and south asia which also have large populations of people living below the poverty line however investment levels in many developing countries notably in africa remain insufficient to make rapid progress towards the 2030 agenda the eventual winding down of the period of ultra cheap global liquidity is raising additional concerns in particular in countries where corporate debt levels are elevated and where corporate borrowing has not been matched by investment into productive assets as funds were channelled instead into financial assets or real estate the addis ababa action agenda aaaa adopted in 2015 laid out a guiding framework to meet these financing challenges in a coordinated manner however the anti ci pated surge in development finance has not yet taken place at the same time public investment is constrained by low government revenues especially in low income countries where they remain below 15 per cent of gdp on average while domestic private investment is deterred by the lack of domestic savings and underdeveloped financial systems private businesses facing a range of short term options hesitate to commit funds to long term investment projects while households often focus on their immediate needs private capital flows which provide the largest share of cross border finance declined sharply in 2015 2018 foreign direct investment fdi flows to developing countries which have been weakening since 2015 contracted by 30 per cent by 2017 and fell further to 1 2 trillion in 2018 the level seen immediately after the global financial crisis official development assistance oda flows to low income countries and ldcs should play an important role in these efforts oda flows account for more than two thirds of external finance for the ldcs globally just over 11 per cent of total bilateral oda is directed towards investment projects figure 2 illustrates the ratio of oda inflows excluding humanitarian aid and programme assistance to gross fixed capital formation in selected low income countries this ratio exceeds 20 per cent in at least 15 countries highlighting the importance of oda as a source of financing to help close investment gaps in 2018 oda provided by members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd development assistance committee dac amounted to 149 3 billion representing a decline of 2 7 per cent in real terms over 2017 to compare the volume of global remittances sent by migrant workers was about three times larger only five of the dac members met or exceeded the 0 7 per cent of gross national income gni target since 2010 the concessionality of bilateral oda has also declined as reliance on concessional loans increased at the expense of grants in 2016 2017 loans made up 15 2 per cent of oda compared to 12 4 per cent in 2010 2012 over 60 per cent of oda finance provided for economic infrastructure and services is in the form of concessional loans mostly in the transport and energy sectors while this expands available financing it also increases the risk of currency mismatches for loans in foreign currency and may contribute to a further build up of external debt in developing countries the absorption capacity of the oda receiving countries should also increase the aaaa called for integrated national financing frameworks yet the progress in defining those frameworks is slow as each country needs to tailor them to particular sectors channeling oda flows to productive investment will require a complex system of interactions between public and private stakeholders to develop and deepen domestic financial systems and also mobilize domestic finance the quality of domestic institutions is absolutely crucial for the efficient absorption of resources developed economies north america recent policy changes have not yet materially increased multinational production in the united states in the first quarter of 2019 gdp in the united states expanded by 3 1 per cent on an annualized basis up from 2 2 per cent in the previous quarter this stronger than expected headline figure masks a slowdown in both household consumption and business investment growth and was driven primarily by a sharp drop in import volumes as may 2019 saw the third major round of tariff hikes between the united states and china the recent drop in import volumes begs the question as to whether recent policy changes in the united states including significant cuts in corporate tax rates incentives to repatriate cash earned overseas and the imposition and threats of import tariffs have encouraged us multinationals to repatriate production or increase investment in the united states driving substitution of imported goods by domestic production to date there is little evidence to support this proposition rather the recent drop in import volumes likely represents a disruption in global value chains suggestive of weaker export and investment growth in the coming quarters bilateral merchandise trade between the united states and china has declined by more than 15 per cent since september 2018 when the second round of tariffs came into effect this has also been associated with a diversion of trade towards countries such as viet nam and mexico rather than an expansion of production in the united states meanwhile in response to measures in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 there was a sharp surge in repatriated profits by us multinational firms however the bulk of these financial transfers have been directed towards stock buybacks mergers and acquisitions rather than an expansion of productive capacity in the united states forward indicators point to a sharp slowdown in capital expenditure plans in the united states during the second quarter of 2019 and the growth momentum is projected to moderate developed asia japan strengthens sdgs partnerships with domestic stakeholders as japan prepares to host the group of twenty g20 summit on 28 and 29 june the japan business federation keidanren is advocating a policy proposal of society 5 0 for the sdgs japan faces pressing economic and social challenges which include a declining population persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish gdp growth to tackle these challenges the government is promoting the sdgs in partnership with domestic businesses civil society and academia the society 5 0 concept places a strong emphasis on technological innovations to transform the japanese economy indeed the recent tankan survey indicates that the software research and development sectors will increasingly drive japan s investment growth in 2019 the partnerships for sdgs initiative in japan demonstrates the pertinent role of the sdgs in a developed country europe trade tensions and brexit weigh on investment investment conditions in europe received a further boost from the european central bank s ecb recent signals that it is willing to inject further liquidity into markets if needed this represents a turnaround from the previous scenario that envisaged the ecb moving away from its historically loose policy stance the change in policy stems from a multitude of factors that put the economic performance of the region at risk these include in particular the heightened global trade tensions which create significant uncertainty as to the future trade conditions and thus also weigh on investment especially in the export dependent economies and sectors of the region in the united kingdom the still undecided nature of the planned exit from the european union eu or brexit has created a situation in which companies have little incentive to commit any new investment given a complete lack of visibility regarding the future legal framework for external trade relations in some sectors like the automobile industry the consequence of this situation is not only the lack of and diversion of investment projects but also the relocation of capacities to other localities that offer greater legal certainty and the continued benefit of being part of the eu which comes with significant legal and regulatory advantages in the form of universal market access to all eu member states economies in transition cis costs of business credit remain high in the commonwealth of independent states cis despite some monetary relaxation and the fast expansion of consumer credit bu siness financing remains complicated in the russian federation international sanctions have affected business confidence although sovereign reserves have increased significantly over the past few years it is unlikely that these resources will be used for public investment in ukraine which is facing a conflict in the east of the country investment has been recovering steadily since 2016 but is skewed towards real estate in the countries of central asia banking system fragilities are constraining access to financing for businesses underscoring the importance of public investment the majority of inward remittances are channelled into private consumption some initiatives will support investment in the region the government of kazakhstan in april announced the launch of the coordination council for the attraction of investment aiming to raise the share of investment in gdp from 20 9 per cent in 2018 to 30 per cent by 2025 at the regional level the implementation of the belt and road initiative is contributing to the improvement of the energy and railway networks in addition the eu in may adopted a new strategy with respect to its relationship with the central asian countries aiming to deepen its engagement boost resilience against internal and external shocks support economic modernization and regional connectivity boost regional trade and investment and support wto accession bids of turkmenistan and uzbekistan a number of regional development banks are active in the cis area investing in multiple projects including in energy infrastructure and the social sectors in south eastern europe the region has been receiving increased investment from china in particular in the energy and infrastructure sectors developing economies africa african continental free trade area aims to overcome constraints to growth and development while africa s growth is expected to pick up in the near term the region is facing difficulties in sustaining a robust growth trajectory in many african countries weak balance of payments remains a crucial obstacle to stronger growth in 2019 only botswana eswatini and the republic of congo are expected to run current account surpluses in the rest of africa to varying extents the space for domestic demand expansion depends on foreign capital inflows the present situation creates a dilemma for policymakers to achieve the sdgs domestic demand namely consumption and investment needs to expand in real terms however an expansionary policy under balance of payment constraints can easily fuel higher consumer price inflation disproportionately affecting the poor and potentially trigger major balance of payments turbulences or even crisis therefore african countries need to develop more resilient export capacities to overcome these vulnerabilities despite various partnerships at bilateral and multilateral levels efforts to strengthen export capacity in africa have rendered limited results this is mainly because africa s exports have structurally been excluded from the mid stream of global value chains the african continental free trade area afcfta which entered into force on 30 may is a momentous regional partnership for africa s economic growth and development the afcfta is projected to boost intraregional trade of final goods and to promote stronger productivity growth amid lower cross border transaction costs in addition the enlarged market size together with the strengthening of productive capacities can encourage the production of critical intermediate manufacturing inputs such as special tools dies and moulds in this way the afcfta promotes african insertion into the mid stream of global value chains which can significantly contribute to strengthening conditions for growth and development across the continent east asia regional integration crucial in boosting the region s sustainable development prospects the further escalation of trade tensions between the united states and china has created significant uncertainty surrounding the multilateral trading system in several parts of the world growing discontent with globalization has resulted in the adoption of more inward looking policies despite the rising challenges to multilateralism however the asian economies have continued to strengthen trade investment and financial linkages within the region a recent report by the asian development bank adb highlighted that asia s share of intra regional trade rose to 57 8 per cent in 2017 from 57 2 per cent in 2016 and is well above the share of 46 per cent seen in 1990 intraregional fdi also rose in 2017 accounting now for more than half of all fdi inflows in the region policymakers commitment towards fostering deeper regional cooperation and integration has been reflected through the progress on several major initiatives these include the asean economic community the belt and road initiative and the asian infrastructure investment bank these initiatives will facilitate the channelling of the region s surplus funds towards productive investments within asia in particular the region s massive infrastructure gap particularly in the transport sector is constraining productivity growth and dampening medium term development prospects according to the adb the developing asia region needs to invest 1 7 trillion per year in infrastructure until 2030 in order to maintain its growth momentum achieve sustained poverty reduction and combat climate change south asia india increasingly attractive to foreign capital according to escap estimates south asia would be on track to achieve the sdgs with an estimated additional investment of 1 00 per person per day until 2030 considering the entire population of the region the annual needs translate into over 700 billion per year until 2030 given that 18 per cent of the regional population is below 9 years old and 37 per cent below 19 years old human capital investment will remain the top priority for many years meanwhile as the impact of climate change intensifies the necessary infrastructure investment will increasingly consume more of government revenues financing sources for all required investments remain a substantial concern to the south asian economies private capital is overwhelmingly directed towards sectors with the most favourable risk return balance leaving governments to continue to finance public goods with a lower financial return in india rapid economic growth political stability rising wealth and openness to foreign investors draw substantial attention from financial markets despite this fdi to india remained at a constant annual 62 64 billion including around 44 billion into equity in the last two years ending in march 2019 services received 18 per cent of all equity fdi with a 37 per cent increase compared to last year the sector is followed by software and hardware investments with a 9 per cent share after a 24 per cent fall around 10 per cent of equity flows remain directed towards various construction activities while india s energy needs will continue to offer countless investment opportunities for many years the power sector received only 3 per cent of recent equity flows with a substantial decline compared to the previous year western asia arab regional partnership seeks leverage for growth and development on 13 june the united nations secretary general antónio guterres told the security council that the cooperation between the united nations and the league of arab states las is pivotal various united nations activities are underway with the las on peace and security challenges and socioeconomic development issues the las is the main regional partnership platform for the arab region including a large part of western asia the arab region includes both high income countries and least developed countries with varying endowments of natural and human resources thus higher economic growth across the region can be sought by leveraging on existing complementarities between countries for example jordanian and lebanese workers in the high income oil exporting countries in the region contributed to the growth of the non oil sector in return the remittance flows to jordan and lebanon helped sustain the economic growth of both countries even at the height of the syrian refugee crisis for this year attaining a sufficient level of regional financial inflows became even more critical for both jordan and lebanon to implement fiscal reform measures as public debt has reached alarming levels in both countries the regional partnership along the las can augment the synergies between the countries through closer economic integration notably efforts to create the arab common market have been progressing in line with the agreements for the greater arab free trade area and the arab customs union latin america and the caribbean china s direct investment slows in 2018 the value of latin america and the caribbean s merchandise trade rose by an estimated 9 7 per cent from the previous year a main driver behind this increase was a rapid expansion in trade with china which is the largest export market for several south american economies including brazil chile peru and uruguay the value of the region s total shipments to china is estimated to have grown by 27 per cent in 2018 raw materials most notably soybeans crude oil iron ore and copper and natural resource based manufactures account for more than 90 per cent of exports to china imports from china on the other hand which consist almost exclusively of manufactures increased by about 13 per cent in 2018 while trade continued to expand china s direct investment activity in the region has slowed the value of both announced greenfield fdi projects and of transactions actually carried out declined notably in 2018 in terms of sector and destination chinese fdi in the region has become more diversified in recent years during the commodity boom of the 2000s fdi flows to latin america and the caribbean were heavily concentrated in the raw material sector since then an increasing share of total investment has gone into manufacturing and services argentina and brazil the two countries that had historically garnered the largest share of chinese fdi have seen inflows decline over the past few years amid unstable economic and political conditions by contrast chile and peru have recorded gains both are among the 19 latin american and caribbean countries that have formally agreed to cooperate with china through the belt and road initiative
populists say that devaluing the us dollar will bring back american jobs and boost domestic manufacturing what kind of american leader would want less bang for the buck more and more it turns out the idea of driving down the value of the united states dollar appeals increasingly to politicians and policymakers both on the protectionist right and on the populist left us senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts a democratic candidate for the us presidency has proposed managing our currency to promote exports and kick start domestic manufacturing a cheaper greenback could boost us exports by making the nation s goods less expensive to buy abroad warren s plan for economic patriotism bears a striking resemblance to us president donald trump s suggestion that the federal government help the american worker by realigning the dollar in an effort to lower the us trade deficit but three quarters of a century after the bretton woods conference sought to end the practice of competitively devaluing currencies economists vociferously disagree about whether the dollar should be weaponised in a currency war critics argue that gaming the value of the us dollar the primary international reserve currency and mode of payment could unhinge the world economy cause global instability drive inflation and make stock markets tank the dollar was anointed king of world currencies 75 years ago on monday by representatives of 44 countries who had gathered in bretton woods in the us to hammer out a blueprint for the post world war ii global monetary system one of the key objectives of the bretton woods agreement was to bring stability to foreign exchange markets and stop countries from competitively devaluing their currencies by pegging them to the dollar which in turn was tied to gold over the decades since the first agreement there have been several modifications most importantly the us abandoned the gold standard in the 1970s but the dollar is still king as trump instigates trade wars with china mexico and other key trading partners some economists argue that pushing the dollar lower would be more effective than tariffs at leveling the playing field for us exports they say that currency realignment is a better strategy for giving us goods a competitive advantage than levying import taxes on 250bn of chinese goods balance trade and capital robert scott the director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the progressive economic policy institute has even been cited by trump while making the case that imbalanced trade with china has hurt the workforce in the us three main ideas are being advocated to realign the dollar one the us treasury can impose a market access charge a foreign investment income tax on capital inflows to reduce demand for us financial assets two the us federal reserve the us central bank could purchase massive amounts of other currencies called countervailing currency intervention or three trump could negotiate a temporary fix with major economies to realign the dollar with the yuan and euro scott favours option one speed bumps on foreign investment in us stocks bonds real estate and other assets to slow down cross border transfers of currency to bring the dollar down from unsustainably high levels he says the fed and central banks in other countries should be adjusting the tax rate s so as to balance trade and capital flows scott told al jazeera that his proposal to remedy imbalances includes a dollar adjustment system that was missing from the hard dollar peg was the basis of the bretton woods system since central banks in about 20 nations mostly in asia have financed their trade surpluses with the us by purchasing treasuries and by extension have triggered the outsourcing of some us jobs scott says it is high time for insourcing to reverse the decades long trend of production going overseas by his calculation if the dollar were manipulated to fall by 25 percent overall and potentially even more against the chinese japanese and european union currencies the us trade deficit could decline by hundreds of billions of dollars annually it is on pace to hit 700bn by 2021 currency manipulation acts like an artificial subsidy to the host country s exports and as a tax on all us exports scott wrote just months after trump took office referencing china and others currency manipulation acts like an artificial subsidy to the host country s exports and as a tax on all us exports by robert scott economic policy institute china has been buying up us currency for years and now holds 3 trillion of foreign reserves and 1 12 trillion in treasury bonds one way countries drive down the value of their own currencies is by buying assets denominated in the currencies of other countries and when countries buy us treasuries they increase demand for such assets which then drives up the value of the us dollar as us goods became increasingly uncompetitive companies moved production from the us to set up shop in places where labour is cheaper in part because workers are paid in currency that is weaker than the dollar yet beijing is far from the only nation manipulating its currency to prop up exports and cultivate domestic production trump himself has also called out russia and the eu for this practice avoid tampering with the greenback manipulating the dollar is not necessarily a panacea for the overall us economy even though a strong dollar makes us exports more expensive around the world it has been good for some us companies that rely on low cost imports especially retailers walmart costco apple amazon dollar general and other retailers that rely heavily on cheap imports would see their prices rise and profits fall boohoo said scott that s one reason wall street is against dollar devaluation which prioritises workers over corporate shareholders trade creates more wealth but populists on both sides of the aisle have criticised trade deals in recent decades that have led to a disproportionate share of trading wealth accruing to business owners while workers fall further behind proponents like scott say on balance that currency realignment would increase us economic growth and government revenue because though manufacturing only comprises eight percent of total us employment it is 12 percent of total us economic output american labourers and exporters could potentially benefit from regaining a fraction of the 5 million manufacturing jobs that have been lost in part due to the overvalued dollar though automation has also played a significant role but if the us unilaterally devalues the dollar other countries could follow suit spawning a global currency war still economists of all stripes including classical liberals and conservatives are resistant to the idea of a currency realignment one notable attempt was the partially successful 1985 plaza accord in which the us and four other major economies agreed to devalue the us dollar to correct trade imbalances president trump and senator elizabeth warren should avoid tampering with the value of the dollar directly david beckworth a senior research fellow with the libertarian mercatus center at george mason university told al jazeera instead they should appoint people to the fed who would make decisions that would lead to a more properly valued dollar beckworth attributes the dollar s recent rise to differences in monetary policy a disparity in interest rate targets set by central banks around the globe in recent years the fed has hiked interest rates more than its central bank counterparts in other major economies which has contributed to the dollar s relative strength the last time the fed lowered interest rates was over a decade ago last month the fed signaled rate cuts may be in the cards this year thanks to economic uncertainty and ongoing global trade wars trump meanwhile has asked aggressively for lower rates to stimulate growth to be clear the fed does not aim to manage the dollar but instead strives to hit its dual mandate of stable prices and full employment said beckworth nonetheless easing by the fed would indirectly cause all else equal a decline in the dollar hold the dollar other economists worry that a weaker greenback would pose dangerous inflationary risks that could negatively impact average americans if the economy is at full employment like in the us the cheaper dollar if not accompanied by tighter budget policy could result in higher inflation said desmond lachman a resident fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute inflation in turn would offset the competitive benefits from a cheap currency lachman told al jazeera adding that us consumers would pay the price lachman argues that a more responsible budget policy with lower annual government deficits would give the fed leeway to drop rates without stoking inflation lower interest rates would make the us dollar less attractive and would lead to its depreciation he said and when it comes to the international trade and currency framework first enacted in 1944 and then altered several decades later not everyone thinks it needs to change the bretton woods system was modified in 1973 to deal with a world of floating currencies said lachman it has served us well and we should stick with it

the single most influential work on imperialism remains v i lenin s classic study of a century ago imperialism the latest stage of capitalism better known by the title given to it following its first publication imperialism the highest stage of capitalism 1 lenin employed the term modern imperialism or simply imperialism to refer to the age of concentrated capital during which the entire world was being carved up by the leading states and their corporations distinguishing the imperialist stage from the colonialism imperialism of the mercantilist and freely competitive stages of capitalism that preceded it colonial policy and imperialism lenin insisted existed before this latest stage of capitalism and even before capitalism 2 the new imperialist stage beginning in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and extending into the twentieth century was seen as a product of the growth of giant capitalist firms with monopoly power the close connection forged between these corporations and the nation states in which they arose and the resulting struggle for control of the world s populations and resources leading to intercapitalist competition and war if it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism lenin wrote we would have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism 3 lenin s general analysis of imperialism belonged to a group of largely complementary theories in the marxian tradition that included such works as rudolf hilferding s finance capital 1910 rosa luxemburg s the accumulation of capital 1913 and nikolai bukharin s imperialism and the world economy 1915 4 yet lenin s own analysis was unrivaled in its ability to capture the dominant world conditions up through the second world war including accounting for the world wars themselves a strong point in his analysis was its concrete historical character divorced from rigid theoretical formulae it encompassed such varied phenomena as the growth of monopoly and financial capital division of the world among the international trusts capital export the race for energy and raw materials class struggle geopolitical rivalry in the struggle for economic territory and spheres of influence the emergence of a labor aristocracy in the capitalist core and the contest for global and regional hegemony 5 while emphasizing intercapitalist competition lenin also pointed to the hierarchy of nation states which served to divide the core powers from the poorer nations of the periphery that fell within their imperial orbits his analysis went beyond colonialism to discuss neocolonialism in relation to latin america in the 1920s alert to the revolutionary struggles occurring in mexico turkey persia china and india lenin pioneered in extending his analysis to the consideration of all imperialist oppressed colonies and countries and all dependent countries giving rise to revolution in the periphery against international imperialism 6 however history in the marxian conception is a dialectic of continuity and change by the 1960s lenin s analysis despite its comprehensiveness needed updating in the post second world war era the united states emerged with near absolute hegemony over the capitalist world economy at the same time the world saw the greatest revolutionary wave in history associated with the break with colonialism the rise of neocolonialism and the emergence of a rival sphere of post revolutionary society including states with socialist aspirations 7 in this changed atmosphere corresponding with the cold war the united states and its allies presented a new ideology of economic growth development aid and modernization within the capitalist ideological framework an army of liberal and social democratic intellectuals including such figures as mark blaug benjamin j cohen robert w tucker and barrington moore jr were enlisted in the 1960s and 70s to deny the existence of economic imperialism if not imperialism more generally aiming their analysis at various figures on the left and in the united states in particular including paul baran paul sweezy william appleman williams and harry magdoff 8 at the very center of the intense debate on u s imperialism in the 1960s and 70s in the context of the vietnam war was magdoff s the age of imperialism the economics of u s foreign policy 1969 written just over fifty years after lenin s great work taken together with magdoff s collection of historical and theoretical essays from the late 1960s and 70s imperialism from the colonial age to the present 1978 the age of imperialism stands as the single most integrated economic historical and theoretical analysis of u s imperialism at its peak in the so called golden age of monopoly capitalism 9 magdoff more than any other figure at the time modeled the dialectic of continuity and change in the marxian analysis of imperialism linking his work to lenin s earlier analysis like other major marxian theorists of imperialism from the mid twentieth century to today such as baran sweezy and samir amin he continued to lay stress on the concentration and centralization of capital along with the rise of monopolistic corporations as the key to understanding late twentieth and emerging twenty first century imperialism in addition magdoff built on the complexity and multifaceted nature of lenin s original approach attempting to replicate this for a later era magdoff had designed the statistical productivity measures still used today by the u s department of labor for the works progress administration s national research project on re employment opportunities and technological development during the new deal in the 1930s he was a pivotal figure in the organization of u s war industry in the second world war as chief of the civilian requirements division of the national defense advisory commission and in his role in the war production board where he was put in charge of planning and controls in the machinery industries he subsequently headed the current business analysis division of the department of commerce where he supervised the u s government s survey of current business and then served as economic adviser to u s secretary of commerce and former u s vice president henry wallace this extraordinary background in the construction and analysis of u s economic statistics and in wartime planning meant that magdoff was well equipped to provide definitive empirical demonstrations of economic imperialism on the part of u s corporations and the u s state along with its relation to the wider dimensions of world imperialism 10 in magdoff s treatment imperialism could not be viewed at the high level of abstraction sometimes used for the analysis of the logic of capital rather a reasonable approach to imperialism required attention to the inner workings of global capitalism informed by theoretical abstraction but ultimately confirmed and made meaningful at a concrete historical level 11 this conformed to the method of karl marx himself who developed his critique of political economy by means of successive approximations moving from the abstract to the concrete marx thus began his critique with capital originally slated as volume 1 in a six volume work representing the most abstract level of analysis and intended to complete it with volume 5 on international trade and volume 6 on the world economy and crises that is in terms of the concrete analysis of what today would be called the imperialist world system however he never got beyond volume 1 of the original plan which turned into the three volumes of capital 12 imperialism magdoff argued was inherently complex and changing in its configurations reflecting both the centripetal and centrifugal forces governing the system where u s imperialism was concerned it had to be interpreted in such a way that the essential one ness between economic political and military strategic objectives tendencies was revealed the role of multinational corporations abroad could not be separated from the role of u s military bases spread across the planet or the need to control oil and other strategic resources magdoff was at his best in refuting those who attempted to claim 1 that foreign direct investment and trade were of little economic significance to the united states he demonstrated that foreign direct investment had risen from around 10 percent of u s after tax nonfinancial corporate profits in 1950 to about 22 percent by 1964 2 that the u s economy was not dependent on oil or other raw materials located abroad and had no inherent geopolitical interests and 3 that u s profits were only marginally affected by surplus extracted from the periphery of the world system 13 the fact that the other major capitalist countries all acceded to u s hegemony did not mean that intercapitalist competition had entirely disappeared or would not resurface in the future responding to those who questioned whether imperialism was really necessary to the united states magdoff explained that imperialism is the way of life of capitalism 14 for magdoff writing in the late 1960s and early 70s the main changes in the structure of imperialism since lenin s time beyond decolonization and the rise of u s hegemony were all related to the further development of monopoly capital 1 the emergence of the military industrial complex 2 the rise of multinational corporations including multinational banking and their growing penetration of the periphery and 3 the priority of the interests of military multinational industry on the affairs of state this description he noted applied first and foremost to the united states itself but reflected relations also materializing among rival imperial powers in essence he was pointing to a tendency within the system toward the formation of a more generalized monopoly capitalism beginning in the united states but lording itself over the entire globe a key element in magdoff s age of imperialism was his chapter on the growth of the financial network investigating the whole phenomenon of multinational banking and finance in general a treatment that he was to carry forward in the early 1990s in globalization to what end which included his analysis of the globalization of finance 15 it will be argued here that the globalization of production and finance which emerged along with neoliberalism out of the economic stagnation of the mid 1970s and then accelerated with the demise of soviet type societies and china s reintegration into the capitalist world system has generated a more generalized monopoly capitalism theorized by thinkers such as magdoff baran sweezy and amin this ushered in what can be called late imperialism late imperialism refers to the present period of monopoly finance capital and stagnation declining u s hegemony and rising world conflict accompanied by growing threats to the ecological bases of civilization and life itself it stands at its core for the extreme hierarchical relations governing the capitalist world economy in the twenty first century which is increasingly dominated by mega multinational corporations and a handful of states at the center of the world system just as it is now common to refer to late capitalism in recognition of the end times brought on by simultaneous economic and ecological dislocations so it is necessary today to speak of late imperialism reflecting the global dimensions and contradictions of that system cutting across all other divisions and posing a global rift in human historical development an epochal crisis posing the question of ruin or revolution 16 the persistent failure of many on the left particularly in the advanced capitalist states to acknowledge these developments is largely the result of a growing abandonment of the theory of imperialism substituting more reified conceptions related to globalization seen as dissolving former imperial hierarchies this is so much the case that a host of alternative frameworks are now offered suggesting 1 the progressive and self annihilating role of imperialism 2 shifting hegemonies within the world system conceived as a substitute for the theory of imperialism 3 deterritorialized stateless borderless empire 4 abstract political imperialism led by the united states or rule by supranational organizations removed from economic forces 5 the rise of transnationalism as an entity in itself largely independent of states and geography and 6 the supposed reversal of imperialist dominance hence before examining the historical phenomenon of late imperialism it is necessary to view some of these prevalent misconceptions on the left in the imperial countries themselves resulting from a refusal to come to terms with the complex many sided structural realities of late imperialism in the twenty first century the western left and the denial of imperialism the issue of the abandonment of the critique of imperialism within much of the western left was dramatically raised by prabhat patnaik in his november 1990 monthly review article entitled whatever happened to imperialism writing two decades after magdoff s the tge of imperialism and a little more than a decade after imperialism from the colonial age to the present patnaik an economist at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi observed an outsider cannot help noticing a remarkable transformation that has taken place in the marxist discourse in the united states over the last decade hardly anybody talks about imperialism any more in 1974 i left cambridge england where i was teaching economics and have now returned to the west this time to the united states after 15 years when i left imperialism occupied perhaps the most prominent place in any marxist discussion and nowhere was more being written about and talked about on this subject than in the united states so much so that many european marxists accused american marxism of being tainted with third worldism marxists everywhere looked to the united states for literature on imperialism this is obviously not the case today younger marxists look bemused when the term is mentioned burning issues of the day are discussed but without any reference to imperialism radical indignation over the invasion of panama or military intervention in nicaragua and el salvador does not jell into theoretical propositions about imperialism and the topic has virtually disappeared from the pages of marxist journals especially those of a later vintage curiously this is not because any one has theorized against the concept the silence over imperialism is not the aftermath of some intense debate where the scales tilted decisively in favor of one side it is not a theoretically self conscious silence nor can it be held that the world has so changed in the last decade and a half that to talk of imperialism has become an obvious anachronism 17 at the time patnaik attributed the change in left perspectives in the united states to absence of a major war such as the vietnam war in the 1975 90 period but of equal importance in the 1980s and early 90s governing the mood in radical circles was the evolving economic situation with the u s economy along with that of the other advanced capitalist countries experiencing deepening economic stagnation in contrast to faster growth in some parts of asia on this shaky basis the dependency thesis of the development of underdevelopment made famous especially by andre gunder frank writing in monthly review was designated as erroneous even by many on the left in spite of the fact that the gap in national income between the leading imperial countries and the developing world as a whole continued to widen with the share of world income received by the top 20 percent of the world s population divided into nation states rising from 66 percent in 1965 to 83 percent in 1990 18 marxist theorist bill warren argued as early as 1973 in imperialism and capitalist industrialization in new left review that dependency in poor countries was in irreversible decline due to a major upsurge in capitalist development in the third world according to warren marx in articles such as the british rule in india had seen colonialism imperialism as playing a constructive role in underdeveloped countries this was later mistakenly reversed by lenin in his imperialism which represented an about turn in marxist theory giving rise to dependency theory the problems of development facing the poorer countries warren argued were not primarily external as depicted by dependistas but could be traced to internal contradictions this outlook though not widespread in the 1970s when warren first introduced it was to gain considerable influence within the western left by 1980 when his posthumous imperialism pioneer of capitalism was published 19 a quite different departure from classical theories of imperialism appeared in the afterword to the 1983 edition of giovanni arrighi s the geometry of imperialism a leading marxian inspired world systems theorist arrighi ended up abandoning the theory of imperialism which he no longer considered relevant replacing it with a more limited conception of struggles over world hegemony the model of the capitalist world system with its shifting hegemonies was seen by arrighi as an adequate substitute for the more complex notion of imperialism the decline of the nation state in the wake of globalization meant that the old theories of imperialism had become obsolete and the theory of monopoly capitalism was likewise seen as dated what remained was a world system and the jostling for hegemony 20 however the most far reaching left rejections of the marxian critique of imperialism were to await the present century in 2000 michael hardt and antonio negri published empire arguing that imperialism was now a thing of the past with the vietnam war representing the final moment of the imperialist tendency only to be replaced by a new deterritorialized global constitutional order and world market modeled on u s political economic relations in a left version of francis fukuyama s end of history the hierarchical imperialism of old hardt and negri argued had been succeeded by the smooth space of the capitalist world market a view that anticipated by five years neoliberal globalization pundit thomas l friedman s claim that the world is flat hence it was no longer possible they wrote to demarcate large geographical zones as center and periphery north and south this transcendence of imperialism in favor of the stateless borderless sovereignty of empire based in a world market consisting of mere network relations without a center and periphery was seen as emerging out of the inner logic of capitalism itself imperialism hardt and negri stated actually creates a straitjacket for capital the inner logic of which ultimately requires a smooth space or flat world in which to operate 21 such ideas were hardly novel except within marxian circles what was innovative was the use of marxian and postmodern terminology to boost views long promoted within establishment u s foreign policy which resulted in hardt and negri s work being highly praised by the new york times time magazine foreign affairs and other mainstream publications it was this that led ellen meiksins wood to refer to hardt and negri s empire as in effect a manifesto on behalf of global capital 22 hardt and negri s rejection of any continuity with classical marxian theories of imperialism opened the way to various sometimes insightful but one dimensional approaches on the left converging with mainstream ideology in the making of global capitalism in 2013 leo panitch and sam gindin stressed the ability of the u s state primarily through actions of the treasury department and the federal reserve board to create a world after its own image subordinating european capital to its influence the argument which was inspired in part by peter gowan s critique of the dollar wall street regime while informative was an almost exclusively political one systematically downplaying the economic dimension of imperialism including finance capital multinational corporations continuing international rivalry and the deteriorating conditions of the underdeveloped world panitch and gindin thus provided an analysis of u s empire much more conversant with received views as opposed to the classical conceptions of imperialism with their numerous critical dimensions in the making of global capitalism the older structure of imperialist countries in the center and the dependent countries in the periphery gave way to smooth networks of transnational production as well as finance revolving around american capitalism s central place in global capitalism what was conveyed was a stable u s world hegemonic order rooted in a washington wall street consensus and seemingly destined to continue indefinitely a mirror image of the view prevailing within u s foreign policy circles but now emanating from the left in this interpretation global capitalism arising out of american empire and managed by the u s state entirely subsumed the more complex and multifaceted and at the same time more concrete analysis of imperialism offered by thinkers such as lenin luxemburg magdoff and amin 23 if panitch and gindin emphasized the rise of political empire largely dispensing with what john hobson had called the economic taproot of imperialism transnationalization theorist william i robinson went in the opposite direction arguing that capital in the age of globalization has completely swallowed up nation states and created a new transnational order dominated by free floating transnational corporations giving rise to a transnational capitalist class and the transnational state writing in a theory of global capitalism in 2004 robinson declared that globalization involves a supersession of the nation state as the organizing principle of social life under capitalism 24 in 2018 in beyond the theory of imperialism a chapter in his into the tempest robinson made a clean break with classical theories of imperialism the class relations of global capitalism are now so deeply internalized within every nation state that the classical image of imperialism as a relation of external domination is outdated and must be abandoned together with notions such as center periphery and surplus extraction the end of the extensive enlargement of capitalism is the end of the imperialist era of world capitalism it is not imperialism in the old sense either of rival national capitals or the domination by core states of precapitalist regions that is needed but a theory of capitalist expansion as a specifically transnational and supranational process characterized by shifting spatial dynamics 25 meanwhile marxist geographer david harvey leaped beyond all of these perspectives claiming in 2017 that the flows of capital have so changed direction that the historical draining of wealth from east to west for more than two centuries has been largely reversed over the last thirty years emphasis added he admitted i don t find the category of imperialism that compelling imperialism was a concept not to be found in marx but mainly attributable to lenin the whole notion of global peripheries was said to be unclear as to its boundaries and arrighi s notion of shifting hegemonies could be seen as displacing earlier marxian theories of imperialism 26 in his 2003 new imperialism a work he now says was not meant to promote the concept of imperialism so much as to combat neoconservative attempts to adopt the term as their own harvey praised hardt and negri s depiction of a decentered configuration of empire that had many new postmodern qualities his book ended by advocating a new new deal imperialism viewed as a more progressive imperialism under a more enlightened washington consensus replacing the current neoliberal neoconservative global order for harvey the left was to be chastised for its icy reception to warren s notion of the progressive character of imperialism 27 if harvey s position on imperialism over the years has been somewhat incoherent his current rejection of the notion of an imperialist world system in the name of a supposedly more dynamic view focusing on constantly shifting spatial configurations which have reversed traditional center periphery relations could not be clearer in its implications referring to contemporary globalization tendencies he explains that it didn t even make sense to try to cram all of this into some universal concept of imperialism the entire marxian analysis of imperialism has become a theoretical straitjacket 28 in conformity with arrighi he discards the rigid geography of core and periphery in favor of a more open and fluid analysis 29 in the process however it becomes necessary to break with the entire historical materialist critique of imperialism in his 2014 the seventeen contradictions of capitalism imperialism does not even warrant inclusion amongst his list of capitalism s double digit contradictions his chapter on uneven geographical developments and the production of space does not once mention imperialism nor center and periphery the only direct reference to lenin s imperialism is aimed at downplaying the structural role of monopoly capital which lenin had associated with imperialism 30 late imperialism there is no question that world capitalism has changed in the century since the first world war when lenin developed his critique of the imperialist stage yet this has to be seen in the context of a historical dialectic that embraces continuity as well as change imperialism is a historical as much as a theoretical category if half a century ago it was still possible to refer as magdoff did to the age of imperialism even to the point of seeing this as imperialism s golden age today we are clearly in an era of late imperialism associated with generalized monopoly finance capital the globalization of production new forms of surplus extraction from the periphery to center and epochal economic military and environmental challenges the crises facing the system and human society as a whole are now so severe that they are creating new fissures in the state in both the advanced capitalist and emerging economies with a rapid growth of protofascist and neofascist tendencies on the one hand and a revival of socialism on the other recognizing the continuity with earlier phases of imperialism is as crucial to our understanding of the present as our awareness of the distinguishing characteristics of the current phase each historical phase of imperialism relies on different means of exploitation and expropriation to feed accumulation on a world scale imperialist countries at the core of the system invariably attempt to restructure labor in the capitalist periphery or in the precapitalist external areas to reinforce power and accumulation at the center of the system at the same time the core imperial nations are often in competition with each other for global spheres of influence the early colonial era in the mercantilist stage of capitalism during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries centered not on free exchange but on profit upon expropriation along with the extirpation enslavement and entombment in mines of the indigenous population of the americas and much of africa and asia 31 in the later mid nineteenth century colonial era or stage of free competition under british hegemony free trade operated in the core of the world economy but this went hand in hand with colonialism in much of the world where unequal exchange and outright robbery and plunder predominated in 1875 robert arthur talbot gascoyne cecil the 3rd marquess of salisbury then secretary of state for british india declared as india must be bled the bleeding should be done judiciously 32 bled it was but not judiciously as utsa patnaik has demonstrated in detail the present value of the drain of surplus from india to britain from 1765 to 1938 amounts on a highly underestimated basis to 9 2 trillion compared to a 2 1 trillion gross domestic product gdp for the united kingdom in 2018 33 nineteenth century colonial capitalism evolved by the end of the century into what lenin called the imperialist stage characterized by the rise of monopoly capital in all the great powers the decline of british hegemony and rising tension over the division of the entire world among the core capitalist powers these conditions led to two world wars among the rival claimants to hegemony over economic territory following the second world war the united states emerged as the world hegemon within the capitalist world in a context that also included a cold war with the rival socialist oriented world while promoting an ideology of free trade and development the u s hegemon nonetheless put in place a system of neocolonialism enforced by multinational corporations dollar hegemony and a globe spanning string of military bases from which numerous military interventions and regional wars were to be launched this was accompanied by the siphoning off of much of the economic surplus of the global south with the rise of monopoly finance capital the world has entered a new phase of imperialism late imperialism rather than a superseding of imperial relations late imperialism as we have seen represents an epoch in which the global contradictions of the system are revealed in ever starker forms and in which the entire planet as a place of human habitation is now at risk with the catastrophic effects falling disproportionately on the most vulnerable of the world population all of this is bound to generate greater geopolitical conflict as capitalism s failure as a society becomes evident none of this was a complete surprise for the more astute analysts of globalization in 1992 magdoff wrote that contrary to widespread expectations sources of tension among the leading capitalist powers have increased side by side with their growing interdependence nor has the geographic spread of capital reduced the contradictions between the rich and poor nations although a handful of third world countries benefiting from the globalization process have made noteworthy progress in industrialization and trade the overall gap between core and periphery nations has kept on widening the process of globalization has produced much that is new in the world s economy and politics but it has not changed the basic ways capitalism operates nor has it aided the cause of either peace or prosperity 34 indeed there is something deeply ironic about the growing rejection of the theoretical critique of imperialism in the present global context as argentinian marxist atilio borón observed in 2003 in empire and imperialism imperialism today reflects those fundamental features with respect to the concentration and centralization of capital on a global scale portrayed by the classical marxist theorists of imperialism but in more developed forms this new stage is characterized now even more than in the past by the concentration of capital the overwhelming predominance of monopolies the increasingly important role played by financial capital the export of capital and the division of the world into spheres of influence the acceleration of globalization that took place in the final quarter of the last century instead of weakening or dissolving the imperialist structures of the world economy magnified the structural asymmetries that define the insertion of the different countries in it while a handful of developed capitalist nations increased their capacity to control at least partially the productive processes at a global level the financialization of the international economy and the growing circulation of goods and services the great majority of countries witnessed the growth of their external dependency and the widening of the gap that separated them from the centre globalization in short consolidated the imperialist domination and deepened the submission of peripheral capitalisms which became more and more incapable of controlling their domestic economic processes even marginally 35 the new phase of imperialism that arose at the very end of the twentieth and the beginning of the twenty first century has been described by amin and various authors associated with monthly review as a system of global monopoly finance capital or a capitalism of generalized monopolies 36 in this more integrated imperialist system five hundred corporations account for nearly 40 percent of world revenue while most other firms in the world economy are entangled in the webs of these giant firms and exist as mere subcontractors 37 production and circulation are now organized in the form of global commodity chains serving to highlight the different roles of center and periphery within these commodity chains this is in line with the global labor arbitrage which serves to promote the intensified exploitation expropriation of labor in the global south leading to the capture of much of this extra value by the north the heightened imperialist controls of global finance and communications are inherent parts of this process without which the globalization of production would not be possible 38 the late 1970s and 80s saw the growth of neoliberal globalization which sought with considerable success to subordinate states particularly in the global south to the rules of a world market where by definition the financial center rules late imperialism can thus also be seen as the period in which economic stagnation financialization and the planetary ecological crisis all emerged as widening irreversible fissures inseparable from the system of monopoly capitalist accumulation itself and finding its ideological justification in neoliberalism a distinguishing feature of globalized production and finance in the current century is the systematic exploitation of low unit labor costs in the south a product of the fact that wages are kept at levels far below those of the north due to 1 the enormous global reserve army located primarily in the south 2 restrictions on the movement of labor between countries and particularly from poor to rich countries and 3 the force of imperialist pressures past and present 39 as economist tony norfield former executive director and global head of foreign exchange strategy in a major european bank explained in 2015 in t shirt economics labour in the imperialist world economy everybody knows that workers in developed capitalist countries are paid more than those in poorer countries however the divergence in average wages can nevertheless be surprising not just 20 percent or 50 percent but more like a factor of 2 5 10 or 20 between the richer countries and the poorer countries mainstream economic theory explains this and justifies it by arguing that workers in richer countries are more productive than in poorer ones because the former are more educated and skilled working with higher levels of technology yet this explanation does not sit well with the reality that many manufacturing employees in poor countries are employed directly or indirectly by major corporations and working with technology that is often comparable to that in the richer country 40 production by or contracted out by foreign multinationals in poor countries relies on the same or near to the same technology utilized in the rich economies leading to comparable levels of productivity the result combined with extremely low wages is that unit labor costs in manufacturing in the so called emerging economies of china india indonesia and mexico in 2014 were only 46 37 62 and 43 percent respectively of u s levels 41 this generates vastly inflated gross profit margins for multinationals located in the north the total production cost reflected in the export price for a t shirt produced in 2010 through a subcontractor in bangladesh working for the swedish firm hennes mauritz h m was 27 percent of the final sales price in europe with the workers in bangladesh receiving a mere pittance for their labor one worker at the factory received 1 36 for a ten to twelve hour day 42 the price markup or gross profit margin on an iphone assembled in china in 2009 was over 64 percent 43 the widening gross profit margins associated with the global labor arbitrage have led to a rapid globalization of production with the world share of industrial employment located in developing including emerging economies rising from 52 percent in 1980 to 83 percent in 2012 44 today a large and rapidly growing portion of production is outsourced to the periphery in the form of arms length contracting or what is known as the non equity modes of production such as leasing licensing franchising and management service contracts constituting a kind of middle ground between foreign direct investment by multinationals and actual trade in 2010 the non equity modes of production generated over 2 trillion in sales 45 still not all value chain production exploiting low unit labor costs in the global south takes the form of subcontracting or the non equity modes of production much of it occurs in the form of more traditional foreign direct investment by multinationals in 2013 alone u s receipts from investments abroad in foreign companies equities bonds etc amounted to 773 4 billion while u s payments on its liabilities from investments that foreigners made in the united states added up to only 564 9 billion resulting in a net gain of some 209 billion equal to about 35 percent of total u s net private domestic investment for that year this only accelerated problems of surplus capital absorption 46 as baran and sweezy wrote in 1966 in monopoly capital foreign investment far from being an outlet for domestically generated surplus is a most efficient device for transferring surplus generated abroad to the investing country under these circumstances it is of course obvious that foreign investment aggravates rather than helps to solve the surplus absorption problem 47 other factors as well enter into the transfer of value from developing countries including capital flight from the global south estimated at more than a 1 7 trillion dollars in 2012 48 indeed every single form of financial transaction between the global north and south includes an element of what marx called profit upon expropriation or simple robbery reflecting the uneven power relations 49 as norfield writes finance is a way for rich countries to draw income from the rest of the world economy 50 a 2015 report by the centre for applied economics of the norwegian school of economics and the united states based global financial integrity estimates that net resource transfers many of them illicit from developing countries independent of the hidden transfers associated with unequal exchange amounted to 2 trillion in 2012 alone rising to 3 trillion if estimates of same invoice faking are included 51 a number of studies have been carried out to estimate the extent of the hidden value transfers due to unequal exchange relations between global south and north whereby the latter gets more labour in exchange for less 52 one approach pioneered by canadian economist gernot köhler utilized purchasing power parity ppp data to show how labor incorporated into export products from the global south given the difference between nominal and real exchange rates failed to reflect what that labor would be worth in terms of local purchasing power in the emerging economy in the words of jason hickel in the divide köhler s method is to calculate the difference between nominal exchange rates and real exchange rates i e corrected for purchasing power for goods traded for example imagine a nominal exchange rate between the us dollar and the indian rupee of 1 50 now imagine that india sends r1 000 worth of goods to the us and receives 20 in return that would be a perfectly equal exchange or at least so it would appear the problem is that the nominal exchange rate isn t exactly accurate in india r50 can buy much more than the equivalent of 1 worth of goods for instance perhaps it can buy closer to 2 worth so the real exchange rate in terms of purchasing power is 1 25 this means that when india sent r1 000 worth of goods to the us it was really the equivalent of sending 40 worth in terms of the value that r1 000 could buy in india and yet india received only 20 in return which in real terms is worth only r500 in other words because of the distortion between real and nominal exchange rates india sent 20 r500 more than it received one way to think of this is that india s export goods are worth more than the price they receive on the world market another way is that india s labour is underpaid relative to the value that it produces 53 köhler s empirical results relying on ppp could thus be seen as a rough measure of the transfer of value generated in the south non organization for economic cooperation and development countries but credited to the north oecd countries via what economists call unequal exchange in this way he was able to estimate that such value transfers in 1995 alone amounted to 1 75 trillion representing losses equivalent to almost a quarter of total non oecd gdp 54 although such empirical estimates are open to question in a number of respects there can be little doubt about the underlying reality or the order of magnitude of the imperialist rent 55 as john smith argues the vast s n flows of value associated with unequal exchange are rendered invisible in statistics on gdp trade and financial flows precisely because the value generated in the south is captured in the north all sources of income whether wages profits rent or interest arising from the enormous gross profit margins on southern production are simply booked as value added in the global north contributing to northern gdp 56 the huge profits from outsourcing and other means of global value capture further exacerbate problems of surplus capital absorption much of this imperialist rent ends up in tax havens and becomes a means of amassing financial wealth concentrated in a small number of corporations and wealthy individuals while largely disconnected from the ongoing and increasingly problematic process of production investment and growth in the united states and other imperialist nations 57 this then worsens the overall problem of stagnation characterized by excess capacity underemployment slow growth rising inequality and periodic financial bubbles and crises amin argued that imperialist rent had two distinct components the first was the rent derived from the imperialist exploitation of southern labor the second was the draining of natural resources from the south and violations of its sovereignty in this respect by multinational corporations and imperialist states although the first form of imperialist rent was at least in principle measurable in value terms the second form of rent since it concerned use values and capital s appropriation of free gifts of nature rather than exchange values was not 58 nevertheless marx he insisted had provided ways of perceiving ecological contradictions and ecological imperialism imperialism engages in an enormous struggle for the control of strategic resources it has been estimated that the u s military spends approximately 16 percent of its base budget on directly safeguarding global oil supplies alone 59 it is difficult to exaggerate as magdoff emphasized the extent to which military and natural resource interests are interrelated military hegemony plays a key role in all issues of securing economic territory and strategic resources multinational corporations are inextricably tied to the financial and political military power of the particular states in which they are based without which they could not exist for a moment and on which their ability to engage effectively in international competition depends in the case of the top hundred nonfinancial corporations in the world three quarters have their home in just six countries united states united kingdom france germany japan and switzerland according to norfield what distinguishes an imperialist company is not its size or competitive success or even its global importance as a major producer of goods or services although it will often be a big company given the advantages it enjoys what distinguishes it is the backing it receives from a powerful nation state in the world economy and any advantages it gets because it is located in and identified with that imperialist state likewise what in economic terms distinguishes an imperialist state is its ability to exert power in the world economy on behalf of its national capitalist companies 60 end times imperialism today is more aggressive and boundless in its objectives than ever 61 in the present period of declining u s hegemony as well as economic and ecological decline the dollar oil pentagon regime backed by the entire triad of the united states canada europe and japan is exerting all of its military and financial power to gain geopolitical and geoeconomic advantages 62 the goal is to subordinate still further those countries at the bottom of the world hierarchy while putting obstacles in the way of emerging economies and overthrowing all states that violate the rules of the dominant order intercore conflicts within the triad continue to exist but are currently suppressed not only due to the overwhelming force of u s power but also as a result of the perceived need in the core to contain china and russia which are seen as constituting grave threats to the prevailing imperial order in china and in russia for different but related historical reasons global monopoly finance capital lacks the dominant combination with the national capitalists within their political economies that is present in the other brics countries meanwhile the european union is in disarray experiencing centrifugal as opposed to centripetal tendencies arising out of economic stagnation and the instability generated by imperial blowback emanating from adjacent regions particularly the middle east and north africa under these circumstances global value supply chains along with energy resources and finance are more and more viewed in military strategic terms at the center of this interlocked globalized world order is the unstable hegemony exercised by fortress america over both europe and japan the united states today is pursuing a strategy of full spectrum dominance aimed at not only military but also technological financial and even global energy dominance against a backdrop of impending planetary catastrophe and economic and political disarray 63 in these deteriorating conditions neofascist tendencies have reemerged once again constituting monopoly finance capital s final class based recourse an alliance between big capital and a newly mobilized reactionary lower middle class 64 more and more neoliberalism is merging into neofascism unleashing racism and revanchist nationalism anti imperialist peace movements have waned in most of the capitalist core even in the context of a revival of the left raising once again the question of social imperialism 65 there is a sense of course in which much of this is familiar as magdoff noted centrifugal and centripetal forces have always coexisted at the core of the capitalist process with sometimes one and sometimes the other predominating as a result periods of peace and harmony have alternated with periods of discord and violence generally the mechanism of this alternation involves both economic and military forms of struggle with the strongest power emerging victorious and enforcing acquiescence on the losers but uneven development soon takes over and a period of renewed struggle for hegemony emerges 66 late imperialism however represents a historical end point for the capitalist world order presaging either planetary catastrophe or a new revolutionary beginning today s earth system emergency gives new urgency to the age old collective struggle for freedom in general 67 the wider human struggle must build on the continuing revolutionary resistance of the workers and peoples in the global south aimed first and foremost at overthrowing imperialism as the global manifestation of capitalism labor in core nations cannot be free until labor in periphery nations is free and imperialism is abolished 68 what marx called socialism a society of sustainable human development can only be constructed on a universal basis all narrow invidious exploitative relations must go and humanity must at last confront with sober senses its relations with its kind and its unity with the earth 69 notes
during the election we were promised jobs and growth but in 2019 20 the conversation s forecasting panel is predicting an economic growth rate as weak as any since the financial crisis as well as dismal consumer spending no improvement in unemployment or wage growth and an increased chance of recession as in january the conversation has assembled a forecasting panel of 20 leading economists from 12 universities across six states among them are macroeconomists economic modellers former treasury imf oecd and reserve bank officials a former government minister and a former member of the reserve bank board whereas in january only three members of the 20 person panel expected the reserve bank to cut interest rates and most expected an economic growth rate approaching 3 which is the treasury s estimate of the best that can be achieved on a sustained basis this time all but two expect the bank to cut again and most expect a growth rate closer to 2 one of the most anaemic since the financial crisis read more no surplus no share market growth no lift in wage growth economic survey points to bleaker times post election on the upside the panel expects iron ore prices to stay higher for longer than did the budget it expects home prices to stabilise and it is predicting the lowest government bond rate on record making it cheaper than ever before for the government to borrow and spend its way out of trouble the panel predicts a surplus in name only in 2019 20 and overwhelmingly believes the government should be prepared to abandon it if it has to in order to keep the economy growing economic growth the panel s average forecast for year on year growth is 2 1 year on year growth is the measure used in the budget it compares economic activity throughout all of one financial year with activity throughout all of the previous financial year the budget forecast for 2019 20 is 2 75 respected forecasters including former reserve bank board member warwick mckibbin and former oecd director adrian blundell wignall expect much lower growth than 2 1 mckibbin expects 1 8 blundell wignall expects 1 5 only three of the panel s 20 forecasts are close to treasury s the rest are lower some panellists submitted forecasts for chinese economic growth under sufferance they made it clear they were forecasting official growth not actual growth which they think is much lower even so most expect official growth to slow as the trade war between the united states and china intensifies nigel stapledon says unless it is reined in and he thinks it will be it could bring on recessions other panellists including rebecca cassells say the impact of us tariffs on chinese goods has so far been positive for australia china has responded by investing in infrastructure projects that need australian iron ore and coal this together with reduced competition from other suppliers of iron ore after the collapse of a tailings dam and mine closures in brazil has lifted the price and volume of australian exports to levels not seen for some time the panel expects robust united states growth of 2 6 in 2019 although many members are concerned about the year that will follow the only panellist to forecast low us growth in this year 1 is blundell wignall who until last year analysed world economies in his role as special advisor to the oecd secretary general living standards jobs growth will disappoint both the treasury which has forecast unemployment of 5 by the end of the financial year and reserve bank governor philip lowe who has adopted a target of 4 point something all but three of the 20 person panel expect the rate to stay above 5 the average forecast is 5 3 which is close to the present 5 2 stapledon says australia s recent strong employment growth has been out of kilter with slower gdp growth and the winding down of housing construction meaning jobs growth is set to slow down pushing up unemployment brendan coates says underemployment is also climbing as more people work fewer hours than they would like making it harder for them to push for wage rises rebecca cassells points out that full time employment has grown almost twice as fast among women than men which given the low rates of pay in the industries that traditionally employ women is likely to further depress average wages the headline measure of living standards gdp per capita has been falling but a better measure real net disposable income per capita which takes better account of buying power has been continuing to climb the panel expected to climb a further 1 over the year to june 2020 after climbing 1 3 in the year to march nominal gdp which takes full account of mining revenue and drives company profits and the budget revenue has grown 5 over the past year and is expected to grow 3 in the year ahead the risk of recession the panel regards a recession as more likely than it did in january assigning a 29 probability to a conventionally defined recession in the next two years up from 25 economic modeller janine dixon says the bulk of australia s recent economic growth has come from higher commodity prices via exports she says without them australia would be reliant on weak wage and consumption growth although she believes high population growth will be enough to ensure economic activity doesn t shrink for two consecutive quarters which would be the conventional definition of a recession former treasury and anz bank economist warren hogan says with consumers tightening their belts an external shock could easily knock australia into a recession julie toth an economist at the australian industry group who has also worked for the productivity commission says with growth already low it won t take much to turn it negative debt theorist steve keen who assigns a 95 probability a recession as he did in january says australia escaped that fate during the global financial crisis in part by boosting grants to first home buyers which made australian households among the most indebted in the world and put off the day of reckoning when those debts would be unwound through a mix of good luck and good management australia has avoided a recession during three global downturns since the early 1990s the 1997 asian economic crisis the early 2000s dotcom collapse and the 2007 09 global financial crisis if it succeeds again it will enter its fourth decade recession free in this term of government in mid 2021 wages and prices the panel expects continued historically wage growth of only 2 2 in 2019 20 slightly weaker than the latest reading of 2 3 and well short of the budget forecast of 2 75 if that average forecast is right it will be the seventh consecutive year in which wage growth has fallen short of the budget forecast the good news for wage earners is that even that unusually low rate of wage growth would be well above the rate of inflation which is expected to be only 1 5 or 1 4 on the so called underlying basis watched closely by the reserve bank the bad news for the reserve bank is that it will put inflation well outside the bank s target band of 2 3 for the fifth consecutive year raising questions about whether there is any point to the band abs 6401 0 mark crosby warren hogan and adrian blundell wignall suggest broadening the target band to 1 3 tony makin and nigel stapledon suggest cutting it to 1 2 richard holden and warwick mckibbin suggest ditching it altogether and replacing it with a target for nominal gdp growth mckibbin suggests a nominal gdp target of 6 which given the present forecast for weaker nominal gdp growth would mean interest rate cuts in better times it would mean rate rises chris edmond and craig emerson defend the 2 3 inflation target saying that what is really concerning is the bank s preparedness to stay beneath the target band for extended periods home prices the panel expects only modest falls in sydney and melbourne house prices of 2 3 in each city after falls of 10 over the past year it is more optimistic on home building than is the treasury expecting housing investment to fall by 4 9 rather than the budget forecast of 7 business none of the panellists expects household spending to grow by the 2 75 forecast in the budget on average the panel expects spending growth of just 1 9 in 2019 20 which is little better than the present 1 8 and only few points above population growth janine dixon blames continuing weak growth in wages and incomes nigel stapledon says much of it flows from the weaker housing market household furnishings drive household spending growth household spending drives gdp growth accounting for more than half of it in better news the panel expects mining investment to rebound after sliding for most of the last five years its forecasts of growth in mining investment of 4 4 and growth in non mining investment of 4 are in line with budget forecasts interest rates and the budget perhaps surprisingly given its forecasts for weak employment growth weak economic growth and weak inflation the panel s average forecast for interest rates is for just one more cut perhaps as soon as july 2 but some time in the second half of the year only five panellists expect a followup cut in the first half of next year but among them are craig emerson richard holden and steve keen who were the only three to correctly forecast in january that there would be a rate cut at all this year holden expects two further rate cuts in the second half of this year taking the reserve bank cash rate to 0 75 and then a further two in the first half of next year taking it to just 0 25 keen expects one further cut on the second half of this year and another two in the first half of next year taking it to 0 5 warwick mckibbin is the only panellist expecting the reserve bank to change course expecting one further cut this year and then a series of increases as ballooning debt makes the reserve bank and other central banks realise they cut too far pushing the cash rate back up to 1 5 the panel expects a government 10 year borrowing rate of just 1 5 which is about the lowest it has ever been a year ago the 10 year bond rate was 2 7 the ultra low rate will both make it easier for the government to borrow and cut the cost of servicing its existing debt as loans are rolled over in further good news for the budget the panel expects a substantially higher spot iron ore price than does the government of us 95 a tonne by mid next year instead of the fall to us 55 assumed by the treasury the forecast is somewhat above the department of industry s new july forecast of us 95 a tonne by the end of this year trending down to us 61 by the end of 2020 but are way in excess what was forecast in the budget a sensitivity analysis included in the budget said that for every us 10 that the iron ore price was higher than budgeted the government s tax take would be a 1 1 billion higher in 2019 20 and a 3 7 billion higher in 2020 21 the panel expects the australian dollar to remain broadly where it is at just below 70 us cents as the upward push from strong commodity prices offsets the downward push from domestic economic weakness yet despite the iron ore price and lower borrowing costs the panel expects a much weaker budget outcome than the a 7 1 billion surplus forecast in april its average forecast is for a surplus of only 1 2 billion which is a mere sliver of gdp 0 07 practically indistinguishable from a deficit of the same amount the forecasts come after finance department figures for may released on friday raised the possibility of an early return to surplus in 2018 19 they suggest that surplus is at risk in 2019 20 and beyond both because of economic weakness and an because of an increasingly urgent need to respond to that weakness through spending or further tax cuts asked whether should the government strive to continue to deliver its promise of a surplus if economic growth remains weak or weakens further former oecd director adrian blundell wignall replied bluntly of course not the only panellists prepared to defend the continued pursuit of a surplus in the economy remained weak or weakened were ross guest who said it was a worthwhile aim given the steady rise in government debt to gdp ratio and tony makin who qualified his reply by saying the surplus should be achieved by pruning unproductive expenditure such as industry assistance rather than deferring tax cuts former government minister craig emerson regretfully forecast that the government would deliver a surplus whatever the economic circumstances for political

india s foreign exchange reserves soared to a new record high of usd 426 416 billion in the week to june 21 surging a whopping usd 4 215 billion boosted by higher foreign portfolio investments and a stable rupee the previous high was usd 426 028 billion in the week to april 13 2018 since then it had been fluctuating and had fallen by over usd 35 billion as the monetary authority had been heavily intervening in the market to salvage the rupee which was the worst performing currency in asia throughout 2018 advertisement shy of usd 427 billion the reserves can take care of imports for almost 10 months according to market experts forex reserves are one of the key revenue earning sources for the central bank which invests the money in foreign government bonds and also with the imf and other secure investment class a portion of it is used to shore up the gold reserves as well which after decades the rbi had increased by over 8 tonnes last fiscal for decades the american government securities have the single largest investment class for the rbi despite it being one of the lowest yielding investments but for the fact that the us government has the most secure credit profile as of end may of the total forex reserves over usd 157 billion were invested in us gilts as per the latest us fed data in the reporting week the reserves soared usd 4 215 billion while in the previous reporting week ending june 14 it had declined by usd 1 358 billion to usd 422 2 billion higher forex reserves are must for a fast growing economy like india with higher imports and lower export earnings earlier in the day the central bank said the country is driven by higher imports mostly by crude oil whose prices spiked during the reporting week due to the iran us diplomatic row the fy 19 cad rose to 2 1 per cent of gdp or usd 57 2 billion as against 1 8 per cent in the previous year but for the march quarter it more than halved to 0 7 per cent from 1 8 per cent the central bank said during june till 23 overseas investors had pumped in a net of rs 10 312 crore into the domestic capital markets this has helped steady the rupee on one hand and also boosted the reserves kitty during the month though the debt segment accounted for the lion s share equity investments slowed down on account of rising geopolitical tensions between iran and the us coupled with trade conflict according to the experts foreign portfolio investors have been net buyers for the previous four consecutive months they invested a net rs 9 031 15 crore in may rs 16 093 crore in april rs 45 981 crore in march and rs 11 182 crore in february both equity and debt advertisement the us dollar mobilised through the two dollar rupee buy sell swaps of usd 5 billion each conducted by the reserve bank in march and april also aided the forex reserves in the week to june 28 the foreign currency assets the major component of the overall foreign exchange reserves increased usd 4 202 billion to usd 398 649 billion expressed in dollar terms foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation depreciation of non us units like the euro pound and yen held in the reserves gold reserves remained unchanged at usd 22 958 billion according to the rbi data special drawing rights with the international monetary fund increased by usd 4 2 million to usd 1 453 billion the country s reserve position with the fund also rose by usd 9 6 million to usd 3 354 billion
hubbis and exclusive partner for the event fiera capital corporation fiera assembled an erudite group of 15 gatekeepers asset managers and cios for a private and off the record discussion on the development of frontier and mena markets executive summary the topics covered included the key reasons for investment in frontier markets their high growth but low correlation to global equity markets the rationale for alpha strategies and the sustainability of returns despite the frontier status of markets such as kuwait vietnam and the uae fiera s representatives at the discussion wanted to convey the strategies and objectives of the magna new frontier fund they launched in 2016 fiera was represented by lead portfolio manager dominic bokor ingram rick nino the firm s global head of distribution and chairman of fiera europe and stephen king head of institutional sales apac together they gave the guests a remarkable insight into the universe of frontier markets and offered a deep appreciation of the key attributes that active fund managers should be looking for in the countries and the companies in which they invest the key insights reform the essential catalyst reform is the driver for performance in frontier market investing there is a one to one correlation between reform and economic growth just look at asia in the past 30 years where political economic and financial market reforms have led to dramatic growth in gdp and in company earnings but reforms can be derailed although the outlook for reform in frontier middle east markets and in countries such as vietnam currently are encouraging a watchful eye must be maintained in case the next argentina venezuela or turkey is around the corner only 15 years ago venezuela was the wealthiest country in latin america but today it is an economic and political disaster zone vietnam shines vietnam is perhaps the single most glaring frontier market opportunity with what experts believe is a very sustainable political reform process a sustainable economic reform process and genuine growth in the economy and in corporate performance eastern europe also performs of the 27 countries of eastern europe that were formerly ussr states before the berlin wall fell in 1989 romania and poland are producing the fastest growth in the whole of europe the middle east s appeals reforms are taking place across saudi arabia and the uae countries with some of the nearby countries such as egypt also notable for their reforms frontier markets low foreign investment as well as rapid growth propelled by reforms frontier markets are characterised by minimal focus from outside investors as well as minimal research coverage this opens the door for outperformance by funds driven by bottom up fundamental research and financial modelling to identify major alpha generating opportunities growing the averages the average frontier market is roughly 5 owned by foreign investors while the average well developed emerging market is nearer 50 owned by foreign investors no need to benchmark active funds such as fiera s magna new frontiers fund do not need to benchmark against the msci frontier markets index which might not be that representative of the universe of opportunity with the biggest stocks often private firms highly or often excessively valued alpha generators are not always found in the financial sector which dominate some 50 of the index for example or in the larger privatised ex state entities segment domestic growth a key driver fiera focuses mostly on domestic stocks benefitting from domestic consumption growth for example retail white goods brown good education or healthcare these stocks should benefit from the type of expansion seen in the emerging markets of asia in the past 20 to 30 years liquidity is available the average market capitalisation of the stocks currently in the portfolio is around uds 5bn some of the companies in the saudi market for example are valued at more than usd30 billion and the overall market trades about usd1 billion a day vietnam trades around usd250 million a day currencies not a major issue fiera s managers do not hedge their currency exposures partly this is because currencies in some key markets such as the middle east are dollar pegged and partly because currency issues will show up in fiscal or political changes before any crisis emerges at least for those experts closely watching developments good governance fiera highlighted the vital importance of corporate governance from all aspects including respect for minority shareholder rights appropriate dividend distributions fairness in related party transactions fair valuation for transactions sensible allocation of capital and so forth low correlation frontier markets as an asset class have a very low correlation to emerging or developed markets for example the pakistan index over the last year is down about 60 in us dollars but that has zero impact on saudi arabia where there is a very positive reform process an msci upgrade cycle hence the market in the last year is up about 20 in us dollars the iran contagion fiera considers the iran problem no different from the situation of the past several decades no better and no worse fiera considers that what is going on in the ground in the middle east is massively different from what is perceived by looking at the newspapers and there is no escalation of the problems currently and fiera also considers the current period of economic stability in the region better than any period in the past half century avoiding africa fiera s team have great concerns about africa as frontier markets largely because of internecine strife between races and tribes that have somewhat arbitrarily been carved into countries by colonialists passing back control of the region decades ago since independence started in the late 50s no country has grown sustainably for any real period of time fiera reported but what about china in africa don t be fooled by china s wholesale investments in africa their mission is to gain access to cheap resources and commodities and the price for doing so is quid pro quo investment in infrastructure keeping an eye out kazakhstan and uzbekistan might be frontier markets in which to invest in coming years if reforms do indeed gain traction one key way of playing those markets is indirectly for example fiera invests in a bank in georgia that itself invests in the banking sector in uzbekistan the discussion frontier markets are not only fascinating but if approached properly they can be the source of impressive alpha generation fiera s lead portfolio manager for the firm s flagship magna new frontiers fund dominic bokor ingram took the floor what we look for first in frontier market investing is reform processes he began because in our experience of 30 years in emerging markets economic growth is generated with a one to one correlation when you get reform processes reforms whether they are political economic or stock market reforms create economic growth and the best place to look for companies that can compound their earnings over many years is in countries that are reforming reform opportunity bokor ingram points to asia where he observed that in the past 30 plus years huge reforms have taken place which have led to multi year economic growth opportunities emerging markets as we know he reported are about growth so finding the right companies that can participate in that growth is the key and that is our remit from start of the investment process to the end but he noted that it is not always a one way street to performance and his and his colleagues roles are therefore to assess sustainability of reforms as an example of reform processes going in the opposite direction he cited venezuela watch out for the u turns new democracies and new reforms are not always sustainable and rely on the will of the politicians and the motivation of the people to sustain them venezuela some 15 years ago was the wealthiest country in latin america had a constitution that looks very much like the us constitution but today is one of the biggest economic disasters in global history and this in a country that has the largest oil reserves of any country in the world the frontier market beacons looking around the globe he focused on vietnam as the stand out opportunity we see a very sustainable political reform process a sustainable economic reform process which is producing genuine growth in the economy and genuine growth in companies turning to the 27 countries of eastern europe he noted that romania and poland are producing the fastest growth in the whole of europe and he explained that the fund is heavily invested in a number of middle eastern countries where after many decades of not reforming change is taking place saudi arabia is probably the standout country right now where real reforms are actually happening but we still need to see if those reforms continue with a higher oil price kuwait dubai and some of the other countries in the region such as egypt and morocco are also notable for their reforms but as with venezuela there are the countries that exhibit the opposite characteristics nigeria has huge oil reserves but an economic and political system that is far from conducive to private enterprise or economic growth foreign investors will follow but slowly he noted that as well as rapid growth and reform frontier markets are characterised by minimal focus from outside investors as well as few analysts covering the stocks allowing fiera s bottom up fundamental research and financial modelling to identify major alpha generating opportunities and very big differences in valuation between what the market is thinking and what we might fiera might believe your average frontier market is 5 owned by foreign investors he noted while the average well developed emerging market is more like 50 owned by foreign investors he remarked that one of the biggest problems in these youthful markets is misallocation of capital financial and markets reforms oil the wheels followed by rising foreign ownership and the resultant re rating should then take place we have seen a number of examples in recent history of markets going through exactly this process and then being upgraded to msci emerging market status and doing fantastically well but he also noted that this does not always happen due to the possible reversal of the political or economic reforms we identify some 165 countries in the world that are not developed and not emerging and that have the potential to go through this reform and upgrade cycle but at any point in time we focus on a universe narrowed down to about seven or eight situations steering away from benchmarks a guest asked why the msci frontier market index had not outperformed the equivalent emerging market index in the past three to five years first i would say that the msci is not that representative of the opportunity set he explained msci is an organisation that puts together indices based on what their clients are focussing on and what mainly their etf clients can invest in but if you look at our frontier fund over the last five years on average we have been 80 non benchmark holdings relative to the msci frontier markets benchmark and as a result relative to any emerging market fund we have actually outperformed over that period note that it is also a quirk of msci which at some point they will have to sort out it has become so china dominated that your average active investor is underweight china because they can only invest 20 in any one country and china is 30 of the index financials play a key role another guest noted that the msci frontier market is still dominated as to roughly 50 by financials in frontier markets the banks tend to be very simple in what they do and very simple to analyse bokor ingram commented most of them take deposits from consumers and corporates and invest in government t bills and that is the method by which the governments have been used to financing their budget deficits when an economy opens up the growth has to come from either the government spending more money or foreign direct investment or the banks starting to lend but generally the governments do not have the money at that stage and foreign money has yet to follow through as they want to see a period of stability first accordingly he explained that the banks are the drivers and they are not involved in complex transactions they are simply lending domestically and their margin is the difference between the deposit costs and their lending margins moreover he added within that financials bucket if you look at the msci classification you also have insurance and usually real estate which both tend to be leading indicators of economic activity as well so i would say financials are probably here to stay as a big percentage of any frontier markets benchmark size and liquidity he was asked about the average size of the companies in which the fund invests usd5 billion was the answer as to liquidity bokor ingram noted that the saudi arabia market trades around one billion dollars a day with some companies valued at up to usd30 to usd40 billion saudi is frontier because it is under researched and foreign investment is less than 2 he added and the next lowest is qatar with 14 ownership saudi only allowed foreign ownership quite recently and we expect it to surge to 10 to 20 over the next 18 months in asia he highlighted vietnam with single stocks valued at up to usd5 to usd10 billion and total trading in the market around usd250 million a day currency exposure the long fund does not hedge but in all financial modelling and for target stock prices fiera works on hard currency taking account of expected currency devaluation in the current portfolio it is not such a big issue because the big positions are in the middle east where the currencies are pegged to the dollar and in countries like vietnam and romania which have much more developed currency markets they are therefore less prone to big shocks than some of the markets that have had big shocks recently such as argentina and turkey however as a generalisation he added that normally currency crises are a function of political or economic problems that appear before the currency devalues we tend to have a rule that when we see fx reserves falling significantly it tends to mean that the currency will either have to devalue or there will be capital controls and we get out of that country we believe you will never make money investing in the best stock in a bad market looking at domestic fundamentals our strategy is very much focussed on what is going on domestically and it is domestic growth where you will really make the money in these countries bokor ingram reported in vietnam you have a two tier market at the moment with some big former state owned companies perhaps in the oil or dairy sectors they are liquid and that is where many people put their money but they are they are amongst some of the most expensive stocks in frontier or emerging markets generally however underneath them there are a number of companies in the one to five billion dollar range that are going to effectively benefit from the same sort of growth path of asia and china in the past 25 years selectivity is essential with gdp per capita surging there is a clear path by reference to the more advanced countries of asia that indicates vietnam s retail market will explode with activity the key for us bokor ingram explained is that this is not complicated investing mobile phone shops electronics goods retailers grocery stores jewellery shops these just require the right management and the right corporate governance similarly if you look at our investments in saudi arabia they are not the big oil and gas companies the petrochemical companies they are in education healthcare companies which is where rising middle classes spend their money governance bokor ingram highlighted the importance of corporate governance from all aspects including respect for minority shareholder rights appropriate dividend distributions fairness in related party transactions fair valuation for transactions and so forth we look for companies where we can trust the management to look after our interests in short but we reckon that about 75 of those companies we meet do not reach the standards we expect especially former state companies and private companies run as founder s private wealth vehicles over the past 30 years we have experienced the thousand ways that money can disappear so this is a huge focus for us in any investment that we make low correlation he also pointed to the frontier markets as an asset class that has very low correlation to emerging or developed markets frontier markets tend to be driven much more by what s going on domestically than by what s going on in global markets he explained and correlations between frontier markets also tend to be very low for example the pakistan index over the last year is down about 60 in us dollars but that has zero impact on saudi arabia where you have a very positive reform process you have an msci upgrade cycle and the market in the last year there is up about 20 in us dollars iran contagion not really bokor ingram was asked if iran s troubles are a source of possible contagion of the frontier market story in the middle east two years ago he replied we had 40 of the portfolio in pakistan and argentina but we sold out completely as we saw what was going on in those countries and we actually reinvested in the middle east where we think that what is going on in the ground is massively different from what is perceived by looking at the newspapers the iran situation is absolutely no different than it was in 2005 in 2010 in 2015 he elucidated iran and saudi arabia will always disagree and will always vie for control of the region there has been no actual escalation in the middle east despite what you read in the newspapers the only thing that has happened over the last year or so is that the us has decided to side more with saudi than with iran ironically he added no one in the senior us administration can go there because political ties were cut in 1979 but iran culturally should be the usa s closest ally in the region they are the most entrepreneurial the most culturally free there are even more female university women students in iran than men and you go to companies and more often than not the ceo or the cfo is a woman versus in saudi zero economically iran is self sufficient a massive exporter of manufactured goods in saudi it is close to zero however saudi will sell the us cheap oil and buy their weapons and buy american goods in conclusion to this viewpoint he explained that the magna team does not foresee peace in the middle east in the foreseeable future but in terms of what s actually going on there they have not witnessed a period of greater stability economically in the region in the last 50 years moreover he noted the currencies are all pegged to the us dollar which means that you don t have currency fluctuations debt levels in the countries we re investing in and us dollar debt are lower than any other emerging market region in the world and other countries in the region have seen what s happened in dubai which 30 years ago was 95 dependent on oil and today has zero oil because the oil has run out but the economy is now tourism and financial services and trade active vs passive if you look at the performance of a lot more than 50 of frontier market funds they have also like us outperformed the benchmark as well i think in frontier markets it makes a lot of sense to have active management these are not emerging markets which can be driven by etf money i personally think in frontier markets it is not even a discussion you literally cannot invest via a passive strategy looking at the morningstar performance numbers over the last 5 years 74 of frontier funds have outperformed the benchmark i do not believe you will see this in any other equity asset class africa off the radar we are not yet playing africa bokor ingram reported when quizzed by a guest my top down theory on africa is about why this population growth story is very unlikely to translate into economic growth and equity market returns if you look at a map of africa it s a series of straight lines drawn up by the colonials as they were leaving africa in short i don t think you really have countries based on traditional cultural and tribal demarcations so these are not really countries in the traditional definition africa is very tribal actually most regions in the world are very tribal and the history of africa since independence is that when a tribe gets in power it takes everything from the guys who were in power before long term investment cannot thrive in that environment since independence started in the late 50s no country has grown sustainably for any real period of time bokor ingram noted that the one holding the fund has in africa is in a telecoms company named mtn ghana which is a subsidiary of mtn a south african company there are virtually no fixed lines and very bad banking infrastructure he explained so there is massive potential what about china and africa bokor ingram explained that china s massive investment in africa is simply self serving chinese investment in africa is very different because it is not investment to make money out of the country it is investment to gain access to cheap resources he reported it is as simple as that the investment story goes something like there is a massive iron ore mine we want to mine it so we will build it and in return we will build you some roads or some hospitals or whatever in short chinese investment has nothing to do with development of africa it has everything to do with cheap resources keeping eyes open as to potential countries that might become more interesting to the fiera team bokor ingram highlighted kazakhstan and uzbekistan we have heard a very similar story for much of the last 20 years about attempts by the kazakhstan government to privatise and to develop the non oil economy he commented i am actually a major sceptic but in the past year they have been privatising banks mining and the airline and although far from ideal there are indications that there is movement towards genuine democracy with the recent elections 77 for the long standing president whereas last time it was 99 5 we have invested in the bank which trades on a 1x book value and is generating nearly a nearly 20 return on equity and with great growth potential we should increase our weighting in the country if things move forward well uzbekistan a country of about 30 million people has until the past few years been one of the most inward looking countries of the 27 eastern european countries that were created after the fall of the soviet union ruled by the same leader in that time and with ongoing very strong links to russia but virtually no links anywhere else including virtually no links to other central asian countries in terms of trade he explained but they have now decided on a reform process although access is very tough as there is no fully functioning stock exchange first of all and there is pretty much only one bank however one of our investments which is a georgian bank is just now making an investment in the banking sector in uzbekistan and if all goes well uzbekistan could be very interesting for the moment however there is no way of investing directly only indirectly a world of opportunity by the time the discussion closed guests had been treated to a bird s eye view of the world of frontier market investing from an expert with both the experience and track record to merit the attention the attendees clearly gave throughout the discussion
is the us still the world s leading superpower while the strong global economic growth of the late 19th and early 20th centuries was driven in part by the two first phases of industrialization and the transport revolution in western europe successive wars on the old continent have weakened growth and european countries since then globalization has given a boost to global growth while propelling the united states to global superpower status what is globalization globalization is all about commercial interaction between different parts of the world these flows can be exchanges of goods capital services people or information this was all made possible by the improvement of the means of communication nict the containerization revolution the very low cost of maritime transport the increasing liberalization of trade gatt and then wto in 1995 and the deregulation of financial flows between countries advertisement advertisement since the 1990s globalization has accelerated with the fall of the ussr the rise of the internet the creation of the world trade organization wto 1995 and regional free trade agreements such as nafta all contributing to this acceleration with the first world war the united states quickly became the world s leading economic centre in 1945 the us held ⅔ of the world s gold stock and accounted for 50 of global production the new world economic order was organized by the us imf and ibrd in bretton woods in 1944 gatt in 1947 and their currency the american dollar or usd became the currency of international trade wall street in new york became the economic and financial heart of the world what made the united states a unique superpower the american democratic capitalist and liberal model as well as the american way of life spread to the non communist world with the marshall plan 1947 and the development of multinational companies advertisement advertisement by the end of the 20th century the emergence of mass media and the internet revolution gave americans the opportunity to influence the entire world even more with the development of mass consumption that began in the 1950s many american products arrived on other markets some products are now an integral part of the lives of many europeans asians and south americans such as the visa card sportswear such as nike soft drinks such as coca cola fast food such as mcdonald s as well as american music cinema universities etc story continues this undeniable cultural influence called soft power is a huge source of influence for the us across the world this soft power indirectly influences and positively shapes the view of the usa in the eyes of other countries this power makes adoption of the american point of view much more palatable to other countries all without the need for force or threat in addition to soft power there is also hard power characterized by economic hegemony technological progress information technology nuclear space conquest and first rate military and diplomatic power which make it possible to impose the will and power of the united states on the rest of the world by force or intimidation the us the powerful and criticized nation at the heart of globalization the american system arouses as much wonder as questions criticism in regards to their management of the social crisis and poverty political extremism weak environmental protection measures etc it could be argued that american influence has declined in recent years although the country remains a first rate power that dominates many sectors of activity advertisement advertisement first of all we can see heightened criticism of the american hegemony even if anti americanism is not exactly a new phenomenon several countries russia and china foremost among them and political currents reject the american model while us involvement in foreign wars are subject to the harshest criticism the united states is also experiencing an increasing number of economic competitors such as from the european union and the brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa the subprime crisis in 2007 also eroded the power of the us both immediately following the crisis and in the years since china became the world s leading economic power ahead of the united states in 2014 after 142 years of american rule according to imf figures the increased debt burden and evidence of the united states dependence on foreign capital particularly chinese capital is also a factor that challenges us supremacy how has the election of trump altered the future of globalization the surprise election of donald trump as the 45th american president invites a re evaluation of the future of the global economic order movement of goods money and people across international borders have all certainly changed since trump s election as resistance to globalization was one of his prominent policy themes during his election campaign with particular emphasis on the us china relationship advertisement advertisement china and the united states have an extensive but tense economic partnership often triggering periods of conflict such as the current situation trade tensions have significantly increased since 2018 when trump first sought to limit chinese economic influence with tariffs trump s plan to reduce his country s dependence on china focuses on increasing taxes on their imported products so american products are favored locally and purchased instead of course china reacted by increasing taxes on american imported products these trade tensions and tariffs could cut global output by 0 5 in 2020 according to the imf consequently the organization cut its global growth forecast there are growing concerns over the impact of the current trade tensions the risk is that the most recent us china tariffs could further reduce investment productivity and growth said imf chair christine lagarde trump s wish to implement us protectionist policies will have one important consequence for the country as the usa turns inward on worldwide economic integration this will certainly have an impact on global stocks and flows knock on effects to this policy such as retaliation from countries like china canceled contracts with american companies and suppliers and countries that seek to imitate trump s anti globalization agenda like greece and hungary may also all lead to significant consequences for the global economy what consequences on the global economy can be expected if the trade war escalates as noted by the european central bank in its analysis on implications of rising trade tensions for the global economy the impact of an escalation of trade tensions could be felt in different ways advertisement advertisement in the case of a generalized global increase in tariffs higher import prices could increase firms production costs and reduce households purchasing power particularly if domestic and imported goods cannot be substituted for each other easily this could affect consumption investment and employment moreover an escalation of trade tensions would fuel economic uncertainty leading consumers to delay expenditure and businesses to postpone investment declared the ecb how to take advantage of the changes in our interconnected global economy in response to higher uncertainty financial investors could also reduce their exposure to equities reduce credit supply and require higher compensation for risk added the european organization it s worth mentioning that through close financial linkages heightened uncertainty could spill over more broadly adding to volatility in global financial markets which can create great trading opportunities for investors advertisement advertisement thankfully there are plenty of available instruments that can turn a profit in any market condition you can short an index diversify into a new more promising geography or just bet on volatility the main things to watch for when seeking such exposure is that your broker is regulated and the scope of instruments it can provide it doesn t hurt when a broker has a robust efficient and reliable trading platform such as multibank group times of great uncertainty breed great opportunities investors and traders can make the most of the potential changes in the world order by focusing on the most promising region or business sector bottom line the united states remains one of the world s largest economies it is a major power that excels in many areas with an influence that is exercised both with hard power economic military and diplomatic power and soft power cultural influence advertisement advertisement however the country faces many challenges challenges that threaten to erode its role as a superpower such as the emergence of significant economic competition from other countries and their recent policy shift to economic isolationism highly integrated into globalization the recent decisions of the united states regarding greater protectionism and the hard retreat from globalization wanted by trump affect the world economic order and global trade flows the current global climate is well encapsulated by harvard business review the myth of a borderless world has come crashing down traditional pillars of open markets the united states and the uk are wobbling and china is positioning itself as globalization s staunchest defender this article is brought to you by the courtesy of multibank group advertisement advertisement read our multibank group review this article was originally posted on

second to none and we re collecting 25 percent on 250 billion and china is paying for it as you know because as you notice our inflation hasn t gone up trump further claimed that china has devalued their currency in order to pay for the tariffs and in addition to devaluing they ve also pumped a lot of money into their economic model they ve been pumping money in we haven t we ve been retracting we ve been raising interest rates and they ve been lowering interest rates separately the loosening up of huawei ban triggered some criticism from trump s republican party south carolina republican senator lindsay graham warned there will be a lot of pushback if it is a major concession but national economic council chairman larry kudlow tried to tone it down on fox news sunday he said all that is going to happen is commerce will grant some additional licenses where there is a general availability of the parts the company needs and companies are selling products that are widely available from other countries this not a general amnesty the national security concerns will remain paramount china daily us china remain widely apart even on the conceptual level on the chinese side the

expectation of 39 2 looking ahead rba to cut interest rates nfp and isms to guide fed move rba is generally expected to cut cash rate again by 25bps to 1 00 this week originally some expected the rate cut to happen in august but such expectation was pulled ahead after governor philip lowe said after june s cut that it would be unrealistic to expect that lowering interest rates by ¼ of a percentage point will materially shift the path we look to be on and it is not unrealistic to expect a further reduction in the cash rate as the board seeks to wind back spare capacity in the economy and deliver inflation outcomes in line with the medium term target some might argue that rba could hold fire first and wait until new economic projections before acting but the problem is lowe has already set up expectations with his unusually blunt language failure to deliver this week would shoot up the exchange which should offset some of the effect of prior rate cut thus even though it s far from certain rba is much more likely to cut this week than not the string of economic data from the us this are more important than ever now that the threat of further trade war escalations is delayed economic data will be crucial to for fed to decide on whether to cut interest rate immediately in july or not let s recall chair jerome powell just emphasized last week we are also mindful that monetary policy should not overreact to any individual data point or short term swing in sentiment doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook it seems like fed doesn t really something stellar in this week s nfp and isms for it to hold its hand rather having the readings back to normal would be enough for standing pat for now in addition japan tankan uk pmis china pmis australia trade balance

you don t have to be an avid consumer of news about the federal government to know that uncle sam s annual budgeting process is a mess the budget is rarely completed on time and it always seems to get bogged down with partisan bickering and political scheming the process is often interrupted or transformed into an emergency by fiscal cliffs and government shutdowns and it faces numerous chronic problems as well from dead on arrival white house budget plans to perpetually ignored statutory deadlines when the dust finally settles the result is usually a bloated agglomeration of goodies for special interests that most likely had a better grasp of the budget s contents than the elected representatives who voted on it probably without ever reading it of course almost every budget is bigger than its predecessor if the budgeting process is broken it s apparently been broken for a long time since the enactment of the budget control act of 1974 which dictates the current rules and was meant to make congress more accountable legislators have passed all 12 of the required discretionary spending appropriations bills on time on just four occasions instead of an orderly process we tend to end up with omnibus spending legislation that wraps everything into one giant spending bill or short term continuing resolutions that punt on hard choices various fixes have been proposed to right the budget process one recurring idea is that we should replace an annual budget with a biennial budget covering two fiscal years supporters argue that a longer budget period would give legislators more time to conduct oversight of federal programs and thus more time to weigh competing spending desires with more time spending would supposedly be better targeted toward those programs that work while those that don t work would either be fixed or see their funding cut thanks to better oversight this is wishful thinking in the 19 states that currently have such a process in place the opposite is true biennial budget states actually spend more money while oversight remains flat and congressional oversight is overrated oversight hearings are often just political dog and pony shows of little or no consequence in many cases the whole point is for politicians to make statements that can then be used during political campaigns these events are designed to benefit lawmakers not the public the same can be said about budget process reform argues stan collender a budget expert who teaches at the mccourt school of public policy at georgetown university his take is that the process actually works exactly as legislators want it to work indeed for all the complaints that the budget process receives from those in charge it enables politicians to do what they want to do cater to interest groups while avoiding what they don t want to do live within their means the growth of mandatory spending exacerbates the problem outlays on social security medicare and medicaid as well as interest payments on the debt aren t appropriated each year in the manner of discretionary programs covering education transportation and the like as a result those programs can t be used to distribute favors though promising not to reduce spending on them often indirectly serves that function as the number of people benefiting from the entitlement system grows and the eligibility rules are relaxed a bigger and bigger share of spending has to be directed toward it today 70 percent of the budget is spent on such programs compared to 40 percent in 1970 politicians therefore have less money to fling around on new spending meant to curry voter favor it s true that some members of both houses talk about reforming the budget process to make it more rigorous and fiscally responsible they have even formed house and senate budget committees and held hearings on the issue however collender believes that this activity is less designed to retool the budget process than it is to placate all those who are so fervently saying that it needs to be reformed the interest groups think tanks and associations that make up the inside the beltway federal budgeting community this situation is tragic this chaos and the resulting failure to follow budget rules has led to an unremitting expansion of the size and scope of government this u s debt meanwhile has more than doubled in the last 10 years recently reaching 22 trillion if it continues as projected washington will find itself in a tough spot vulnerable to the risk of interest rate hikes an inability to increase spending on short notice to respond to emergencies and slower growth overall interest in how to design a better budget process one that actually limits the growth of government isn t new f a hayek wrote in 1948 that adam smith s chief concern was not so much with what man might occasionally achieve when he was at his best but that he should have as little opportunity as possible to do harm when he was at his worst the goal must therefore be a social system which does not depend for its functioning on our finding good men for running it or on all men becoming better than they are now but which makes use of men in all their given variety and complexity sometimes good and sometimes bad sometimes intelligent and more often stupid it was the 1986 nobel laureate james buchanan who really pioneered the notion that good fiscal rules are key to controlling government spending and restraining government borrowing his extensive body of work shows that at least in theory these rules can enforce budgetary restraints by tying politicians hands as the structural roots of budget deficits have become more widely understood a growing number of countries have adopted fiscal rules to reshape democratic governance the columbia university macroeconomist pierre yared found that in 1990 only seven countries had such restrictions in place but by 2015 92 countries did governments across the world have been mandating deficit spending and revenue limits to constrain fiscal policy and curtail further increases in government debt these fiscal rules are broadly effective comprehensive data covering many years show that countries with such rules have annual budget deficits that are smaller by an average of 0 5 percent of gross domestic product gdp when compared to countries without such rules but not all rules are created equal when it comes to limiting government profligacy and slowing the growth of debt yared and yale economist marina halac recently found that rules based on outcomes e g setting a rule preferably through a constitution that limits spending growth to a certain percentage of gdp tend to work better than rules based on short term and arbitrary restraints such as the sequestration requirement included in the debt ceiling deal of 2011 which lawmakers can lift easily more specifically expenditure based rules and debt caps have higher rates of compliance in advanced economies than do balanced budget rules around 70 percent vs 35 55 percent compliance which is fundamental to the success of fiscal restraint efforts is even greater if the rules are legally enshrined or constitutionally binding hong kong while there are many troubling aspects of governance in hong kong it might actually represent the gold standard of good fiscal policy our commitment to small government demands strong fiscal discipline the territory s financial secretary john tsang explained in a 2014 speech at the heritage foundation it is my responsibility to keep expenditure growth commensurate with growth in our gdp that may sound like something a politician would say during a speech but in hong kong it s actually a constitutional requirement article 107 requires that the government strive to achieve a fiscal balance avoid deficit and more important make sure government spending doesn t grow faster than the economy when their constitutions demand fiscal restraint politicians go out of their way to anticipate the problems they might encounter in the future tsang noted for example that he had created a working group on long term fiscal planning and directed it to conduct a fiscal sustainability health check we are keenly aware of hong kong s low fertility rate and aging population he explained not unlike many advanced economies and that can pose challenges to public finance in the longer term hong kong s public spending hasn t risen above 13 5 percent of gdp in several decades compared to 38 percent in the united states its debt is close to zero social welfare spending remains steady around 3 percent of gdp vs 18 7 percent in the u s and the share of the population relying on social security assistance has gone down from 8 percent in 2005 to 5 4 percent in 2014 switzerland the swiss are known for their fine watches and chocolate they should be recognized also for the comparative excellence of their fiscal rules after public referenda in 2001 the swiss government in 2003 implemented a new constitutional requirement aimed at ensuring a balanced annual budget through a cyclically adjusted expenditure ceiling the short story is that swiss politicians are not allowed to increase spending faster than average revenues rise over a multiyear period as calculated by the swiss federal department of finance that basically confines spending growth to a rate no higher than the rate of inflation plus population growth significantly the swiss debt brake rule appeals to economists and policy makers on both sides of the aisle the fiscally conservative types like it because it is effectively a spending cap it also makes it impossible to raise spending during good times since the rate ceiling is taken from an average over several years so the treasury s coffers during such periods become flush with cash key to this design is the fact that it is more difficult than it might seem for politicians to increase the spending cap by raising taxes as economist dan mitchell of the center for freedom and prosperity explained in the wall street journal maximum rates for most national taxes in switzerland are constitutionally set such as by an 11 5 income tax an 8 value added tax and an 8 5 corporate tax the rates can only be changed by a double majority referendum which means a majority of voters in a majority of cantons would have to agree yet the debt brake also appeals to economists and policy makers who favor deficit spending when revenues plummet during economic downturns because the rule allows for spending in excess of estimated revenues under special circumstances this escape clause which applies to recessionary periods effectively deals with unforeseen emergencies without putting the rule at risk in the medium to long term there s no arguing with the results annual spending growth fell from an average of 4 3 percent before the rule was implemented to 2 5 percent after and in 10 out of the past 14 years switzerland has had budget surpluses deficits have remained rare and small averaging 0 85 percent of gdp during this period at the same time swiss debt has fallen from almost 60 percent of gdp in 2003 to around 42 percent in 2017 switzerland now finds itself in an unusual place with policy makers frequently debating what to do with all of their surplus revenue a situation that seems a million miles away from the fiscal conditions in the united states in 2010 germany adopted a policy similar to the swiss debt brake the rules are parallel to each other in that each follows the small government keynesianism model that allows the government to spend in a recession but cuts expenditures in good times creating surpluses for when the country needs them while the german rule isn t as strict as the swiss one it has successfully reduced germany s public debt from 80 percent of gdp in 2010 to 64 percent of gdp in 2017 denmark vermont sen bernie sanders loves to tout denmark as his model of a socialist paradise the country is certainly no libertarian ideal yet since the 1970s it has undertaken impressive reforms to address the serious fiscal issues brought on by the danes very generous welfare programs among other reforms denmark has lowered its top income tax rate from 73 percent to 63 percent lowered the corporate tax rate from 50 percent to 22 percent abolished the wealth tax reduced the length of government supplied unemployment benefits from indefinite to two years and raised the retirement age denmark also implemented some interesting process oriented reforms to more systematically control spending in 2014 it passed a budget act aimed at ensuring a balance or surplus on the general government balance sheet as well as appropriate expenditure management at all levels of government the rule sets a limit of 0 5 percent of gdp on the structural or persistent budget deficit policy makers decided that managing spending under the condition of maintaining a balanced budget over time would lead to a stronger fiscal position in the long run they also designed the system to take discretion out of their own hands by subjecting themselves to independent monitoring by the danish economic council which can impose automatic correction mechanisms in the event of a budget deviation such an action forces the ministry of finance to present an adjustment plan for the following year in addition to its structural deficit rules the budget law introduced four year rolling expenditure ceilings these ceilings set legally binding limits for spending at all levels of government and by program if one program spends under its cap the remaining money cannot be reallocated to another program the danish economic council assesses annually whether government policy is adhering to the target structural public balance and whether the proposed expenditure ceilings are consistent with medium term projections in the structural balance for public finances according to data from the organization for economic co operation and development oecd denmark s fiscal position improved significantly in the three years after implementation of its budget act general government debt fell from 59 14 percent to 49 96 percent of gdp in that time while central government debt fell from 38 22 percent to 29 88 percent of gdp according to the international monetary fund imf and in 2017 the country ran a budget surplus equal to 1 09 percent of gdp the netherlands for such a small country the netherlands has a lot going for it amsterdam pot tulips bike paths as it turns out the imf the oecd and the european commission have also regularly highlighted the dutch fiscal framework as an example of good practices that achieve a high degree of budgetary transparency the framework has several commendable features such as its medium term rather than short term orientation and use of independent macroeconomic forecasts under the sustainable public finance law passed in 2014 expenditure ceilings are set for three main budgetary areas central government social security and health care and benchmarks are set for revenues while the revenues can fluctuate over the multiyear cycle the expenditure ceilings must be respected as statutory requirements the netherlands deficit ballooned beyond 3 percent of gdp from 2009 to 2013 but the country has seen noticeably improved fiscal conditions since 2014 especially compared to countries with other fiscal frameworks in 2017 the government ran a budget surplus of 1 22 percent compared to a deficit of 2 15 percent in 2014 and according to the oecd general government debt fell during those three years from 82 60 percent to 69 95 percent of gdp why most rules fail governments across the spectrum from free market hong kong to bernie sanders beloved denmark have implemented prudent budget rules and policies the ones that are most effective share some common features they all impose a limit on the growth of spending as opposed to the balanced budget constitutional requirement favored by some economists and they all set automatic triggers to reduce politicians discretion at this point you may be wondering if they can do it why can t we that s the 22 trillion and counting question so what is it that convinced politicians in these other countries not simply to adopt fiscal rules but to adopt fiscal rules that truly constrain them i wish i knew financial crises staggeringly large debts slow economic growth and angry voters probably all nudge politicians to adopt a fiscal rule but the data show that even when politicians do take steps to address fiscal problems more often than not they choose policies that don t work adopting the right rule the kind that actually shrinks the growth of government is what matters the same is true at the level of u s states as my colleague matthew mitchell s work on tax and expenditure limits tels demonstrates the design of the rule is what explains whether these tels will control spending or not the ones that are effective all tend to be constitutionally codified to focus on spending rather than revenue and to include provisions that require majority support to override some tels work pretty well but these are exceptions rather than the norm in other words state officials and legislators often avoid designing rules that would actually tie their hands the literature on fiscal adjustments the combination of expenditure and taxation increases and decreases shows the same result economists have demonstrated that the way to reduce the government s debt to gdp ratio is to adopt fiscal adjustment packages mostly made of spending cuts preferably to entitlement programs but in 80 percent of the cases where fiscal adjustment packages were put in place politicians opted to rely more on tax hikes than on reductions in outlays the american enterprise institute s benjamin zycher looked at the failure of tels to deliver on their promise to constrain spending he concluded that the limits themselves are the products of the same political pressures and election dynamics that yield fiscal outcomes they are supposed to battle moreover he wrote the competition among political interests that results in budget outcomes also is likely to weaken or circumvent limits that otherwise would be effective basically the same forces that result in the government growing debt piling up interest groups getting what they lobby for at the expense of everyone else and budget process drama are at play during the making of government fiscal rules no wonder the constraints more often than not fail to accomplish what they re meant to yet some places do manage to overcome these forces we can look to them for inspiration
energy trade between producers in the united states and consumers in mexico has long been a productive relationship benefitting households and businesses on both sides of the border natural gas has become increasingly important for the mexican economy as a necessary fuel source particularly for electric power and industrial development u s companies began exporting natural gas to mexico via pipeline in 1988 and exports have increased significantly as the shale revolution in the u s produced affordable abundant natural gas for consumers in the u s mexico and around the world ref liquefied natural gas lng which is transported by ship supplements the pipeline trade in natural gas ref additional mexican pipelines and lng infrastructure will increase export opportunities for u s energy producers in the south and southwest ref concerns over the future of u s mexico energy trade are developing however newly elected mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador has been very critical of free market energy reforms in mexico and wants to return to more state control ref president lópez obrador is threatening to change pipeline contracts with the mexican government and private american and canadian companies creating uncertainty in current and future investments ref the u s and mexico should build on past policies that have enabled energy trade by expanding interconnectivity honoring contracts and respecting the rule of law and streamlining permitting processes for natural gas infrastructure americans and mexicans will gain significant economic and security benefits as a result america s abundance of natural gas due to the shale revolution the united states has been the world s largest natural gas producer since 2009 ref technological advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made america s abundance of natural resources available for extraction and delivery domestic energy continues to be an enormous boon to the american economy creating hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and millions of jobs in supporting industries ref increased supplies have lowered energy bills for households across america abundant low cost power is also beneficial for energy using businesses especially america s energy intensive manufacturing base both dry gas without liquids and wet gas mainly associated with oil extraction and liquids coming from the permian basin in west texas and southeastern new mexico are important sources of energy for mexico ref the eagle ford basin in texas is the primary source of cross border pipeline gas export to mexico thus far other sources of supply include the san juan basin located in northwest new mexico as well as natural gas resources spanning colorado and wyoming the success of energy production in the united states is largely a function of market risk and development by private companies market competition is spurring investments in new energy projects and the necessary infrastructure to transport it free markets a strong rule of law and private ownership of resources are the foundation for the energy renaissance in the u s however policy problems exist in the u s primarily with the government subsidizing the production and consumption of energy in addition to all energy technologies having onerously long permitting processes for projects where government intervention is less invasive energy markets thrive expanded opportunities in mexico for u s suppliers natural gas trade between american producers and mexican consumers has increased substantially over the past decade u s exports continue to break records as mexico imported nearly 6 billion cubic feet of natural per day from u s suppliers last summer ref one billion cubic feet of natural gas is enough to power 10 000 american homes for a year ref most of mexico s energy imports travel through cross border pipelines critical to the growth in trade was the expansion of pipeline capacity both in the u s and across the border total cross border pipeline capacity nearly tripled since 2011 from about 4 billion cubic feet per day to about 11 billion cubic feet per day ref the expansion has not only increased the flow of energy but also expanded natural gas to different regions throughout mexico ref additionally mexico is accessing the u s s expanded lng capacities in the u s gulf of mexico ref while piped gas from the u s is displacing lng imports from other countries mexico is increasing lng imports from american facilities in the gulf coast ref expanded natural gas trade is a win for both countries u s producers have more opportunities resulting in market development investment job creation and economic growth mexican consumers are receiving a stable secure source of energy overall electricity demand has grown as the country s economy has grown since 2005 ref furthermore mexico s industrial sector has grown 47 percent over the same period increasing demand for natural gas particularly in the heavy metals and chemicals industries ref most of mexico s northern industrial region including border facilities depends on imports of natural gas for electric power demonstrating how important u s producers are for mexico s economic development overcoming infrastructure constraints in the u s and mexico despite the growth in natural gas exports from the u s to mexico infrastructure bottlenecks in both countries constrain u s producers and mexican consumers from maximizing energy trade permian crude oil and associated gas require additional pipeline capacity expansion to move it to markets transportation constraints block development of the full resource potential in the number of shale regions throughout the southwestern and western parts of the country this is a widely known takeaway capacity bottleneck takeaway capacity is the total capacity at which oil and natural gas move from a basin through pipelines the pipeline bottleneck discounts the price of oil and natural gas in the region because the surplus supply that accumulates in the area forces producers to sell the product at a discount ref without the additional pipeline capacity companies are also flaring gas controlled burning under rules of texas and new mexico regulatory authorities the area of west texas is now undergoing a substantial build out to bring more infrastructure capacity online this year and over the next few years ref developers are planning a five pipeline wall of capacity that will likely provide more than enough oil and natural gas capacity ref additional oil and natural gas resource production in the greater permian basin should meet excess capacity one project will transport two billion cubic feet per day in development that would serve as a texas intrastate expansion to the gulf coast ref projects in development are expanding market supply for increased international consumption of lng including by mexico within mexico pipeline construction delays are inhibiting the ability to take advantage of the cross border excess capacity some pipelines have become operational or are near operational bad weather and construction delays pushed back the use of the valley crossing pipeline however the federal energy regulatory commission ferc recently gave permission to put the pipeline into service ref the pipeline will have a capacity of 2 6 billion cubic feet per day and will be the largest natural gas pipeline that flows from the u s to mexico oil and gas companies have several incomplete pipeline projects in mexico for other unforeseen complications as well canadian based transcanada stopped work on two natural gas pipelines in mexico citing social and legal concerns ref transcanada argued that several mexican municipalities made it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits and that social groups have made irrational requests that border on extortion ref these groups include municipal groups demanding higher prices for permits and community groups in locales where the company had properly consulted with the community as required by law where the groups are nevertheless unsatisfied with the agreement corruption and weak rule of law in mexico threatens current and future energy infrastructure investments and constrains economic opportunity ref contrasting pipeline regulations in the u s and mexico with respect to u s natural gas pipelines projects begin in development stages by privately held companies a company will begin with an assessment of the market need and typically enter into a pre filing stage to engage with various government agencies and local communities the lead federal regulatory body is ferc ferc coordinates action with the environmental protection agency the department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa bureaus in the department of the interior and the army corps of engineers as well as state and local governments ref in addition to conducting an environmental and safety assessment conducted by the phmsa ferc also validates proposed projects based on demonstrated market need evidenced by long term contract commitments and considers the potential of overdeveloping capacity under section 7 of the natural gas act ferc regulates the construction and operation of interstate pipeline projections ensuring that the projects comply with department of transportation safety standards ref the state department participates with a presidential permit process in each case of a cross border pipeline between the u s and either mexico or canada after submitting requests for comment from different agencies the secretary of state makes a decision to approve or deny the project based on the national interest of the u s ref in order to increase or expand this permitted volume or if a significant modification is made a company must receive an amended presidential permit ref in contrast to the u s regulatory decisions focused on market needs the mexican government largely controls the economic and regulatory decisions for energy projects through central planning despite the liberalization of mexico s energy markets there are still large elements of government control that differ from the u s market system based on private capital risk taking mexico s ministry of energy sener ultimately controls the planning of infrastructure and the pipeline grid for electric power in connection to natural gas fired electricity under the energy reform legislation of 2014 cenagas mexico s state run natural gas operator was involved in a five year strategic planning process from 2013 to 2018 ref before the election of lópez obrador in late 2018 the annual review of the five year plan included incremental steps toward competitive natural gas markets the goal of cenegas was to continue to diversify and open markets cenagas conducted its first initial open season on its pipeline system with contracts similar to the u s open season commitments covering 97 percent of capacity and over 50 shippers ref nonetheless cenagas remains an agency of the mexican government and the multi sector five year plan was not determined by free market supply and demand competition but by state management under continued free and open markets mexico s pipelines would be open access and regulated much like they are in the united states market reforms authorized the private sector to build own and operate mexico s natural gas pipelines limiting mexican government investment to existing infrastructure maintenance and modernization however with the election of president lópez obrador oil and gas policy in mexico has changed from incremental market reform to resource nationalism post election concerns the lópez obrador government s move to consolidate control over the country s energy markets is jeopardizing present and future natural gas trade opportunities president lópez obrador s opposition to current negotiated contracts too much dependence on natural gas imports and his preference for resource nationalism all have implications for the future of energy trade between the u s and mexico with current natural gas contracts most of the capacity is under a take or pay provision at a fixed or predetermined rate over a 25 year period under take or pay private pipeline operators charged the federal electricity commission cfe for natural gas volumes whether mexico takes the gas or not since mexico pipeline capacity is not yet in place to take the gas the mexican government must pay either way private pipeline companies have force majeure clauses which relieve a company from fulfilling its contractual obligation because of circumstances beyond their control in this instance a company s force majeure clause stipulates that the cfe must pay pipeline developers even though the pipelines are not yet in operation because of protests legal challenges and attempts at extortion ref companies such as transcanada have stated their desire to work with the cfe and the rest of the mexican government to resolve the delays in construction ref american pipeline companies support fixed capacity take or pay systems as a requirement for financial lenders and investors to approve large pipelines for higher volumes however president lópez obrador opposes the existing natural gas pipeline build out contracts between the cfe and american pipeline companies ref mexico is investigating the contractual process for uncovering any potential illegal activity by mexican negotiators president lópez obrador said that the cfe will renegotiate its fixed capacity take or pay contracts ref mexico s energy regulatory commission cre is denying accusations of any wrongdoing ref another risk to natural gas trade between u s producers and mexico s consumers is the potential of increased import substitution policy from the new mexican government import substitution proposes that mexico reduce or replace imports with its own domestic natural gas production imports of natural gas from the u s make up nearly 60 percent of mexico s total consumption ref under current supply and demand estimates the percentage of natural gas imports could reach 70 percent ref how much more dependence will be politically acceptable for the mexican government the expected revision of the 2013 2018 plan will reflect the objectives of lópez obrador the reality of increasing amounts of natural gas flowing from the u s will stimulate an important substitution policy debate by mexico s new government about how to increase supplies domestically with lópez obrador s desire to return to elements of resource nationalism one way to accomplish higher domestic production would be through increased production by state owned companies and increased central planning in fact cfenergia the fuel marketing affiliate of cfe recently stated that it will prioritize natural gas supplies for pemex and other state owned entities to lower energy costs and increase output ref even so there will be challenges for mexico s government and pemex the state owned petroleum company if they choose to substitute u s imports with domestic production mexico s natural gas production decline is expected to rebound only slightly until 2025 and then rapidly with technology advances ref new production would require a six year build out and necessitate the hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in large parts of mexico domestic production will need social and political consensus to move forward energy trade in the united states mexico canada agreement usmca and the trump administration s tariff announcements an important component to the flow of u s produced natural gas to mexico is the new north american free trade agreement nafta productively the usmca maintains the nafta provision that there will be no tariffs on raw and refined oil and gas products maintaining no tariffs will keep important energy trade relationships intact and benefit north american energy consumers u s oil and gas companies and power providers will keep their eligibility to use investor state dispute settlement isds for energy investments in mexico isds is an international arbitration process that protects investors for instance if a foreign government seizes an energy company s property locking in the legal framework of isds protection and keeping mexican hydrocarbons open to foreign investment will strengthen american companies commitment to remaining in mexico in another provision specific to mexico the usmca asserts that the mexican government has direct inalienable and imprescriptible ownership of all hydrocarbons in the subsoil of the national territory including the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone located outside the territorial sea and adjacent thereto in strata or deposits regardless of their physical conditions pursuant to mexico s constitution ref though the provision is not surprising mexico s stated federal ownership of its natural resources is a missed opportunity to capitalize on a critical feature of the american energy renaissance private property rights the united states is the world s largest oil and gas producer not solely because of its abundant reserves much of the growth in production is occurring on private and state owned lands where permitting time frames are sensible therefore encouraging private investment however mexico s market reform did open energy exploration and operation to foreign companies and the new trade agreement includes a commitment that mexico retain at least its current level of openness more recently the trump administration announced a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from mexico until later backing off after reaching an agreement with the mexican government the tariffs would have been implemented as a response to illegal immigration from mexico increasing 5 percent each month until they reached 25 percent in october the mexican government agreed to increase security at its own southern border causing president trump to withdraw the scheduled tariffs however the president also warned that future tariffs could still be an option ref tariffs will not only harm american consumers but they will also harm president trump s energy dominance agenda the decision could jeopardize current and future energy projects and the advancement of the usmca furthermore u s refiners will incur higher prices when importing mexican crude oil the result will be higher energy prices for both american and mexican families and businesses even the threat of future tariffs creates uncertainty and uneasy relationships among stable trading relationships recommendations for mexico and the united states energy investments for production sale and consumption should be market based not held hostage to procedural red tape subjective determinations or political biases both governments should recognize the importance of u s mexico natural gas trade as a strategic benefit to avoid the high economic costs and dysfunction that results from resource nationalism and state control mexico s should welcome the economic and geopolitical benefits of natural gas deliveries from the united states to improve natural gas trade between u s energy companies and consumers and mexico a number of reforms and commitments should take place to reduce barriers and improve market conditions specifically mexico should commit to its market reforms and deregulated energy markets sener should permit projects based on market need rather than centrally planning mexico s energy markets doing so would likely encourage economically efficient fuel switching for instance mexico still uses oil for electricity production where it would likely be more economically and environmentally beneficial to switch to natural gas sener should permit projects based on market need rather than centrally planning mexico s energy markets doing so would likely encourage economically efficient fuel switching for instance mexico still uses oil for electricity production where it would likely be more economically and environmentally beneficial to switch to natural gas honor contracts with privately owned pipeline companies and resolve state and local issues that are causing unnecessary construction delays honoring the contracts will be critical to ensuring legal and financial certainty for current and future investment in mexico u s exporters and pipeline infrastructure managers require improved transparency for competitive financial market efficiency honoring the contracts will be critical to ensuring legal and financial certainty for current and future investment in mexico u s exporters and pipeline infrastructure managers require improved transparency for competitive financial market efficiency examine the gulf coast over concentration of natural gas supply tumultuous weather in the gulf coast can threaten natural gas exports to mexico one way to reduce that risk is through diversification mexico has recognized that natural gas imports from texas new mexico and the rocky mountain energy corridor have both economic and strategic advantages the mexican government should continue to recognize the benefits of supply diversification the united states should ensure the timely environmental review and permitting process for pipeline projects congress should repeal or reform major environmental statutes such as the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act and ensure that activists do not tie up projects for years of costly and unnecessary litigation

monrovia leaders of the member states of the economic community of west african states ecowas convening for the 55th summit of the regional body in abuja nigeria have taken the bold step of formally agreeing to name a planned common currency the eco which will become the new currency of west african states this comes as the liberia dollar continues its freefall now 200 to 1 united states dollars as africa s oldest republic creeps to its 171st independence anniversary all 16 nation bloc comprising benin burkina faso cape verde gambia ghana guinea guinea bissau ivory coast liberia mali niger nigeria senegal sierra leone and togo represent a total population of around 385 million at least eight of those ecowas countries benin burkina faso guinea bissau ivory coast mali niger senegal and togo currently use the cfa franc while the rest including liberia use their individual currencies the plan 30 years in the making has been flirted with by regional leaders with limited results while member states had penciled in 2020 as the year to unveil the plan economists say the date appears unlikely and even though supporters of the plan say the move would boost cross border trade in west africa early reservations from nigeria could muddy the waters it is difficult to see nigeria agree to being in a monetary union if it is not the boss said economist ndongo samba sylla from the rosa luxemburg foundation in dakar quoted by france24 sylla argues that the currency would be launched into a void the report notes that nigeria whose oil dependent economy accounts for two thirds of the region s gdp would likely dominate a future monetary zone and has so far been skeptical about its benefits abdourahmane sarr former senior economist at the international monetary fund imf told france24 that african leaders must face up to a number of choices including officially postponing the 2020 launch date the regional body in a statement saturday made considerable progress on the single currency and has adopted eco as the currency s name the adoption of the currency is aimed at creating a flexible currency regime after making considerable progress on plans for a single currency but the bloc would first need to set up a monetary union as it strives for regional integration regional integration has been a subject for discussion for the bloc over the past decade which has encountered hurdles including questions around the currency of trade and the strengthening of individual economies within the region several west african economies rely on commodities whose prices are regulated on international markets nigeria faced a recession in 2016 after the price of oil plunged two years earlier it has since recovered but growth is still fragile for liberia currently in a financial decline with interventions from the international monetary fund preparing to embrace the eco could come with some complications in addition to the steady climb of the local currency s exchange rate to the us dollar the country according to the imf remains a fragile post conflict country with weak capacity and limited physical and human capital accumulation external assistance to liberia is winding down from its peak in 2016 to address pressing needs the government launched its pro poor agenda for prosperity and development papd focusing on physical and human capital accumulation policy uncertainty and slippages however imposed a significant toll on the economy over the past two years particularly higher fiscal deficits and accommodative monetary policy have led to rapid depreciation of the liberia dollar and increased inflation eroding the purchasing power of the poor the body reported in its recent article iv consultation conclusion the imf reported that country s near and medium term outlook under the baseline scenario is challenging growth is projected to slow further to about 0 4 percent in 2019 and remain below 2 percent into the medium term in the baseline scenario the authorities face the possibility of a forced abrupt adjustment when domestic and external financing options are exhausted an alternative reform scenario is therefore presented as a more viable alternative in which growth weakens somewhat in the near term due to proactive fiscal and monetary tightening but picks up significantly over the medium term to exceed 5 percent by 2024 in addition to the nigeria concerns some also question the implications of a regional currency in a region prune to black money scams and counterfeiting schemes this is why some economists are arguing against the currency plan is a bit unrealistic because at least seven of those countries including liberia have their own currencies and none of them are freely convertible others say ecowas could take a lesson form the multi year eurozone debt crisis as a case in point that single currencies if not implemented the right way could be detrimental to countries economies for the foreseeable future economist say liberia lime most countries in the region faces a daunting challenge putting their various economies in order for the imminent arrival of the eco
la paz bolivia ap abraham rodríguez s small shoe store grew into a factory that employed more than a dozen workers during an economic boom in bolivia when prices for the gas and minerals it produces soared today he can only employ one worker he says the tax free import of goods and the black market have affected his sales and have caused him to go into debt my life was better 10 years ago there were sales and the shoe store grew rodríguez said in his workshop located in la paz today the market has reduced my employees left because i couldn t afford to pay their salary surrounded by nations reeling from economic crises bolivia remains a rare example of economic stability and growth and in more than 12 years under president evo morales poverty has dropped steadily in south america s poorest country helped by soaring natural gas production but experts say his economic model is facing mounting challenges including rising debt shrinking reserves and devaluing currencies in its main trade partners and some bolivians are starting to feel the consequences despite the storm clouds morales says he must be returned to power in oct 20 elections as any change would bring chaos bolivia s first indigenous president is one of the few remaining leaders of the wave of leftists who swept into office in south america in past decades about 45 000 artisan workshops in bolivia closed in recent years according to the confederation of micro and small enterprises which estimates an annual loss of more than 2 billion a year in its sector or about 5 percent of the gross domestic product advertising thousands of artisans and other workers swapped their jobs and turned to commerce because the sale of imported electronics and other goods from china became more profitable this meant the number of people who joined the informal sector has swelled to about 50 one of the region s highest rates big industries are also complaining about a slump in the first months of the year with the agroindustry taking the biggest hit and there are less earnings from gas exports and a reduction of the market said hugo siles an economist of the national industry chamber bolivia exports most of its gas to argentina and brazil but its neighbors are facing challenges argentines are frustrated by a recession a sharp depreciation of their currency and spiraling inflation brazilian president jair bolsonaro had a big election victory last year but is struggling to advance his agenda and is also coping with a tumbling currency argentina and brazil have had strong devaluations and that made them more competitive in their exports siles said bolivia has had a fixed and stable exchange rate against the dollar for eight years which means industries that have a high component of domestic input are affected by imports and contraband the fiscal deficit has been rising for six years since the boom in commodity prices ended and it closed at 7 of gdp last year this as well low private investment a sharp decline in currency reserves the increase in public debt with still low international prices and an economy dependent on commodities are causing tensions in bolivia s economic policy said juan pablo bohoslavsky the u n independent expert on foreign debt and human rights the fixed exchange rate to control inflation leads to an increase in import prices and a growing deficit in the balance of payments he said advertising bolivia s external debt rose in march to 10 billion or about 25 of the country s gdp but central bank president pablo ramos discarded the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency the purchasing power depends on the level of prices we have low inflation about 0 6 in 2019 ramos told the associated press this price stability guarantees purchasing power and we must maintain it a few months ago morales said the economy was shielded but his economy minister luis arce recently acknowledged that brazil s crisis will affect bolivia brazil remains bolivia s top market for energy but exports to the region s largest country have plunged due to lower demand and declining fields official reports say that exports fell from a peak of 31 million cubic meters a day of natural gas in 2014 to 23 8 million cubic meters a day in 2017 still the bolivian government remains optimistic and is betting on continuity since morales took office in 2006 the economy has grown by an annual average of about 4 5 well above the regional average and the international monetary fund says it will grow at 4 percent this year experts however warn that growth is largely dependent on savings and external credits from china while the 15 1 billion in international reserves reached in 2014 plunged to 8 billion last march advertising morales is credited for his pragmatic economic stewardship that spread bolivia s natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses but he has lost support following allegations of manipulating the justice system corruption scandals and his insistence in running for a fourth term in office bolivia s long governing president warns that if he is not re elected in october bolivia could break with its recent run of stability and return to a past of economic turmoil influenced by the policies of international organizations before the world bank and the international monetary fund decided the economic destiny of bolivia morales recently

weekly outlook going to japan to talk about china tankan nfp rba also daily comment for 28 june it s been a confusing week in the financial markets the currency markets seem to be reflecting a risk on mood with the commodity currencies coming out on top and the risk averse japanese yen weakening although the safe haven swiss franc was higher nzd was the best performing currency of the week even though the reserve bank of new zealand turned even more dovish and virtually promised to cut rates gold is up but silver is down it s hard to find a one size fits all theme to explain all of this a lot of the market s movement this week had to do with rumors and leaks concerning this weekend s g20 meeting in japan normally these meetings are the very definition of anodyne while the communique that comes out afterwards is the very definition of bromide it s hard enough to get two world leaders to agree on anything but 20 talk about a lowest common denominator settlement we re talking here about the lowest common denominator for 20 prime numbers the communique is usually something like in the movie animal house where the college motto was knowledge is good if i remember correctly rarely does it move markets however trump has upset the comfortable pattern by rejecting what used to be considered acceptable boilerplate by everyone this time the focus is going to be on his bilateral meetings particularly his meeting with chinese president xi it s expected to take place on saturday at 1130 local time 0230 gmt and scheduled to run for 90 minutes there s some optimism that the meeting may result in a temporary truce in the trade war between the two countries a truce but not a settlement the washington post reported that peter navarro a senior advisor to trump and the top china critic is also going to attend the g20 meeting he was a last minute addition to the team which includes us trade representative lighthizer treasury secretary mnuchin and commerce secretary ross the addition of navarro a staunch critic of china reduces the likelihood of reaching an agreement although that was never that likely anyway both sides have been trying to play down expectations of what s likely to be achieved but even a truce holding tariffs where they are and not escalating further would probably improve sentiment for the dollar and for the risk on currencies buying aud jpy or nzd jpy would be the way to play that one what s the market s view compared to the same time ahead of last year s g20 summit in buenos aires nov 30 dec 1 the market seems quite concerned about the result of the summit the usd cny one month risk reversal a measure of the relative expense of usd cny calls vs puts is noticeably higher than it was back then china has shown it s willing to let its currency weaken to offset the impact of any tariffs usd cny is not much different than it was before the buenos aires summit but the market perceives the risk of usd cny moving higher i e cny weakening as much higher indicating that it sees a higher possibility of failure at this meeting than at the previous one or perhaps just less room for success us treasury secretary mnuchin said on cnbc this week that they were about 90 of the way there with a deal that sounds good but what it also means is that the last 10 may require concessions that neither side is willing to make china isn t the only trade issue however trump is also threatening to impose tariffs on car imports from europe if talks at the g20 meeting and afterwards don t manage to kill that idea then europe is threatening to hit the president where it hurts wherever that is so probably we ll never hear the end of this main events during the week tankan nfp rba meeting advertisement the problem with the tankan is you never know how it will affect the yen the impact seems quite inconsistent it has a more consistent impact on the tokyo stock market the reaction of the yen then may well be a knock on effect the fx market takes its cue from the stock market that could move the currency in a counter intuitive direction for example if the tankan causes people to downgrade expectations for the japanese economy as seems likely the stock market may fall and usd jpy may well fall too i e the yen strengthen on a risk off mood probably there are so many variables to watch here the dis the outlook dis and the very important capital spending expectations figures that you can t make a simple judgement from one number but rather have to evaluate the entire set after that the major indicator out in the coming week will be the redoubtable us nonfarm payrolls on friday and its harbinger the adp report on wednesday this indicator once the main focus of excitement every month had become rather routine until suddenly last month it shocked everyone by coming in far below expectations at only 75k the big question now is after 104 consecutive months of expansion will we have the first decline in payrolls or was may just a fluke and we re back to the races again sep 2017 was initially 33k but later was revised up to 18k the market is expecting some mean reversion but not back to the six month moving average of 195k expectations currently are for 165k which is still quite healthy a figure like that would probably quell any thoughts that the employment picture is turning and would therefore reduce the need for a preemptory insurance cut in interest rates by the fed it would therefore be positive for the dollar other numbers coming out are expected to corroborate the optimistic picture the unemployment rate is expected to remain at the extraordinarily low level of 3 6 while average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 3 1 yoy again showing no acceleration but then again no further slowing either the payroll figures are always closely watched but this month is likely to come under even more scrutiny than usual because of tuesday s conference board consumer confidence figures those figures include includes data on the percent of people who think jobs are plentiful and the percent who think they are hard to get subtracting the latter from the former gives us a jobs diffusion index which is watched as a fairly reliable indicator of turning points in the labor market this month it fell the most it s fallen in a decade as the percent saying jobs are plentiful fell and hard to get rose it s still positive but not as positive as it was in may an early warning sign of a turn in the us labor market and the dollar perhaps there s only one central bank meeting during the week the reserve bank of australia rba at their last meeting on june 4th they cut the cash rate by 25 bps to 1 25 the first change in rates since august 2016 the market expects them to cut again at tuesday s meeting and then at least one more time this year as the rba continues to monitor the labour market closely rba gov lowe last month explained that the rba has changed its mind about how low unemployment can get before inflation starts rising apparently they had thought that the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu was around 5 but now they think it s even lower with unemployment currently at 5 2 that means they ll have to get the unemployment rate down much further if they want to see inflation back in their target range that makes the unemployment figures key for aud the next ones are coming out on july 18th other important indicators out during the week include the purchasing managers indices for most countries including the final ones for june for the eurozone and the us finally thursday is a national holiday in the us independence day and so all markets will be closed many people are likely to take friday off as well so us markets may be thin and volatile as a result the weekly commitment of traders report will come out the following monday not on friday today s market usd lower chf up on risk aversion us pce seeing as the g20 meeting and monday s tankan are important issues for today s daily i thought i would wrap it all into one report today market recap it s definitely a risk off day today as virtually all asian stock markets are lower the questions then are why is cad beating jpy and why are all the commodity currencies up anyway looking at the trade weighted indices the only down currencies this morning are gbp naturally and usd and looking just at movements against the dollar nzd is leading the pack again i assume this is all end of month rebalancing that investors want to get dollars off their books and hold currencies for the end of the month and so were simply selling everything vs usd but still why nzd would perform so well in a risk off environment continues to be a mystery to me yesterday s anz business activity outlook failed to show any recovery in confidence or activity instead it was consistent with the reserve bank of new zealand s recent message of the risk of ongoing subdued domestic growth today s consumer anz consumer confidence index was a bit higher but nothing dramatic more rate cuts are in store here a 70 probability of a cut at the august meeting today s events to keep it brief i m mostly going to discuss the major indicator out today namely the us personal consumption expenditure pce deflators which are released every month as part of the personal income and spending data the fomc stated back in january 2012 that the pce deflator was most consistent over the longer run with the federal reserve s statutory mandate in other words this is the fed s preferred inflation gauged and therefore crucial for its rate decision they didn t spell out that they focus on the core pce deflator but it s widely assumed the core deflator is therefore more important but as it doesn t change very much the market usually gets it right in that case attention will focus on the headline measure and any deviation from expectations there the key point is that according to last week s dot plot half the members of the fomc are expecting a rate cut at some point this year but when will they cut pre emptively as insurance or only once they see a definite need to they noted in the statement that inflation is running below 2 percent if the pce deflators continue to run below their 2 target and show no sign of turning upwards then the committee may feel a rate cut is justified in order to get inflation back up towards target thus the consensus forecast of an unchanged headline rate of inflation and a 10 bps drop in the core rate the more important of the two is probably negative for the dollar the eu wide cpi is expected to remain at the same yoy pace as in the previous month both at the headline level and core after yesterday s german cpi stayed unchanged at 1 3 yoy that shouldn t be a surprise eur neutral

la paz bolivia abraham rodríguez s small shoe store grew into a factory that employed more than a dozen workers during an economic boom in bolivia when prices for the gas and minerals it produces soared today he can only employ one worker he says the tax free import of goods and the black market have affected his sales and have caused him to go into debt my life was better 10 years ago there were sales and the shoe store grew rodríguez said in his workshop located in la paz today the market has reduced my employees left because i couldn t afford to pay their salary surrounded by nations reeling from economic crises bolivia remains a rare example of economic stability and growth and in more than 12 years under president evo morales poverty has dropped steadily in south america s poorest country helped by soaring natural gas production but experts say his economic model is facing mounting challenges including rising debt shrinking reserves and devaluing currencies in its main trade partners and some bolivians are starting to feel the consequences despite the storm clouds morales says he must be returned to power in oct 20 elections as any change would bring chaos bolivia s first indigenous president is one of the few remaining leaders of the wave of leftists who swept into office in south america in past decades about 45 000 artisan workshops in bolivia closed in recent years according to the confederation of micro and small enterprises which estimates an annual loss of more than 2 billion a year in its sector or about 5 per cent of the gross domestic product thousands of artisans and other workers swapped their jobs and turned to commerce because the sale of imported electronics and other goods from china became more profitable this meant the number of people who joined the informal sector has swelled to about 50 one of the region s highest rates big industries are also complaining about a slump in the first months of the year with the agroindustry taking the biggest hit and there are less earnings from gas exports and a reduction of the market said hugo siles an economist of the national industry chamber bolivia exports most of its gas to argentina and brazil but its neighbours are facing challenges argentines are frustrated by a recession a sharp depreciation of their currency and spiraling inflation brazilian president jair bolsonaro had a big election victory last year but is struggling to advance his agenda and is also coping with a tumbling currency argentina and brazil have had strong devaluations and that made them more competitive in their exports siles said bolivia has had a fixed and stable exchange rate against the dollar for eight years which means industries that have a high component of domestic input are affected by imports and contraband the fiscal deficit has been rising for six years since the boom in commodity prices ended and it closed at 7 of gdp last year this as well low private investment a sharp decline in currency reserves the increase in public debt with still low international prices and an economy dependent on commodities are causing tensions in bolivia s economic policy said juan pablo bohoslavsky the u n independent expert on foreign debt and human rights the fixed exchange rate to control inflation leads to an increase in import prices and a growing deficit in the balance of payments he said bolivia s external debt rose in march to 10 billion or about 25 of the country s gdp but central bank president pablo ramos discarded the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency the purchasing power depends on the level of prices we have low inflation about 0 6 in 2019 ramos told the associated press this price stability guarantees purchasing power and we must maintain it a few months ago morales said the economy was shielded but his economy minister luis arce recently acknowledged that brazil s crisis will affect bolivia brazil remains bolivia s top market for energy but exports to the region s largest country have plunged due to lower demand and declining fields official reports say that exports fell from a peak of 31 million cubic meters a day of natural gas in 2014 to 23 8 million cubic meters a day in 2017 still the bolivian government remains optimistic and is betting on continuity since morales took office in 2006 the economy has grown by

samir amin 1931 2018 was director of the third world forum in dakar senegal and the author of many books this article is adapted from parts of the prologue of the second volume of his autobiography the long revolution of the global south out now from monthly review press contemporary capitalism is a capitalism of generalized monopolies what i mean by that is that monopolies no longer form islands important as they may be in an ocean of corporations that are not monopolies and consequently are relatively autonomous but an integrated system and consequently now tightly control all productive systems small and medium sized companies and even large ones that are not themselves formally owned by the oligopolies are enclosed in networks of control established by the monopolies upstream and downstream consequently their margin of autonomy has shrunk considerably these production units have become subcontractors for the monopolies this system of generalized monopolies is the result of a new stage in the centralization of capital in the countries of the triad that developed in the 1980s and 90s simultaneously these generalized monopolies dominate the world economy globalization is the name that they themselves have given to the imperatives through which they exercise their control over the productive systems of world capitalism s peripheries the entire world beyond the partners of the triad this is nothing other than a new stage of imperialism as a system generalized and globalized monopoly capitalism ensures that these monopolies derive a monopoly rent levied on the mass of surplus value transformed into profits that capital extracts from the exploitation of labor to the extent that these monopolies operate in the peripheries of the globalized system this monopoly rent becomes an imperialist rent the capital accumulation process which defines capitalism in all of its successive historical forms is consequently governed by the maximization of monopolistic imperialist rent this displacement of the center of gravity of capital accumulation lies behind the continual pursuit of the concentration of incomes and fortunes increasing monopoly rents and captured mostly by the oligarchies plutocracies that control the oligopolistic groups to the detriment of labor incomes and even the revenues of non monopolistic capital in turn this continually growing disequilibrium is itself the origin of the financialization of the economic system what i mean is that a growing portion of the surplus can no longer be invested in the expansion and strengthening of productive systems and that the financial investment of this growing surplus is the only possible alternative for continuing the accumulation controlled by the monopolies this financialization which accentuates the growth in unequal distribution of income and wealth generates the growing surplus on which it feeds the financial investments or more accurately investments of financial speculation continue to grow at breathtaking rates disproportionate with the rates of gross national product growth which itself then becomes largely false or rates of investment in the productive system the breathtaking growth in financial investments requires and sustains among other things the growth in the debt in all its forms particularly sovereign debt when existing governments claim to pursue the goal of debt reduction they deliberately lie the strategy of financialized monopolies needs growth in the debt which they seek and do not oppose a financially attractive means to absorb the surplus from monopoly rents austerity policies imposed to reduce the debt as it is said actually end up increasing its volume which is the sought after consequence the plutocrats the new ruling class of obsolescent capitalism the logic of accumulation lies in the growing concentration and centralization of control over capital formal ownership can be spread out as in the owners of shares in pension plans whereas the management of this property is controlled by financial capital we have reached a level of centralization in capital s power of domination such that the bourgeoisie s forms of existence and organization as known up to now have been completely transformed the bourgeoisie was initially formed from stable bourgeois families from one generation to the next the heirs carried on the specialized activities of their companies the bourgeoisie was built and built itself over the long run this stability encouraged confidence in bourgeois values and promoted their influence throughout the entire society to a large extent the bourgeoisie as dominant class was accepted as such its access to the privileges of comfort and wealth seemed deserved in return for the services they rendered it also seemed mainly national in orientation sensitive to national interests whatever the ambiguities and limitations of this manipulated concept might have been the new ruling class abruptly breaks with this tradition some describe the transformation in question as the development of active shareholders sometimes even characterized as populist shareholders fully reestablishing property rights this laudatory and misleading characterization legitimizes the change and fails to recognize that the major aspect of the transformation involves the degree of concentration in control of capital and the accompanying centralization of power the new ruling class is no longer counted in the tens of thousands or even millions as was the case with the older bourgeoisie moreover a large proportion of the new bourgeoisie is made up of newcomers who emerged more by the success of their financial operations particularly in the stock market than by their contribution to the technological breakthroughs of our era their ultrarapid rise is in stark contrast with their predecessors whose rise took place over numerous decades the centralization of power even more marked than the concentration of capital reinforces the interpenetration of economic and political power the traditional ideology of capitalism placed the emphasis on the virtues of property in general particularly small property in reality medium or medium large property considered to purvey technological and social progress through its stability in opposition to that the new ideology heaps praise on the winners and despises the losers without any other consideration the winner here is almost always right even when the means used are borderline illegal if they are not patently so and in any case they ignore commonly accepted moral values contemporary capitalism has become crony capitalism through the force of the logic of accumulation the english term crony capitalism should not be reserved only for the underdeveloped and corrupt forms of southeast asia and latin america that the economists the sincere and convinced believers in the virtues of liberalism denounced earlier it now applies to capitalism in the contemporary united states and europe this ruling class current behavior is quite close to that of the mafia even if the comparison appears to be insulting and extreme the political system of contemporary capitalism is now plutocratic this plutocracy adapts itself to the practice of representative democracy which has become low intensity democracy you are free to vote for whomever you want which is of no importance since it is the market and not the congress or parliament that decides everything a plutocracy also adapts itself elsewhere to autocratic forms of management or electoral forces these changes have altered the status of the middle classes and their mode of integration into the global system these classes are now mainly formed of wage earners and no longer of small commodity producers as before this transformation manifests as a crisis of the middle classes marked by a growing differentiation the privileged high salaries have become the direct agents of the dominant oligopolistic class while the others are pauperized the profiteers the new dominant class in the peripheries the centers peripheries contrast is not new it has been part of the globalized expansion of capitalism from the beginning five centuries ago consequently the local ruling classes of the peripheral capitalist countries whether independent or colonies were always subaltern ruling classes though still connected to their countries drawing profits from their insertion into globalized capitalism there is considerable diversity in these classes which are largely derived from those that had dominated their societies before their submission to capitalism imperialism the reconquest of independence often led to the replacement of these older collaborationist subordinated classes by new ruling classes bureaucracies state bourgeoisies which were more legitimate in the eyes of the people at the beginning because of their association with national liberation movements but here again in the peripheries dominated either by the older imperialism forms prior to 1950 or the new imperialism from the bandung era up to around 1980 the local ruling classes benefited from a visible relative stability the disruptions caused by the oligopolistic capitalism of the new collective imperialism the triad truly uprooted the powers of all these older ruling classes in the peripheries and replaced them with a new class that i will call profiteers the profiteers in question are business people not creative entrepreneurs they derive their wealth from their connections with the established government and the system s foreign masters whether representatives of the imperialist states the cia in particular or the oligopolies they act as well paid intermediaries benefiting from an actual political rent this is the origin of most of the wealth they accumulate the profiteers no longer subscribe to any moral and national values whatsoever in a caricature of their alter egos in the dominant centers they are interested in nothing other than success in accumulating money with a covetousness that stands out behind a supposed praise of the individual again mafia like even criminal behaviors are never far away the formation of the new class of profiteers is inseparable from the development of the forms of lumpen development widely characteristic of the contemporary south but the main axis of the dominant bloc is formed by this class only in the non emergent countries in the emergent countries the dominant bloc is different the dominated classes a generalized but segmented proletariat karl marx rigorously defined the proletarian a human being forced to sell their labor power to capital and recognized that the conditions of this sale formal or real to use marx s terms were always diverse the proletariat s segmentation is not a new phenomenon the description was more accurate for some parts of the class like the nineteenth century workers in the new manufacturing sector or a better example the fordist factory in the twentieth century focus on the workplace facilitated solidarity in common struggles and the maturation of political consciousness but it also encouraged workerism in some historical marxisms the fragmentation of production resulting from capital s strategy of implementing the possibilities offered by modern technologies without however losing control of subcontracted or delocalized production weakens solidarity and strengthens diversity in perception of interests thus the proletariat seems to disappear just at the moment it has become more widespread forms of small autonomous production and millions of small peasants artisans and merchants disappear and are replaced by subcontracting work large chain stores etc ninety percent of workers in both material and immaterial production become in formal terms wage workers i have drawn certain conclusions from the diversification in wages far from being proportional to the costs of training for the required qualifications this diversification is accentuated to the extreme yet this has not prevented a rebirth in the feeling of solidarity we the 99 percent say the occupy movements this twin reality capital s exploitation of everybody and the diverse forms and violence of this exploitation is a challenge for the left which cannot ignore the contradictions among the people and yet cannot give up on moving toward a convergence of objectives this in turn implies a diversity in forms of organization and action by the new generalized proletariat the ideology of the movement ignores these challenges moving to the offensive requires an inevitable reconstruction of centers able to think about the unity of strategic objectives the image of the generalized proletariat in the peripheries whether emergent or not is different in at least four ways 1 the progress of the working class visible in the emergent countries 2 the persistence of a large peasantry that is nevertheless increasingly integrated into the capitalist market and consequently subjected to exploitation by capital even if indirect 3 the extremely rapid growth of survival activities resulting from lumpen development and 4 the reactionary positions of large sections of the middle classes when they are the exclusive beneficiaries of growth the challenge for the radical left in these circumstances is to unite peasants and workers to use terms derived from the third international to unite workers including the so called informal ones the critical intelligentsia and the middle classes in an anticomprador front new forms of political domination transformations in the economic base of the system and its accompanying class structures have changed the conditions for the exercise of power political domination is now expressed through a new style political class and a media clergy both dedicated exclusively to serving the abstract capitalism of generalized monopolies the ideology of the individual as king and the illusions of the movement that wants to transform the world even change life without posing the question of workers and peoples seizing power only reinforce capital s new methods of exercising power in the peripheries an extremely caricatured form is achieved when lumpen development confines the exercise of power to a comprador state and class of profiteers by contrast in the emergent countries social blocs of a different type exercise real power the legitimacy of which derives from the economic success of the policies implemented the illusion that emergence in globalized capitalism and by capitalist means will make it possible to catch up with the centers together with the limitations of what is possible in this context and the concomitant social and political conflicts open the door to different possible developments that could move either toward the best in the direction of socialism or the worst failure and recompradorization obsolescent capitalism and the end of bourgeois civilization the characteristics of the new dominant classes described here are not passing conjunctural phenomena they strictly correspond to the operational requirements of contemporary capitalism bourgeois civilization like any civilization cannot be reduced to the logic of the economic system s reproduction it includes an ideological and moral component praise for individual initiative certainly but also honesty and respect for the law even solidarity with the people expressed at least at the national level this value system ensured a certain stability to social reproduction as a whole and marked the world of political representations at its service this value system is disappearing taking its place is a system without any values ignorance and vulgarity characterize a growing majority in this world of the dominants a dramatic change of this kind heralds the end of a civilization it reproduces what can clearly be seen from other eras of decadence for all these reasons i consider that contemporary oligopolistic capitalism must now unequivocally be described as obsolescent whatever its apparent immediate successes since these are completely absorbed into a path clearly leading to a new barbarism i refer here to my study revolution or decadence already more than thirty years old 1 the system of generalized monopoly capitalism globalized imperialist and financialized is imploding right before our eyes this system is visibly incapable of overcoming its growing internal contradictions and is condemned to pursue its mad rush the crisis of the system is due to nothing other than its own success the strategy used by the monopolies has always resulted in the sought after results up to this very day austerity plans the so called social in fact antisocial plans for layoffs are still imposed in spite of resistance the initiative still remains even now in the hands of the monopolies the markets and their political servants the governments that submit their decisions to the so called requirements of the market analyses of struggles and conflicts that begin with the idea of challenging imperialist domination allow us to situate the new phenomenon of the emergence of some countries in the south yet this autumn of capitalism does not coincide with a springtime of peoples which implies that workers and peoples in struggle have made an accurate assessment of the requirements not to end the crisis of capitalism but to end capitalism 2 this has not happened or not yet the gap separating the autumn of capitalism from the possible springtime of peoples gives to the current moment of history its dangerously dramatic character the battle between the defenders of the capitalist order and those who beyond their resistance can urge humanity onto the long road to socialism viewed as a higher stage of civilization has hardly begun all alternatives the best as well as the most barbaric are thus possible the very existence of this gap requires some explanation capitalism is not only a system based on the exploitation of labor by capital it is also a system based on polarization in its development on the world scale capitalism and imperialism are the two inseparable faces of the same reality that of historical capitalism the challenge to this system developed throughout the twentieth century up to 1980 in a long wave of victorious struggles by workers and dominated peoples revolutions conducted under the banners of marxism and communism reforms conquered within the context of a gradual path to socialism the victories of the national liberation movements of colonized and oppressed peoples all together built relations of force less unfavorable to workers and peoples than previously but this wave ran out of steam without succeeding in creating the conditions for its own continuation by new advances this exhaustion then allowed monopoly capital to retake the offensive and reestablish its absolute and unilateral power while the outlines of a new wave of challenges to the system can barely be discerned in that crepuscular light of the night that has not yet ended and the day that has not yet begun monsters and ghosts take shape whereas generalized monopoly capitalism is truly monstrous the responses by forces of rejection are still largely nebulous emergence and lumpen development the term emergence is used by various people in extremely different contexts and most often without clearly defining its meaning emergence is not measured by an elevated rate of growth in gross domestic product gdp or exports over a long period of time more than a decade or by the fact that the society in question has attained an elevated level in per capita gdp as the world bank and conventional economists view it emergence implies much more sustained growth in a country s industrial production and an increase in the ability of these industries to be competitive on the world scale moreover two further questions need to be clarified what industries are involved and what is meant by competitive we should exclude extractive industries mines and fuels that alone can in countries well endowed by nature produce accelerated growth without drawing in its wake all the productive activities of the country in question extreme examples of these non emergent situations are the gulf countries venezuela and gabon it is also necessary to consider the competitiveness of the productive activities in the economy as well as that of the productive system as a whole and not just the competitiveness of a select number of production units taken on their own by means of delocalization or subcontracting multinationals operating in countries of the south can be behind the establishment of local production units subsidiaries of the multinationals or autonomous units capable of exporting on the world market which makes them competitive in the view of conventional economics the competitiveness of a productive system depends on various economic and social factors such as general levels of education and training of workers at all levels and the effectiveness of all the institutions that manage the national political economy tax system corporate law labor rights credit public support etc in turn the productive system in question should not be reduced solely to processing industries that produce manufactured goods for production and consumption though the absence of these really means there is no productive system worthy of the name but also includes food and agricultural production as well as services required for the normal operation of the system particularly transport and credit the concept of emergence then implies a political and holistic approach to the question therefore a country is emergent only insofar as the policies implemented by the government aim at the objective of building and reinforcing an inward looking economy even if it is open to the outside and consequently capable of asserting its national economic sovereignty this complex objective implies that the assertion of this sovereignty involves all aspects of economic life in particular it implies a policy that makes it possible for a country to strengthen its food sovereignty as well as its sovereignty over the control of natural resources and access to them from outside its national territory these multiple and complementary objectives are in stark contrast with those of a comprador government that is content to adjust the growth model implemented to the requirements of the dominant liberal globalized world system and the possibilities offered by it so far we have said nothing about the orientation of the political strategy implemented by a particular state and society is it capitalist or moving toward socialism yet this question cannot be eliminated from the debate because a ruling class choice of orientation has major positive or negative effects on the very success of emergence the relation between policies of emergence on the one hand and the accompanying social transformations on the other does not depend exclusively on the internal consistency of the former but also on the degree of their complementarity or conflict with the latter social struggles class struggles and political conflicts do not arise from adjusting to the logic of the state s project of emergence they are a determinant of what the state does current experience illustrates the diversity of and fluctuations in these relations emergence is often accompanied by a worsening of inequalities yet the precise nature of these inequalities should be spelled out do these inequalities occur in a context where a tiny minority or a larger one the middle classes benefit from the policies pursued while the majority of workers are pauperized or in a context where there is an improvement in the living conditions of this majority even if the rate of growth in their income is lower than that of the system s beneficiaries in other words the policies implemented can link emergence to pauperization or not emergence is not a status that a country achieves once and for all it consists of successive steps earlier ones if successful would prepare the way for the following ones or if not successful would lead to an impasse in the same way the relation between the emergent economy and the world economy is itself in constant transformation and part of different overall possibilities which could support social solidarity in the nation or weaken it emergence is thus not synonymous with growth in exports and the rising power of a country measured in this way growth in exports hinges on the growth of an internal market that has to be specified for the working classes the middle classes and the former can become a support or an obstacle to the second growth in exports can thus weaken or strengthen the relative autonomy of the emergent economy in its relations to the world system emergence is a political project not only an economic one an evaluation of its success is thus based on an examination of its capacity to reduce the way in which the dominant capitalist centers continue their domination in spite of the economic successes of emergent countries measured in the terms of conventional economics for my part i have defined these means in terms of control by the dominant powers of technological development access to natural resources the global financial and monetary system means of information and weapons of mass destruction i also maintain the thesis that there is indeed a collective imperialism of the triad that intends to preserve by any means its privileged position in the domination of the world and prevent any emergent country from challenging this domination i conclude from this that the ambitions of the emergent countries are in conflict with the strategic objectives of the imperialist triad and the extent of the violence in this conflict is proportional to the degree of radicalness in the challenges from the emerging countries to the privileges of the center enumerated above the economics of emergence also cannot be separated from the international policy of the countries in question do they align themselves with the triad s politico military coalition do they consequently accept the strategies implemented by the north atlantic treaty organization or do they attempt to counter them an authentic project of emergence is the exact opposite of one that includes unilateral submission to the requirements of the globalized capitalism of the generalized monopolies which can only result in what i call lumpen development i am here freely borrowing the term used by the late andre gunder frank to analyze a similar development but in different spatial and temporal conditions today lumpen development is the result of accelerated social disintegration connected to the model of development which does not deserve the name imposed by the monopolies of the imperialist centers on the dominated societies of the periphery it is reflected in the dramatic growth in survival activities the so called informal sphere in other words by the pauperization inherent to the unilateral logic of capital accumulation among the experiences of emergence some fully deserve the label because they are not part of processes of lumpen development in other words in these situations pauperization does not afflict the working classes instead there is an improvement in their conditions of life whether modest or strong two of these experiences are clearly capitalist south korea and taiwan i will not discuss here the particular historical conditions that made possible the success of the emergence project in these two countries two others inherit the legacy of socialist revolutions china and vietnam cuba could be included in this group if it succeeds in surmounting the contradictions it is currently undergoing there are other cases of emergence connected to obvious processes of lumpen development india is the best example parts of the country s situation correspond to what emergence requires and produces there is a state policy that aims at strengthening a sizable industrial system there is an accompanying expansion of the middle classes there is progress in technological capacities and education and there is a foreign policy capable of autonomy on the world scene but there is also accelerated pauperization for the great majority two thirds of the society this is an example then of a hybrid system that combines emergence with lumpen development we can even bring out the complementarity of these two faces of reality i believe without intending to make a huge overgeneralization that all the other countries considered to be emergent belong to this hybrid family whether it be brazil south africa or others but there are also and this is true of most other countries in the south situations in which the elements of emergence are barely apparent while the processes of lumpen development are clearly dominant the contribution of maoism the workerist and eurocentric marxism of the second international shared with the era s dominant ideology a linear view of history in which all societies have to pass first through a stage of capitalist development for which colonization in this regard historically positive planted the seeds before being able to aspire to socialism the idea that the development of some the dominant centers and the underdevelopment of others the dominated peripheries were inseparable like two sides of the same coin both immanent products of capitalism s worldwide expansion was totally alien to it the polarization inherent in capitalist globalization a major fact with significant worldwide social and political implications calls for a perspective that leads to the surpassing of capitalism this polarization is the basis for the possible support of large fractions of the working classes and above all the middle classes whose development is itself favored by the position of the centers in the world system in the dominant countries for social colonialism simultaneously it transforms the peripheries into a zone of storms as the chinese expression has it in a permanent natural rebellion against the capitalist world order certainly rebellion is not synonymous with revolution but it raises the possibility of the latter motivations for rejecting the capitalist model are not lacking even at the system s center as the case of 1968 among other examples illustrates undoubtedly the chinese communist party s chosen formulation of the challenge at one time the countryside encircles the cities is consequently too extreme to be useful a global strategy for the transition beyond capitalism toward global socialism must coordinate struggles in the centers with those in the peripheries of the system initially v i lenin distanced himself from the dominant theory of the second international and successfully led a revolution in the weak link russia but always with the belief that this would be followed by a wave of socialist revolutions in europe this was a disappointed hope lenin then moved toward a view that gave more importance to the transformation of rebellions into revolutions in the east but it was up to the chinese communist party and mao zedong to systematize this new perspective maoism made a decisive contribution to a comprehensive assessment of the issues and challenges the globalized capitalist imperialist expansion represents it allowed us to place the centers peripheries in contrast to the expansion of the inherently imperialist and polarizing really existing capitalism at the center of the analysis and to draw from that analysis all the implied lessons for the socialist struggle in both the dominant centers and the dominated peripheries these conclusions have been summarized in a beautiful chinese style expression states want independence nations want liberation and peoples want revolution states the ruling classes of all countries in the world when they are something other than lackeys and conveyors of external forces work to enlarge their space of movement that allows them to maneuver within the capitalist world system and raise themselves from passive actors condemned to adjust unilaterally to the dominant demands of imperialism to active actors who participate in shaping the world order nations that is historical blocs of potentially progressive classes want liberation specifically development and modernization peoples that is the dominated and exploited working classes aspire to socialism the phrase allows us to understand the real world in all its complexity and therefore formulate effective action strategies it shares the view that the transition from capitalism to world socialism will be long very long even and consequently breaks with the third international s concept of the short transition ecology and marxism the ecological question arises in almost all debates this is understandable given that the scale of ecological disasters is now clearly visible yet these debates rarely get beyond confusion only a minority of movements understand that a response to the challenge demands leaving behind the logic of capitalist accumulation the established powers quickly understood the danger and expended major supposedly scientific efforts which in reality are purely ideological propaganda to demonstrate that a green capitalism was possible i talked about this in my analyses of the questions of sustainable development 3 i also in contrast contended that the works of mathis wackernagel and william rees to which i referred illustrate the possibility of calculating i emphasize the word calculating that is a quantified measure use values on the condition of breaking away from capitalism françois houtart s book 2010 dissects the hoax of green capitalism john bellamy foster 2000 has given a masterful analysis of marx as an ecologist 4 for these reasons i believe it might be useful for readers to know what my viewpoint is on these questions one that i have tirelessly advocated in many debates the text that follows is drawn from my book the law of worldwide value 2010 the viewpoint of the dominant currents in environmentalism particularly in the fundamentalist variety is certainly not that of marxism although both rightly denounce the destructive effects of development environmentalism attributes these destructive effects to the eurocentric and promethean philosophy characteristic of modernity in which the human being is not part of nature but claims to subject the latter to the satisfactions of its needs this thesis entails a fatal culturalist corollary it inspires a call to follow another philosophy that emphasizes humanity s belonging to nature its mother with that in mind supposedly alternative and better philosophies such as one derived from a particular interpretation of hinduism are praised in opposition to so called western philosophy this is ill considered praise which ignores the fact that hindu society was not and is not different from so called western societies neither concerning the use of violence hindu society is anything but as nonviolent as it claims to be nor the subjection of nature to exploitation marx develops his analysis on a completely different terrain he attributes the destructive character of capital accumulation to capitalism s logic of rationality which is governed exclusively by the pursuit of immediate profit short term profitability he demonstrates that and draws the explicit conclusions in volume 1 of capital these two methods of interpreting history and reality lead to different judgments on what must be done to meet the challenge the destructive effects of development environmentalists are led to condemn progress and thereby join the postmodernists in viewing scientific discoveries and technological advances negatively this condemnation leads in turn to a method of envisaging what the future might be which is at the very least not very realistic thus projections are made in which a particular natural resource will be exhausted fossil fuels for example and then the validity of these fatally alarmist conclusions is generalized by the assertion that the planet s resources are not infinite which is certainly correct in principle but not necessarily in terms of what can be deduced from it hence possible future scientific discoveries that might counter a particular alarmist conclusion are ignored of course the distant future remains unknown and there will never be any guarantee that progress will always make it possible to find solutions to unknown future challenges science is not a substitute for the belief in eternity religious or philosophical in this context situating the debate on the nature of the challenges and the ways to deal with them would lead us nowhere on the contrary by placing the debate on the terrain cleared by marx the analysis of capitalism we are able to advance in analyzing the challenges yes there will still be scientific discoveries in the future on the basis of which technologies for controlling the riches of nature might be derived but what can be asserted without fear of contradiction is that as long as the logic of capitalism forces society to exercise its choices on the basis of short term profitability which is implied by the valorization of capital the technologies that will be implemented to exploit new scientific advances will be chosen only if they are profitable in the short term consequently this implies that such technologies will carry an increasingly higher risk of being environmentally destructive it is only when humanity has designed a way of managing society based on prioritizing use values instead of the exchange values associated with the valorization of capital that the conditions for a better management of the relations between humanity and nature will come together i do say better management and not perfect management the latter implies the elimination of the limitations to which all human thought and action are subject the early critique of eurocentrism that i advanced taken up in the second and expanded edition of my book eurocentrism continues the work started by marx as a counterpoint to the culturalist postmodernist and supposedly environmentalist discourse 5 environmentalists choice to debate these questions in a flawed theoretical context traps them not only in theoretical but above all in political impasses this choice allows the dominant forces of capital to manipulate all the political proposals that result from it it is well known that alarmism allows the societies of the imperialist triad to preserve their privilege of exclusive access to the planet s resources and prevent the peoples of the peripheries from being able to deal with the requirements of their development whether for good or bad it is ineffective to respond to antialarmist views by pointing to the incontestable fact that they are themselves mere fabrications of the lobbies for example the automobile lobby the world of capital always operates in this way the lobbies that defend particular interests of segments of capital endlessly confront one another and will continue to do so lobbies for energy intensive choices now oppose lobbies for green capitalism environmentalists will only be able to get out of this labyrinth if they understand that they must become marxists notes
la paz bolivia abraham rodríguez s small shoe store grew into a factory that employed more than a dozen workers during an economic boom in bolivia when prices for the gas and minerals it produces soared today he can only employ one worker he says the tax free import of goods and the black market have affected his sales and have caused him to go into debt my life was better 10 years ago there were sales and the shoe store grew rodríguez said in his workshop located in la paz today the market has reduced my employees left because i couldn t afford to pay their salary surrounded by nations reeling from economic crises bolivia remains a rare example of economic stability and growth and in more than 12 years under president evo morales poverty has dropped steadily in south america s poorest country helped by soaring natural gas production but experts say his economic model is facing mounting challenges including rising debt shrinking reserves and devaluing currencies in its main trade partners and some bolivians are starting to feel the consequences despite the storm clouds morales says he must be returned to power in oct 20 elections as any change would bring chaos bolivia s first indigenous president is one of the few remaining leaders of the wave of leftists who swept into office in south america in past decades about 45 000 artisan workshops in bolivia closed in recent years according to the confederation of micro and small enterprises which estimates an annual loss of more than 2 billion a year in its sector or about 5 per cent of the gross domestic product thousands of artisans and other workers swapped their jobs and turned to commerce because the sale of imported electronics and other goods from china became more profitable this meant the number of people who joined the informal sector has swelled to about 50 one of the region s highest rates big industries are also complaining about a slump in the first months of the year with the agroindustry taking the biggest hit and there are less earnings from gas exports and a reduction of the market said hugo siles an economist of the national industry chamber bolivia exports most of its gas to argentina and brazil but its neighbours are facing challenges argentines are frustrated by a recession a sharp depreciation of their currency and spiraling inflation brazilian president jair bolsonaro had a big election victory last year but is struggling to advance his agenda and is also coping with a tumbling currency argentina and brazil have had strong devaluations and that made them more competitive in their exports siles said bolivia has had a fixed and stable exchange rate against the dollar for eight years which means industries that have a high component of domestic input are affected by imports and contraband the fiscal deficit has been rising for six years since the boom in commodity prices ended and it closed at 7 of gdp last year this as well low private investment a sharp decline in currency reserves the increase in public debt with still low international prices and an economy dependent on commodities are causing tensions in bolivia s economic policy said juan pablo bohoslavsky the u n independent expert on foreign debt and human rights the fixed exchange rate to control inflation leads to an increase in import prices and a growing deficit in the balance of payments he said bolivia s external debt rose in march to 10 billion or about 25 of the country s gdp but central bank president pablo ramos discarded the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency the purchasing power depends on the level of prices we have low inflation about 0 6 in 2019 ramos told the associated press this price stability guarantees purchasing power and we must maintain it a few months ago morales said the economy was shielded but his economy minister luis arce recently acknowledged that brazil s crisis will affect bolivia brazil remains bolivia s top market for energy but exports to the region s largest country have plunged due to lower demand and declining fields official reports say that exports fell from a peak of 31 million cubic meters a day of natural gas in 2014 to 23 8 million cubic meters a day in 2017 still the bolivian government remains optimistic and is betting on continuity since morales took office in 2006 the economy has grown by an annual average of about 4 5 well above the regional average and the international monetary fund says it will grow at 4 per cent this year experts however warn that growth is largely dependent on savings and external credits from china while the 15 1 billion in international reserves reached in 2014 plunged to 8 billion last march morales is credited for his pragmatic economic stewardship that spread bolivia s natural gas and mineral wealth among the masses but he has lost support following allegations of manipulating the justice system corruption scandals and his insistence in running for a fourth term in office bolivia s long governing president warns that if he is not re elected in october bolivia could break with its recent run of stability and return to a past of economic turmoil

you may be well aware of the benefits of trading currencies and the fact that the forex market opens up a world of opportunities for you similarly there are other markets as well which present great opportunities for you one such market the energy market includes petroleum products natural gas and even a few exotic items such as heating oil before anything else one of the first aspects you need to be aware of prior to involving in energy trading is to find out whether your broker offers contracts for difference cfd trading if not you will have to look out for a futures broker though the cfd markets often tend to move in tandem with the futures markets a slight difference has always been observed however the difference is not very significant and would not impact your trading results now the real question you must ask yourself is which futures broker is affordable for you this is because futures contracts are considerably more expensive and are believed to present a one size fits all kind of situation further if you decide that you will trade futures contracts in crude oil in the u s the margin required for each contract will be to the tune of 5 000 or more however a cfd broker allows you to trade for much smaller amounts when compared to the standardized futures contracts as you get access to a smaller tick value the margin requirement also comes down fundamentals are applicable to energies you may probably be used to viewing currencies as reflecting the economic situation of countries energies should also be looked at in the same fashion for instance when we approach the colder northeastern part of america in the latter part of the year the value of natural gas often goes up this can be attributed to the fact that the united states consumes higher amounts of natural gas during the winter season during this time the market participants often tend to focus on short term inventory gains and losses the crude oil market is another market you can look at the price of crude oil might rally when tensions prevail in the middle east region in the event of any conflict cropping up or the possibility of a disruption in supply arising the price of oil shoots up when the tension eases the price of oil comes down during the middle of this year supply from libya supply was disrupted and this drove oil prices higher however the prices declined when the ports were opened once again the changes in the value of the us dollar is important a change in the value of the greenback may not impact the price of natural gas but crude oil is extremely sensitive this is because the price of crude oil is denominated in us dollars for instance imagine that the price of crude oil is 75 per barrel when the greenback s value rises crude oil will cost less economic data is also equally important it is important that you keep in mind the fact that energy is very sensitive to the economic data for instance a strong global economic situation is generally positive for the energy markets this is because energy is required for growth in the manufacturing and transportation sectors this has a cumulative effect on both natural gas and crude oil as they are essential to power large industries and shipping among others when there is an increase in commerce the energy consumption will also increase this drives demand energy prices work as an indicator at times one of the aspects as regards energy trading is that some people use electricity and some others need natural gas while crude oil consumption may be higher at some other places for example a higher consumption of crude oil provides an indication that the economies around the world are growing if it happens in china considered the factory of the world it means that a large amount of energy is being consumed to produce the goods they ship to countries around the world they will have to use energy for powering the trucks and boats that carry their produce related how the price of oil affects alternative energy employment change in the united states of america and seasonality nonfarm payroll nfp provides information about the changes in employment in the u s this data significantly influences the energy markets as energy requirement rises when the number of people employed is more further the energy requirements will be different during different seasons in the u s during the summer season it is very common for the families in the u s to go on long drives this drives gasoline a product derived from crude oil consumption up energy markets are not equal in general it is important that you be with the large and liquid energy markets the most liquid energy markets are west texas intermediate crude light sweet crude brent and natural gas you can also trade heating oil but such markets are not very liquid when compared to the larger energy markets they may also experience a great deal of volatility you will have to spend a lot of time to understand the demand and supply for such energies but the margin offered does not justify the time invested in some of these contracts typically such energy markets are often dealt with by hedgers and not day traders therefore it makes sense to stay liquid markets when it comes to trading energy markets use currencies as a substitute if you want to avoid dealing with the energy market you may make use of certain currencies as a substitute however you must know that inflation has a significant impact on these currencies that said there are a number of currency traders who specialize in buying and selling the canadian dollar mexican peso and norwegian krone among others as they mimic both the demand as well as the price of crude oil this is because they are all key oil producing countries therefore the values of the currencies these countries tend to mirror crude oil s price in relative terms

u s trade war with china put investors in a buying mood the milestone marks the second time in less than two weeks that the benchmark index closed at a record high the s p 500 is now up 18 3 for the year the broad rally came after the world s two biggest economies agreed over the weekend to resume negotiations the truce which involves the u s holding off on imposing new tariffs on 300 billion in chinese goods gave financial markets reason to breathe a little easier the new tariffs would have come on top of existing tariffs that remain in place investors have been worried the fallout from the tariffs could hurt global economic growth and corporate profits those concerns prompted the federal reserve last month to declare its willingness to cut interest rates if the dispute hurts the u s economy it s really a de escalation of the tough talk we ve heard from both sides on tariffs said jeff zipper managing director at u s bank private wealth management it s basically kicking the can

tariffs on 300 billion in chinese goods the move still leaves 25 import taxes imposed by the u s on 250 billon of chinese imports in place however and china maintains the tariffs it placed on 110 billion in american goods primarily agricultural products trump also said he would allow u s companies to sell some components to chinese telecommunications giant huawei which last month was placed on an american blacklist as a threat to national security wall street s gains in the first half of the year were marked by months of volatile trading as investors rode the ups and downs of the trade war that volatility is unlikely to fade as the u s and china head into yet another round of trade talks the market also had a bounce back in december when both sides agreed to more talks and negotiations seemed on track that rally quickly faded as investors complained the agreement didn t resolve the core issues in the dispute the key difference this time around is the federal reserve in december the fed spooked investors by raising interest rates for the seventh time in two years now the central bank has said it is willing to cut rates in order to shore up the u s economy if the trade war crimps growth in what is now the longest economic expansion in u s history the federal reserve is key here zipper said you re going to need the fed to follow through on these rate cuts for the market to go

i am delighted to be in helsinki at this important conference on monetary policy and the future of europe s monetary union 1 today i would like to discuss the broad review of the federal reserve s monetary policy framework that my fellow policymakers and i are undertaking this year we are examining the policy strategy tools and communication practices that we use to pursue our dual mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability in my remarks i will describe the motivation for and scope of this review and discuss some of the events that are taking place in our review we are being transparent and open minded and we are seeking perspectives from a broad range of interested individuals and groups including academics other specialists and the public at large motivation for the review the fact that the federal reserve is conducting this review does not suggest that we are dissatisfied with the existing policy framework indeed we believe our existing framework has served us well helping us effectively achieve our statutorily assigned dual mandate goals nonetheless in light of the unprecedented events of the past decade we believe it is a good time to step back and assess whether and in what possible ways we can refine our strategy tools and communication practices to achieve and maintain these goals as consistently and robustly as possible 2 i note that central banks in other countries have conducted periodic reviews of their monetary policy frameworks and their experience has informed the approach we are pursuing with the u s economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review the unemployment rate is near a 50 year low and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective by conducting this review we are ensuring that we are well positioned to continue to meet our statutory goals in coming years in addition the federal reserve used new policy tools and enhanced its communications in response to the global financial crisis and the great recession and the review is evaluating these changes furthermore u s and foreign economies have significantly evolved since the pre crisis experience that informed much of the research that provided the foundation for our current approach perhaps most significantly neutral interest rates or r appear to have fallen in the united states and abroad 3 moreover this global decline in r is widely expected to persist for years the decline in neutral policy rates likely reflects several factors including aging populations changes in risk taking behavior and a slowdown in technology growth these factors contributions are highly uncertain but irrespective of their precise role the policy implications of the decline in neutral rates are important all else being equal a fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank s policy rate will reach its effective lower bound elb in future economic downturns that development in turn could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and keep inflation from falling too low 4 another key development in recent decades is that inflation appears less responsive to resource slack that is the short run phillips curve appears to have flattened implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment 5 a flatter phillips curve is in a sense a proverbial double edged sword it permits the federal reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturns as was the case during and after the great recession because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the phillips curve is flatter 6 however a flatter phillips curve also increases the cost in terms of economic output of reversing unwelcome increases in longer run inflation expectations thus a flatter phillips curve makes it all the more important that longer run inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective 7 finally the strengthening of the labor market in recent years has highlighted the challenges of assessing the proximity of the labor market to full employment the unemployment rate which stood at 3 6 percent in may has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment however the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment is not directly observable and thus must be estimated i believe the range of plausible estimates extends to 4 percent or below for example in the summary of economic projections submitted in conjunction with the june meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the range of estimates for the longer run normal unemployment rate is 3 6 to 4 5 percent 8 the decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has been accompanied by a pronounced increase in labor force participation for individuals in their prime working years 9 these increases in prime age participation have provided employers with a source of additional labor input and have been one factor restraining inflationary pressures as with the unemployment rate whether participation will continue to increase in a tight labor market remains uncertain the strong job gains of recent years also have delivered benefits to groups that have historically been disadvantaged in the labor market for example african americans and hispanics have experienced persistently higher unemployment rates than whites for many decades 10 however those unemployment rate gaps have narrowed as the labor market has strengthened and there is some indication of an extra benefit to these groups as the unemployment rate moves into very low territory 11 likewise although unemployment rates for less educated workers are persistently higher than they are for their more educated counterparts such gaps appear to narrow as the labor market strengthens 12 and wage increases in the past couple of years have been strongest for less educated workers and for those at the lower end of the wage distribution 13 scope of the review in the federal reserve act the congress assigned the federal reserve the responsibility to conduct monetary policy so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates 14 our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the committee s statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy 15 first adopted in january 2012 the statement has been reaffirmed at the start of each subsequent year including at the fomc s meeting this past january with unanimous support from all 17 fomc participants the statement indicates that the committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level in doing so the fomc recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision according to the federal reserve act the employment objective is on an equal footing with the inflation objective as a practical matter our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known in the research literature as flexible inflation targeting 16 however the fed s mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation targeting central banks and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict neither one takes precedent over the other we believe this transparency about the balanced approach the fomc takes has served us well over the past decade when high unemployment called for extraordinary policies that entailed some risk of inflation the review of our current framework is wide ranging and we are not prejudging where it will take us but events of the past decade highlight three broad questions three questions the first question is can the federal reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective under our current approach as well as that of most flexible inflation targeting central banks around the world the persistent shortfalls of inflation from 2 percent that many advanced economies have experienced over most of the past decade are treated as bygones this means that policy today is not adjusted to offset past inflation shortfalls with future overshoots of the inflation target nor do persistent overshoots of inflation trigger policies that aim to undershoot the inflation target central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots but the elb on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more likely persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer term inflation expectations become poorly anchored or become anchored below the stated inflation goal 17 in part because of that concern some economists have advocated makeup strategies under which policymakers seek to undo in part or in whole past inflation deviations from target such strategies include targeting average inflation over a multiyear period and price level targeting in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path 18 these strategies could be implemented either permanently or as a temporary response to extraordinary circumstances for example the central bank could commit at the time when the policy rate reaches the elb to maintain the policy rate at this level until inflation over the elb period has on average run at the target rate 19 other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the elb by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case 20 in many models that incorporate the elb these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate and thereby viewed over time provide no conflict between the dual mandate goals 21 the benefits of the makeup strategies rest heavily on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will in fact be delivered when the time comes for example that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent as is well known from the research literature makeup strategies in general are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent conditions at that time will not warrant doing so because of this time inconsistency any makeup strategy to be successful would have to be understood by the public to represent a credible commitment that important real world consideration is often neglected in the academic literature in which central bank commitment devices are simply assumed to exist and be instantly credible on decree thus one of the most challenging questions is whether the fed could in practice attain the benefits of makeup strategies that are possible in models the next question the review will consider is are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability or should the toolkit be expanded and if so how the fomc s primary means of changing the stance of monetary policy is by adjusting its target range for the federal funds rate in december 2008 the fomc cut that target to just above zero in response to financial turmoil and deteriorating economic conditions because the u s economy required additional policy accommodation after the elb was reached the fomc deployed two additional tools in the years following the crisis balance sheet policies and forward guidance about the likely path of the federal funds rate 22 the fomc altered the size and composition of the fed s balance sheet through a sequence of three large scale securities purchase programs via a maturity extension program and by adjusting the reinvestment of principal payments on maturing securities with regard to forward guidance the fomc initially made calendar based statements and later on it issued outcome based guidance overall the empirical evidence suggests that these added tools helped stem the crisis and support economic recovery by strengthening the labor market and lifting inflation back toward 2 percent that said estimates of the effects of these unconventional policies range widely 23 in addition to assessing the efficacy of these existing tools we will examine additional tools to ease policy when the elb is binding during the crisis and its aftermath the federal reserve considered but ultimately found some of the tools deployed by foreign central banks wanting relative to the alternatives it did pursue but the review will reassess the case for these and other tools in light of more recent experience in other countries the third question the review will consider is how can the fomc s communication of its policy framework and implementation be improved our communication practices have evolved considerably since 1994 when the federal reserve released the first statement after an fomc meeting over the past decade or so the fomc has enhanced its communication practices both to promote public understanding of its policy goals strategy and actions and to foster democratic accountability these enhancements include the statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy postmeeting press conferences various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the committee s normalization of monetary policy and quarterly summaries of individual fomc participants economic projections assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections 24 as part of the review we will assess the committee s current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful for example there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability activities and timeline for the review let me turn now to our review process 25 the board and the reserve banks are conducting fed listens events during which we are hearing from a broad range of interested individuals and groups including business and labor leaders community development professionals and academics one of our fed listens events was a research conference at the federal reserve bank of chicago in early june with speakers and panelists from outside the fed i would like to give a brief summary of what we heard there janice eberly james stock and jonathan wright provided a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the federal reserve s monetary policy strategy tools and communications since 2009 lars svensson evaluated the pros and cons of several monetary policy strategies that have makeup features and argued that average inflation targeting could be more likely than price level targeting to be understood by the public and garner credibility cynthia wu and eric sims used a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to analyze the efficacy of several policy tools at the elb forward guidance negative interest rates and asset purchases and the interactions between them stephen cecchetti and kermit schoenholtz assessed the federal reserve s communication practices and offered suggestions for improving our most important communication vehicles in other sessions katharine abraham and john haltiwanger developed an innovative search and matching model to estimate labor market slack which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps and phillips curve relationships maurice obstfeld examined the ways that global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest and the role played by the u s dollar in transmitting the federal reserve s monetary policy to other countries anil kashyap and caspar siegert spoke about the interplay between financial stability considerations and monetary policy our conference also included two sessions with national and community leaders a panel discussion moderated by fed governor lael brainard provided a valuable perspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate statistics we often consult another panel discussion moderated by federal reserve bank of boston president eric rosengren offered valuable perspectives about how the monetary levers we pull and push affect communities credit availability and small businesses in addition to the chicago conference 7 of the 12 reserve banks have hosted fed listenssessions and other events are planned for later this year from these listening sessions we have heard about innovative partnerships involving employers workforce development groups and community colleges to fill training gaps and about greater flexibility in the workplace around entry requirements and working arrangements this innovation and flexibility are coming when the labor market is tight and qualified workers are scarce and so are welcome developments from the perspective of job creation and retention all of our fed listens events are being conducted with a high degree of transparency you can view videos of the events or read the summaries on our website in coming regularly scheduled fomc meetings we will begin our own assessment of our monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices informed by what we heard at the conference and during our listening sessions in the federal reserve districts and by the work of our staff when the committee tackles important issues we take the time for wide ranging and candid discussions and so i expect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this year we will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review likely during the first half of next year concluding thoughts the economy is constantly evolving bringing with it new policy challenges so it makes sense for us to remain open minded as we assess current practices and consider ideas that could potentially enhance our ability to deliver on the goals the congress has assigned us for this reason my colleagues and i do not want to preempt or to predict our ultimate finding what i can say is that any refinements or more material changes to our framework that we might make will be aimed solely at enhancing our ability to achieve and sustain our dual mandate objectives in the world we live in today references aaronson stephanie r mary c daly william wascher and david w wilcox 2019 okun revisited who benefits most from

of the phillips curve in the united states and abroad see among others simon matheson and sandri 2013 blanchard cerutti and summers 2015 and bank for international settlements 2017 6 one potential contributor to the flattening of the phillips curve is a change in the conduct of monetary policy since the 1980s toward greater stabilization of inflation and economic activity for evidence of such a change see clarida galí and gertler 2000 boivin and giannoni 2006 and boivin kiley and mishkin 2010 as discussed in roberts 2006 and bullard 2018 greater stabilization on the part of a central bank can lead to the estimation of flatter phillips curves in reduced form regressions similarly the adoption of an explicit inflation objective along with greater certainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy can help anchor longer term inflation expectations and stabilize actual inflation in response to shocks 7 see yellen 2015 for a discussion of inflation dynamics and monetary policy see erceg and others 2018 for a quantitative exploration of the monetary policy implications of a flat phillips curve in an uncertain economic environment since the mid 1980s movements in both realized inflation and measures of longer term inflation expectations have been somewhat muted complicating the task of extracting the precise role of inflation expectations as a determinant of realized inflation faust and wright 2013 review the literature on inflation forecasting and present evidence in support of the conclusion that measures of inflation expectations help predict the trend in inflation cecchetti and others 2017 showed that while the level of realized inflation and four quarter ahead inflation expectations are positively correlated changes in these variables have been largely uncorrelated since the mid 1980s these authors suggest that in a low and stable inflation environment policymakers should pay attention to a wide array of other indicators in determining the implications of movements in realized inflation and measures of inflation expectations 8 the box how tight is the labor market in the board s february 2018 monetary policy reportcontains a discussion

levels and with different levels of education can be calculated using data from the current population survey from the bureau of labor statistics the economic policy institute 2019 provides convenient tabulations of these data 14 even though the act lists three distinct goals the federal reserve s mandate for monetary policy is commonly known as the dual mandate the reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers is stable creates the conditions needed for interest rates to settle at moderate levels for a discussion see mishkin 2007 quoted text from the federal reserve act is in 12 u s c 225a 2000 15 the statement is available on the board s website at return to text 16 for a discussion of this terminology and references see english lópez salido and tetlow 2015 and clinton and others 2015 17 these risks could be exacerbated if households and businesses expect monetary policy to be insufficiently accommodative because of proximity to the elb for related discussions see reifschneider and williams 2000 adam and billi 2007 nakov 2008 and hills nakata and schmidt 2016 18 eggertsson and woodford 2003 provide an early discussion of how optimal monetary policy at the elb entails a commitment to reflate the price level during the subsequent economic expansion nessén and vestin 2005 discuss the relationship between average inflation targeting and price level targeting there is a dearth of empirical evidence on strategies seeking to make up for inflation deviations central banks that pursue an inflation goal generally seek to achieve a specific rate of inflation by some time horizon typically a couple of years ahead or over the medium run without regard to past inflation deviations one exception is the reserve bank of australia whose inflation goal is specified as a range of 2 3 per cent on average over the medium term and thus might embed some notion of history dependence however ruge murcia 2014 argues that the drift in the price level in australia is comparable with the drifts observed in economies with purely forward looking specification of the inflation goal the only known historical example of price level targeting occurred in sweden from 1931 to 1933 when the country abandoned the gold standard and attempted instead to maintain its price level the temporary adoption of price level targeting is credited with helping sweden avoid deflation an outcome that contrasted with that in countries that stayed on the gold standard see berg and jonung 1999 19 see bernanke 2017 for a discussion of such a strategy see hebden and lópez salido 2018 for a quantitative assessment of that and other strategies see also kiley and roberts 2017 for a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during economic expansions to compensate for below target realizations of inflation during economic downturns 20 see reifschneider and williams 2000 for a strategy in which a central bank following a taylor rule makes up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during elb episodes by subsequently keeping the policy rate lower than otherwise the box complexities of monetary policy rules in the board s july 2018 monetary policy report contains an application of such a modified rule see board of governors 2018b pp 37 41 21 see english lópez salido and tetlow 2015 for applications of flexible price level targeting and nominal income targeting

considered in a january 2017 speech by then chair janet yellen prescribed setting the federal funds rate between negative 1 1 2 and negative 9 percent see yellen 2017 in addition to using these two additional monetary policy tools the federal reserve implemented a number of other measures to stabilize the financial system increase households and business confidence and more generally support the economic recovery these supplementary measures included the setting up of several credit facilities and the introduction of stress tests for systemically important financial institutions 23 on the

when d d market closed its franklin avenue storefront in sept 2016 hartford lost more than a landmark small business the third generation family grocer caterer and purveyor of fresh foods traces its capital city roots back to 1932 when present day owner daniel d aprile s grandfather opened a bustling market that became a mainstay on one of hartford s most vibrant small business corridors however things changed dramatically over the decades shifting demographics a shrinking customer base and higher rents all made doing business in hartford more difficult daniel d aprile said in a recent interview but the biggest pain point was property taxes though d aprile didn t own d d s old hartford quarters at 276 franklin ave his father actually does he was still responsible for paying real estate and personal property taxes at its peak he owed 54 000 a year to the city a sum that became too much to bear and led him to buy a smaller property less than four miles away in wethersfield where he d eventually relocate his entire business and 38 employees since opening the wethersfield location on wolcott hill road in 2014 sales are up 35 percent d aprile said just as important he s paying less than a quarter of the property taxes 12 000 annually than he did in hartford i never wanted to move my business out of hartford but the rent was skyrocketing the property taxes were skyrocketing and sales weren t going up d aprile said we were working very hard for nothing there was no money left over after paying property taxes if we stayed in hartford we would have been out of business he added d d market s story isn t wholly unique for years hartford s small and large businesses have complained they re paying an exorbitant and disproportionate share of property taxes hurting their ability to prosper at 74 29 mills hartford s property tax rate is by far the state s highest and among the nation s highest in fact the effective property tax rate for a commercial landlord in hartford over 5 percent is higher than what new york city boston and chicago landlords face that s stifled economic growth in the city hartford s 4 billion grand list is valued 30 percent below what it was near the turn of the 21st century and 38 percent below its 1990 peak of 6 5 billion by comparison neighboring west hartford one of the region s wealthier communities with half the population of hartford has a 41 mill rate and 6 3 billion grand list new haven a city with a comparable population to hartford but lower mill rate 42 98 mills has a 6 6 billion grand list has brought development to an absolute screeching halt said hartford city councilor and lawyer john gale it s a huge drag this has been the biggest single financial issue the city has faced in the last 15 years with limited exceptions private development has eschewed hartford over the last decade or longer unless it s been supported by state government subsidies or city tax breaks the city s small businesses in particular have felt enormous pressure from the high property tax rate part of the reason key commercial avenues franklin maple main albany etc in various neighborhoods have lost their luster and for anyone who thinks commercial taxpayers will soon get relief after the state last year helped the city avert bankruptcy by agreeing to pay off hartford s 550 million in general obligation debt over the coming decades think again despite its bailout hartford s finances remain in a precarious position and commercial taxpayers aren t likely to see a tax rate reduction anytime soon according to mayor luke bronin credit hartford business journal hartford business journal hartford mayor luke bronin for a small business or any property owner paying the full freight 74 mills it s an unsustainable and unfair burden bronin said i think it s a huge issue and one that our state has to confront if we want to be competitive for hartford s mill rate to be competitive over the long run bronin said it needs to be cut in half that however would likely require major reforms at the state level or a miraculous surge in new commercial development house majority leader matt ritter d hartford said he agrees hartford still has a long road to recovery but he also thinks the bailout he helped broker provided the city with much needed financial stability he said it could take 10 to 15 years to put any sizable dent in the mill rate and that s only if hartford is able to grow its grand list and secure additional state funding among other efforts he also said the bailout deal was the best the city could have hoped for given the political environment for anyone who thinks the deal could have been better they are sorely mistaken ritter said there was not an appetite to reduce the mill rate the hartford business journal has spent months interviewing property tax experts commercial property owners landlord developers policymakers homeowners city officials and others about the effects of hartford s property tax system which is complicated and broken in myriad ways occupying just 18 square miles hartford is a tiny city that also houses many tax exempt properties significantly limiting the city s ability to grow its grand list in fact 59 percent of the assessed real estate in the city is exempt from taxation because it s owned by governments nonprofits churches or other tax exempt organizations an hbj analysis of city property records shows meantime hartford is also home to one of the poorest populations in the country increasing the need for social health care and other services adding insult to injury hartford has the state s only bifurcated property tax system in which commercial property owners pay a higher tax rate than residential homeowners hartford s challenges are a statewide concern because the city s fortunes are directly tied to the state s especially as more employers and skilled workers want to be in or near vibrant cities despite its challenges some business leaders are still bullish about hartford s future especially given downtown s new vibrancy in recent years helped by the additions of dunkin donuts park uconn s west hartford campus a fledgling tech scene and about 1 500 new apartment units i m more optimistic about hartford s increasing attractiveness as a location for companies due to the urbanization trend said jon putnam executive director of commercial realty broker cushman wakefield how did we get here hartford didn t land in its current financial and property tax predicament overnight numerous factors over many decades stacked up to create an unstable and untenable situation with no clear or easy solutions the start of the decline of hartford s property tax base and system can be traced to the mid 20th century when the city like many others in connecticut and across the u s was going through major economic and demographic shifts as more people moved to the suburbs that squeezed out a large portion of hartford s middle class and the affluence that went along with it the city s manufacturing and industrial base also began to shrink while its impoverished populace grew leading to higher city government costs as taxes rose to compensate more properties also shifted to nonprofit ownership that came on top of the enormous share of city property already owned by tax exempt institutions like colleges hospitals sewage plants and even the state itself over the past half century the portion of hartford s tax exempt grand list has more than doubled state government reimburses the city for some of its tax exempt property but it doesn t come close to filling the gap city government too has exacerbated the problem over the decades by overborrowing making pension promises whose costs have outpaced grand list growth and then kicking the can down the road either through short term and costly debt restructurings or by raising taxes however bronin who is running for reelection this year said much larger structural issues have been the leading cause of hartford s fiscal stress at the root of the problem is the fundamental flaw of having an 18 square mile city with an enormous concentration of non taxable property and intense concentration of poverty and asking that city to run itself on only one local source of revenue he said referring to the fact that municipalities in connecticut are only allowed to raise revenue through the property tax in addition to permit and other fees the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences bronin said his administration is running a very lean government and has made deep cuts over the last few years the city council just passed the mayor s 573 2 million budget for fiscal 2020 which does raise spending by 3 2 million but doesn t rely on borrowing and keeps the city s workforce excluding public safety personnel 11 percent below 2015 levels notably since taking office in 2016 bronin has also managed to not increase the city s sky high mill rate even still hartford is unable to lower its property tax rate that shows excess borrowing isn t the root cause of hartford s problems bronin said since the state essentially eliminated most of the city s long term debt if the city had never borrowed a single dollar you would still have a mill rate of 74 29 to make the city function he said noting that city finances are now reviewed by a state oversight panel without the state bailout or bankruptcy hartford would have had to quickly raise its mill rate an additional 10 to 15 mills bronin said which wouldn t have been sustainable he argues much more drastic reforms are still needed at the state level including giving the city additional ways to raise revenue the bailout has provided enough relief to prevent a financial armageddon but the city still has limited financial flexibility bronin said at the end of the day he said there is a cost to delivering basic core services in hartford and the value of taxable property does not come anywhere near funding that state rep jason rojas a democrat from east hartford who co chairs the powerful finance revenue and bonding committee said the city will likely continue to lean on the state credit hartford business journal hartford business journal state rep jason rojas absent pretty significant economic growth in the grand list which i think is difficult to do i think there s still a lot more work to do for the long term future of the city rojas said marc fitch an investigative reporter for the yankee institute a free market think tank said there s plenty of blame to spread for hartford s fiscal situation on the one hand the city awarded really generous labor contracts in the past so fitch views the bailout at least partially as rewarding fiscal mismanagement on the other hand the state has not fully reimbursed hartford for its tax exempt property shortchanging it of vital operating funds hartford has avoided bankruptcy for now but fitch who credits bronin for his budgeting discipline said the city appears stuck in limbo for the foreseeable future even with the bailout and everything their finances are razor thin and they re relying on potential grand list growth to hopefully fill those gaps in the next few years and that is a gamble fitch said out of whack property taxes hartford s financial and economic instability over the years have birthed arguably the most dysfunctional commercial property tax structure this state has seen in the last half century besides the exorbitant mill rate hartford is the only connecticut municipality allowed to assess commercial property at a higher tax rate to calculate any property tax bill in connecticut owners must multiply their property s assessed value by a city s or town s mill rate and then divide by 1 000 in the 1970s connecticut passed a law requiring municipalities to adopt a 70 percent assessment ratio that means to determine the assessed value of a property whether it s a single family home commercial property or apartment assessors multiply its market value by 70 percent by the late 1970s hartford faced a crisis the city was in the middle of its first revaluation in 17 years and many residential properties experienced a significant spike in value if all properties were assessed at the same level some homeowners faced average tax increases of well over 80 percent which was deemed practically and politically untenable so city officials hatched an agreement with state policymakers that among other things allowed hartford to lower its residential assessment ratio to 45 8 percent that shielded homeowners from a major tax hike while leaving commercial property owners with a higher tax rate that initial bifurcated tax structure was actually phased out by 1986 but adopted again in 2006 and remains in place today commercial and apartment properties are assessed at 70 percent of value while single family homes are assessed at 35 percent there is a formula in place that gradually raises the residential assessment ratio to 70 percent but it will take decades before that happens said city assessor john s philip hartford and new haven developer bruce becker says the uneven property tax setup matched with the high mill rate dissuades commercial investment and fosters an environment in which the city must cut tax deals to spur development especially for larger costly projects he knows that firsthand he redeveloped the 777 main st 26 story office tower into 285 apartments in 2015 an 85 million project that relied heavily on public financing and tax credits he also got a tax break from the city without that support he said the project wouldn t have happened relying on the property tax exclusively to fund municipalities is inefficient becker said delayed revals one source of hartford s problems over the years is that it often waited long periods between revaluations when that coincided with wild swings in the real estate market it led to dramatic changes in assessed property values for example hartford waited 10 years before conducting its 1998 1999 reval which shrank the city s grand list 38 percent to 3 6 billion while the mill rate jumped from 29 50 to 47 the grand list nosedived because assessed property values hadn t fully taken into account the effects of the late 1980s and early 1990s savings and loan crisis which put connecticut and the nation into recession over a 40 year period starting in 1962 hartford only conducted three revals today state law requires municipalities to do revaluations at least every five years waiting 10 years to do a revaluation is not a great idea philip said some have pitched the idea of conducting revaluations more frequently to better capture real estate value changes in a more timely manner but it s seen by many as too costly hartford has also experimented with a commercial property tax surcharge that reached as high as 15 percent and stayed at that level for nine years starting in 1997 the surcharge drew the ire of the business community led by the metrohartford alliance which eventually lobbied to phase out the additional tax in 2010 hartford s mill rate has stabilized since 2011 there have been no tax increases under the bronin administration but the mill rate went on a consistent and steady climb at the turn of the 21st century going from 29 50 in 1998 to its current 74 29 mills today bottom line impact the effect of hartford s bifurcated tax system is that commercial landlords and their tenants are shouldering a much higher tax burden than homeowners in fact city homeowners have an effective tax rate of about 2 2 percent on par with the statewide average while commercial properties have an effective tax rate of more than 5 percent that means for every 1 000 of assessed value a hartford commercial taxpayer pays more than 50 in taxes vs 22 for residential by comparison the effective property tax rates on commercial properties in boston and new york city are 1 8 percent and 3 9 percent respectively according to the lincoln institute of land policy businesses in those cities however face other unique costs property values are also much higher in those cities hartford s high tax rate has a negative effect on commercial property values said john mcdermott a former hartford city assessor during the 1970s who is now a consultant to connecticut businesses commercial properties are valued based on how much net operating income they generate from rents property taxes are typically the second highest expense behind a mortgage when taxes rise they eat into a building s profitability thus eroding their market value that in turn negatively impacts the city s grand list in 1996 when hartford s effective commercial mill rate was 33 4 the grand list totaled 5 8 billion today hartford s grand list sits at only 4 billion making things more challenging for commercial landlords particularly those who own downtown s class a office towers is that rents have been stagnant for nearly three decades settling in at about 22 to 26 per square foot while property taxes and operating expenses increased squeezing their bottom lines combined operating expenses and taxes cost downtown landlords around 10 to 11 per square foot in the late 1980s but reached as high as 15 to 17 in the early 2000s those costs have retreated a bit more recently as landlords found ways to reduce operating expenses and the city kept a lid on real estate tax increases said putnam the cushman wakefield commercial realty broker and it s not just landlords stuck paying higher property taxes many commercial tenants have a triple net lease meaning they must pay a share of a building s property taxes businesses must also pay taxes on personal property like machinery and equipment and motor vehicles that s how tax bills begin to add up for small and midsize merchants like d aprile s d d market that rent space in the city mcdermott said hartford s mill rate is a major impediment to renaissance efforts taking place downtown it s a competitive environment he said in today s world clearly entrepreneurs have an opportunity to go anywhere they want to go there are clearly advantages to being in the city but also from an economic perspective the suburbs have a tax impact that is dramatically less you can very easily go to glastonbury or rocky hill where the tax burden is half or two thirds of the city s urban draw despite hartford s tax burden the city particularly downtown has seen noticeable development and investment in recent years most of it however has been subsidized by the state or is the beneficiary of city tax breaks still many employers find it necessary to have a hartford presence especially as millennials and others desire urban settings where they can live work and play credit hartford business journal hartford business journal dunkin donuts stadium home of the hartford yard goats for some residents symbolizes a recent mini renaissance for the city in fact hartford has seen some employers move from the suburbs to downtown in recent years to be closer to a wider talent pool and the various amenities the city offers the vacancy rate for class a office space downtown is currently 17 7 percent down from 25 5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 according to commercial realty firm cbre the city s overall office vacancy rate fell from 26 1 percent to 16 5 percent over that same time period the state s purchase of two major office towers and the conversion of vacant office buildings into apartments have helped lower the vacancy rate meantime the grand list despite being well below historical highs is up 23 percent since 2006 the city lately has also attracted out of state realty investment including from new york landlord shelbourne global solutions llc shelbourne has invested more than 200 million since 2014 buying up some of downtown hartford s most prized office towers cementing it as one of the center city s most prominent landlords most recently it teamed up with hartford parking giant laz parking to buy the city s iconic gold building skyscraper for 70 5 million shelbourne managing member ben schlossberg said his group finds the city attractive because it s walkable uniquely located between new york and boston and has a strong corporate and higher education presence however he is also cognizant of hartford s high tax rate shelbourne sued the city a few years ago after its appeal for lower property taxes on several of its recently revalued buildings was denied it eventually brokered a tax break deal with the city to resolve the issue without that helping hand some of shelbourne s properties would have gone into foreclosure schlossberg said an issue familiar to downtown especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we are very excited about what is going on in hartford schlossberg said however he added the state needs to find a way to lower the mill rate which is oppressive travelers cos is one employer that has made significant investment in hartford in recent years the property and casualty insurer spent about 55 million giving its famous travelers tower office high rise and campus a facelift it s currently spending millions more to spruce up its interior offices the company was also one of three insurers in addition to the hartford and aetna to promise a combined 50 million donation to the city over five years to help hartford deal with its budget crisis credit hartford business journal hartford business journal andy bessette executive vice president at travelers travelers which is the second highest taxpayer in the city with 143 2 million in assessed real estate and property is aware of the high property tax rate but is also bullish about hartford s future said andy bessette the company s executive vice president and chief administrative officer he said companies look at more than just taxes when deciding where to locate and he s attracted to hartford because of the insurance talent here and the quality of life and amenities the region offers bessette also sits on the board of the capital region development authority which has helped finance development of 1 500 apartment units downtown in recent years that along with a growing innovation ecosystem has added to the center city s vibrancy do we care about property taxes absolutely bessette said adding he recognizes that the high tax rate might impact small and midsize companies more than a large corporation would you like to have them lower absolutely but you know what we believe in the city and want to be sure it s successful you need a thriving urban environment he said
with brent d griffiths the ticker the trade truce that president trump negotiated with chinese president xi jinping in japan over the weekend offers less than meets the eye business leaders are sighing with relief that the agreement forestalls the imposition of tariffs on an additional 300 billion of chinese goods but otherwise it mostly appeared to lock in place a status quo that could augur an extended economic cold war between the world s two largest economies the proof of that analysts say will be evident in the results the truce produces among other things look for those results to include a stock market bump that s short lived no new clarity for federal reserve officials trying to determine whether to cut interest rates a continuing escalation between the united states and china in tensions over technology and corporate chiefs holding back on major investments and continuing to migrate supply chains out of china advertisement 1 the stock market the market just concluded a strong half year with the s p 500 up 17 percent over that period and the dow jones industrial average climbing 14 percent that represents the dow s strongest first half performance in two decades capped by its best june since 1938 investor bullishness came despite trump s intensifying trade war with china and threatening escalations on other fronts including mexico and the european union but several wall street watchers weighing in over the weekend said the osaka cease fire won t translate into a sustained rally for stocks because investors probably will recognize its limits reports from the summit confirm our view that the us china trade war continues into 2020 pretty much as it is today what we call suspended animation engagement generally no deal no end to tariffs but also no new ones terry haines of pangaea policy wrote in a weekend note the market reaction likely will be similar to last december s informal summit meeting with an initial small market positive serving as a sigh of relief giving way to an incremental negative as investors digest that there will be no quick end to the us china trade war the united states and china agreed june 29 during the group of 20 meeting to restart trade talks and to hold off on imposing new tariffs on chinese exports video reuters or as olivier d assier head of applied research for the asia pacific region at axioma which advises asset managers told the wall street journal s steven russolillo and paul j davies the deal represented a weak outcome it falls far short of the specifics we were hoping to get in terms of a timetable for talks a deadline for finalizing the negotiations and a framework for rolling back the existing rounds of tariffs he said in other words things are not going to get worse in the short term but this monkey is by no means off our backs advertisement and goldman sachs economists reached a similar conclusion noting the trump administration will be able to impose new tariffs quickly if talks falter writing in a saturday note they said they continue to think that renewed talks are unlikely to result in the broad agreement the us had sought a few months ago and that it is slightly more likely that the us will impose tariffs on additional imports from china 2 the fed federal reserve chair jerome powell made it clear at the conclusion of the central bank s june meeting that monetary policymakers are moving toward cutting interest rates this year and the drag from trump s trade offensive would weigh heavily into those decisions while some fed watchers predicted before osaka that a trump xi cease fire there would point the way to a more comprehensive deal and remove the need for imminent rate cuts the journal s nick timiraos talked to analysts over the weekend who reached the opposite conclusion advertisement he writes he agreement does little to clear the fog of uncertainty weighing on global trade and investment that has prompted federal reserve officials to consider cutting interest rates and indeed with no details about the path forward analysts said the cease fire could make a deal less likely because it reveals both sides see little urgency to make new concessions and are comfortable with the status quo the outcome leaves fed officials to weigh how much trade uncertainty has already weighed on spending and investment decisions and how continued uncertainty could affect this picture bond traders meanwhile will need to see more than a few friendly words between trump and xi to step back from their bets on rate cuts bloomberg s katherine greifield and brendan murray write heading into the weekend futures traders had expected the u s central bank to lower rates by about a percentage point in the coming year they report the market had

around 1 of total reduction by end of next year still remains fully priced in 3 tech advertisement trump in a key concession to the chinese agreed to allow american companies to start selling gear to huawei again the trump administration last month placed the tech giant on the commerce department s entity list suspecting it of working with the chinese government to facilitate espionage and therefore representing a national security threat the president s move drew angry bipartisan blowback from capitol hill with sen marco rubio r fla calling it a catastrophic mistake to reverse sanctions on the company if president trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against huawei he has made a catastrophic mistake it will destroy the credibility of his administrations warnings about the threat posed by the company no one will ever again take them seriously marco rubio marcorubio june 29 2019 but scott kennedy a china expert at the center for strategic and international studies said the move would do little to slow a wider arms race over technology between the two countries the trump administration has been driving that conflict within the conflict with restrictions on the sales of american tech products to china and tighter limits on chinese investment in the u s the new york times s peter baker and keith bradsher write as kennedy told the paper the two sides are more likely to continue going around in circles rather than reaching the destination of a real deal neither side looks ready to compromise meanwhile the tech war will continue to intensify this is a truce on only one front of the wider conflict 4 manufacturing advertisement american companies that have relied on china for their production have already begun shifting those supply chains to other countries in the region and beyond a response to the 25 percent tariffs the trump administration has imposed on 200 billion of chinese imports that process is likely to continue apace since the truce that trump and xi reached over the weekend provides no timetable for resuming talks much less for removing those existing tariffs the deal could further cement a broad reshuffling of the global economic order that undermines china s decades long role as the world s factory floor the nyt s bradsher writes even a fragile truce could have lingering implications the united states would keep in place broad tariffs on chinese goods for months or perhaps years to come global companies would almost certainly respond by continuing to shift at least the final stages of their supply chains out of

when d d market closed its franklin avenue storefront in sept 2016 hartford lost more than a landmark small business the third generation family grocer caterer and purveyor of fresh foods traces its capital city roots back to 1932 when present day owner daniel d aprile s grandfather opened a bustling market that became a mainstay on one of hartford s most vibrant small business corridors however things changed dramatically over the decades shifting demographics a shrinking customer base and higher rents all made doing business in hartford more difficult daniel d aprile said in a recent interview but the biggest pain point was property taxes though d aprile didn t own d d s old hartford quarters at 276 franklin ave his father actually does he was still responsible for paying real estate and personal property taxes at its peak he owed 54 000 a year to the city a sum that became too much to bear and led him to buy a smaller property less than four miles away in wethersfield where he d eventually relocate his entire business and 38 employees since opening the wethersfield location on wolcott hill road in 2014 sales are up 35 percent d aprile said just as important he s paying less than a quarter of the property taxes 12 000 annually than he did in hartford i never wanted to move my business out of hartford but the rent was skyrocketing the property taxes were skyrocketing and sales weren t going up d aprile said we were working very hard for nothing there was no money left over after paying property taxes if we stayed in hartford we would have been out of business he added d d market s story isn t wholly unique for years hartford s small and large businesses have complained they re paying an exorbitant and disproportionate share of property taxes hurting their ability to prosper at 74 29 mills hartford s property tax rate is by far the state s highest and among the nation s highest in fact the effective property tax rate for a commercial landlord in hartford over 5 percent is higher than what new york city boston and chicago landlords face that s stifled economic growth in the city hartford s 4 billion grand list is valued 30 percent below what it was near the turn of the 21st century and 38 percent below its 1990 peak of 6 5 billion by comparison neighboring west hartford one of the region s wealthier communities with half the population of hartford has a 41 mill rate and 6 3 billion grand list new haven a city with a comparable population to hartford but lower mill rate 42 98 mills has a 6 6 billion grand list has brought development to an absolute screeching halt said hartford city councilor and lawyer john gale it s a huge drag this has been the biggest single financial issue the city has faced in the last 15 years with limited exceptions private development has eschewed hartford over the last decade or longer unless it s been supported by state government subsidies or city tax breaks the city s small businesses in particular have felt enormous pressure from the high property tax rate part of the reason key commercial avenues franklin maple main albany etc in various neighborhoods have lost their luster and for anyone who thinks commercial taxpayers will soon get relief after the state last year helped the city avert bankruptcy by agreeing to pay off hartford s 550 million in general obligation debt over the coming decades think again despite its bailout hartford s finances remain in a precarious position and commercial taxpayers aren t likely to see a tax rate reduction anytime soon according to mayor luke bronin credit hartford business journal hartford business journal hartford mayor luke bronin for a small business or any property owner paying the full freight 74 mills it s an unsustainable and unfair burden bronin said i think it s a huge issue and one that our state has to confront if we want to be competitive for hartford s mill rate to be competitive over the long run bronin said it needs to be cut in half that however would likely require major reforms at the state level or a miraculous surge in new commercial development house majority leader matt ritter d hartford said he agrees hartford still has a long road to recovery but he also thinks the bailout he helped broker provided the city with much needed financial stability he said it could take 10 to 15 years to put any sizable dent in the mill rate and that s only if hartford is able to grow its grand list and secure additional state funding among other efforts he also said the bailout deal was the best the city could have hoped for given the political environment for anyone who thinks the deal could have been better they are sorely mistaken ritter said there was not an appetite to reduce the mill rate the hartford business journal has spent months interviewing property tax experts commercial property owners landlord developers policymakers homeowners city officials and others about the effects of hartford s property tax system which is complicated and broken in myriad ways occupying just 18 square miles hartford is a tiny city that also houses many tax exempt properties significantly limiting the city s ability to grow its grand list in fact 59 percent of the assessed real estate in the city is exempt from taxation because it s owned by governments nonprofits churches or other tax exempt organizations an hbj analysis of city property records shows meantime hartford is also home to one of the poorest populations in the country increasing the need for social health care and other services adding insult to injury hartford has the state s only bifurcated property tax system in which commercial property owners pay a higher tax rate than residential homeowners hartford s challenges are a statewide concern because the city s fortunes are directly tied to the state s especially as more employers and skilled workers want to be in or near vibrant cities despite its challenges some business leaders are still bullish about hartford s future especially given downtown s new vibrancy in recent years helped by the additions of dunkin donuts park uconn s west hartford campus a fledgling tech scene and about 1 500 new apartment units i m more optimistic about hartford s increasing attractiveness as a location for companies due to the urbanization trend said jon putnam executive director of commercial realty broker cushman wakefield how did we get here hartford didn t land in its current financial and property tax predicament overnight numerous factors over many decades stacked up to create an unstable and untenable situation with no clear or easy solutions the start of the decline of hartford s property tax base and system can be traced to the mid 20th century when the city like many others in connecticut and across the u s was going through major economic and demographic shifts as more people moved to the suburbs that squeezed out a large portion of hartford s middle class and the affluence that went along with it the city s manufacturing and industrial base also began to shrink while its impoverished populace grew leading to higher city government costs as taxes rose to compensate more properties also shifted to nonprofit ownership that came on top of the enormous share of city property already owned by tax exempt institutions like colleges hospitals sewage plants and even the state itself over the past half century the portion of hartford s tax exempt grand list has more than doubled state government reimburses the city for some of its tax exempt property but it doesn t come close to filling the gap city government too has exacerbated the problem over the decades by overborrowing making pension promises whose costs have outpaced grand list growth and then kicking the can down the road either through short term and costly debt restructurings or by raising taxes however bronin who is running for reelection this year said much larger structural issues have been the leading cause of hartford s fiscal stress at the root of the problem is the fundamental flaw of having an 18 square mile city with an enormous concentration of non taxable property and intense concentration of poverty and asking that city to run itself on only one local source of revenue he said referring to the fact that municipalities in connecticut are only allowed to raise revenue through the property tax in addition to permit and other fees the biggest problem is that you have a city built on the tax base of a suburb that from the start is a structural flaw that has all kinds of consequences bronin said his administration is running a very lean government and has made deep cuts over the last few years the city council just passed the mayor s 573 2 million budget for fiscal 2020 which does raise spending by 3 2 million but doesn t rely on borrowing and keeps the city s workforce excluding public safety personnel 11 percent below 2015 levels notably since taking office in 2016 bronin has also managed to not increase the city s sky high mill rate even still hartford is unable to lower its property tax rate that shows excess borrowing isn t the root cause of hartford s problems bronin said since the state essentially eliminated most of the city s long term debt if the city had never borrowed a single dollar you would still have a mill rate of 74 29 to make the city function he said noting that city finances are now reviewed by a state oversight panel without the state bailout or bankruptcy hartford would have had to quickly raise its mill rate an additional 10 to 15 mills bronin said which wouldn t have been sustainable he argues much more drastic reforms are still needed at the state level including giving the city additional ways to raise revenue the bailout has provided enough relief to prevent a financial armageddon but the city still has limited financial flexibility bronin said at the end of the day he said there is a cost to delivering basic core services in hartford and the value of taxable property does not come anywhere near funding that state rep jason rojas a democrat from east hartford who co chairs the powerful finance revenue and bonding committee said the city will likely continue to lean on the state credit hartford business journal hartford business journal state rep jason rojas absent pretty significant economic growth in the grand list which i think is difficult to do i think there s still a lot more work to do for the long term future of the city rojas said marc fitch an investigative reporter for the yankee institute a free market think tank said there s plenty of blame to spread for hartford s fiscal situation on the one hand the city awarded really generous labor contracts in the past so fitch views the bailout at least partially as rewarding fiscal mismanagement on the other hand the state has not fully reimbursed hartford for its tax exempt property shortchanging it of vital operating funds hartford has avoided bankruptcy for now but fitch who credits bronin for his budgeting discipline said the city appears stuck in limbo for the foreseeable future even with the bailout and everything their finances are razor thin and they re relying on potential grand list growth to hopefully fill those gaps in the next few years and that is a gamble fitch said out of whack property taxes hartford s financial and economic instability over the years have birthed arguably the most dysfunctional commercial property tax structure this state has seen in the last half century besides the exorbitant mill rate hartford is the only connecticut municipality allowed to assess commercial property at a higher tax rate to calculate any property tax bill in connecticut owners must multiply their property s assessed value by a city s or town s mill rate and then divide by 1 000 in the 1970s connecticut passed a law requiring municipalities to adopt a 70 percent assessment ratio that means to determine the assessed value of a property whether it s a single family home commercial property or apartment assessors multiply its market value by 70 percent by the late 1970s hartford faced a crisis the city was in the middle of its first revaluation in 17 years and many residential properties experienced a significant spike in value if all properties were assessed at the same level some homeowners faced average tax increases of well over 80 percent which was deemed practically and politically untenable so city officials hatched an agreement with state policymakers that among other things allowed hartford to lower its residential assessment ratio to 45 8 percent that shielded homeowners from a major tax hike while leaving commercial property owners with a higher tax rate that initial bifurcated tax structure was actually phased out by 1986 but adopted again in 2006 and remains in place today commercial and apartment properties are assessed at 70 percent of value while single family homes are assessed at 35 percent there is a formula in place that gradually raises the residential assessment ratio to 70 percent but it will take decades before that happens said city assessor john s philip hartford and new haven developer bruce becker says the uneven property tax setup matched with the high mill rate dissuades commercial investment and fosters an environment in which the city must cut tax deals to spur development especially for larger costly projects he knows that firsthand he redeveloped the 777 main st 26 story office tower into 285 apartments in 2015 an 85 million project that relied heavily on public financing and tax credits he also got a tax break from the city without that support he said the project wouldn t have happened relying on the property tax exclusively to fund municipalities is inefficient becker said delayed revals one source of hartford s problems over the years is that it often waited long periods between revaluations when that coincided with wild swings in the real estate market it led to dramatic changes in assessed property values for example hartford waited 10 years before conducting its 1998 1999 reval which shrank the city s grand list 38 percent to 3 6 billion while the mill rate jumped from 29 50 to 47 the grand list nosedived because assessed property values hadn t fully taken into account the effects of the late 1980s and early 1990s savings and loan crisis which put connecticut and the nation into recession over a 40 year period starting in 1962 hartford only conducted three revals today state law requires municipalities to do revaluations at least every five years waiting 10 years to do a revaluation is not a great idea philip said some have pitched the idea of conducting revaluations more frequently to better capture real estate value changes in a more timely manner but it s seen by many as too costly hartford has also experimented with a commercial property tax surcharge that reached as high as 15 percent and stayed at that level for nine years starting in 1997 the surcharge drew the ire of the business community led by the metrohartford alliance which eventually lobbied to phase out the additional tax in 2010 hartford s mill rate has stabilized since 2011 there have been no tax increases under the bronin administration but the mill rate went on a consistent and steady climb at the turn of the 21st century going from 29 50 in 1998 to its current 74 29 mills today bottom line impact the effect of hartford s bifurcated tax system is that commercial landlords and their tenants are shouldering a much higher tax burden than homeowners in fact city homeowners have an effective tax rate of about 2 2 percent on par with the statewide average while commercial properties have an effective tax rate of more than 5 percent that means for every 1 000 of assessed value a hartford commercial taxpayer pays more than 50 in taxes vs 22 for residential by comparison the effective property tax rates on commercial properties in boston and new york city are 1 8 percent and 3 9 percent respectively according to the lincoln institute of land policy businesses in those cities however face other unique costs property values are also much higher in those cities hartford s high tax rate has a negative effect on commercial property values said john mcdermott a former hartford city assessor during the 1970s who is now a consultant to connecticut businesses commercial properties are valued based on how much net operating income they generate from rents property taxes are typically the second highest expense behind a mortgage when taxes rise they eat into a building s profitability thus eroding their market value that in turn negatively impacts the city s grand list in 1996 when hartford s effective commercial mill rate was 33 4 the grand list totaled 5 8 billion today hartford s grand list sits at only 4 billion making things more challenging for commercial landlords particularly those who own downtown s class a office towers is that rents have been stagnant for nearly three decades settling in at about 22 to 26 per square foot while property taxes and operating expenses increased squeezing their bottom lines combined operating expenses and taxes cost downtown landlords around 10 to 11 per square foot in the late 1980s but reached as high as 15 to 17 in the early 2000s those costs have retreated a bit more recently as landlords found ways to reduce operating expenses and the city kept a lid on real estate tax increases said putnam the cushman wakefield commercial realty broker and it s not just landlords stuck paying higher property taxes many commercial tenants have a triple net lease meaning they must pay a share of a building s property taxes businesses must also pay taxes on personal property like machinery and equipment and motor vehicles that s how tax bills begin to add up for small and midsize merchants like d aprile s d d market that rent space in the city mcdermott said hartford s mill rate is a major impediment to renaissance efforts taking place downtown it s a competitive environment he said in today s world clearly entrepreneurs have an opportunity to go anywhere they want to go there are clearly advantages to being in the city but also from an economic perspective the suburbs have a tax impact that is dramatically less you can very easily go to glastonbury or rocky hill where the tax burden is half or two thirds of the city s urban draw despite hartford s tax burden the city particularly downtown has seen noticeable development and investment in recent years most of it however has been subsidized by the state or is the beneficiary of city tax breaks still many employers find it necessary to have a hartford presence especially as millennials and others desire urban settings where they can live work and play credit hartford business journal hartford business journal dunkin donuts stadium home of the hartford yard goats for some residents symbolizes a recent mini renaissance for the city in fact hartford has seen some employers move from the suburbs to downtown in recent years to be closer to a wider talent pool and the various amenities the city offers the vacancy rate for class a office space downtown is currently 17 7 percent down from 25 5 percent in the first quarter of 2011 according to commercial realty firm cbre the city s overall office vacancy rate fell from 26 1 percent to 16 5 percent over that same time period the state s purchase of two major office towers and the conversion of vacant office buildings into apartments have helped lower the vacancy rate meantime the grand list despite being well below historical highs is up 23 percent since 2006 the city lately has also attracted out of state realty investment including from new york landlord shelbourne global solutions llc shelbourne has invested more than 200 million since 2014 buying up some of downtown hartford s most prized office towers cementing it as one of the center city s most prominent landlords most recently it teamed up with hartford parking giant laz parking to buy the city s iconic gold building skyscraper for 70 5 million shelbourne managing member ben schlossberg said his group finds the city attractive because it s walkable uniquely located between new york and boston and has a strong corporate and higher education presence however he is also cognizant of hartford s high tax rate shelbourne sued the city a few years ago after its appeal for lower property taxes on several of its recently revalued buildings was denied it eventually brokered a tax break deal with the city to resolve the issue without that helping hand some of shelbourne s properties would have gone into foreclosure schlossberg said an issue familiar to downtown especially in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we are very excited about what is going on in hartford schlossberg said however he added the state needs to find a way to lower the mill rate which is oppressive travelers cos is one employer that has made significant investment in hartford in recent years the property and casualty insurer spent about 55 million giving its famous travelers tower office high rise and campus a facelift it s currently spending millions more to spruce up its interior offices the company was also one of three insurers in addition to the hartford and aetna to promise a combined 50 million donation to the city over five years to help hartford deal with its budget crisis credit hartford business journal hartford business journal andy bessette executive vice president at travelers travelers which is the second highest taxpayer in the city with 143 2 million in assessed real estate and property is aware of the high property tax rate but is also bullish about hartford s future said andy bessette the company s executive vice president and chief administrative officer he said companies look at more than just taxes when deciding where to locate and he s attracted to hartford because of the insurance talent here and the quality of life and amenities the region offers bessette also sits on the board of the capital region development authority which has helped finance development of 1 500 apartment units downtown in recent years that along with a growing innovation ecosystem has added to the center city s vibrancy do we care about property taxes absolutely bessette said adding he recognizes that the high tax rate might impact small and midsize companies more than a large corporation would you like to have them lower absolutely but you know what we believe in the city and want to be sure it s successful you need a thriving urban environment he said

global stock markets were flat in anticipation of what the sidebar meeting between president trump and xi at the g20 meeting would bring after the 80 minute meeting trump said that negotiations are back on track the baseline scenario leading up to the g20 sit down of the two leaders was just the restart of trade talks without a big announcement or details on how closer or far they are to reach a deal there is a high probability that the outcome will be similar to the previous g20 meeting where another truce was announced fears of tariff escalation will ease but current tariffs could remain unless real progress in made from both sides in their meeting in osaka everybody played their part without any additional drama and until more details emerge we are back at square one the road ahead looks complicated as china demands more equal treatment and the us is pushing through on intellectual property protection the us dollar is mixed against major pairs at the end of trading on friday commodity currencies lead the charge with the new zealand dollar almost 2 percent up on the greenback the canadian dollar rose 1 percent as strong economic indicators play down the probability of an

productive g20 summit with russian president putin announcing an extension to the production cut agreement that will be finalized later this week when the group meets in vienna markets will look forward to an action packed first week of july the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec will meet with major producers to finalize the extension discussed by putin at the g20 manufacturing data in china and the us will not show any impact from the g20 meeting but the indicator could change drastically going forward chinese factory activity was lower than expected at 49 4 and remains in contraction with the newly announced truce between china and the us will have to deliver an agreement or else global manufacturing will continue to deliver soft data points the reserve

percent trade uncertainty ahead of get g20 added volatility to energy pricing it was the main reason the opec and the other major producers pushed back their ministerial meeting to this week russia remains on the sidelines and seems only a big drop in oil prices would expedite an extension of the agreement to cut production to stabilize prices crude prices have been pressured downward as the trade war between us china was a negative factor on energy demand supply disruptions added support to prices but the major factor was the opec which is why if russia does not agree to an extension the initiate could be too much for saudi arabia to handle by itself despite trump and xi getting back to the negotiation table on trade russia decided to go ahead with a production cut extension that could last 9 months gold gold under pressure from positive trump xi comments on trade at g20 the most anticipated meeting at the g20 left market participant wanting more the sit down between trump and

on top as the favourite destination for investors seeking refuge from uncertainty the willingness to cut rates from the fed is keeping the dollar weak and gives the gold the upper hand as july gets underway the market is pricing in a rate cut to be announced at the july federal open market committee fomc that will put more downward pressure on the dollar middle east tensions and the ongoing brexit debate will be in the spotlight in july making a strong case for gold climbing higher as major central banks run back their easing monetary policy playbook gold will be pressured as trade optimism reduces the appeal of the yellow metal as a safe haven although given the macro headwinds it remains part of various diversification strategies the lack of details on what has really changed from the us china negotiations makes it hard to believe the new talks will have a different outcome which is a positive for gold the next biggest obstacle for gold will be us economic indicators if there is a significant rebound the fed could hold the benchmark rate at its july meeting the market has walked back the number and depth of the rate cuts after some less dovish comments from fed

thwe joint secretary 1 of myanmar s thilawa sez management committee presented a three year plan to conduct a detailed survey on the childcare needs of thilawa sez workers this survey would lead to the implementation of sez based as well as potentially community based childcare centres dr than than thwe explained that factory owners monthly corporate social responsibility contributions could support the development of these centres on site childcare is a win for everyone dr than than thwe exclaimed from employers as it would contribute to reducing labour shortages and increasing productivity to employees as it would provide a safe environment for their children and emotional security spurred by the example of thilawa sez mr sun samouen senior human resource manager of phnom penh sez informed the plenary that phnom penh sez would also begin investigating the possibility of setting up a childcare centre in the zone another encouraging initiative was shared by mr soe naing deputy director of the department of labour under myanmar s ministry of labour immigration and population molip and a representative of the labour section of thilawa sez mr soe naing informed participants that sez based firms have agreed to pay new workers the full minimum wage from the onset of employment rather than training and probationary period wages which are legally less than the statutory minimum wage of 4 800 myanmar kyat or around 3 us dollars per day during the workshop participants from myanmar actively debated the project s recommendation to pay workers a living wage agreeing on the need to study and account for inflation and the rising cost of living for families as opposed to gauging it on an individual s basic needs when devising a new minimum wage rate a garment manufacturers association in cambodia representative shared cambodia s standing practice of reviewing the minimum wage annually through tripartite negotiations in line with ilo standards and encouraged the myanmar counterparts to consider doing the same since myanmar s minimum wage law was adopted in 2013 a new minimum wage rate has been set roughly once every two years mmn and ait researchers shared project findings revealing restrictions on workers access to freedom of association and limited social dialogue platforms across all of the studied sezs study respondents reported cases of collective industrial actions being suppressed trade unions struggling to be established and outside unions failing to access workers inside the zones during the meeting representatives of the thilawa sez management committee and molip expressed a commitment to working with trade unions and labour rights organisations moving forward a commitment which csos intend to closely follow up on despite seeming enthusiasm for improved working conditions and access to labour rights in sezs from some myanmar and cambodian actors participants acknowledged the challenges that exist for myanmar cross border migrant workers in thailand s tak sez employers in tak are increasingly registering migrant workers for border passes under section 64 of the royal ordinance on the management of foreign workers employment b e 2560 2017 which grants workers 30 day visas and 90 day work permits this form of registration excludes migrant workers from accessing social security benefits limits their movement to the three districts classified as tak sez and prevents them from migrating with dependents further reducing childcare options while issues were raised related to the need to recognise workers skills and pay them accordingly csos shared that migrant workers in tak sez continue to receive far less than the 310 thai baht 10 us dollars daily minimum wage with the study finding that workers were receiving around 57 of the minimum wage 174 thai baht or 5 66 us dollars on average from 2016 to 2019 mmn and ait supported by canada s international development research centre idrc investigated labour and migration issues through a gendered lens in four sezs thilawa sez in myanmar phnom penh sez and manhattan sez in cambodia and tak sez in thailand guided by the question of whether the jobs being created within mekong sezs are promoting decent work an international labour organization ilo concept for fair and secure job opportunities for women migrant workers the study focused its attention on the garment industry within these zones sez development has been expanding in the greater mekong sub region gms in recent years myanmar is constructing three sezs while there are roughly 30 in cambodia 10 in thailand and over 30 in other gms countries the garment industry is being established in these spaces as investment privileges and quality infrastructure are aimed at attracting manufacturers seeking low production and labour costs women represent the majority of the garment industry s workforce but are often concentrated in the lowest paying positions with the least recognised skills the challenges they face are compounded when they are also migrants who experience a unique set of vulnerabilities within the gms manufacturing production in sezs increasingly hinges on internal and cross border migrant labour although mmn and ait s study found that the potential of mekong sezs to support decent work has not yet been realised multi stakeholder discussion during the two day workshop and the commitments expressed by the management teams of cambodian and myanmar sezs left some participants feeling hopeful that through sustained collaborative and transparent efforts sezs could have the potential to set an example for decent labour practices

one of the most important first tasks on moving to a new country as an expat is making sure your finances are in order money ranks high with finding somewhere decent to live sorting out healthcare and if you have children searching for a good school becoming an expat living in the philippines is no different and careful financial planning is needed ask other expats about this a high street bank survey did and found one in four expats had trouble organising their finances as a newcomer to the country where they lived juggling money between your former home and where you now live is a tough task the rules governing how banks and financial firms work vary between countries which can be confusing unless you know exactly who you are dealing with then there s managing money in different currencies making sure you pay the right taxes on time and moving money between countries in different time zones making sense of your finances as an expat in the philippines can be more than a little daunting but this guide should help make things easier and a little less fraught philippines expat financial advice no matter what you do for a living or if you are retired as an expat you will need tailored financial advice for different scenarios as your life unfolds before you and unexpected events arise to make the best of your money you need to know about short and long term savings which could cover a rainy day fund for coping with unforeseen bills and a pension for when you retire other events are bound to arise marriage children buying a home or even a buy to let property back in the uk should you think about returning an independent financial advisor can point out your financial options along the way while looking out for tax or investment traps along the way this guide will cover what you need to know about expat finance in the philippines financial advice is not only about paying less tax expats need to know how to make the most of their money tax is important but only one brick in the financial wall why go to the philippines the government is working hard to make the philippines attractive to wealthy foreigners with money to invest in the economy retired expats are welcome under the special resident retiree s visa srrv see more below and the cost of living is low making a finite income stretch much farther the country is warm and welcoming with a population of more than 100 million stretching over nearly 7 500 tropical islands offering major cities like the capital manila to sleepy backwaters with glorious sun kissed palm tree lined beaches the thriving big cities follow the american pattern of shopping malls skyscrapers and busy living but the older more relaxed philippines still exists not far from the suburbs for older expats the philippines retirement agency helps with handling officialdom providing visas and offering job opportunities and other benefits to encourage long stays spending your money paying your bills or shopping in the philippines is the same as most other places the shops take most international credit cards but few along with most banks and money exchange services will not change traveller s cheques most major currencies can be exchanged at airports banks hotels and a few larger stores on arrival if you plan to take more than php50 000 into the country you ll need to obtain written authorisation from the philippines central bank current exchange rates put the philippines peso at 51 4 to the us dollar and 65 2 to the british pound trusting a financial adviser as an expat you are likely to need someone to guide you through the financial maze in the philippines your adviser should become like a close friend and confidante they will have a privileged insight into your innermost financial secrets and you need to respect that they will keep your sensitive information private and offer you best advice getting on with each other is important just like any other close relationship it s ok to disagree from time to time but if you have no trust the relationship will fail and you will have to look for another adviser why expats in the philippines need a financial plan failing to budget and put a financial plan into place is a risky strategy because you are at the mercy of others every expat has financial resources specific to them and their own ideas about spending and saving but a financial plan puts brakes and checks into place like making sure you have life insurance retirement saving is on track and that you have money left to pay the bills and have a little fun on the way a financial adviser is a travel guide for your financial journey every so often they should confirm you are on track and give a heads up about what lies ahead so you can take avoiding action as the client it s always your choice whether to follow their advice or to take a different route what is a financial plan everyone likes to think they make their own decisions in life but control over managing your money is often limited by external factors the money markets and interest rates can rise and fall inflation will impact on savings charges can eat into savings and investments while governments often regard people prudent with their money as a cash cow there to milk of more tax a financial plan tries to consider how what might happen will play out by running software models to show how events beyond your control could affect your savings and investments the best financial plans include a budget how to set aside money to cover a short term emergency like accident or illness that stops you working for a few weeks then they look at the medium to long term of three or more years into the future and consider how to invest to match your financial goals these could include school and university fees buying a home a pension or starting a business and don t believe financial planning is only for the rich your financial status as an expat doesn t matter professional advice can make all the difference to your income whatever you have in the bank your savings and investments influence much of your life such as the type of home you have your car and what you can spend on holidays and other pursuits financial advice priced at more than you save as a result is not cost effective questions to ask your financial advisor making the right financial choices is never easy most people have a nagging doubt that they could have done better you can help put your mind at ease by asking your financial adviser some key questions is this decision right for me your financial adviser should recommend insurance or investments that tie in with your financial plan that means taking account of your current spending and lifestyle as a benchmark as well as discussing your financial goals you should be confident that your adviser has considered all this before drafting a short list of products or services for you and should be able to explain the thinking behind the advice what financial products do i need this is one of those everyone is different answers that depends on your personal financial circumstances if you are married with a family and how old you are the question is precisely why a good financial adviser will benchmark your financial status before putting forward any recommendations your adviser should have the qualifications and experience to offer everything you need to know about managing your money including the best way to save do you need to pay for private medical care in the philippines can you buy a home without a filipino partner or associate and how much will a property loan cost what cross border taxes might you pay on top of tax in the philippines should you keep money offshore how to pay to educate your children or grandchildren saving for a pension making a will in the philippines and in your home country and how they interact with each other these are easy questions for your adviser but more perplexing for you if you do not have a detailed knowledge of tax and finance in the philippines a reputable adviser is not a n immigration lawyer or tax expert but should have arrangements to call on other professionals if necessary a crucial question if you can afford not to take financial advice as an expat how much should financial products and advice cost ask for a breakdown of costs together with features and benefits for each product or service recommended the cheapest or most expensive are not always the best you want to pay for the features and benefits that are important to you and compromise in other areas your adviser will charge depending on their status see the section titled how much does financial advice cost below how much should i save or invest this is part of your financial plan and varies between expats for instance a married expat with children will have a different financial outlook than a young single expat many advisers have a rule of thumb to work out how much you should save pay more for what you need rather than an unrealistic notion of what you want around half your income should cover your needs around a third should go towards savings and insurance the rest should go on what you want save little and often don t make grand gestures you can t afford instead every little helps over the long term this means drip feeding savings over the long term rather than larger amounts in fits and starts this allows compound interest work some magic to grow your money what does a financial adviser do a financial adviser is a professional with the skills and qualifications to help you arrange your savings insurances and investments to your best advantage besides finding the right financial products for you the adviser should first benchmark what you have then discuss your attitude to risk this helps choose what sort of investments you are willing to make by balancing the risk of losing money against what you hope to gain another key role is projecting forecasts of how much your savings and investments will be worth for your retirement and milestones in between now and then financial advice is not a one off your adviser should program regular check ups and reviews to confirm your plans are on track and if not any options you may have to make them do better philippines financial advice qualifications financial advisers in the philippines are often well meaning and experienced individuals who do not have formal qualifications and ongoing career development supervised by a professional body a financial adviser should at least qualify as a registered financial planner rfp of the trade body rfp philippines which offers a certification program and a professional code of ethics that members should follow most expat advice firms operating in the philippines are regulated in the uk with advisers holding certifications from the chartered institute for securities investment cisi the main financial certification bodies recognised in the philippines besides the rfp and cisi are chartered insurance institute personal finance society london institute of banking and finance chartered institute of bankers in scotland cfa society of the uk institute of financial planning pensions management institute scottish qualification authority for wills trusts and inheritance advice try someone belonging to step society of trust and estate practitioners or solla society of later life advisers qrops advice for the philippines the philippines is not a recognised jurisdiction for qrops qualifying recognised overseas pension schemes and the overseas transfer charge will apply to expats resident in the country the transfer charge is a 25 tax on the value of a pension fund switched to a qrops expats looking to move their uk pensions offshore without the overseas transfer charge can consider a self invested pension plan sipp why you should deal with a professional adviser although many financial advice qualifications are similar between countries government regulation is not the uk has arguable the most rigorous financial watchdogs and a compensation scheme if things go wrong but many other countries do not the best you can do is only consult an adviser belonging to a professional body advisers belonging to a certifying body are likely to have business insurance and work to a code of ethics most professional bodies have an independent adjudicator handling complaints who can award compensation to find out if your adviser is part of a professional body ask for their qualification and membership number you can confirm this by calling the body or by searching their web site this information is on a business card or letterhead most big brands in the industry do not employ with uncertified advisers so sometimes it pays to stay away from sole traders or small firms verifying your financial adviser besides checking an adviser s qualifications with their professional body there are some other checks you run you may know someone who has does business with them and can offer a reference testimonials offered by the adviser are not that helpful as they are unlikely to put up a customer who doesn t have something good to say search for independent online reviews out of control of the adviser or the firm they work for these can give a flavour of what the adviser is like but most of us post comments for bad work rather than anything good your background checks should include confirming qualifications and experience working with expats in the philippines confirming their independent or tied advice status asking about fee and commission structures considering how you would take advice if you or the adviser should or leave the philippines look at how the adviser deals with tax and estate planning between the uk and the philippines monitoring the response to phone email or text messages an advisor who can t reply within a reasonable time to a new client is unlikely to offer current clients good customer service finding a financial adviser there are several places to look but a good word from a friend or colleague is always useful providing you carry out your own due diligence as well the philippines has loads of online directories and financial advisers regularly write in newspapers and magazines although most are tied many international expat financial advice firms regulated in the uk have offices in the philippines and offer financial solutions wherever you are in the world the registered financial planner rfb web site can pair you up with some suitable candidates picking the right adviser is like recruiting staff at work they not only need to have the qualifications and experience to do the job but you hope they also fit in socially as well try at least two or three before you make a final decision and remember whoever you choose could stay in your life for a long time what sort of advice are you getting you need to know the professional status of your financial adviser from the start as it impacts the quality of advice they give financial consultants are independent multi tied or tied independent financial advisers these arecommonly called ifas or international ifas should give unrestricted whole of the market advice ifas can pick products and services from any provider that suit your needs overseas ifas can be paid commission charge a fee or make their money from a mixture of both multi tied financial advisers multi tied advisers can source products and services from a limited list of providers they generally work for a network or a bank and charge no fees but earn commission on the insurance or savings plans that they sell tied financial advisers a tied adviser has the most limited choice of financial products and services usually restricted to those offered by their employer a tied adviser typically works for a bank or insurance company they earn commission on sales independent v tied financial advice if you take recommendations from a multi tied or tied adviser they have no obligation to tell you about better or cheaper rival products so you could pay more and overlook a better deal just remember if an adviser in the philippines offers you something for free you will pay somewhere along the line how much does financial advice cost good financial advice comes at a price in the philippines advisers earn commission and sometimes it s hard to work out the cost added to take account of their sale commission can be good for expats you undoubtedly would not offer free labour and you should expect financial advice to come at a reasonable cost you can cut costs by negotiating a fixed fee for specific advice or a discount if you want a portfolio of work like a mortgage savings plan and a pension street away from a fee based on time as this can be manipulated added extras that bring benefits large expat financial providers have such big client lists and sign up so many customers for insurance savings and pensions that banks and investment houses offer them sweeteners to refer more customers these include discounts and savings for customers some of these firms are one stop expat finance shops with experts who can give guidance on banking mortgages savings investments and pensions under a single roof putting your finances with a regulated firm can make sense for busy expats don t forget to settle your expat tax sorting out your tax residence as soon as you can is a big cog in the expat finance wheel tax residence is typically the place you call home and where your life is based most countries have a checklist of indicators that point to where you pay your taxes expats cannot determine this for themselves it s a matter of fact based on the checklist if the tax man at either end of your journey decides you come under their jurisdiction you must pay tax as they demand and follow their filing rules for british expats that s hm revenue customs but countries like the usa and south africa from 2020 expect expats to pay tax on their worldwide income regardless of where they live the philippines bureau of inland revenue demands income tax on resident aliens expats based in the country who stay for more than 180 days rates of tax depend on the source of income but expect to pay 20 25 don t forget to finalise your tax affairs in the country you are leaving as well as your new home hmrc expects departing british residents to file an exit form p85 plus a self assessment tax return to bring their uk taxes up to date tax advice for expats in philippines best tax advice for expats is find a professional in your home country and where you live to make sure you don t pay more than you should like financial advisers most tax consultants are qualified and regulated to give advice in the country where they live and work and not overseas for expats who want to stay above the law start your tax plans at home and in the philippines months before you leave for your new home tax follows residence so find out where that is as soon as you can don t try to sort out your own tax it s a minefield get professional help expats want free access to their money wherever they are but the philippines has rules about moving the local currency in and out of the country healthcare is free for most people in the philippines but some expats might slip through the rules and need a private policy or a top up if an employer is offering cover the philippines has a double taxation agreement with the uk so the tax you pay in one country is generally credited against the tax due in the other fatca and crs fatca the us foreign account tax compliance act and crs the common reporting standard are aimed at making sure any tax resident of countries in the networks cannot keep money or other assets hidden offshore fatca is a us program that includes banks and finance houses in the philippines any fatca registered financial institution feeds data on accounts held by us nationals to the internal revenue service irs and in many cases the irs reciprocates with information about philippine residents with accounts and investments in america crs is a similar network to fatca comprising of more than 100 countries but the philippines is not yet a member state and is not listed to join before 2021 at the earliest plan for an early exit many expats go home sooner than expected due to family problems 54 health issues 42 or homesickness 28 according to data from the legatum institute foundation leaving early can upset the best financial plans and end up a costly exercise so don t up sticks and go to the philippines on a whim visas for the philippines anyone can enter the philippines for 30 days without a visa or for 59 days with a tourist visa stays can be

president donald trump has long been convinced that the united states is locked in an unfair trading relationship with china the u s has lost 500 billion a year for many years he has said several times in a possible reference to the balance of trade that showed the nation bought 420 billion more goods from china in 2018 than it sold trump has long touted china s huge exports to the u s as a sign that beijing has been taking advantage of american businesses for decades his determination to redress what he sees as an imbalance has resulted in an escalating trade war with stringent tariffs affecting not only the two countries economic outlooks but also the entire global economy and when he sits down with xi jinping on the sidelines of the g 20 summit being held june 28 and 29 in osaka japan all eyes will be on whether they can restart trade talks that collapsed amid a war of words in may while both sides have good economic incentives to return to free trade experts say the two superpowers also have good political reasons to hold firm and back up the tough rhetoric with action on the u s side the mood music was good with treasury secretary steven mnuchin saying wednesday that washington and beijing were almost done with their trade deal whatever happens next the u s china spat threatens to overshadow the meeting of some of the world s leading economies and crucial topics such as climate change and urgent reform of the world trade organization in may trump doubled u s tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent and said he was prepared to slap the same tariff on the remaining 300 billion if there was no progress in talks the effect of this would be huge goldman sachs has warned it would cause global equity markets to fall by 4 percent the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that renewed tensions between the two countries could see global gross domestic product gdp drop by as much as 0 6 percent the chief economist of the international monetary fund imf gita gopinath said in a blog post in may that the trade war could significantly dent business and financial market sentiment disrupt global supply chains and jeopardize the projected recovery in global growth in 2019 low income households in the u s would be chief among those to suffer from increased prices if the tariff regime was extended she added that s why the mood music coming out of osaka the first official meeting between the two sides in months matters so much why has the dispute become so intense trump spoke so much about u s china trade on the campaign trail in 2015 that a three minute compilation video of him saying china went viral on social media and has since been viewed more than 15 million times a sign for the g 20 summit at a train station in osaka japan tomohiro ohsumi getty images and as promised he has delivered an anti globalization protectionist america first trade agenda billed as a policy that protects u s workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices not everyone believes trump s bold rhetoric will be met by further action there is a real question over whether the u s administration would really be willing to impose all of those i m dubious because this would involve putting tariffs on almost all of the rest of chinese imports said mike jakeman a senior economist at pwc the accountancy and consultancy company in london that would lead to domestic inflation and suddenly you ve got consumers who are quite angry as to why the cost of buying a new iphone has gone up appreciably he said and in an election year when trump has already talked about the economy extensively in his campaign he probably won t want that risk trump s twitter account hails u s economic success on a daily basis from record jobs numbers to stock market highs and it s this economic good fortune that allows him to treat china in terms of foreign policy not just economics jakeman added it s remarkable that trump has gone almost three quarters of the way through his term without really having a difficult decision to make about the economy he has enjoyed a really solid spell that s allowed him to pursue his foreign policy strategy he said national pride as for china the dispute is also about national pride as well as economic success posturing goes both ways and according to james mcgregor an american author journalist and businessman who has lived in china for more than 25 years and is currently chairman of the consulting firm apco worldwide china may have more time to spare despite its domestic economic slowdown the bremen express cargo ship prepares to dock at florida s portmiami which saw china as its top trading country in 2018 joe raedle getty images file i think we have to remember xi jinping does not have to get re elected in 2020 donald trump does and when there s more tariffs coming and they really hit the u s economy and the stock market takes a dive trump will want the stock market to go back up before his election he said so i do think china can be more patient than the u s on this because it s now wrapped up in chinese nationalism very tightly because of huawei he said referring to the huge chinese communications firm that in may was banned from doing business in the u s on whether china is being unfair to u s companies seeking to do business in the country as trump and others allege the picture is more complex the trump administration has made chinese compliance with ip laws a priority for any agreement on reducing or eliminating tariffs between the two countries and it has become a protectionist issue that underscores national pride for both leaders all the more so after trump banned huawei china s leading communications firm from doing business in the u s vicky pryce a former senior u k government economist and now a board member at the centre for economics and business research a london based consultancy said that while american consumers would ultimately be the ones to pay the price for higher tariffs the u s had been justified in taking china to task on various fronts president donald trump greets china s president xi jinping during a business leaders event at the great hall of the people in beijing on nov 8 2017 nicolas asfouri afp getty images file for one thing the government helps chinese companies in a variety of ways such as widespread hidden subsidies she said china has been opening up and so on but it has used all sorts of tricks that make it hard for anyone to see if they have been dumping goods and so on she said you can t say whether in an economic sense it s been wrong but the question is whether you go about it this way the issue of ip theft has long been a bone of contention for trump and for american businesses one third of whom say chinese firms have stolen from them at some point in the past decade at a cost of between 225 billion and 600 billion annually according to the office of the u s trade representative china needs to step up efforts in reform and opening up and carry out more policies in respecting and treating foreign companies and chinese companies as equal to create a better business environment said wei jianguo a former vice minister of commerce and the vice president of china international economic exchange center a government think tank the escalation of tariffs comes as the global economy faces the possibility of a downturn after picking up in 2016 and 2017 with investment and manufacturing stagnating economists generally define a global recession as when growth falls below 2 percent the imf is forecasting 3 6 percent for 2020 which is out of the danger zone but significantly below the 4 percent seen in 2017 so an economic cease fire between the two sides could be a much needed boost if there is suddenly a resolution of the trade problem then you could see a very substantial improvement pryce said i don t think it s a very happy environment at the moment

by just in time for the 2020 presidential election the democrats have discovered that there is real economic inequality in the united states but they have not yet fully addressed the role that the democratic party and its leaders have played in creating this vast inequality that led to the election of president donald trump in 2016 the presidential candidates have been slow to fully recognize the role that former president bill clinton s globalization policies nafta and wto played in the outsourcing of american jobs or the lowering of wages for workers as the democratic presidential debates have shown vice president biden is having a hard time defending his long public record especially as an opponent of federally mandated forced busing to integrate our public schools decades after the supreme court s overturning of racial segregation in brown v board of education 1954 as a senator joe biden was a free trade advocate as well but senator biden played a large role in creating inequality in two additional realms he was a strong backer of a 2005 bankruptcy reform law that made it harder for people to file personal bankruptcy and to wipe out all of their debts given that perhaps as many as fifty percent of all personal bankruptcies in america are caused by debt incurred from health care not covered by insurance this was an especially cruel blow to those seeking relief from their heavy debt loads senator warren has already criticized biden for his support of this bill the twenty year argument between joe biden and elizabeth warren over bankruptcy explained in lock the s o b s up joe biden and the era of mass incarceration the new york times documents his decades long support of tough on criminals legislation culminating in the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act this bill signed into law by president clinton has been blamed for the jailing of high numbers of african americans and other minorities in particular unlike the republicans whose goal is to increase inequality by lowering taxes on the wealthy at least the democrats seem sincere about reducing it to do this they have fallen all over themselves to offer free college tuition and to reduce student loan debt sen bernie sanders recently proposed to eliminate all student loans entirely why have democrats focused on college as a means of solving economic inequality statistics have shown that in general the more education you have the higher your lifetime earnings will be for example men with bachelor s degrees earn nearly a million more dollars in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates so are the democrats right to try and solve the equality problem by making college more affordable with tuition perhaps free or are these proposals simply the current version of the herbert hoover s 1928 presidential campaign where he literally offered voters a chicken for every pot but before we go spending trillions of dollars on college tuition and eliminating student debt shouldn t we ask what has been driving up the cost of attending college over the past few decades leading to the current lack of affordable college options in his run for re election as vice president in 2012 joe biden made clear that he blamed college professors high salaries for the skyrocketing costs of tuition this was an astonishing charge especially given that his wife has long been a college professor he was immediately admonished by faculty groups around the country faculty groups try to educate biden on salaries john curtis former director of research for the american association of university professors wrote a rebuttal to biden on january 18 2012 he took issue with biden s claim pointing out that full time faculty salaries have been stagnant for a number of years he noted that tuition rates in contrast had risen between three and fourteen times as fast as full time faculty salaries underlining added curtis also cites trends in college spending 1998 2008 by the delta project on postsecondary education costs productivity and accountability which documented decreased spending on college teaching in favor of administration even before the great recession and wrote the common myth that spending on faculty is responsible for continuing cost escalation is not true as curtis notes full time salaries are only one part of the faculty salary picture curtis own research for the aaup published as an appendix to my equality for contingent faculty documents that only twenty five percent of professors now teach on the tenure track and only sixteen percent have tenure seventy five percent of all college professors one million in total teach off the tenure track with fifty percent of all professors teaching part time while free trade agreements encouraged the closing of american factories and the loss of millions of american jobs colleges and universities instituted their own brand of wage theft called by adjunct ron swift inside outsourcing even though the number of students was increasing the colleges staunched the number of well paid secure full time tenure track positions they met rising enrollments by staffing classrooms with contingent faculty who teach off the tenure track without the protections for free speech afforded their tenured brothers and sisters the colleges save money by refusing to pay these contingent professors a living wage in flagrant violation of the principle of equal pay for equal work they are paid on a completely separate and lower pay scale than their full time counterparts are paid for teaching the very same courses they are paid on average only about fifty percent of what a full timer would earn for teaching the same number of courses see my the wal martization of higher education how young professors are getting screwed in other words though women are still paid only 82 percent of what men earn for doing the same work with black men earning only 73 and hispanics only 69 most adjunct professors are paid at most 50 of what tenure track faculty earn for teaching the same course though possessing master s and doctorates and tens of thousands of dollars in student loans these college professors are not being paid for all of the hours they work outside of class preparing lectures grading tests and meeting with students they often do not even have offices their work schedule is capped below full time so they will not qualify for tenure their work varies from quarter to quarter and they are often denied unemployment when they are in fact unemployed the adjuncts and other contingent professors usually do not have any health insurance or retirement benefits in the ph d now comes with food stamps the chronicle of higher education has documented hundreds of thousands of people with graduate degrees receiving some form of public assistance many of them contingent faculty the treatment between the two tiers is so disparate that i have called it faculty apartheid because the tenure track few control and dominate the contingent many indeed the tenured faculty often serve as the direct supervisors of the contingents i have called the kind of discrimination that exists in higher education tenurism the baseless but widespread stereotype that the tenured faculty are superior and warrant higher pay and better treatment and than the non tenure track faculty see my against tenurism in an interview with shankar vedantam on the npr show the hidden brain raj chetty a harvard economist who has done research on inequality in education says the best solution is to have the best teachers in american classrooms but we are far from that solution with the majority of the u s higher education teaching force earning much less than the vaunted 15 an hour minimum wage recommended by nearly all of the democratic candidates these contingent faculty are apprentices to nowhere with little realistic hope of escaping the academic ghetto as the contingents far outnumber the dwindling number of tenure track professors but don t the democrats have a tight relation with the faculty unions american association of university professors american federation of teachers and the national education association yes they do but the unions themselves have collectively bargained the contingents into poverty and income insecurity the two tier system exists within the unions too which have long been run by and for the tenure track faculty these unions clearly have not apprised the democrats of these inequalities let alone insist they solve them will the democrats insist that these unions upon whom they are so dependent for money and campaign workers treat all of their members equally or will they continue to look the other way in order to keep union money flowing into their campaign coffers will the democrats insist that these colleges upon whom they wish to build an equal society treat their professors equally and offer them the same opportunities for a better life that they are offering their students if politicians are going to solve a problem they must first have a clear diagnosis before offering a treatment before the democrats spend tax money on free tuition and paying off student loans they need to acknowledge the income disparity among the professoriate and make solving it an equal priority keith hoeller is the co founder of the washington part

surveys a sharp drop in a gauge of prices paid by manufacturers could be yet another reason for the federal reserve to consider cutting interest rates this month the u s central bank last month signaled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation as well as growing risks to the economy from u s china trade tensions manufacturing is clearly taking it on the chin from the rising trade uncertainty said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the institute for supply management ism said its index of national factory activity dropped to 51 7 last month the lowest reading since october 2016 from 52 1 in may it was the third straight monthly decline in the index a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector which accounts for about 12 percent of the u s economy economists polled by reuters had forecast the ism index would fall to 51 0 in june the ism said businesses expressed concern about u s china trade turbulence they were also spooked by potential tariffs on mexican imports which were averted at the eleventh hour the united states bitter trade war with china has hurt business sentiment that together with disruptions to supply chains caused by import tariffs is weighing on manufacturing u s president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping on saturday agreed to a trade truce and a return to talks but trump said he was in no hurry to cut a deal and chinese state media warned there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached trump in may raised import tariffs on 200 billion in chinese goods prompting beijing to retaliate slowing economy manufacturing is also taking a hit from an inventory overhang which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers a reduction in the production of boeing s max 737 aircraft which was grounded in march after two fatal plane crashes in five months is also a drag on activity the weakness in factory activity is in sync with a slowdown in economic growth following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory consumer spending is rising moderately while the pace of job and wage growth has slowed in addition the housing market is struggling and the goods trade deficit widened in may the ism s forward looking new orders sub index decreased 2 7 points to a reading of 50 0 last month the lowest reading since december 2015 a measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled 5 3 points to 47 9 but there were some glimmers of hope for manufacturing factories reported hiring more workers which included replacing retiring workers and adding summer help the survey s factory employment gauge rose to 54 5 from 53 7 in may that pointed to a moderate pickup in manufacturing payrolls in june after they were almost flat in may it also suggested an improvement in overall job growth last month after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 75 000 in may the government is scheduled to publish june s employment report on friday suppliers deliveries are improving while a measure of inventories contracted for the first time since december 2017 with many manufacturers saying they continued to align stocks with softening demand more customers viewed inventories as too low which could lead to some increase in orders stocks on wall street were trading higher with the s p 500 index hitting an all time high as technology stocks gained on a likely reprieve for chinese telecoms company huawei the dollar rose against a basket of currencies but u s treasury prices fell despite the persistent weakness u s manufacturing is in relatively better shape compared to the rest of the world reports on monday showed factory activity shrinking across much of europe and asia the ism said 12 industries including machinery computer and electronic products textile mills furniture and electrical equipment appliances and components reported growth last month apparel and transportation equipment were among the five industries reporting a contraction computer and electronic products manufacturers complained that china tariffs and pending mexico tariffs are wreaking havoc with supply chains and costs and described the situation as crazy transportation equipment manufacturers said demand for the remainder of 2019 has softened significantly due to issues in the aerospace industry while manufacturers worst fears about an all out trade war with china developing imminently have been allayed uncertainty about the structure of future trading relations continues to linger said sarah house a senior economist at wells fargo securities in charlotte north carolina we suspect factory activity will continue to struggle in the second half of the year a separate report from the commerce department on monday showed construction spending declined 0 8 in may the biggest drop since last november after rising 0 4 in april construction spending surged in the first quarter boosted by

tien shan gold belt which extends from uzbekistan into tajikistan kyrgyzstan and western china and which hosts a number of multi million ounce gold deposits cng is currently in a commissioning phase with mining contractors on site finalising construction of the mine plant tailings dam and refinery about tajikistan tajikistan is a secular republic located in central asia the country is a member of the commonwealth of independent states and the shanghai cooperation organisation tajikistan hosts numerous operating precious metal mines as well as the largest aluminium smelter in central asia cng s management team has extensive experience in the mining industry in tajikistan the information contained within this announcement is deemed by the company to constitute inside information under the market abuse regulation eu no 596 2014 ceo s statement as ceo it gives me great pleasure to present the ceo s statement of the annual report for the year ended 31 december 2018 with the full cooperation of the construction companies designers and equipment suppliers the construction of the mine site at the pakrut gold project was successfully completed at the end of 2018 with us 17 9m revenue being generated from trial production in the period following the successful completion of infrastructure and construction works at the mine site the pakrut gold project entered full operation in 2019 and is currently producing at levels of 2 000 tons per day this marks a new chapter for the group as it becomes an important gold producer in tajikistan and brings steady cash flows to support the sustainable development of the company construction 2018 was a critical year for the pakrut gold mine the flotation tailings pond filling station mine camp and underground ventilation system all of which began construction after the snowfall damage were successfully completed and commissioned at the end of 2018 meaning that the construction works surrounding the pakrut gold project were finalised and it has been possible to commence full production in 2019 operation through the joint efforts of company staff the pakrut gold mine produced the first gold since the suspended production in 2017 as a result of the snowfall disaster in 2018 from trial production a total of 268 200 tons of ore were processed at a grade of 2 18 g t 9 030 tons of gold concentrate were produced at a grade of 63 58 g t 451 46kg of gold bullion were poured with a comprehensive recovery rate of 80 89 this achievement was hard won because both construction and trial production for pakrut gold project were carried out at the same time in 2018 to ensure that the group could enter full production in 2019 full production commenced at the start of 2019 and from january to april 2019 186 800 tons of ore were processed 5 325 tons of gold concentrate were produced the recovery rate of processing was 86 77 the recovery rate of smelting was 87 3 and the output of gold ingots was 350kg revenue to april 2019 is us 12 5m and gross margin for the same period is 31 14 financial results as progress on the pakrut project moved towards completion during the year expenditure continued to be incurred by the group on development and construction work and as at 31 december 2018 the value of mines under construction stood at us 397 876 955 2017 us 331 160 369 administration expenditure was us 6 371 750 2017 us 5 084 991 the main reason for the increase is due to higher local taxes paid in tajikistan during 2018 as a result of increases in subsoil taxes the overall loss incurred by the group was us 4 483 499 2017 us 15 036 884 the reduced loss is mainly as a result of the 2017 impairment to mines under construction of us 10 702 895 in addition in the current year other income of us 2 8 million 2017 us nil has been generated being compensation from the insurance provider following the snowfall disaster in early 2017 during the course of the year the group signed financing agreements with cnmc international capitals company limited ⅱ an associate of china nonferrous metals international mining co ltd for a loan facility of usd 90 million cnmc loan the time limits on the loan contracts previously signed with china national capital international co ltd china nonferrous metals international mining co ltd and china nonferrous metals mining group co ltd were extended to december 2019 in july 2018 cnmc and china national economic trade co ltd signed an agreement transferring one of the loans of us 20 million to china nonferrous mining group co ltd to zhongse economic and trade co ltd which constitutes a related party under the aim rules for companies in 2018 the group repaid a loan of us 35 million to china construction bank corporation macau branch the existing ccbc loan facility of us 85 million and the cnmc and cnmim loan facilities of us 260 million amounted to us 345 million in total of loans payable as at 31 december 2018 of this us 163 million is payable within one year of the financial statements which includes us 10 million due to ccbc and the remaining balance due to shareholders the ccbc loan is due for repayment in march 2021 events after the reporting period in january 2019 the group drew down us 20 million on a us 30 million loan facility with china construction bank corporation macau branch the contract was signed in november 2018 but at that time there was no withdrawal as mentioned earlier in order to ensure the repayment of existing loans a broader refinancing is required discussions are ongoing and with the signing of the new loan agreement the remaining discussions are expected to be completed in the near term the group has now entered full production and this should enable sufficient working capital to be raised as previously announced to ensure repayment of the existing facilities as they fall due a wider refinancing will be required outlook with the completion of mine construction and improvement of technology the pakrut gold mine has now entered into full production and the annual revenue target of ore is expected to increase based on normal operations in 2019 the group is currently continuing to enhance its production capacity and intends to double this capacity by 2021 whilst improving production the group is also focusing on perfecting and improving the smelting process by reducing production costs increasing recovery rates and improving competitiveness the group has long been dedicated to becoming a significant gold producer in central asia and participating in the belt and road initiative with the substantial support and advantages of major shareholders the group has also established a strong relationship with the government of tajikistan and other central asian countries and is well positioned to potentially gain more gold resources and gold mines so as to create greater benefits for its shareholders in the future i would like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees management and advisors for their continued efforts in 2018 and thank our shareholders for their continued support i very much look forward to updating our shareholders further on the mine developments

s operations expose it to a number of financial risks principally the availability of adequate funding movements in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates continuous monitoring of these risks ensures that the group is protected against any adverse effects of such risks so far as it is possible and foreseeable market risk a cash flow and interest rate risk the continued operation of the group is dependent on the ability to raise sufficient working capital until commencement of commercial production the group currently finances itself through the issue of equity share capital and the secured loan facilities from cnmim cnmc and ccb management monitors its cash and future funding requirements through the use of cash flow forecasts all cash not immediately required for working capital purposes is held on short term deposit the group s exposure to interest rate fluctuations on cash balances is restricted to the rate earned on these short term deposits at the year end the group had cash reserves of us 20 786 held in a sterling deposit account a 0 25 change to the interest rate would give rise to a us 52 increase or decrease in interest on this deposit on an annual basis the group s interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings the group has both variable and fixed rate borrowings borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash invested at variable rates the annual fixed interest rate for the cnmim loan is 9 for all usd and rmb denominated tranches all payments of principal and interest in respect of the rmb denominated tranche are repayable at a fixed rmb usd exchange rate the interest rate on the ccb loan is 2 10 per annum over the quarterly libor rate and the loan is repayable in us the interest rate on the new cnmc loan of us 90 million is fixed at 5 8 per annum calculated and paid on a half yearly basis the interest rate on all other cnmc loans is a fixed annual interest rate of 4 on the amount drawn down payable in arrears at 31 december 2018 if interest rates on variable rate borrowings at that date had been 0 25 higher lower with other variables held constant the recalculated loss for the year would be us 9 978 higher lower due to the higher lower interest expense b foreign currency risk the group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from currency exposures currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates the group has cash assets denominated in uk sterling united states dollars tajik somoni and prc renminbi and incurs liabilities for its working capital expenditure in all of these denominations primarily tajik somoni payments are made in all of these denominations at the pre agreed price and converted if necessary as soon as payment needs to occur currency conversions and provisions for expenditure are only made as soon as debts are due and payable the group is therefore exposed to currency risk in so far as its liabilities are incurred in uk sterling prc renminbi and tajik somoni and fluctuations occur due to changes in the exchange rates against the functional and presentational currency of us dollar the table below details the split of the cash held as at 31 december 2018 between the various currencies somoni gbp sterling us dollar renminbi total us 000 1 098 31 7 142 92 8 363 the group manages this risk by matching receipts and payments and monitoring movements in exchange rates the group does not currently hedge its exposure to foreign currencies and recognises the profits and losses resulting from currency fluctuations as and when they arise at the year end the group did not have material exposure to foreign exchange risk relating to its non us denominated bank deposits and as such this not disclosed 1 financial risk management continued liquidity risk and credit risk the continued operation of the group is dependent on the ability to raise sufficient working capital as noted above the group currently finances itself through the issue of equity and borrowings from cnmim cnmc and ccb management monitors its cash and future funding requirements through the use of cash flow forecasts the group enters into capital commitments for exploration and construction expenditure and any surplus cash not immediately required for working capital purposes is held on short term deposit the table below summarises the maturity profile of the group s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments less than 1 year us 000 between 1 and 2 years us 000 between 2 and 5 years us 000 over 5 years us 000 total us 000 carrying

knowledge and past experience in the particular jurisdiction capital risk management the group consider equity to be their capital the group s objective when managing their capital is to safeguard the group s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and to enable the group to continue its exploration evaluation and mine construction the group holds debt in the form of both shareholder and external loans and defines capital based on the total equity of the company except for the secured loan facilities from cnmim cnmc and ccb the group s current policy for raising capital is through equity issues and debt financing the group is not currently required to monitor its gearing ratio and is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements 2 critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are set out below estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on management s experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods the group has identified the following areas where significant estimates assumptions and judgments are required the most significant judgment for the group is the assumption that exploration and development at its sites will ultimately lead to a commercial mining operation failure to do so could lead to impairment of the mine estimated impairment of mines under construction note 11 the group tests annually whether exploration evaluation and licensing assets and mines under construction have suffered any impairment the recoverable amounts of the cash generating units cgus have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions such as long term commodity prices gold recovery rates discount rates operating costs and therefore expected margins future capital requirements and mineral resource estimates see below these estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty and therefore there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will impact the recoverable amount management has assessed its cgus as being individual exploration and mine sites which is the lowest level for which cash inflows are independent of those of other assets or cgus in assessing the carrying amounts of its exploration evaluation and licensing assets and mines under construction at pakrut the directors have used an independently prepared and director approved bankable feasibility study the period used in management s assessment is the anticipated life of the mine to the expiration of the license in 2030 with revenues being generated from full production from january 2019 gold revenues have been estimated over that period at a price of us 1 300 these estimates are based on and are consistent with external sources of information the calculation assumes a mining capacity of 2 000 tonnes of ore daily increasing to 4 000 tonnes per day the total cost per ounce is estimated to be around us 650 with a gross margin of circa 60 royalties have been calculated at 6 of sales revenues and corporate income tax at 15 according to the relevant laws in tajikistan a discount rate of 10 has been utilised the calculations have been tested for sensitivity to changes in the key assumptions the most sensitive inputs in the calculation of the value in use are operating costs the gold price and the discount rate an impairment to the mine value would occur if the discount rate were to increase to 12 gold prices fell by 1 or costs were to increase by 1 2 critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments continued approval of pakrut reserves by tajik department of geology in november 2011 the government of the republic of tajikistan issued the pakrut gold project mining license to llc pakrut according to the terms of the license the amount of ore that can be mined is variable depending upon the mine plan the plan submitted by the group envisages an initial processing capacity of 660 000 tons of ore per annum increasing to 1 320 000 tons per annum the mining license is valid until 2 november 2030 the mining license issued in november 2011 currently entitles the group to mine jorc compliant resources measured indicated and inferred of 904 000 ounces out of total jorc compliant resources of 4 383 000 ounces at pakrut excluding the eastern pakrut rufigar and sulfidnoye ore zones the jorc compliant resources include the results from the group s exploration and evaluation work subsequent to the mining license issue date llc pakrut has sought approval of the increased jorc compliant resources from the tajik department of geology and the scientific and technical counsel which includes the results of all exploration and evaluation activities undertaken by the group between 2009 and 2013 the application is currently subject to that approval process and the directors are not aware of any legal or other impediments which would prevent approval of their application and therefore permit the group to mine the increased resources however the approval process currently remains incomplete the mine design and construction work undertaken to date together with the assessment of the recoverable amount of mines under construction see below is based upon the total quantity of jorc compliant resources of which part falls outside the area covered by the mining license and still subject to formal approval as noted above failure to obtain this approval would lead to an impairment of mines under construction together with inventories and also impact the going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements the group has made the judgement that this approval will be forthcoming no provision for impairment has been recognised in these financial statements relating to this uncertainty mineral resource and reserve estimates reserves are estimates of the amount of resources that can be economically and legally extracted from the group s mining properties the group estimates its mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size depth shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates this analysis requires complex geological judgments to interpret the data the estimation of the recoverable amount is based upon factors such as estimates of commodity prices future capital expenditure and production costs along with geological assumptions made in estimating the size and grade of the resources details of the mineral resources and reserve estimates can be found on www cnfgold com the group estimates and reports mineral resource estimates in line with the principles contained in the australasian code for reporting exploration results mineral resources and ore reserves december 2004 which is prepared by the joint ore reserves committee jorc of the australasian institute of mining and metallurgy

payments can happen cheaply and easily without banks or credit card companies this has now been demonstrated not in the united states but in china unlike in the u s where numerous firms feast on fees from handling and processing payments in china most money flows through mobile phones nearly for free in 2018 these cashless payments totaled a whopping 41 5 trillion and 90 were through alipay and wechat pay a pair of digital ecosystems that blend social media commerce and banking according to a may 2018 article in bloomberg titled why china s payment apps give u s bankers nightmares the nightmare for the u s financial industry is that a technology company whether from china or a homegrown juggernaut such as amazon com inc or facebook inc replicates the success of alipay and wechat in america the stakes are enormous potentially carving away billions of dollars in annual revenue from major banks and other firms that threat may now be materializing on june 18 facebook unveiled a white paper outlining ambitious plans to create a new global cryptocurrency called libra to be launched in 2020 the new york times says facebook has high hopes that libra will become the foundation for a new financial system free of control by wall street power brokers and central banks but apparently libra will not be competing with visa or mastercard in fact the libra association lists those two giants among its 28 soon to be founding members others include paypal stripe uber lyft and ebay facebook has reportedly courted dozens of financial institutions and other tech companies to join the libra association an independent foundation that will contribute capital and help govern the digital currency entry barriers are high with each founding member paying a minimum of 10 million to join this gives them one vote or 1 of the total vote whichever is larger in the libra association council members are also entitled to a share proportionate to their investment of the dividends earned from interest on the libra reserve the money that users will pay to acquire the libra currency all of which has raised some eyebrows both among financial analysts and crypto activists a zero hedge commentator calls libra facebook s crypto trojan rabbit an article in ft s alphaville calls it blockchain but without the blocks or chain economist noriel roubini concurs tweeting it will start as a private permissioned not trustless centralized oligopolistic members only club so much for calling it blockchain t is blockchain in name only and a monopoly to extract massive seignorage from billions of users a monopoly scam another zero hedge writer calls libra the dollar s killer app which threatens not only the power of central banks but also the government s money monopoly itself from frying pan to fire to the crypto anarchist community usurping the power of central banks and governments may sound like a good thing but handing global power to the corporate controlled libra association could be a greater nightmare so argues facebook co founder chris hughes who writes in the financial times this currency would insert a powerful new corporate layer of monetary control between central banks and individuals inevitably these companies will put their private interests profits and influence ahead of public ones the libra association s goals specifically say that will encourage decentralised forms of governance in other words libra will disrupt and weaken nation states by enabling people to move out of unstable local currencies and into a currency denominated in dollars and euros and managed by corporations what libra backers are calling decentralisation is in truth a shift of power from developing world central banks toward multinational corporations and the u s federal reserve and the european central bank power will shift to the fed and ecb because the dollar and the euro will squeeze out weaker currencies in developing countries as seen recently in greece the result will be to cause their governments to lose control of their currencies and their economies pros and cons in a june 9 review in forbes caitlin long co founder of the wyoming blockchain coalition agreed that libra was a trojan horse but predicted that it would have some beneficial effects for one she thought it would impose discipline on the u s banking system by leading to populist calls to repeal their corporate subsidies the fed is now paying its member banks 2 35 in risk free interest on their excess reserves which this year is projected to total 36 billion of corporate welfare to u s banks about half the sum spent on the u s food stamp program if facebook parks its entire u s dollar balance at the federal reserve through one of its bank partners it could earn the same rate but long predicted that facebook would have to pay interest to libra users to avoid a chorus of critics who would loudly publicize how much money facebook and its partners were pocketing from the interest on the money users traded for their libra currency but that was before the libra white paper came out it reveals that the profits will indeed be divvied among facebook s libra partners rather than shared with users at one time we earned interest on our deposits in government insured banks with libra we will get no interest on our money which will be entrusted to uninsured crypto exchanges which are coming under increasing regulatory pressure due to lack of transparency and operational irregularities u k economics professor alistair milne points to another problem with the libra cryptocurrency unlike bitcoin it will be a stablecoin whose value will be tied to a basket of fiat currencies and short term government securities that means it will need the backing of real money to maintain its fixed price if reserves do not cover withdrawals who will be responsible for compensating libra holders ideally milne writes reserves would be held with the central bank but central banks will be reluctant to support a private currency caitlin long also predicts that facebook s cryptocurrency will be a huge honeypot of data for government officials since every transaction will be traceable but other reviewers see this as libra s most fatal flaw facebook has been called big brother the ultimate government surveillance tool facebook has already demonstrated that it is an untrustworthy manager of personal data how then can we trust it with our money why use a cryptocurrency at all a june 20 coindesk article asks why facebook has chosen to use a cryptocurrency rather than following wechat and alipay in doing a global payments network in the traditional way the article quotes yan meng vice president of the chinese software developer network who says facebook s fragmented user base across the world leaves it with no better choice than to borrow ideas from blockchain and cryptocurrency facebook just can t do a global payments network via traditional methods which require applying for a license and preparing foreign exchange reserves with local banking one market after another said meng the advantage of wechat and alipay is they have already gained a significant number of users from just one giant economy that accounts for 20 percent of the world s population they have no need to establish their own digital currencies which they still regard as too risky meng suspects that facebook s long term ambition is to become a stateless central bank that uses libra as a base currency he wrote in a june 16 article with sufficient incentives nodes of facebook s libra network would represent facebook to push for utility in various countries for its 2 7 billion users in business investment trade and financial services which would help complete a full digital economy empire the question is whether regulators will allow that sort of competition with the central banking system immediately after facebook released its libra cryptocurrency plan financial regulators in europe voiced concerns over the potential danger of facebook running a shadow bank maxine waters who heads the financial services committee for the u s house of representatives asked facebook to halt its development of libra until hearings could be held she said this is like starting a bank without having to go through any steps to do it we can t allow facebook to go to switzerland and begin to compete with the dollar without having any regulatory regime that s dealing with them a stateless private central bank or a publicly accountable one facebook may be competing with more than the dollar jennifer grygiel assistant professor of communications at syracuse university writes it seems that the company is not seeking to compete with bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies rather facebook is looking to replace the existing global financial system with an all new setup with libra at its center at least at the moment the libra is being designed as a form of electronic money linked to many national currencies that has raised fears that libra might someday be recognized as a sovereign currency with facebook acting as a shadow bank that could compete with the central banks of countries around the world caitlin long thinks bitcoin rather than libra will come out the winner in all this but bitcoin s blockchain model is too slow expensive and energy intensive to replace fiat currency as a medium of exchange on a national scale as josh constine writes on techcrunch com existing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum weren t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings making it tough for merchants to accept as payment and cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars but with facebook s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess it was well poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem for libra to scale as a national medium of exchange its governance had to be centralized rather than distributed but libra s governing body is not the sort of global controller we want jennifer grygiel writes facebook ceo mark zuckerberg is declaring that he wants facebook to become a virtual nation populated by users powered by a self contained economy and headed by a ceo zuckerberg himself who is not even accountable to his shareholders in many ways the company that mark zuckerberg is building is beginning to look more like a roman empire now with its own central bank and currency than a corporation the only problem is that this new nation like platform is a controlled company and is run more like a dictatorship than a sovereign country with democratically elected leaders a currency intended for trade on a national let alone international scale needs to be not only centralized but democratized responding to the will of the people and their elected leaders rather than bypassing the existing central banking structure as facebook plans to do several groups of economists are proposing a more egalitarian solution nationalizing and democratizing the central bank by opening its deposit window to everyone as explored in my latest book banking on the people democratizing money in the digital age these proposals could allow us all to get 2 35 on our deposits while eliminating bank runs and banking crises since the central bank cannot run out of funds profits from the public medium of exchange need to return to the public rather than enriching an unaccountable corporate controlled facebook trojan horse before you go truthout faces a serious threat after 22 years of

winning power s highest honor is a set of three gas fired power plants and related infrastructure the egypt megaproject which was the single biggest order ever in siemens long history completed in a record setting 27 5 months from financial closure the three plants added 14 4 gw to egypt s power grid heaving the country away from persistent power shortages that would have crippled industrial growth and setting it firmly en route to long term power security like many countries in the middle east and africa egypt s power supply has been somewhat unreliable over the years with scattered unplanned outages due to increased demand from its growing population although egypt is a large producer of oil and gas the sector along with the rest of the nation s economy suffered from an energy crisis after the country s revolution in 2011 frequent blackouts in egypt lessened investment interest from other countries government officials knew they needed to incentivize foreign investment to grow oil and gas production a first step to restore the nation s economy and they needed strong international partners to help finance and build new power generation infrastructure during egypt s economic development conference in march 2015 siemens and the egyptian government reached firm agreements to support the country in its mission to develop a reliable and sustainable power supply in june that year siemens and its consortium partners signed contracts worth 6 billion for high efficiency natural gas fired power plants designed to boost egypt s power generation capacity by more than 40 compared to the country s installed base in 2015 together with elsewedy electric and orascom construction siemens was invited to design supply and deliver three combined cycle power plants in beni suef to service upper egypt new capital to energize the new administrative center east of cairo and the strategic area at new suez canal development zone and burullus to supply the nile delta and the mediterranean coast siemens financial services structured the financing package for siemens role in the contracts including a tailored guarantee concept the envisaged loan facilities supported to a large extent by coverage from two export credit agencies in germany and italy were provided by international and regional banks while siemens was tasked with the engineering supplying and delivering of the egyptian megaproject on a turnkey basis many other companies and government partners would also play key roles siemens formed consortiums with elsewedy electric for the beni suef plant and with orascom construction for the burullus and new capital plants both egyptian based partners would perform admirably in bringing the projects to completion in record setting time of 27 5 months from financial closure leveraging industry expertise crucial to their selection for the megaproject was that both elsewedy and orascom had garnered the necessary expertise and experience to complete a task of this magnitude and urgency when egypt adopted its fast track power plan in december 2014 urging grid connection of 3 632 mw before the end of 2015 to avoid debilitating power shortages cairo based multinational conglomerate elsewedy sprang to action erecting the first project of the program the 640 mw attaqa power plant in suez city in a record breaking 159 days to help ease the summer demand surge attaqa was a power top plant in 2016 global engineering and construction contractor orascom had also already been heavily involved in helping egypt achieve its ambitions to nearly double its capacity over a sparse five year timeframe among orascom s notable fast track projects are two simple cycle power plants in assiut and west damietta a total of 1 500 mw which it delivered in under eight months in 2015 and which it has since converted to combined cycle to boost their total capacity to 2 250 mw since 2015 orascom has added more than 12 gw to the national grid as an engineering procurement and construction contractor yet elsewedy electric group legal director mahmoud sharaawy described his company s 820 million share of the project putting up the 12 turbines at beni suef as a massive undertaking that required deliberate and precise organization one aspect that helped speed along the project was clarity about expectations said sharaawy elsewedy s scope of work included engineering procurement site preparation leveling civil works installation of balance of plant equipment as well as installation of the siemens turbines the company spent two months negotiating agreements and technical parameters of each unit at the beni suef site with siemens and egypt talks which culminated in a final agreement in june 2015 and set the stunning two year timeframe we finalized everything in less than three years sharaawy pointed out adding supposedly these types of plants take four to five years at beni suef 6 000 workers toiled day and night to meet the tight schedule amassing a stunning 22 million hours those were safe working hours he stressed orascom too wielded its vast expertise to get new capital and burullus built on time and it echoed elsewedy s focus on safety we achieved over 90 million man hours on the burullus and new capital power plants combined the company told power key to project completion was a proactive and strong team that was able to look ahead and forecast any issues that could arise resulting in an efficient risk management approach it said mega equipment each of the three sites consists of four blocks each block has two siemens sgt5 8000 h class gas turbines figure 1 one steam turbine figure 2 three generators two heat recovery steam generators hrsgs three transformers figure 3 and associated auxiliary equipment each site exports power up to 4 8 gw to the grid through a 500 kv gas insulated switchgear 1 a total of 24 siemens sgt5 8000 h class gas turbines were supplied for the egyptian megaproject this image shows one of the gas turbines being placed into position at the beni suef site courtesy siemens 2 in addition to gas turbines the combined cycle power plant design used on the egyptian megaproject includes one steam turbine for each block in this image a low pressure steam turbine rotor is being placed in its casing at the beni suef site courtesy siemens 3 as part of the egyptian megaproject siemens supplied transformers not only for the three power plants but also for six substations courtesy siemens siemens h class gas turbine operates at more than 61 efficiency in combined cycle mode the high efficiency translates into significant fuel savings and reduced emissions compared to many other units available on the market the egyptian plants mainly rely on natural gas as their fuel sources but one module at each facility is dual fuel capable with fuel oil used as a backup energy source the equipment was sourced from various manufacturing facilities around the world the gas turbines came from siemens berlin germany factory while the steam turbines originated at the company s plant in mülheim germany some of the generators were sourced from mülheim while others shipped from siemens charlotte energy hub in north carolina nem energy b v a siemens company supplied the vertical triple pressure reheat once through hrsgs for the megaproject from its south korea manufacturing plant the relatively light weight hrsg design allows fast and flexible startups with a small footprint each boiler contains 24 modules and approximately 14 000 single tubes each around 20 meters in length challenging terrain although the three plants are designed similarly certain aspects were affected by local factors beni suef is located on the west bank of the nile river in upper egypt about 110 kilometers km from cairo new capital is located about 45 km east of greater cairo near a new city that egypt is building from scratch to ease congestion and overcrowding in cairo the city will ultimately house a new presidential palace a new parliament building a central bank business district and airport burullus meanwhile is situated about 200 km north of cairo because beni suef is located on the nile river and burullus is on the mediterranean sea water for cooling purposes was not a major concern at those plants however the new capital facility is located in the desert where water is scarce therefore an air cooled condenser the largest of its kind in the world was incorporated into that plant the topography of the beni suef site posed some unique challenges the plant was built on a hilltop which required the excavation of about 1 75 million cubic meters of hard rock over five months you can imagine it as equivalent to the size of a small egyptian pyramid dalia abou el seoud siemens deputy director for the megaproject told power it s huge to account for the 40 meter slope from the nile to the highest level the site was terraced with the plant placed at the top and the water treatment plant nearer to the river it s actually a very panoramic and picturesque power plant she said at beni suef elsewedy also spent four months backfilling four more months reinforcing concrete five months completing the steel structures and three months installing open cycle piping burullus also faced extreme challenges owing to difficult site conditions the project is located near lake burullus a brackish water lake in the nile delta a remote site that required additional complex geotechnical engineering with significantly greater soil improvement and piling work than expected orascom said orascom also chose to run the plant s cooling pipelines below ground and under the sea which required building an immense marine and water intake structure in the open sea developers opted for the design aspect over easier alternatives because it was integral to shoreline preservation mega logistics shipping heavy loads from factory to site was as cumbersome to ship the gas turbines each weighing 445 tons from berlin to beni suef for example involved a complicated three month process the turbines were transported on a special 192 wheel vehicle figure 4 from the assembly hall to a 250 meter long loading bay where they were placed on a heavy cargo shuttle the transport route passed through the residential area of berlin moabit requiring police to stop traffic for a short while 4 moving h class gas turbines which weigh 445 tons is no small task the special 192 wheel vehicle shown here was used for one portion of the journey from the factory in berlin germany to each plant site in egypt cranes ships and other heavy cargo shuttles were also used along the way courtesy siemens the heavy cargo shuttle was used to move the gas turbines via waterways through parts of berlin to westhafen the city s western harbor at berlin westhafen the equipment was hoisted from the cargo shuttles onto barges for transport to either rotterdam netherlands or hamburg germany once there the gas turbines were loaded onto heavy load carrier ships using onboard cranes the ships traveled to the mediterranean sea across the strait of gibraltar the cargo passed through the suez canal and arrived at the destination port of adabiya on the red sea a 40 axle trailer then transported the turbines the rest of the way traveling the 250 km route along the nile to beni suef in about five days we had some great support from the government as this was a national project which facilitated lots of logistics challenges said abou el seoud however it was not an easy job because we had to coordinate to get the different equipment from all over the world transporting equipment to other sites was similarly difficult in fact the burullus site offered additional challenges burullus is hard to reach so we had to build a fishing port in burullus in order to accommodate big vessels and to get the big machines inside the country without having to build up new roads abou el seoud said recruiting and training a main focus of the egyptian megaproject was not only bridging the country s energy gap but also contributing to the egyptian society by educating people and preparing them for sophisticated high level technical jobs construction projects are quite common in egypt so a fairly large pool of qualified construction workers was available to draw from however more than 24 000 workers would eventually be needed at the three sites during the peak of construction so getting ramped up was no small task at elsewedy and orascom sourcing manpower and talent was fairly routine owing to the companies separate work pools from other egyptian projects we used mainly subcontractors in addition to our human resources team and people living in beni suef said sharaawy both companies noted that work culture is also founded on safety protocols and procedures nonetheless the industrial safety culture in egypt was different from what siemens was used to in other countries safety was always an integral part of whatever measures that we do on the ground ahmed el saadany head of siemens professional education for the middle east and africa region told power so the company added a step to enhance safety performance and ensure it met expectations we had built up for each of the power plants a full training center including simulators on different safety hazard situations and use of personal protective equipment el saadany said siemens then made completion of training at the centers a prerequisite for site entry that went a long way toward bridging the gap in egyptian and german safety culture there was always this commitment not only to build the power plants but also to train the egyptian people el saadany said the goal was to staff the power plants with egyptian citizens and that meant educating workers to meet siemens high standards figure 5 5 operations and maintenance engineers and technicians received six months of extensive schooling which included technical training on gas turbines as well as courses on safety and other job skills courtesy siemens in the beginning the task of staffing the power plants sounded easy enough egypt has a population of about 100 million people and more than half are under the age of 30 that meant there was a youthful energetic core of reasonably tech savvy recruits waiting to be tapped however finding people who could meet siemens hiring criteria proved to be much more difficult than finding construction workers the company targeted 200 operations and maintenance personnel for each facility making a total of 600 recruits needed like most hiring processes reviewing applications and interviewing candidates took time and many more applicants were rejected than accepted but the mission was ultimately accomplished in order to enable those young egyptians to enhance their professional and vocational competencies while building local experts in the energy industry over the next years siemens has made significant investments to further develop their learning and training capabilities to create a positive long term ripple effect on egypt s society as those who have received the training will pass on their skills to the next generation el saadany said all 600 completed a six month training program divided between egypt and germany furthermore they came back to jobsites for hands on training during the construction as siemens was also awarded an eight year contract for the operation and maintenance of the three power plants the operations and maintenance personnel were hired for the same period sustainably contributing to the country s growth el saadany said but the story doesn t end there siemens worked with germany s federal ministry for economic cooperation and development to broaden societal opportunities by establishing the egyptian german technical academy in ain sokhna egypt not far from the new capital plant the initial goal is to train 5 500 egyptian youth over the next four years siemens aim in creating the academy was to ensure future generations would get the same level of quality education the 600 new hires received without having to leave the country the technical training that was conducted in germany can now be done in egypt and the facility will serve as an educational resource for the entire region and even other industries siemens also helped create a meaningful pathway for technical and vocational education and training in egypt by helping modernize two facilities in the local education system the zein al abedeen school of excellence a technical secondary school now offers a three year basic technical education program that prepares students for a two year program at the higher technical institute located in the el ameriya area of cairo successful graduates may eventually take industry specific gap filler courses at the academy in ain sokhna that was let s say the offspring from this megaproject and power plants el saadany said project management takeaways managing any megaproject is difficult but when a very tight project execution schedule is incorporated it places even more stress on the management team quite many colleagues were questioning whether we at siemens as an organization would be able to execute according to the schedule and also to budget laurenz krause siemens director of projects for the egypt megaproject said in an interview in june with power to streamline the process we received great direct support from the highest management level including joe kaeser who made a promise to the egyptian president that the egyptian people can count on siemens to achieve this mission critical project krause said according to krause the highest attention was given to the avoidance of any delay and to create float in the schedule this you can only achieve together with your extremely committed team taking ownership for all their tasks during project phases which included the engineering construction and commissioning period he said in addition to all this we had outstanding collaboration and trust with our consortium partners like i have never experienced before we also received genuine support from all egyptian stakeholders and i would say that all this beautiful and diverse mix has contributed to the entire megaproject s success in a record breaking time of less than 3 years krause concluded for elsewedy s part sharaawy credited the company s skilled professional management team which accrued valuable experience over varied projects the company connected 1 500 mw of conventional and renewable projects across egypt iraq and jordan last year alone we have good experience and to expedite projects with excellent quality we can say that we have a dream team of finalizing these kinds of projects he said along with the experience we had skilled people we had the empowerment of the government and those are key factors that collected to finalize the project in this way orascom too pointed to experience proactivity and preventative measures for its success stressing these attributes were crucial in forestalling delays that for example typically affect equipment procurement we leveraged our execution experience particularly as a contractor and our ability to raise financing efficiently which is something that we have done in other industries such as cement and fertilizer the company noted a power reinvention perhaps the biggest beneficiaries of the megaproject are egyptians themselves egypt is the most populous country in north africa and the arab region and home to one of the fastest growing populations globally but only 10 years ago it suffered a chronic power shortage of between 20 and 25 that resulted in blackouts and power outages especially during hot summer months affecting residential and industrial areas alike freshly emerging from the political and economic shakeup stemming from the 2011 revolution the government prioritized efforts to bridge the chasm between power demand and supply and sought to address a growing natural gas supply crisis along with urgent measures to scale up infrastructure spending to alleviate the crippling electricity crisis reforms sought to liberalize energy prices and completely eliminate subsidies by 2022 in a bid to pave the way for private companies to engage in power generation which had previously been dominated by state entities the government also rolled out a new energy strategy setting ambitious targets to boost its generating capacity to add 54 gw to its 2015 total installed capacity of 31 34 gw by 2022 and it s already halfway there while the 2014 fast track program added 3 6 gw by 2016 egypt had grid connected an additional 5 6 gw of new capacity and another 1 8 gw from combined cycle conversion projects outside of the fast track program meanwhile since 2014 5 546 km of new lines to bolster the 500 kv transmission network have been added to the grid figure 6 6 thousands of kilometers of power lines and new electrical infrastructure have been added to the egyptian power grid since 2014 including the burullus transmission lines shown here courtesy siemens the three siemens megaproject power plants add another 14 4 gw bringing total capacity added since 2014 to 25 4 gw it means as the head of the administrative control authority mohamed erfan said during a july 2018 inauguration ceremony for the three plants that egypt went from chronic deficit to a 25 capacity surplus in just four years and now it is poised to begin exporting power among its potential power hungry neighbors are sudan cyprus syria and jordan for transforming a nation s power security trajectory from scarcity to abundance and doing it so quickly the megaproject deserves the recognition that this award power s highest honor can confer aaron larson is power s executive editor sonal patel and darrell proctor are power associate editors

some blocks don t have gas then you ve got blocks near haskell street with these itty bitty water lines you also have lines that only go 2 1 2 to 3 feet deep which would be continually problematic it s not a complaint it s just reality it s a reality that intruded on marmot s latest midtown project a duplex apartment made from shipping containers before raydon could start on it the project hit one gigantic obstacle the roots of a towering old locust tree had grown into all the sewer lines underneath the property and were threatening the foundations of the existing buildings we chased roots and roots and more roots said rick potts an employee of contractor twisted metal that tree kicked our ass dealing with that one tree not only cost raydon several months it came with a financial cost as well when raydon started the project he envisioned a complex of four tiny units with rents of 1 000 per month the connection fees and parking requirements for four homes however would have made the project more expensive add the cost of the delays from the tree and raydon decided to construct a duplex with higher rents instead raydon initially targeted each duplex unit to rent out for 1 400 to 1 500 the market rate for the area after the delays and added costs he is now eyeing 1 700 a month instead these will have to be 1 700 because it cost so damn much raydon said we thought a lot about

note is that reno median household incomes fell by 15 from 2008 to 2012 which means the wage increase in the five years that followed is not as big as it seems reno is booming but not all our families are feeling that said reno councilman oscar delgado at a recent groundbreaking event for affordable senior housing the struggle is real for these families part of the huge spike is because the housing market had more ground to make up for after the real estate bubble collapsed the resale market for single family houses lost more than half of its value in january 2006 for example the median price for an existing home in reno sparks reached a then record of 365 000 by january 2012 it was down to 135 000 at the same time an analysis by the reno gazette journal last year found that median household incomes in the area fall short of being able to buy the median home in order to afford a 387 000 house you will need a median household income of 80 000 a year the median household income in the city of reno was 57 125 in 2017 and 61 498 for washoe county which includes sparks and incline village according to the census bureau s acs data story continues below graphic loading reno is not alone home prices are outpacing wages in 40 of u s housing markets according to a report released in june by attom data solutions the same report found that the median priced house also is not affordable for average wage earners in 74 percent of u s housing markets half of america can t qualify for a loan that s one reason you re seeing rents go up so much said glenn kelman ceo of online real estate brokerage firm redfin they are living on the edge kelman added they are scraping every dollar they can get to afford a mortgage and that s what makes the real estate market so volatile right now while opinions vary among developers government officials housing advocates and economic development circles about how to best solve the housing crisis in reno all sides agree on one thing lack of supply is a big factor in the steep increases in house prices the question now is why here s why reno sparks is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis new jobs are fueling housing demand in reno sparks yet the area averaged fewer home permits per year the last 6 years than in the 1980s sam gross jason hidalgo jason bean and benjamin spillman reno gazette journal why are fewer housing permits being issued from 1983 to 2007 washoe county averaged 2 979 building permits for single family homes annually the building frenzy reflected nevada s status as the fastest growing state in the nation in washoe county permits for new homes peaked at 5 809 in 2005 with activity never falling below 1 600 permits per year that all changed in 2008 beginning that year nevada s housing market started tumbling toward an epic collapse by 2011 unemployment in nevada was above 14 the highest in the nation at the time real estate s downward spiral hit nevada s construction sector especially hard by the time the bloodletting was done it lost about 70 of its workforce across the state story continues below graphic loading during the peak of the housing boom in 2005 there were roughly 65 builders operating in washoe county and surrounding areas said don tatro ceo of the builders association of northern nevada by 2015 they were down to 24 even as nevada recovered from the crash and regained its status as the fastest growing state in the nation by 2018 the memory of nevada s historic real estate crash made local builders especially hesitant about ramping up operations according to tatro they got wiped out tatro said we ve seen a lot of consolidation in building and a lot of subcontractors are unwilling to grow he added they don t want to lay off a lot of people like they did in the recession so they ve found a sweet spot of how many employees they want to have and manage at an easier level several other factors are being cited for why new construction is not keeping pace with housing demand rob dietz chief economist of the national association of home builders uses a concept that he calls the five l s labor lumber lending lots and laws to explain the various elements that can impact the cost of building new housing help us investigate important news in our community 1 for 6 months subscribe get news and insights sent to your inbox sign up for email newsletters sign up for developers addressing all those elements can be akin to playing whack a mole according to dietz housing affordability is a really complicated topic dietz said there s no silver bullet that fixes everything brian bonnenfant project manager for the center for regional studies at the university of nevada reno agreed with dietz and says he would add one more l litigation in addition to cases involving construction defects bonnenfant also pointed to a 50 million lawsuit filed against the city of reno by the developers of the proposed 4 700 unit daybreak housing development at the former butler ranch site the developers claim they could lose 100 million after the city denied the project late last year this is a problem with a lot of moving parts bonnenfant said and they all move together and impact construction activity the construction industry is under stress and underemployed when the great recession pulled the rug out from under the building industry many construction workers who lost jobs ended up transitioning to different careers this compounded a longstanding problem in the industry which has been raising concerns about its difficulties in recruiting younger people who do not see construction as a viable or sexy career path groups such as the associated general contractors of america say such issues arise because society prioritizes preparing for a four year college education over skilled trades this focus impacts the education system as well as the types of funding programs available the organization said we need more public officials to understand that the path to a good middle class life doesn t always include attending a four year college and spending a lifetime behind a desk said agc america ceo stephen e sandherr in november as of april 2019 404 000 construction positions were open in the u s in nevada 79 of construction companies reported difficulties hiring hourly craft laborers jason hidalgo earlier this year the department of labor reported that the u s economy as a whole was facing a nationwide labor shortage of more than 1 million workers at the end of january construction is no exemption as of april this year the number of open construction positions totaled 404 000 according to the national association of home builders citing bureau of labor statistics data a report released in september by the agc america found that 4 in 5 construction companies were having a difficult time filling hourly craft positions which make up the bulk of their workforce in nevada 79 of construction companies reported difficulties in hiring hourly craft laborers including laborers carpenters plumbers roofers mechanics concrete workers sheet metal workers truck drivers as the u s economy recovered from the recession and demand for construction ramped up across the country competition for a limited labor pool suddenly became fierce the loss of entire communities from natural disasters and wildfires in recent years further added to the demand for labor as the affected areas needed to be rebuilt according to bonnenfant loading for developers the labor shortage doesn t just lead to delays in building when competing for a limited pool of workers it becomes necessary to pay those laborers even more said john keeling executive vice president of valencia hotel group at the national association of real estate editors 2019 conference in austin in june this is done either to attract workers or prevent existing employees from going elsewhere for higher wages the construction industry is under stress said keeling who described the overall labor situation in the united states as a crushing issue there aren t enough subcontractors you have tariffs on steel general materials are up and then you have rising land costs lumber especially saw plenty of volatility with prices jumping by 31 percent during the first half of 2018 before tumbling down by 35 percent by the end of the year according to analytics firm forest2market meanwhile costs for construction equipment and raw materials such as insulation roofing siding and steel were up overall pricing for asphalt roofing and siding for example rose by 10 9 last year while steel pipe and tubing was up 21 3 according to the bureau of labor statistics although steel prices fell at the start of 2019 trade and tariff disputes are adding uncertainty to the market and making it more difficult to forecast which way material costs will go concerns over a potential economic slowdown have lenders starting to exercise more caution as well with several construction industry indicators such as the dodge momentum index showing signs of a potential slowdown by 2020 risk management is becoming an increased focus for lenders they re not going to put money behind speculative housing bonnenfant said they re going to lend to demand after hitting historic highs in 2018 the reno sparks housing market saw prices stabilize at the end of the year here s what angelica reyes president of the reno sparks association of realtors said to expect at the beginning of 2019 jason hidalgo rgj lenders such as wells fargo are also seeing less appetite for speculative building from builders who remain more cautious and are building based on demand this impacts not just permitting but the number of loan applications for housing projects said stuart brady wells fargo s northern nevada commercial banking manager overall builders are definitely building more cautiously based on demand and that could be contributing to the decline in permitting and traditional residential development commercial lending in reno sparks brady said many of the land transactions are cash or private money for smaller developers such as marmot properties financing or the lack thereof has killed some projects this includes development of a property in midtown reno s haskell street which had issues with aging infrastructure the issues include old water lines which would have required significant financial investment to replace marmot has since sold the property to a connecticut based private equity group we couldn t make the project pencil out with outside investors raydon said we just didn t have the capital lots and laws affect reno most one sore spot frequently mentioned by developers and builders about reno is its confluence of regulations and requirements in some cases there appears to be a disconnect between the city s goals for housing and how some of the regulations are written raydon said the city of reno is really good in a lot of respects but in other respects it s not raydon said they say they want more density but want everybody to have one and a quarter parking spaces they say they want more affordability but they charge the same fees for urban infill projects as they do for resource hogging starter castles they talk from both sides of their mouth sometimes of the five l s that impact construction nothing has engendered more debate between developers and local government than lots and laws part of the challenge is geography with the truckee meadows surrounded by mountains finding new areas to develop is easier said than done lots are in short supply and they re expensive to create bonnenfant said the easy ones where there s infrastructure and capacity for sewer and water are all spoken for for smaller developers like marmot properties financing or the lack thereof has killed some projects jason hidalgo rgj in response developers are starting to look further outward including less geographically desirable areas for construction these places include the former butler ranch site in southeast reno the area was the subject of spirited discussion in recent years after developers proposed a 4 700 unit development called daybreak at the site the reno city council ultimately voted down the project 6 1 in november reasons cited include mercury tainted soil potential traffic and congestion how the area was the community s last remaining natural flood plain ongoing flooding issues at the swan lake community in reno s lemmon valley also served as a cautionary tale even as proponents for development contend that they have the technology to ensure the same issue does not happen in butler ranch the city of reno s decision was criticized not just by developers but some in the economic development community as well back in 2015 president and ceo mike kazmierski of the economic development authority of western nevada sounded the alarm about the greater reno area s upcoming growth and warned that the community will need to build 5 000 new homes per year just to keep up with it at the time kazmierski saw pushback with the housing crash still fresh in builders minds some in the local developer community saw the number as unrealistic today s housing crunch has since validated edawn s forecast which is based on the first economic planning indicator committee or epic study at the end of the day we need more housing and if that means we build on land that s not perfect and engineer solutions for their problems then that s what we need to do kazmierski said we ve got blm land all around us so it s not like we have a bunch of land nearby to expand to another solution being floated by kazmierski and others is more infill and missing middle development missing middle housing refers to buildings that help increase density such as townhouses duplexes and bungalow courts missing middle housing also can be sold at a lower price per unit than a single family home making them a potential option for entry level housing developers however say regulations and increasing fees combined with the cost of development make it tough to build new missing middle projects much less affordable or workforce housing for residents nationwide government regulations account for 24 of costs associated with the development and construction of new homes according to the national association of home builders for multifamily projects the cost goes up to 32 the cost of regulation is not limited to fees but also the time spent just waiting said will holder a professor of practice and construction science management at texas state university and former president of trendmaker homes time is literally money for a developer paying 1 each month on an 80 000 credit line while waiting for approval from a government entity he said you re talking 800 a month to sit there and watch grass grow on a lot holder said and that cost is later obviously transferred to the home buyer mike kazmierski president and ceo of the economic development authority of western nevada at the end of the day we need more housing and if that means we build on land that s not perfect and engineer solutions for their problems then that s what we need to do quote icon rising costs are also a big reason why you are seeing a lot of luxury housing developments in reno according to tatro that s because those are the only projects that will pencil out financially once higher costs are factored in he said the cost of developed land is higher building codes are growing fees are going up and that has significant impact tatro said we re trying to build missing middle housing but it s painstakingly long to get those projects moving multi story projects are also cost prohibitive so you re not going to get a 10 story workforce housing project unless it s heavily subsidized how are local governments responding to the housing crisis developers seeking subsidies for affordable housing received an assist from the 2019 nevada legislature which passed a couple of bills related to the issue one was senate bill 103 which allows local governments to subsidize building permit and impact fees by slashing or eliminating them for affordable housing projects another senate bill 448 gives developers up to 10 million in transferable tax credits critics say it s interesting that developers get subsidies while regular people are left to fend for themselves in a tough real estate market watch reno renter stephanie lee talks about her rent increase reno renter stephanie lee is facing a 40 percent rent increase jason bean rgj with median income households unable to afford a median priced house and renters being subject to skyrocketing rents and no cause evictions businesses should not be getting handouts said bob fulkerson development director for the progressive leadership alliance of nevada it s like if these guys had to survive in the free market they d go broke fulkerson said it s socialism for developers and capitalism for the rest of us so i have zero patience for them local governments meanwhile say they have been working with developers to help streamline the permitting process ten years ago the city of reno updated its zoning code to simplify the review process said claudia hanson planning manager for the city of reno s community development department this shaved a couple of months from developers timelines because many projects did not have to go through hearings anymore the city of reno is also updating its parking standards which were written 15 years to 20 years ago and are fairly out of date because they don t take into account new trends such as ridesharing as well as improvements involving transit and walkability according to hanson in some cases delays occur because of application errors hanson added a lot of times we ll see developers submit whatever they have whether it meets code or not just to meet their deadline hanson said this really slows the process on our side if they submit an incomplete set of plans midtown s resurgence has made it attractive for developers in reno but the neighborhood has a sadistic side that intruded on marmot properties latest project a duplex apartment made from shipping containers jason hidalgo rgj to reduce delays from erroneous applications local governments such as reno and washoe county offer free pre application or pre development meetings the meetings allow developers to sit down with various experts from departments such as engineering building and fire to do a high level review of their application before it is submitted sarah tone business facilitator for washoe county s community services department recalls one developer who did not understand why engineering needed to look at his development site and its water flows we sat him down and showed him the water flows in and out of his system and how it had the potential to cause the house to fall down because it would have eroded his foundation tone said as far as complaints about changes in codes and regulations representatives from reno sparks and washoe county say those are done to stay in line with changes to building code standards these include federal as well as international codes which have minimum requirements that must be met nevada for example typically adopts new building codes in a five year cycle and there are always changes to them said john martini assistant city manager for sparks cylus scarbrough management analyst for the city of reno s community development department they have to be knowledgeable in affordable housing regulations and the federal laws and codes around that there s not many developers really interested in engaging in that universe quote icon it s incumbent upon the building and safety division to stay current with codes it s that simple martini said it s a safety and welfare issue for the people who live here because we get high winds we get snow we re subject to a fairly high risk for earthquakes so we have to keep up with those house codes reno for example sees notable seismic activity every year including a recent earthquake swarm on june 6 the series of 10 earthquakes within a six hour period included a magnitude 3 7 quake there are also several options available via local state and federal programs to help developers build affordable housing projects said cylus scarbrough management analyst for the city of reno s community development department these include large scale affordable housing funding initiatives such as the federal home investment partnership program although not unlimited such resources are still substantial scarbrough said the issue is that affordable housing projects require specialized expertise they have to be knowledgeable in affordable housing regulations and the federal laws and codes around that scarbrough said there s not many developers really interested in engaging in that universe what s going up and what s going down a huge billboard advertising country artist toby keith s concert at the nugget event center in sparks can be seen from interstate 580 just a few months ago the venue on sparks victorian square was a dirt lot by mid june the site has been transformed into an 8 958 seat amphitheater the latest in a development blitz that is adding a bunch of apartments and amenities such as restaurants right in the middle of sparks urban core they re getting a downtown overnight said bonnenfant of unr s center for regional studies while folks such as tatro have described reno as the stick in the mud for development sparks has received more positive feedback from developers for its efforts to keep projects moving despite that the city is not exempt from one common complaint raised by developers rising fees this year a 30 increase in sewer connection fees took effect in sparks this was accompanied by a 2 96 increase in storm drain connection fees with both rising by 5 annually through 2022 fee increases are a frequent refrain heard from builders as an obstacle to more development the rising costs are also passed on to the final product which helps contribute to the declining affordability being seen in the market according to tatro for every 1 000 increase in the price of a house 251 people are priced out tatro said we re trying to get product to the market but you have thousands of people who can t buy them martini however says sparks has no choice the sparks city council approved the increases in response to significant expenses that will be coming in for the truckee meadows water reclamation facility which treats waste water in reno sparks raising the fees was a way to make sure that development is paying its fair share martini said incomes have not kept pace with the skyrocketing cost of housing in the reno metro area chastity laskey usa today network martini also echoed a statement heard from reno and washoe county while the economy is booming local government revenues have yet to catch up a large part of the issue has to do with nevada s property tax abatement which greatly devalued properties after the recession but capped how high they could increase per year at 3 afterward all that abatement money is simply gone martini said when we came out of the recession the world around local government recovered but local governments have not recovered yet we are just starting to see general fund revenues increase due to property tax and that is simply due to new development washoe county meanwhile says it saw a revenue gap of 107 000 for permits because it froze automatic fee increases the county also faces its own unique issues for development such as limited density development in washoe county for example is capped at three units per acre by law said mojra hauenstein division director of planning and building for the county s community services department while permitting activity for single family homes is down compared to the 36 year average one segment is seeing increased activity overall in 2017 apartment permits outpaced house permits in washoe for the first time at 2 974 vs 2 133 this helped total permits break the 5 000 mark for the first time since 2005 story continues below graphic loading despite that housing whether it be single family homes or apartments remains unaffordable for a huge swath of the community s population at the end of the day everyone is on the same team even if it might not seem that way hauenstein said everyone has to be in order for the housing problem to be solved she added there s this misconception that we re not on the same side but i really believe we are hauenstein said a lot of the people who work here used to be on the other side of the counter so we truly understand the impacts of permitting on people s livelihoods it s just not an easy process although builders developers and local governments typically get most of the attention when it comes to the rising costs for a new home one contributing factor that doesn t get as much attention are homebuyers themselves more specifically the expectations that many homebuyers have for what an entry level home should be are a lot different these days than they were even just a few years ago holder said there was a time when builders could throw in a pre formed formica countertop and add a tile backsplash to a kitchen and call it a day these days buyers are expecting features such as all stainless steel appliances and granite countertops according to holder we can probably build a really stripped down airtight home at a lower cost holder said but i think you d find people wouldn t buy it loading jason hidalgo covers

volverá a la ideología de bolívar translate los revolucionarios no toman caca cola no se trata solamente de un capricho sino de una sana actitud en todos los sentidos desde la solidaridad con el pueblo colombiano donde la empresa caca cola ha cometido los más grandes abusos contra sus trabajadores incluyendo el presunto secuestro y asesinato de los dirigentes del sindicato hasta la proteccion de la salud de nuestros hijos enviciados por ese jarabe de cola y azucar que les produce obesidad prematura pensemos tambien los revolucionarios que ese dinero que gastamos en los refrescos es utilizado por esas empresas para financiar el terrorismo en nuestro país es cierto no se trata solo de la caca cola sino tambien de la cerveza de los cigarrillos y todos esos articulos innecesarios y mas que eso dañinos para nuestra salud podriamos incluso pensar en un dia de parada para cada uno de ellos es cuestion de irnos organizando pero para empezar que tal si dejamos de comprar caca cola y sus similares cuando lo extraordinario se vuelve cotidiano discurso del acto de grado en barinas en 12 de febrero del 2005 queridos graduandos más que un discurso quiero dirigirles algunas palabras que escribí anoche después de visitar en las clínicas a los estudiantes heridos a consecuencia de los enfrentamientos con la policía de hace apenas dos días me ha tocado por razones del destino ser la persona que les otorgue el titulo que bien merecieron con sus estudios y me siento sumamente orgulloso de serlo me consta que la universidad de los llanos occidentales ezequiel zamora a pesar de lo dicho por los enemigos de esta universidad es una universidad de primera no tendremos la mejor planta física en los salones hace calor en el comedor hace calor pero no es en lo material que las cosas deben valorarse el mayor capital es el ser humano y en eso nuestra unellez lo digo con conocimiento de causa esta sobrada los llaneros venezolanos son nobles valientes de coraje en la unellez hacen vida en este momento aproximadamente 67000 personas el 97 de ellas son estudiantes jóvenes que como ustedes hasta el día de hoy buscan ese titulo que constata los años de dedicación y de estudio los jóvenes son el río de la vida ustedes graduados deben ser los capitanes de esos barcos que naveguen por el río de la vida nuestra patria atraviesa momentos muy difíciles porque decidió dejar de ser esa matrona de edad vetusta y complaciente para ser joven rebelde y altanera nuestra imagen ya no es la de una acaudalada ricachona mayamera en nuestro rostro brilla ahora la sonrisa del che guevara con su diente delantero torcido su pelo largo y su boina con la estrella entender esto a mí me ha tomado prácticamente toda la vida tengo 53 años y ya perdí mi oportunidad de derramar sangre joven a causa de un ideal ustedes son jóvenes están en la flor de la vida no cometan por favor el error de renunciar a su instinto de rebelión el che guevara fue ministro de a economía en cuba los billetes y las monedas se adornaban con su rostro nada de eso le importó primero fue a angola donde pasó un penoso año de combate después se fue a bolivia donde encontró la muerte el che era el último que comía el que cargaba la mochila mas pesada siempre se sacrificaba por los demás en un estoicismo que mas parecía fervor religioso que ideología marxista si quieren un modelo de vida ahí lo tienen dije hace unos momentos que el 97 de la población de la unellez es estudiante se imaginan ustedes la universidad que podríamos tener si todos los estudiantes tuvieran la abnegación la combatividad del che los momentos que se avecinan van a requerir de una gran unidad del pueblo venezolano la alternativa de continuar siendo libres o regresar a la pobreza se nos planteará en los próximos días de forma enmascarada o quizás peor desenmascarada vestida con uniforme de soldado del imperio por nuestra parte podemos esperar lo mejor la macroeconomía no podría ir mejor la justicia social ha mejorado notablemente las misiones ocupan un papel muy importante en el pago de dicha justicia social aquí en barinas ya hemos cumplido con dos de las misiones la misión robinsón y la misión sucre no hay analfabetismo y no hay exclusión en la educación superior en estas tierras de zamora pero ay malhaya son precisamente estos éxitos los que nos hacen más antipáticos al imperio para ellos somos inclusive un mal ejemplo que se esta contagiando al resto del continente y cuidado sino al resto del mundo nunca venceremos al imperio estará siempre ahí acechando por lo menos hasta que el mismo no se autodestruya porque sépanlo señores el neoliberalismo es caníbal cuando le ataque el hambre se devorará a si mismo ustedes queridos graduandos a partir de hoy pasan a conformar la elite profesional que debe sostener este país en los próximos cuarenta o cincuenta años años decisivos para el logro de nuestra libertad y del rescate de nuestra soberanía no se dejen comprar no se dejen corromper no se dejen gritar no se dejen pisar que nadie les diga qué comer o qué vestirse o qué leer sean siempre auténticos rebeldes contestatarios pero eso si profundamente patriotas dignos de ser hijos de

producto líquido más del 10 es azúcar o sea que en una lata de coca cola más de un centímetro y medio es puro azúcar en polvo aproximadamente tres cucharadas soperas llenas de azúcar por lata la

extracto de hojas de la planta de coca áfrica e india y otros pocos aromatizantes naturales de otras plantas mucha cafeína conservante que puede ser benzoato de sodio o potasio dióxido de carbono en cantidad para sentir freír la lengua cuando se bebe sal para dar la sensación de refrigeración el uso del acido fosforito y no del acido cítrico como en todas las demás gaseosas es para dar la

coca cola tiene permiso porque claro sin el acido fosfórico la coca cola sabría a jabón el extracto de coca y otras hojas casi no cambia en nada el sabor es más bien un efecto cosmético el extracto forma parte de la coca cola porque legalmente tiene que ser así pero sin él no se nota ninguna diferencia en el gusto que esta dado básicamente por las cantidades diferentes de azúcar azúcar quemada

cero sal publicado por loretahur en realidad la formula secreta de la coca cola se puede detallar en 18 segundos en cualquier espectrómetro óptico y básicamente la conocen hasta los perros lo que

que dañen los tubos de pvc los productos endulzantes ligth tienen una vida media muy corta por ejemplo el aspartamo después de tres semanas mojado pasa a tener gusto de trapo viejo sucio para evitar eso se agregan una infinidad de otros productos químicos uno para alargar la vida del aspartamo otro para neutralizar el color otro para mantener el tercer químico en suspensión porque sino el fondo de la gaseosa quedaría oscuro otro para evitar la cristalización del aspartamo otro para realzar el sabor dar mas intensidad al acido cítrico o fosforito que perdería su sabor por el efecto de los cuatro productos químicos iniciales y así sucesivamente un consejo final después de toda mi experiencia con la producción de bebidas embasadas puedo afirmar sin dudar un segundo la mejor bebida es el agua como también los jugos exprimidos de naranja o limón nada más cero azúcar y cero sal publicado por loretahur margarina o mantequilla la margarina fue producida originalmente para engordar a los pavos cuandolo que hizo en realidad fue matarlos las personas que habían puesto el dinero para la investigación quisieronrecobrarlo así que empezaron a pensar en una forma de hacerlo tenían una sustancia blanca que no tenía ningún atractivo como comestible así que le añadieron el color amarillo para vendérselo a lagente en lugar de la mantequilla qué tal ésa ahora han sacado algunos nuevos sabores para vender más alos incautos como usted y yo conoce usted la diferencia entre la margarina y la mantequilla siga leyendo hasta el final porque se pone bastante interesante comparación entre mantequilla y margarina 1 ambas tienen la misma cantidad de calorías 2 la mantequilla es ligeramente más alta en grasas saturadas 8 gramos comparada con los 5 gramos que tiene la margarina 3 comer margarina en vez de mantequilla puede aumentar en 53 el riesgo deenfermedades coronarias en las mujeres de acuerdo con un estudiomédico reciente de la universidad de harvard 4 comer mantequilla aumenta la absorción de gran cantidad de nutrientesque se encuentran en otros alimentos 5 la mantequilla provee beneficios nutricionales propios mientras lamargarina tiene sólo los que le hayan sido añadidos al fabricarla 6 la mantequilla sabe mucho mejor que la margarina y mejora el sabor deotros alimentos 7 la mantequilla ha existido durante siglos mientras que la margarinatiene menos de 100 años ahora sobre la margarina 1 es muy alta en ácidos grasos trans sí ésos que recién ahora loscientíficos descubrieron que son malísimos y los gobiernoscomenzaron a prohibirlos 2 triple riesgo de enfermedades coronarias 3 aumenta el colesterol total y el ldl el colesterol malo y disminuye elhdl el colesterol bueno 4 aumenta en cinco veces el riesgo de cáncer 5 disminuye la calidad de la leche materna 6 disminuye la reacción inmunológica del organismo 7 disminuye la reacción a la insulina y he aquí el factor más inquietante aquí está la parte más interesante a la margarina le falta una molécula para ser plástico sólo este hecho es suficiente para evitar el uso de la margarina de porvida y de cualquier otra cosa que sea hidrogenada esto significaque se le añade hidrógeno lo cual cambia la estructura molecular de lassubstancias usted puede ensayar lo siguiente compre un poco de margarina y déjela en el garaje o en un sitio sombreado dentro de unos días notará dos cosas no habrá moscas ni siquiera esos molestos bichos se le acercarán esto yale debe decir a usted algo no se pudre ni huele mal o diferente porque no tiene valor nutritivo nadacrece en ella ni siquiera los diminutos microorganismos puedencrecer en ella por qué porque es casi plástico no a la guerra si a la paz misterios de la ciencia los costos de la guerra medicos y capitalismo capitalismo medicos 2

menafn jordan times new york us president donald trump has based his foreign policy on a series of harsh economic blockades each designed to frighten coerce and even starve the target country into submitting to us demands while the practice is less violent than a military attack and the blockade is through financial means rather than the navy the consequences are often dire for civilian populations as such economic blockades by the united states should be scrutinised by the united nations security council under international law and the un charter when trump campaigned for office in 2016 he rejected the frequent us resort to war in the middle east during the years 1990 2016 the us launched two major wars with iraq 1990 and 2003 as well as wars in afghanistan 2001 libya 2011 and syria 2012 it also participated in many smaller military interventions mali somalia and yemen among others none of these us led wars and others in recent history achieved their political objectives and the major conflicts have been followed by chronic violence and instability the attempt to force syria s bashar al assad from power led to a proxy war eventually involving the us syria russia saudi arabia qatar iran turkey israel and the united arab emirates that displaced over 10 million syrians and caused around half a million violent deaths while trump has so far eschewed a new war he has continued us regime change efforts by other means trump is often called an isolationist but he is as interventionist as his predecessors his strategy at least so far has been to rely more heavily on us economic power than military might to coerce adversaries which creates its own kind of cruelty and destabilisation and it constantly risks flaring into outright war as occurred with iran this month the trump administration currently is engaged in three attempts at comprehensive economic blockades against north korea venezuela and iran as well as several lesser blockades against countries such as cuba and nicaragua and an intensifying effort to cut off china s access to technology the blockade against north korea is sanctioned at least in part by the un security council the blockade against iran is in direct opposition to the security council and the blockade against venezuela is so far without security council engagement for or against the us is attempting to isolate the three countries from almost all international trade causing shortages of food medicines energy and spare parts for basic infrastructure including the water supply and power grid the north korean blockade operates mainly through un mandated sanctions and includes a comprehensive list of exports to north korea imports from north korea and financial relations with north korean entities the un food and agriculture organisation fao reports that 10 million north koreans are at risk of hunger partly owing to sanctions he unintended negative impact sanctions can have on agricultural production through both direct and indirect impacts cannot be ignored the fao warns the most obvious are restrictions on the importation of certain items that are necessary for agricultural production in particular fuel machinery and spare parts for equipment the draconian us sanctions on venezuela have come in two phases the first beginning in august 2017 was mainly directed at the state oil company pdvsa the country s main earner of foreign exchange the second round of sanctions imposed in january 2019 was more comprehensive targeting the venezuelan government a recent detailed analysis of the first round of sanctions shows their devastating impact the us sanctions gravely exacerbated previous economic mismanagement contributing to a catastrophic fall in oil production hyperinflation economic collapse output is down by half since 2016 hunger and rising mortality us sanctions against iran have been in place more or less continuously since 1979 the most recent and by far most draconian measures introduced in august 2018 and intensified in the first half of this year aim to cut iran off from foreign trade the us sanctions are in direct contravention of un security council resolution 2231 which endorsed the 2015 nuclear agreement with iran the effects have been devastating the international monetary fund forecasts that iran s economy will shrink by 10 per cent between 2017 and 2019 with inflation reaching 30 per cent this year medicines are in short supply one might expect that other countries would easily circumvent us sanctions but the us has threatened to punish foreign companies that violate the sanctions and has used the dollar s global clout as a bludgeon threatening to sanction foreign banks that finance trade with iran european companies have fallen into line despite the european union s express desire to engage economically with iran over the longer term it is likely that more ways will be found to circumvent the sanctions using renminbi rouble or euro financing yet the erosion of us sanctions will only be gradual despite the intense economic pain indeed calamity inflicted on north korea venezuela and iran none of them has succumbed to us demands in this sense sanctions have proved to be no more successful than military intervention north korea has maintained and most likely is expanding its nuclear arsenal the iranian regime rejects us demands concerning its missile programme and foreign policies and venezuela s president nicolás maduro remains in power the us blockades have been carried out by presidential decree with almost no public debate and no systematic oversight by congress this has been a one man show even more so than in the case of president led wars which trigger vastly more public scrutiny trump realises that he can impose crippling sanctions abroad with almost no direct costs to the us public or budget and with virtually no political accountability military blockades are acts of war and therefore subject to international law including un security council oversight america s economic blockades are similar in function and outcome to military blockades with devastating consequences for civilian populations and risk provoking war it is time for the security council to take up the us sanctions regimes and weigh them against the requirements of international law and peacekeeping jeffrey d sachs professor of sustainable development and professor of health policy and management at columbia university is director of columbia s centre for sustainable development and of the un sustainable development solutions network

an escalation in trade tensions between the united states and china other data on monday showed construction spending unexpectedly fell in may as investment in private construction projects dropped to its lowest level in nearly 2 1 2 years the reports were the latest indications that economic growth slowed in the second quarter after getting a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory while the slowdown in factory activity was not as steep as had been flagged by some regional factory surveys a sharp drop in a gauge of prices paid by manufacturers could be yet another reason for the federal reserve to consider cutting interest rates this month the u s central bank last month signalled it could ease monetary policy as early as this month citing low inflation as well as growing risks to the economy from u s china trade tensions manufacturing is clearly taking it on the chin from the rising trade uncertainty said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york the institute for supply management ism said its index of national factory activity dropped to 51 7 last month the lowest reading since october 2016 from 52 1 in may it was the third straight monthly decline in the index a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector which accounts for about 12 percent of the u s economy economists polled by reuters had forecast the ism index

inventory overhang which has resulted in businesses placing fewer orders with manufacturers a reduction in the production of boeing s max 737 aircraft which was grounded in march after two fatal plane crashes in five months is also a drag on activity the weakness in factory activity is in sync with a slowdown in economic growth following a temporary boost from exports and an accumulation of inventory consumer spending is rising moderately while the pace of job and wage growth has slowed in addition the housing market is struggling and the goods trade deficit widened in may the ism s forward looking new orders sub index decreased 2 7 points to a reading of 50 0 last month the lowest reading since december 2015 a measure of prices paid by manufacturers tumbled 5 3 points to 47 9

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by howard schneider washington reuters a now record setting run of u s economic growth enters its 121st month on monday sustained by a decade of low interest rates and massive federal reserve intervention that helped put 22 million people back to work but the real economic recovery may only be in its infancy and if recent history is any guide it could be approaching a delicate moment related stories it was only last year that u s gross domestic product caught up with estimates of its potential surpassing where congressional budget office analysts feel it would have been if the housing bubble hadn t burst in 2007 investment bank lehman brothers had not failed the following year and the world had not cratered into a deep recession the periods when gdp exceeds potential are typically when workers enjoy the greatest wage gains and members of historically sidelined communities find jobs in recent years those periods have not lasted long a fact that fed and other officials are wrestling with as they weigh possible interest rate cuts and assess just where the u s economy now stands we re only now making up ground even though the economy has been growing since june 2009 the month the national bureau of economic research marked as the trough of the last recession said vincent reinhart chief economist at mellon the approach of the decade long expansion mark has boosted speculation about how much longer the recovery might last whether a recession is inevitable in the next couple of years and whether the fed and u s government are adequately prepared to fight another downturn for the type of progress fed and elected officials feel is needed to rebuild middle class incomes it may take several more years the 2007 2009 recession wiped 600 billion dollars from u s gdp on an inflation adjusted basis it created an even bigger gap of close to 1 trillion between u s output and the economy s potential based on its population industrial base and other factors according to estimates created annually by the cbo those estimates dating back to the years just after world war two show a pattern that labor advocates argue should make the u s central bank willing to take some risks on behalf of wage earners for most of the time since 1949 178 of 281 quarters as measured by the cbo the economy has been below potential yet it is only during sustained periods when it operates above potential that workers claw back a higher share of the country s economic output that happened consistently in the decade or two immediately following world war two and most notably in the late 1960s when a six year run of output above potential helped push the share of gdp taken home by workers to close to 65 the only recent comparable era was the late 1990s when gdp stayed above potential for nearly five years and labor s share of national output which had dipped below 60 at that point again rebounded those two eras ended differently one gave way to a period of excessive inflation that led the fed to impose record high interest rates that triggered a recession beginning an era when output took 15 years to crawl back to potential the other was nursed along by a fed that trimmed interest rates at a time and in a way to keep growth on track and ended with only a mild downturn in 2000 for a graphic on a decade of expansion just now gaining ground click new world the central bank which signaled in mid june that it could cut interest rates as early as this month is trying to make a similar read now in hopes of sustaining the sort of tight economy over the several more years needed for workers to gain more ground but the environment has changed in the short term global trade disputes and other risks could slow the economy no matter what the fed does the risk of inflation may be low but so is the expected trend rate of growth in an economy where people are aging and productivity is lagging a drag on workers potential to recover income and wealth inequality and the effects of automation on the workforce have become an increasing concern but so has the risk that keeping interest rates too low might feed the sort of excessive debt that caused the last financial crisis the u s economy has only operated above potential in 12 quarters since 2001 including the last four labor s share of national output at the start of this year was just over 56 in dollar terms about 1 5 trillion short of what it would be at the peak levels in the 1960s and 1990s the expansion may have notched its record but it may take a bit of nerve for the fed to extend a recovery that in many ways is only just starting it feels like a new world with structurally less global demand and structurally less resilience in our economies said nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income that is the nature of the new world that we are in it does make it more complicated

speech by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the bank of finland conference on monetary policy and future of emu i would like to thank the bank of finland for inviting me to speak at this conference in helsinki today in my contribution i wish to share some thoughts on the conduct of monetary policy in a low inflation environment this is a global topic that generates similar challenges for most of the central banks represented at this event to a significant extent this sequence of low inflation rates reflects the prolonged adjustment dynamics that characterise the aftermath of a major global financial crisis together with a substantial downward shift in the realisation of shocks to inflation that we have observed in recent years at the same time regardless of the underlying origins of the current low inflation environment some observers may be tempted to query whether and how central banks will meet their inflation objectives especially under conditions in which monetary accommodation is already quite extensive to address these concerns in respect of the euro area i will demonstrate the effectiveness of the policy instruments that we have deployed to ensure that inflation climbs to meet our objective over the medium term as will be explained in the analysis my assessment is that the evidence shows that our package of monetary policy measures has been an effective response to the environment that the ecb has faced in recent years furthermore the effectiveness of the policy toolkit means that we can add further monetary accommodation if it is required to deliver our objective finally especially when inflation deviates from its objective for an extended period central banks including the ecb should adopt clear communication strategies that leave no doubt about their absolute commitment to meeting the inflation objective over the medium term the ecb s instruments and tools excellent accounts of the history of ecb monetary policy are provided by hutchinson and smets 2017 hartmann and smets 2019 and rostagno et al forthcoming as a summary device chart 1 shows some key interest rates and developments in excess liquidity in recent years the chart underlines the primary role of the deposit facility rate which has been in negative territory since 2014 in anchoring the key eonia market interest rate in a world in which the money market operates in conditions of excess liquidity from mid 2014 onwards net liquidity provision from refinancing operations and asset purchases has markedly increased in part this expansion of liquidity provision depended on banks choosing to take up funding support in refinancing operations especially conventional longer term refinancing operations ltros and more recently targeted ltros tltros however the expansion during 2014 18 was dominated by our asset purchase programme app chart 1 eonia key ecb interest rates and excess liquidity lhs bn rhs percentages per annum sources ecb notes daily data excess liquidity is computed as the sum of credit institutions central bank liquidity holdings with the eurosystem in their current accounts and deposit facility minus their reserve requirements eonia stands for the euro overnight unsecured interbank rate dfr for the deposit facility rate and mlf for the marginal lending facility last observation 25 june 2019 in recent years the ecb has deployed an innovative multi pronged approach in the design of its policy stance while it is always possible to envisage a wider range of instruments the current policy mix includes four elements i pushing the policy rate into negative territory ii forward guidance on the future policy path iii the app and iv tltros importantly these measures work as a package with significant complementarities across the different instruments i will outline the effectiveness of these four measures doing so shows the capacity of our policy framework to provide the monetary accommodation required to return inflation to the medium term goal even when the policy rate is no longer in conventional positive territory furthermore the effectiveness of these tools also provides leeway for further easing if it is required negative policy rate deposit facility rate the 2014 decision by the ecb to push the relevant policy rate the deposit facility rate into negative territory was a crucial policy innovation subsequent cuts have taken the deposit facility rate to its current level of minus 40 basis points an important mechanism that reinforces the impact of negative interest rates relates to the way expectations about the future path of monetary policy are reflected in market interest rates at any point in time a wide range of future interest rate paths is conceivable and market participants assign probabilities to different parts of this distribution the yield and forward curves observed in the market are the probability weighted averages of these possible paths aggregated across market participants a perceived binding lower bound on monetary policy rates skews the predictive distribution upward since it truncates the distribution of conceivable future short term rates from below as the overnight interest rate reaches the lower bound interest rate paths that would have embodied expectations of a further cut at a higher level of the actual overnight rate are by definition eliminated from the set of conceivable outcomes conversely rates above the lower bound receive a higher relative weight and the expected value of interest rates is mechanically pushed up while longer term yields are likely to decline even as the central bank cuts the short term rate towards its lower bound the truncated asymmetric distribution of expected future short term rates means that they decline by less than they would away from the lower bound the resultant tightening bias in turn can be quite costly since it tends to arise in situations of strong and persistent disinflationary pressures and in the wake of a previous sequence of sizeable rate cuts a policy of negative interest rates mitigates this tightening bias in particular the observation that a central bank is prepared to take interest rates to levels below zero induces a re evaluation of technical feasibility constraints a salient feature of this re evaluation is the disappearance of the qualifier zero in the economic debate on lower bound constraints via this re evaluation negative rates loosen the perceived lower bound on the future distribution of short term interest rates through this mechanism negative interest rates have a marked impact on transmission particularly in the euro area as they push down the short and medium segment of the risk free curve which for the most part is the segment of the curve that determines the pricing of loans to non financial corporations it follows that control of this segment of the curve directly influences the level of lending rates to illustrate the effectiveness of negative policy rates ecb staff undertook a counterfactual exercise they constructed the forward curve that would prevail in a scenario without either the negative interest rate policy or the forward guidance on the future path of the policy rates as shown in chart 2 the forward curve derived from the overnight index swap curve would be pinned at a higher level and would be distinctly steeper the dashed blue line on the right than the forward curve that we observe today the red curve chart 2 expectations of future short term rates observed and counterfactual under no nirp percentage per annum sources bloomberg rostagno et al 2019 notes the chart shows the evolution of the ois forward curve from pre policy package dashed black line to post policy package red line together with risk neutral option implied distributions euribor 3m spread adjusted as well as a shifted counterfactual forward curve dashed blue line and the risk neutral option implied distribution the counterfactual distribution and forward curve is constructed by anchoring the current distribution at zero and subsequently assuming that without nirp all probability mass that is observed below zero after shifting would proportionally redistribute to zero while this mainly serves as an illustration as it is based on a number of assumptions and input parameters it is indicative of the sort of tighter interest rate constellations that the euro area economy would face in the absence of this important policy tool our negative policy rate thus contributes substantially to providing monetary accommodation at the same time it is also clear that there may be negative side effects accordingly the governing council will continue to assess the case for mitigating measures which is especially relevant if further rate cuts are envisaged forward guidance on interest rates our interest rate forward guidance with its state contingent and date based legs has become the principal tool for adjusting the monetary policy stance especially following the end of net asset purchases the state contingent leg expresses the anchor of our policy setting expectations policy rates will not be raised until we are sufficiently confident that inflation will reach levels that we consider most consistent with the ecb s price stability objective this in turn allows interest rate expectations to adjust dynamically in a data dependent manner which results in automatic easing if the convergence path is delayed through the date based leg the governing council affects interest rate expectations by expressing its views about the rate path in the near term that given the outlook for inflation is most conducive to reaching the objective over the medium term this removes unnecessary uncertainty about the policy orientation over horizons that are not stretching too far into the future and prevents an unwanted weakening of the monetary policy stimulus the evidence shows that our enhanced forward guidance has been effective the state contingent element is clearly understood by investors and is influencing their expectations since the second half of 2018 when we enhanced our forward guidance on interest rates and especially since the monetary policy meeting of the governing council in march 2019 the reassessment by investors of information regarding the outlook has led them to expect a somewhat longer horizon over which rates are more likely than not to remain unchanged accordingly the eonia forward curve has shifted down substantially over recent months see chart 3 chart 3 eonia forward curve estimates from ois percentages per annum sources ecb and ecb calculations latest observation 24 june 2019 in light of this endogenous adaptability of the state contingent leg through investor behaviour occasional gaps may emerge vis à vis the date based leg since the latter can only be recalibrated at each governing council monetary policy meeting in march and june 2019 the governing council assessed that the risks to price stability warranted a recalibration of the date based leg thereby conveying the governing council s updated assessment of the direction that the ecb s key interest rates will have to follow the governing council now expects to keep policy rates unchanged at least through the first half of 2020 it should be fully understood that a change to the date based leg is not intended to ratify market views rather it provides information on the governing council s assessment of the rate path that given the evolving state of the economy we view as the likeliest to be realised finally the inherent flexibility in our forward guidance framework always allows for additional enhancements to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained adjustment path app the significant stock of assets purchased through the app and the subsequent reinvestments once net purchases ended in december 2018 have been providing substantial monetary accommodation to the euro area my colleague benoît cœuré recently provided a thorough assessment and chart 4 and chart 5 illustrate the contribution of the app to the easing of financial conditions through the reduction of yields according to those estimates after the last recalibration of the app in june 2018 the ten year bond yield would have been around 95 basis points higher in the absence of the app moreover this impact is quite persistent asset purchases work through a variety of mechanisms of particular importance is the duration channel by absorbing duration risk from the market investors require less risk compensation which pushes down term premia and yields the duration channel is complemented by the signalling channel through which asset purchases can affect the expected path of short term policy rates importantly the bonds we have purchased will remain on our balance sheet for a long time and we continue to reinvest maturing principals chart 4 a meaningful stock effect will therefore continue to prevail and will exert substantial downward pressure on yields chart 5 particularly at the longer end of the curve the reinvestment horizon is linked to the forward guidance on policy rates we now say that we will continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ecb interest rates this means that any recalibration of the date based leg of forward guidance by construction extends the period over which investors expect the ecb to continue reinvesting in full this prolongs the favourable liquidity conditions and reinforces the downward effect of our rate forward guidance on long term rates by suppressing term premia see chart 5 chart 4 projected evolution of the pspp portfolio of the four largest euro area countries in maturity adjusted terms bn ten year equivalents source based on eser lemke nyholm radde vladu 2019 notes for selected dates corresponding to recalibrations of the app the figure shows the projected evolution of the government bond

supply held by price sensitive investors free float if warranted by our policy assessment net purchases under the app could be restarted in the future in the event of any resumption of net purchases associated revisions to the framework of forward guidance would have to be considered in order to make sure that the different instruments continue to be tightly linked and that their synergies are maximised tltros the governing council recently decided to start a third series of tltros tltro iii to help preserve favourable bank lending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy the generous borrowing conditions offered to banks should not only provide a backstop to the banking system but also lower aggregate funding costs which contributes to the overall accommodative monetary policy stance the funding cost relief is direct for those banks that switch from more expensive options to tltro financing however there is also an indirect channel that benefits the entire banking system while looking ahead banks will have to step up their issuance in order to satisfy regulatory requirements the tltro programme will help avoid cliff effects by allowing banks drawing tltro funds to cancel or postpone plans to issue bonds in the market this reduction in the supply of securities relative to what we would see in the absence of tltro iii creates a scarcity channel that puts further downward pressure on bank bond yields resulting in funding cost relief across the board the upshot of cheaper bank funding is higher credit volumes and lower lending rates to the wider economy via the bank lending channel chart 6a impact of tltro on lending rates upper chart and lending volumes lower chart percentage points deviations from september 2014 sources ecb imir and

countries are ireland greece spain italy cyprus portugal and slovenia other countries are all the remaining euro area countries in fact our experience with previous tltros tltro i and ii was that these operations had a significant effect on funding costs particularly in more vulnerable euro area countries moreover the lower funding costs were passed through to customers particularly in vulnerable countries banks that participated in tltros cut their lending rates by more than their non participating peers see chart 6 the policy package in assessing the impact of our policy package we must also take into account that the instruments were designed to be complementary and mutually reinforcing overall the transmission of our suite of measures to the financial system has been very effective this is in no small part due to the strong complementarities between instruments which ensure that all segments of the yield curve are influenced thereby easing financial conditions more broadly see chart 7 let me give two examples to illustrate the role played by complementarities in our policy design first the negative interest rate policy has supported the portfolio rebalancing channel of the app by encouraging banks to lend to the broad economy instead of holding onto liquidity at the same time the extra liquidity from the app has dampened volatility at the short end of the curve second the app and its reinvestments have supported our enhanced forward guidance via the signalling channel asset purchases provide a strong signal that policy rates will remain low for an extended period of time this effect is reinforced by the sequencing of our instruments which is embedded in the structure of our forward guidance at the same time our forward guidance on rates reinforces the app and reinvestments since it anchors the short end of the risk free curve and thereby ensures that the stimulus from the app and the reinvestments is not offset chart 7 impact of ecb non standard measures on the term structure of interest rates 2014 18 percentage points per annum source rostagno et al 2019 the improved financing conditions have made a considerable contribution to the macroeconomic performance of the euro area a counterfactual exercise undertaken by ecb staff shows that growth and inflation would have been notably lower in the absence of our non standard measures see chart 8 and chart 9 chart 8 contribution of ecb non standard measures to real gdp growth 2014 18 year on year percentage changes source rostagno et al 2019 chart 9 contribution of ecb non standard measures to hicp inflation 2014 18 year on year percentage changes source rostagno et al 2019 that said as the governing council has emphasised many times in order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures it is important that other policy areas make a more decisive contribution in particular growth enhancing and vulnerability reducing measures would combine to improve confidence in the long term potential of the euro area economy which is a central factor in determining assessments of steady state real interest rates moreover the aggregate cyclical stance of fiscal policy plays an important role in determining the amplitude and duration of economic fluctuations as noted by president draghi in his sintra speech a cyclically appropriate aggregate fiscal stance may be more easily achieved through a well designed central fiscal capacity let me now turn to the importance of effective communication in maintaining focus on the inflation objective especially during phases of extended deviations central bank communication the treaty on the functioning of the european union establishes price stability as the primary objective of the ecb the ecb strategy makes the primary objective of price stability operational through the medium term orientation of monetary policy this medium term orientation provides the necessary flexibility to combat excessive volatility in output and inflation in responding to shocks the medium term refers to a time span that is long enough to be consistent with a central bank s capacity to control inflation taking into account the typical transmission lag the horizon should be short enough for the public to be able to assess the performance of the central bank in delivering its inflation goal at the same time too long a span of time obstructs accountability however the definition of the medium term cannot be reduced to a fixed interval it must be interpreted as state dependent a demand shock that pushes inflation away from its desired level and output away from potential in the same direction calls for a policy horizon as short as the typical transmission lag the policy response to such a shock is faster and stronger than otherwise by contrast if the economy is hit by persistent supply side shocks for example the medium term interval can stretch well beyond the standard transmission lag of monetary policy furthermore a medium term orientation implies that inflation can deviate from our aim in both directions so long as the path of inflation can be expected to converge back to the objective maintaining a medium term orientation is facilitated by a credible commitment to the inflation goal such that inflation expectations remain well anchored even during a prolonged phase of inflation deviation one piece of evidence on how expectations are formed is provided by a recent special questionnaire in the ecb s survey of professional forecasters spf in which participants were asked about the factors that inform their longer term expectations meaning four or five years ahead the responses indicated that trends in inflation emerged as a substantial driving factor and it is fair to assume that such trends build to a very large extent on historical and thereby backward looking data on actual inflation however the ecb s inflation objective has remained the most important factor informing the longer term expectations of spf participants given that trends in actual inflation have clearly weakened in recent years the role of the inflation objective as an anchor of expectations has been brought more strongly to the fore one sign of this is the looser association in recent times of longer term inflation expectations with the average of actual inflation calculated cumulatively over the history of monetary union chart 10 while this average and the same holds for averages taken over shorter time spans has come down over the period of low inflation longer term expectations have declined to a much lesser extent this suggests that participants have not been overly extrapolative in forming their expectations about inflation chart 10 euro area hicp inflation and inflation expectations y o y percentage change sources ecb consensus economics thomson reuters ecb calculations note beir break even inflation rate is defined as the yield spread between nominal and inflation linked bonds ils stands for inflation linked swaps a financial asset which hedges against the risk of inflation spf survey of professional forecasters and consensus economics denote the expected long term inflation expectations in five years and in six to ten years respectively as inferred from the average point estimate of both surveys all series except the survey series are quarterly averages last observation 2019 q2 maintaining the medium term inflation goal as the guideline for households firms and market participants in forming expectations also requires a consistent communication strategy especially when the near term track record of inflation outcomes has deviated from the objective in part this communication strategy is anchored by our forward guidance on policy measures so that everyone understands that the conditional future policy path supports convergence to the aim it is also supported by demonstrating agility with the central bank communicating that it stands ready to adjust its policy measures at any time to avoid undue delay in returning to the inflation goal and combat any adverse shock to inflation dynamics it is also crucial to the successful anchoring of inflation expectations that the central bank shows it is a learning organisation that is committed in its search for the most effective policy tools in delivering its mandate this general principle is especially relevant during phases when economic and financial conditions pose new challenges and require novel policy responses whether through innovations such as the outright monetary transactions programme during the sovereign debt crisis or through the package of innovative policy measures that have been launched in recent years the ecb has shown itself to be creative and proactive in responding to new challenges in common with other central banks the ecb must always be open to new ideas and new methods drawing from internal and external research and examples of best practice from around the world of course not all new ideas withstand sustained scrutiny but the exploration of new methods and formulations is essential for successful performance for instance albeit with an orientation to the specific conditions of the us economy the academic contributions to the june conference at the federal reserve of chicago show the vibrancy of current international research on meeting the challenges of low inflation some of these themes were also identified in president draghi s recent sintra speech there should be no doubt that the ecb is committed to ensuring that our monetary policy is built on frontier level and robust theoretical and empirical analysis conclusions together with the extended nature of macro financial adjustment in the wake of a major financial crisis we have seen a substantial downward shift in the realisation of shocks to inflation in recent years in the context of the euro area the ecb has been active and creative in deploying non standard measures in addition to extending the range for the policy rate into negative territory our assessment is that this policy package has been effective and further easing can be provided if required to deliver our mandate at the same time an extended phase of below target inflation poses a communication challenge in maintaining focus on the medium term inflation goal it is obvious that it is easier to demonstrate commitment to the target if the actual track record of inflation outcomes corresponds more closely to the declared objective accordingly it is essential that a central bank shows consistency in its monetary policy decisions by proactively responding to shocks that might delay convergence to the target or move inflation dynamics in an adverse direction to this end especially in a world of non standard measures and an essential role for forward guidance it is also vital that a central bank demonstrates that it is always seeking the most effective methods to

piketty show that incomes grew much faster for the top 1 in the 1980s and the 1990s than over the past decade yet inequality has captured much more attention now than it did then in part that may be because middle class and poorer americans haven t enjoyed the fruits of this expansion compared with other recoveries incomes for middle class americans grew nearly twice as fast in the 1980s expansion and about 1 5 times faster in the 1990s than in the current recovery for many people inequality carries less sting when their own fortunes improve the more people are struggling to make ends meet themselves the more they may notice inequality said elise gould an economist at the liberal economic policy institute income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving them little pressure to raise pay not until 2016 did the unemployment rate fall below 5 average hourly pay finally began to pick up with the lowest income workers receiving the fastest average gains though this trend has helped narrow income inequality vast disparities remain overall there s growing inequality gould said with signs of hope at the bottom it s just taken a very long time
usd jpy has risen from the lows amid optimism about trade and moderate comments from the fed the trump xi summit and the non farm payrolls promise an intriguing start to the second half of 2019 early july s daily chart indicates further falls for the currency pair experts see sideways movement in the short term and rises afterward what just happened fed moderates trade in focus the federal reserve has taken a step back from its dovish message suggesting an interest rate cut in july may only serve as an insurance policy and not the beginning of a series of rate reductions james bullard president of the saint louis branch of the federal reserve discarded the option of a 50 basis point cut that markets had hoped for fed chair jerome powell did not refer directly to rates but highlighted the

important summit between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping markets were cheered by reports that both sides agreed to a trade truce no new tariffs during a fresh round of negotiations however trump threatened to slap more duties and china would like to remove all the levies imposed by the us in the past year at the time of writing uncertainty remains high in japan the bank of japan s meeting minutes document has shown concern about low inflation and readiness to add more monetary stimulus however the boj seems to be short of additional policy measures as japanese bond yields are already at rock bottom levels and the interest rate is negative at 0 10 the yen temporarily gained ground amid tensions in the middle east iran downed a us drone and trump was close to authorizing an airstrike in retaliation the incident intensified tensions and also pushed oil prices higher us events trump xi summit full nfp buildup trump and xi will meet for a crucial summit early on saturday while markets are closed and the results will echo throughout the week current expectations are modest an agreement to resume official trade talks and refrain from imposing new tariffs would please markets and may push usd jpy higher if the leaders of the world s largest economies strike a deal a highly unlikely scenario stocks may roar and dollar yen could jump higher as well however a more likely scenario would be an inconclusive summit that will later lead to the us announcing new duties on china in this adverse scenario which has a medium probability usd jpy may not only retreat back to previous levels but plunge to new lows the economic calendar is packed with events that will initially compete for attention with the summit june s ism manufacturing pmi kicks off the week with an expected slide from 52 1 points recorded in june the forward looking indicator provides an insight into the manufacturing sector and its response to trade tensions and also serves as a hint towards the non farm payrolls figures on friday wednesday features two critical hints toward the nfp the adp non farm payrolls shocked investors in early june with a meager gain of only 27k positions the lowest since march 2010 a return to normal with 150k posts is on the cards the second considerable release on wednesday is the ism non manufacturing pmi according to the survey america s services sector is growing at a robust clip the score of 56 9 points reflects rapid growth a minor decline is on the cards now americans are celebrating independence day on thursday and thin liquidity is on the cards allowing traders in other places to get ready for friday s big event the us labor market disappointed in may with an increase of only 75k jobs adding to the case for a rate cut by the fed june s report is projected to show a gain of 165k positions closer to the longer term averages another weak number may open the door to a large rate cut of 50bp in july or perhaps more than one move by the fed on the other hand an increase of over 200k jobs may cast doubt on further interest rate reductions wages have also fallen short of estimations in june with a monthly increase of 0 2 on

washington as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market washington as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion in riches went to the wealthiest 1 figures from the federal reserve show just 25 of it went to middle to upper middle class households the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 in 2016 from roughly 70 in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data and the sharpest increases occurred in richer cities like san francisco where prices have more than doubled in the past decade or phoenix where they ve surged 80 by contrast in lower cost charlotte home prices have risen by only about a third in cleveland by less than one fifth overall in fact middle income households on average now have less home equity than they did before the recession fed data show the other major engine of household wealth the stock market hasn t much benefited most people either the longest bull market in u s history which surpassed its own 10 year mark in march has shot equity prices up more than four fold yet the proportion of middle income households that own shares has actually declined the fed calculates that about half of middle income americans owned shares in 2016 the most recent year for which data is available down from 56 in 2007 that includes people who hold stocks in retirement accounts the decline in stock market participation occurred mainly because more middle income workers took contract work or other jobs that offered no retirement savings plans the fed concluded in other cases people who face major expenses for say health care or who have heavy student loan debt find it hard to save and invest much even if they do have access to retirement accounts many households find it challenging to make key middle class investments because incomes at the middle are not keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership and it is difficult to save enough lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said in a speech in may hannah moore now 37 has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs moore who studied interior design in chicago at a for profit college began job hunting just as many architecture and design firms were downsizing for several years she did freelance design projects and worked in retail jobs sometimes working 30 days without a day off none provided health insurance or a retirement savings plan i had many jobs all at the same time she said it s just not been the easiest of decades if you re trying to jump start a career her situation stabilized when she found full time work in 2013 three years later she moved to los angeles where she works for a design firm that contracts with luxury apartment developers that build rental housing marketed to high tech employees she loves the work but she struggles with los angeles high costs moore says she could afford a monthly mortgage payment but she lacks the savings for a down payment about half her income she calculates is eaten up by rent health insurance and student loan payments of 850 a month as financial inequalities have widened over the past decade racial disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year if wealth inequality has worsened because fewer americans own homes and stocks should the government try to reverse that trend president george w bush spoke optimistically in the 2000s about an ownership society the idea was that a larger proportion of americans would achieve prosperity by buying homes and investing in the stock market through retirement savings plans such discussion has faded since the housing bust many economists argue that what s needed is simply higher incomes so more americans can save and build wealth zucman favours a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals as the wealth gap has widened income gains have remained anemic for americans at all levels for the past decade that is particularly true relative to the sizable pay gains that flowed to households during the robust expansions of the 1980s and 1990s if you compare the economy now to where it was before the recession the most

a false sense of calm data divergence over the past few weeks treasuries and the us dollar have rallied stocks have sold off sequentially other macroeconomic data is signaling that the economy is in trouble but itâ s difficult to gauge how much trouble we are in headline gdp and unemployment figures give a false sense of calm to the markets and we seem to be continuously testing the divergence between bad data and the index price appreciation the stock market goes higher on wordplay at this point right now the u s is throwing a lot of force into the market to keep it on the uptrend whether it s through tweets or formal announcements like powell s pause the us fiscal and monetary policies are deflating the usd we are in a trade dispute with several of our top trading partners and the geopolitical tension keeps growing there is both a bear and bull thesis for the situation moving forward however there is simply not a lot of data priced into the market the most important thing to do moving forward is to simply embrace the chop the bull thesis why we could continue upwards despite all the growth headwinds we could still maintain this ten year bull run earnings growth and profit contraction could trough out over the next 6 months and recover towards the end of the year the fed will provide some support to asset prices through a rate cut global yields are mostly negative which provides incentive to risk on behavior global economic slowdown could bottom out soon and we could see steadiness instead of volatility there could be a potential melt up the light positioning by institutional investors and fund managers could induce side lined money to finally enter the markets finally an overall increase in the money supply would breed greater liquidity the bear thesis why we could go downwards but we could also finally lose the 10 year bull run streak my thinking is that there will either be a large flash crash or a trickle down as we get closer to the 2020 election what i think is that when the nyse composite hits 13 000 we will experience a trend reversal and dip downward source author earnings sales and margins are slowing costs are on the rise but wages are not economic growth is slowing worldwide there is also a large amount of event risk especially from the trade dispute with china if china retaliates devalues their currency etc the u s could experience some economic pain the u s is in a retail slump and there is an overall credit card spending slowdown we are on the brink of an auto recession coupled with a slowing in housing sales and construction there is an earnings recession and 53 of corporate debt is on the bottom tier of investment grade there are several macro themes that could play out poorly as we move forward the job market leading and lagging indicators we have had 9 months in a row of year over year increases in layoffs but that has yet to truly show up in nfp and unemployment rates layoffs are a leading indicator and once the market digests it recession fears could arise the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator meaning that unemployment doesn t predict recessions it s a result of them source liz ann sonders the average span between unemployment rate troughs and recession starts has historically been 6 4 months in 3 of the 5 times that u s unemployment was at its current level the s p 500 peaked within the next ten months simply stated when the unemployment rate has been low for long periods of time as it has been the market is historically near its peak the current unemployment rate has been at less than 3 9 for the past 12 months a peaking of the s p 500 might be around the corner source logan mohtashami looking across the globe weakness abroad the us has the highest debt to gdp ever and just posted a 40 year over year increase in the budget deficit across the globe there are macroeconomic issues 11 countries including south korea japan russia and germany all have pmi numbers below 50 0 the entire eurozone is facing an economic slowdown there is an air freight slowdown and a world trade volume slowdown the trade war could be the cause of some of this especially as a contraction in world trade volumes negatively impact freight and manufacturing tariffs can also decrease consumer spending and compress company profit and revenues the auto industry is already feeling the pain of the increased cost of goods there is also the liquidity problem the federal reserve and the white house are calling for rate cuts when unemployment is below 4 and the stock market is near all time highs if the fed decides to cut rates by 50 bps it might be a repeat of the 1999 redux it could compensate for the trade wars across the globe and trigger inflation to pause the deflation problem we are facing in oil and commodities but at what cost late cycle warnings why rate cuts won t save us andrew sheets latest cross asset playbook notes that trade is one of the three overlapping problems that investors currently face alongside high fed expectations with the market pricing in 75 bps of cuts over the next year source john authers there are several late cycle warning signs as markets are gradually coming alive to the risk that the conflict of china will stretch far beyond tariffs and will be harder to resolve than a trade dispute johnauthers china will fight to the end if the u s insists on escalating the trade dispute the ministry of commerce spokesman gao feng said beijing also warned that a trade war will trigger a recession in the u s and the global economy putin is also unhappy with the u s stating that our relationship with the u s is degrading it s becoming worse and worse the trade war is rippling throughout the world with trump ramping up threats against berlin and their auto industry ireland will be hit three times harder than any other developed nation if the u s decides to impose a blanket trade tariff we are a global nation and this is a global issue conclusion sideways lower into 2020 i don t think that earnings will launch the market higher as the market is expecting flat earnings growth for q2 19 against tough comparison metrics from the tax cut impact of q1 18 the u s china trade war won t be settled anytime soon the fed might not have enough credibility to spur growth again from rate cuts or quantitative easing when the market goes up we will worry about new tariffs and rate hikes when the market goes down we will expect trade war de escalation talk and rate cut talks to cushion the fall my personal thinking we will trade sideways lower into 2020 until we experience a true drop in the meantime it s best to simply embrace the chop
the dollar and offshore chinese yuan rallied on monday after the united states and china agreed to restart their troubled trade talks while the japanese yen and swiss franc were the big casualties as investors sold safe haven currencies while reports of an agreement had been flagged ahead of u s president donald trump and his chinese counterparty xi jinping s meeting on the sidelines of the g20 meeting the outcome was more positive than investors had expected trump said he would hold back on new tariffs and that china will buy more farm products and he offered to ease restrictions on tech company huawei global stocks jumped and investors dumped safe haven assets china s offshore yuan rose more than 0 5 to as high as 6 8165 yuan per dollar near a two month high before easing back to 6 8476 after disappointing factory activity data the dollar which has fallen in recent weeks on rising expectations for federal reserve interest rate cuts rose 0 4 against a basket of currencies its index hitting 96 611 and the highest since june 21 versus the euro the greenback rose 0 4 to 1 1327 the compromise reached between trump and xi at the week s g20 meeting went further than most had expected with trump putting the next tranche of tariffs on hold and reopening us companies ability to supply huawei said rbc s currency strategist adam cole however he cautioned that there remained plenty of scope for trade talks to break down again in the future the japanese yen which investors tend to buy when they are looking for safety dropped 0 6 to as low as 108 53 its weakest since june 19 before settling at 108 31 the swiss franc lost 0 4 versus the euro to 1 1142 francs it also slumped 0 7 against the dollar to 0 9833 the australian dollar sensitive to the economic fortunes of china the country s largest trading partner dropped 0 4 at 0 6995 with the weaker than expected factory data out of china overshadowing the trade ceasefire sterling slipped 0 5 to 1 2638 hurt by the broad dollar rally and after a survey showed britain s manufacturers suffering their sharpest fall in activity in more than six years in june this week sees the release of crucial u s economic data including non farm payrolls on friday and non manufacturing activity on wednesday which should help investors better assess whether the federal reserve will cut interest rates later this month economic data will clearly have a more important role this week and we can t help but think that friday s us employment overview will be a defining moment for july fed rate expectations said bmo capital markets fx strategist stephen gallo source reuters editing by toby chopra and raissa kasolowsky
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by howard schneider washington reuters a now record setting run of u s economic growth enters its 121st month on monday sustained by a decade of low interest rates and massive federal reserve intervention that helped put 22 million people back to work but the real economic recovery may only be in its infancy and if recent history is any guide it could be approaching a delicate moment related stories it was only last year that u s gross domestic product caught up with estimates of its potential surpassing where congressional budget office analysts feel it would have been if the housing bubble hadn t burst in 2007 investment bank lehman brothers had not failed the following year and the world had not cratered into a deep recession the periods when gdp exceeds potential are typically when workers enjoy the greatest wage gains and members of historically sidelined communities find jobs in recent years those periods have not lasted long a fact that fed and other officials are wrestling with as they weigh possible interest rate cuts and assess just where the u s economy now stands we re only now making up ground even though the economy has been growing since june 2009 the month the national bureau of economic research marked as the trough of the last recession said vincent reinhart chief economist at mellon the approach of the decade long expansion mark has boosted speculation about how much longer the recovery might last whether a recession is inevitable in the next couple of years and whether the fed and u s government are adequately prepared to fight another downturn for the type of progress fed and elected officials feel is needed to rebuild middle class incomes it may take several more years the 2007 2009 recession wiped 600 billion dollars from u s gdp on an inflation adjusted basis it created an even bigger gap of close to 1 trillion between u s output and the economy s potential based on its population industrial base and other factors according to estimates created annually by the cbo those estimates dating back to the years just after world war two show a pattern that labor advocates argue should make the u s central bank willing to take some risks on behalf of wage earners for most of the time since 1949 178 of 281 quarters as measured by the cbo the economy has been below potential yet it is only during sustained periods when it operates above potential that workers claw back a higher share of the country s economic output that happened consistently in the decade or two immediately following world war two and most notably in the late 1960s when a six year run of output above potential helped push the share of gdp taken home by workers to close to 65 the only recent comparable era was the late 1990s when gdp stayed above potential for nearly five years and labor s share of national output which had dipped below 60 at that point again rebounded those two eras ended differently one gave way to a period of excessive inflation that led the fed to impose record high interest rates that triggered a recession beginning an era when output took 15 years to crawl back to potential the other was nursed along by a fed that trimmed interest rates at a time and in a way to keep growth on track and ended with only a mild downturn in 2000 for a graphic on a decade of expansion just now gaining ground click new world the central bank which signaled in mid june that it could cut interest rates as early as this month is trying to make a similar read now in hopes of sustaining the sort of tight economy over the several more years needed for workers to gain more ground but the environment has changed in the short term global trade disputes and other risks could slow the economy no matter what the fed does the risk of inflation may be low but so is the expected trend rate of growth in an economy where people are aging and productivity is lagging a drag on workers potential to recover income and wealth inequality and the effects of automation on the workforce have become an increasing concern but so has the risk that keeping interest rates too low might feed the sort of excessive debt that caused the last financial crisis the u s economy has only operated above potential in 12 quarters since 2001 including the last four labor s share of national output at the start of this year was just over 56 in dollar terms about 1 5 trillion short of what it would be at the peak levels in the 1960s and 1990s the expansion may have notched its record but it may take a bit of nerve for the fed to extend a recovery that in many ways is only just starting it feels like a new world with structurally less global demand and structurally less resilience in our economies said nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income that is the nature of the new world that we are in it does make it more complicated

after possibly the best first half of a year ever for world markets investors now find themselves hoping for a familiar fallback to keep the party going central banks wading in with more stimulus despite recent jitters wall street has had a strong 2019 credit ap some are even betting the recent wave of pessimism about the global economic outlook is misplaced despite the possibility of a swift end to the newly agreed us china trade truce and bond markets flashing recession warnings few are optimistic enough to expect as stellar a run for markets as in the first six months of 2019 when global equities soared 15 per cent us government bonds returned 7 per cent and commodity prices climbed as central banks promised more stimulus and risks abound not least from trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies and elevated share and bond valuations which may tempt investors to sell and book profits
why wealth gap has grown despite record long economic growth washington as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the great recession began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion in riches went to the wealthiest 1 figures from the federal reserveshow just 25 of it went to middle to upper middle class households the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 in 2016 from roughly 70 in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data and the sharpest increases occurred in richer cities like san francisco where prices have more than doubled in the past decade or phoenix where they ve surged 80 by contrast in lower cost charlotte home prices have risen by only about a third in cleveland by less than one fifth overall in fact middle income households on average now have less home equity than they did before the recession fed data show the other major engine of household wealth the stock market hasn t much benefited most people either the longest bull market in u s history which surpassed its own 10 year mark in march has shot equity prices up more than four fold yet the proportion of middle income households that own shares has actually declined the fed calculates that about half of middle income americans owned shares in 2016 the most recent year for which data is available down from 56 in 2007 that includes people who hold stocks in retirement accounts the decline in stock market participation occurred mainly because more middle income workers took contract work or other jobs that offered no retirement savings plans the fed concluded in other cases people who face major expenses for say health care or who have heavy student loan debt find it hard to save and invest much even if they do have access to retirement accounts many households find it challenging to make key middle class investments because incomes at the middle are not keeping up with the rising costs of education and homeownership and it is difficult to save enough lael brainard a member of the federal reserve s board of governors said in a speech in may hannah moore now 37 has struggled to save since graduating from college in december 2007 the same month the great recession officially began she has worked nearly continuously since then despite a couple of layoffs moore who studied interior design in chicago at a for profit college began job hunting just as many architecture and design firms were downsizing for several years she did freelance design projects and worked in retail jobs sometimes working 30 days without a day off none provided health insurance or a retirement savings plan i had many jobs all at the same time she said it s just not been the easiest of decades if you re trying to jump start a career her situation stabilized when she found full time work in 2013 three years later she moved to los angeles where she works for a design firm that contracts with luxury apartment developers that build rental housing marketed to high tech employees she loves the work but she struggles with los angeles high costs moore says she could afford a monthly mortgage payment but she lacks the savings for a down payment about half her income she calculates is eaten up by rent health insurance and student loan payments of 850 a month as financial inequalities have widened over the past decade racial disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year if wealth inequality has worsened because fewer americans own homes and stocks should the government try to reverse that trend president george w bush spoke optimistically in the 2000s about an ownership society the idea was that a larger proportion of americans would achieve prosperity by buying homes and investing in the stock market through retirement savings plans such discussion has faded since the housing bust many economists argue that what s needed is simply higher incomes so more americans can save and build wealth zucman favors a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate sen elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals as the wealth gap has widened income gains have remained anemic for americans at all levels for the past decade that is particularly true relative to the sizable pay gains that flowed to households during the robust expansions of the 1980s and 1990s if you compare the economy now to where it was before the recession the most important fact has been its relatively slow growth said jason furman an economist at harvard university and a former top adviser to president barack obama data compiled by zucman saez and thomas piketty show that incomes grew much faster for the top 1 in the 1980s and the 1990s than over the past decade yet inequality has captured much more attention now than it did then in part that may be because middle class and poorer americans haven t enjoyed the fruits of this expansion compared with other recoveries incomes for middle class americans grew nearly twice as fast in the 1980s expansion and about 1 5 times faster in the 1990s than in the current recovery for many people inequality carries less sting when their own fortunes improve the more people are struggling to make ends meet themselves the more they may notice inequality said elise gould an economist at the liberal economic policy institute income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving them little pressure to raise pay not until 2016 did the unemployment rate fall below 5 average hourly pay finally began to pick up with the lowest income workers receiving the fastest average gains though this trend has helped narrow income inequality vast disparities remain overall there s growing inequality gould said with signs of hope at the bottom it s just taken a very long time
everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by howard schneider washington reuters a now record setting run of u s economic growth enters its 121st month on monday sustained by a decade of low interest rates and massive federal reserve intervention that helped put 22 million people back to work but the real economic recovery may only be in its infancy and if recent history is any guide it could be approaching a delicate moment related stories it was only last year that u s gross domestic product caught up with estimates of its potential surpassing where congressional budget office analysts feel it would have been if the housing bubble hadn t burst in 2007 investment bank lehman brothers had not failed the following year and the world had not cratered into a deep recession the periods when gdp exceeds potential are typically when workers enjoy the greatest wage gains and members of historically sidelined communities find jobs in recent years those periods have not lasted long a fact that fed and other officials are wrestling with as they weigh possible interest rate cuts and assess just where the u s economy now stands we re only now making up ground even though the economy has been growing since june 2009 the month the national bureau of economic research marked as the trough of the last recession said vincent reinhart chief economist at mellon the approach of the decade long expansion mark has boosted speculation about how much longer the recovery might last whether a recession is inevitable in the next couple of years and whether the fed and u s government are adequately prepared to fight another downturn for the type of progress fed and elected officials feel is needed to rebuild middle class incomes it may take several more years the 2007 2009 recession wiped 600 billion dollars from u s gdp on an inflation adjusted basis it created an even bigger gap of close to 1 trillion between u s output and the economy s potential based on its population industrial base and other factors according to estimates created annually by the cbo those estimates dating back to the years just after world war two show a pattern that labor advocates argue should make the u s central bank willing to take some risks on behalf of wage earners for most of the time since 1949 178 of 281 quarters as measured by the cbo the economy has been below potential yet it is only during sustained periods when it operates above potential that workers claw back a higher share of the country s economic output that happened consistently in the decade or two immediately following world war two and most notably in the late 1960s when a six year run of output above potential helped push the share of gdp taken home by workers to close to 65 the only recent comparable era was the late 1990s when gdp stayed above potential for nearly five years and labor s share of national output which had dipped below 60 at that point again rebounded those two eras ended differently one gave way to a period of excessive inflation that led the fed to impose record high interest rates that triggered a recession beginning an era when output took 15 years to crawl back to potential the other was nursed along by a fed that trimmed interest rates at a time and in a way to keep growth on track and ended with only a mild downturn in 2000 for a graphic on a decade of expansion just now gaining ground click new world the central bank which signaled in mid june that it could cut interest rates as early as this month is trying to make a similar read now in hopes of sustaining the sort of tight economy over the several more years needed for workers to gain more ground but the environment has changed in the short term global trade disputes and other risks could slow the economy no matter what the fed does the risk of inflation may be low but so is the expected trend rate of growth in an economy where people are aging and productivity is lagging a drag on workers potential to recover income and wealth inequality and the effects of automation on the workforce have become an increasing concern but so has the risk that keeping interest rates too low might feed the sort of excessive debt that caused the last financial crisis the u s economy has only operated above potential in 12 quarters since 2001 including the last four labor s share of national output at the start of this year was just over 56 in dollar terms about 1 5 trillion short of what it would be at the peak levels in the 1960s and 1990s the expansion may have notched its record but it may take a bit of nerve for the fed to extend a recovery that in many ways is only just starting it feels like a new world with structurally less global demand and structurally less resilience in our economies said nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income that is the nature of the new world that we are in it does make it more complicated

by howard schneider washington reuters a now record setting run of u s economic growth enters its 121st month on monday sustained by a decade of low interest rates and massive federal reserve intervention that helped put 22 million people back to work but the real economic recovery may only be in its infancy and if recent history is any guide it could be approaching a delicate moment it was only last year that u s gross domestic product caught up with estimates of its potential surpassing where congressional budget office analysts feel it would have been if the housing bubble hadn t burst in 2007 investment bank lehman brothers hadn t failed the following year and the world had not cratered into a deep recession the periods when gdp exceeds potential are typically when workers enjoy the greatest wage gains and members of historically sidelined communities find jobs in recent years those periods have not lasted long a fact that fed and other officials are wrestling with as they weigh possible interest rate cuts and assess just where the u s economy now stands we re only now making up ground even though the economy has been growing since june 2009 the month the national bureau of economic research marked as the trough of the last recession said vincent reinhart chief economist at mellon the approach of the decade long expansion mark has boosted speculation about how much longer the recovery might last whether a recession is inevitable in the next couple of years and whether the fed and u s government are adequately prepared to fight another downturn for the type of progress fed and elected officials feel is needed to rebuild middle class incomes it may take several more years the 2007 2009 recession wiped 600 billion dollars from u s gdp on an inflation adjusted basis it created an even bigger gap of close to 1 trillion between u s output and the economy s potential based on its population industrial base and other factors according to estimates created annually by the cbo those estimates dating back to the years just after world war two show a pattern that labor advocates argue should make the u s central bank willing to take some risks on behalf of wage earners for most of the time since 1949 178 of 281 quarters as measured by the cbo the economy has been below potential yet it is only during sustained periods when it operates above potential that workers claw back a higher share of the country s economic output that happened consistently in the decade or two immediately following world war two and most notably in the late 1960s when a six year run of output above potential helped push the share of gdp taken home by workers to close to 65 the only recent comparable era was the late 1990s when gdp stayed above potential for nearly five years and labor s share of national output which had dipped below 60 at that point again rebounded those two eras ended differently one gave way to a period of excessive inflation that led the fed to impose record high interest rates that triggered a recession beginning an era when output took 15 years to crawl back to potential the other was nursed along by a fed that trimmed interest rates at a time and in a way to keep growth on track and ended with only a mild downturn in 2000 new world the central bank which signaled in mid june that it could cut interest rates as early as this month is trying to make a similar read now in hopes of sustaining the sort of tight economy over the several more years needed for workers to gain more ground but the environment has changed in the short term global trade disputes and other risks could slow the economy no matter what the fed does the risk of inflation may be low but so is the expected trend rate of growth in an economy where people are aging and productivity is lagging a drag on workers potential to recover income and wealth inequality and the effects of automation on the workforce have become an increasing concern but so has the risk that keeping interest rates too low might feed the sort of excessive debt that caused the last financial crisis the u s economy has only operated above potential in 12 quarters since 2001 including the last four labor s share of national output at the start of this year was just over 56 in dollar terms about 1 5 trillion short of what it would be at the peak levels in the 1960s and 1990s the expansion may have notched its record but it may take a bit of nerve for the fed to extend a recovery that in many ways is only just starting it feels like a new world with structurally less global demand and structurally less resilience in our economies said nathan sheets chief economist at pgim fixed income that is the nature of the new world that we are in it does make it more complicated

one way banks cover no transactions fees atms is by giving consumers the option to pay in a user s home currency even some bankers warn against consumers against doing this a record number of tourists and business travelers visited another country in 2016 and this year is already on pace to exceed that tally one thing you definitely need when traveling abroad besides a passport is local currency such as euros in europe yen in japan or rubles in russia in the past travelers would typically withdraw what they need from an atm in the country they re visiting or simply use a credit card letting their bank calculate the cost in their home currency at roughly the market rate there was usually also a foreign transaction fee increasingly however retailers restaurants and atms are offering travelers the option to pay or withdraw money in terms immediately converted into their home currency companies offering the service call it dynamic currency conversion for example an american tourist visiting paris is able to use her credit card to pay for a fancy meal at a french bistro in u s dollars instead of euros advertisement this may seem innocuous or even convenient but agreeing to use your home currency in a foreign land can significantly inflate the cost of every purchase thinking a bit more like an economist can help you avoid this mistake and save a lot of money surge in tourists a century ago international travel was only for the rich these days almost anyone from an industrialized country can see a bit of the world on a budget while people commonly complain about high airfares the real cost of flying has never been less expensive it s half what it was in the early 80 s or safer and that s one reason why a record 1 24 billion people visited another country in 2016 naturally financial firms have sought to capitalize on all this wandering by inventing ever more ways to separate travelers from their hard earned money buying things abroad tourists rely on credit debit or atm cards to pay for hotels restaurant meals and local trinkets a complex international computer network checks if a card is valid for the transaction and transfers the money traditionally to help pay for this banks and credit card companies have charged customers a foreign transaction fee however banks are now offering more cards with no foreign transaction fees at the same time free atms are popping up around the world that don t charge local transaction fees though your own bank may still do so so how do banks cover the costs of these transactions if they are increasingly letting consumers use the system for free one way is offering the option to pay in a user s home currency even some bankers warn against consumers doing this because the exchange rate used is much worse than the one your bank would offer for example say you re a spaniard visiting new york city and shopping for some clothes at a department store after scouring the store for the right sweater for your mother you go to the cashier to pay the us 50 bill tax included after you swipe your spanish credit card which boasts no foreign transaction fee the cashier asks if you d like to pay in euros instead of dollars if you stick with dollars your bank would convert the price into euros at about the market rate 43 at the moment if you choose to pay in euros however the currency conversion includes a fee for the privilege which may be as much as 10 percentage points so you might end up paying about 47 instead the same thing happens with atms i was recently in london s heathrow airport and needed some british pounds in the old days an atm would simply offer a few denomination options issue me money and my bank at home would eventually calculate the cost in u s dollars instead the airport atm asked me if i wanted to lock in the exchange rate and know exactly how many dollars would be debited from my bank account i wanted 100 and tried two different atms the currency rate offered in dollars ranged from almost 4 percent to 10 percent more than what my bank charged or about 134 to 142 i rejected both offers did the transaction in the local currency and ended up with a total charge of just 129 from my bank i have observed numerous international travelers as they made this choice such as an italian family arguing about it at the next atm and most chose the dynamic conversion into their own currencies so why do travelers pay more by accepting a worse exchange rate when they could simply say no jay zagorsky cc by sa three functions of money economists consider any item as money if it performs three different functions unit of account store of value and medium of exchange two out of three explain why so many international travelers act the way they do the first function of money is a unit of account which is how people post and keep track of prices this is why banks and credit card companies get people to agree to pay in the currency where they live instead of using local money when people travel to a country with a different currency they often mentally keep track of their spending using their home currency converting all prices in their heads as they shop and eat if an atm or credit card terminal asks if you want to pay for something in the currency you use as your unit of account your brain says yes money also acts as a store of value items used as money provide the ability to make purchases now and also in the future at the end of a trip travelers not planning on returning to a country tend to spend leftover money in airports buying things they don t really want they don t want to hold onto foreign bills since they are not a store of value for the same reason they prefer to be charged in their home currency when getting money from an atm money is also a medium of exchange which is anything readily acceptable as payment to buy or sell goods and services this is why people have to convert money when they travel abroad in new york city a dollar bill is a medium of exchange for food drink or a ride on the subway however those dollars are not a medium of exchange in say china where waving a wad of greenbacks would mostly get you stares and that s why travelers must convert money from one currency to another how to save money abroad when faced with an atm or credit card machine that asks if you want to convert to your home currency i recommend you decline especially if you went to the pain and effort to ensure you have a card or bank with no extra foreign exchange fees even if you don t have one and your debt card charges a fee in most cases it still makes sense to use the local currency an exception to this rule of course is if your bank or credit card charges a very high fixed foreign exchange fee and you need only a little bit of money if this is your case then saying yes might save you money even if you get a poor exchange rate the main thing is think it through resist your natural inclination to say yes just because it makes you feel comfortable don t be fooled when asked if you want to complete a transaction using your home currency using the local currency can save you money making your next trip abroad less costly jay l zagorsky economist and research scientist the ohio state university this article was originally published on the conversation and is
