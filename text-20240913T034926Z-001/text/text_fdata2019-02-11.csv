powell s interest rate hikes pause won√¢ t save stocks jerome powell threw wall street a lifeline recently when he decided to temporarily take a pause with the fed s rate hiking campaign the fed head also indicated that the process of credit destruction known as quantitative tightening may soon be brought to an end this move towards donning a dovish plume caused the total value of equities to soar back to a level that is now 137 of gdp for some context that valuation is over 30 percentage points higher than it was at the start of great recession and over 90 percentage points greater than 1985 so the salient question for investors is will a slightly dovish fomc be enough to support the massively overvalued market the s p 500 is now trading at over 16x forward earnings but the growth rate of that earnings will plunge from over 20 last year to a minus 0 8 in q1 of this year according to factset it might have made sense to pay 19x earnings back in 2018 because it was justified by a commensurate rate of earnings growth but only a fool would pay 16x or 17x earnings if growth is actually negative the only reason why that would make sense is if investors were convinced eps growth was about to soar back towards the unusually strong rate of growth enjoyed last year and for that to be the case several stars have to align perfectly the structural problems that are leading to sharp slowdowns in europe china and japan all have to be resolved favorably and in a very short period of time and of course global central banks begin another round of massive and coordinated of qe in addition the trade war must also be resolved quickly and in a way that does not inflict any further damage to the ailing economy in china not only does china have to agree on a myriad of concessions including eliminating its trade surplus with the u s and renouncing its practice of intellectual property theft but the communist nation must also agree to subject itself to rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms not only this but any eventual deal must be constructed in a way that ensures increasing china s dependence on imports does not negatively affect domestic production additionally china s government must be able to re stimulate its growth by forcing yet more debt upon its economy which is already so overleveraged that it has begun to crash in addition the chaos that surrounds washington must abate quickly this means future government shutdowns must be averted and that there will not be presidential indictments from the soon to be released mueller probe also the upcoming conflagrations and brinksmanship over funding the government and increasing the debt ceiling must not adversely affect consumer sentiment but by far the most important of all these factors is the fed it must turn out to be the case that the previous 9 rate hikes and 500 billion worth of currency destruction through qt haven t already been enough to push the economy and stock market over the edge especially in view of the fact that the balance sheet reduction process is still ongoing it is prudent to point out that the fed last stopped raising rates in the summer of 2006 but that certainly didn t turn out to be the all clear sign for the economy a mere twelve months later the stock market began to crash and 18 months after the fed s last hike the real estate crisis and great recession began back in 2006 the global economy was booming with growth of over 4 in sharp contrast today we have parts of europe in a recession while japan s gdp is contracting there is now a sharp slowdown in china from well over 10 growth in 2006 to the 6 range today also the u s economy has slowed from 4 2 in q2 of last year to around 1 at the start of this year the point here is the world isn t growing like it was 13 years ago or even where it was a year ago it is now teetering on recession this means there is a huge difference between the point in which the fed is going dovish this time around if you can indeed categorize a dovish fed as one that is still in the process of destroying 10 s of billions of dollars each month through its reverse qe program it is true that the fed stopped hiking the funds rate at 5 25 back in 2006 while today it is just below 2 5 therefore wall street shills take solace in the fact that rates are at a lower point now than they were in the last hiking cycle so they conclude with an alacrity that today s level of interest rates will turn out to be innocuous however as already mentioned stock prices are much higher relative to gdp today than in 2006 and debt levels today dwarf what was evident at the start of the great recession the fact is that total non financial debt in the u s has surged from 33 3t 231 of gdp at the start of the great recession in december of 2007 to 51 3t 249 of gdp as of q3 2018 the bottom line is the economy is lugging around an extra 18 trillion of debt that it has to service on top of what it could not bear a decade ago therefore it is logical to conclude after raising the fed funds rate 9 times since december 2015 and also for the first time in history destroying 500 billion from its quantitative tightening program that the fed has already tightened enough to send earnings and gdp into a recession despite the sharp slowdown in the global economy the perma bulls dismiss the idea of an earnings recession that lasts more than one quarter this is primarily because the fed has gone on hold with its monetary policy however this ignores the earnings recession that occurred only a few years back the s p 500 eps for the calendar year 2014 was 119 06 for 2015 it was 118 76 and for 2016 it was 119 31 it should be noted that the earnings recession of 2014 2016 occurred in a much more favorable macroeconomic environment the ecb was still in the throes of its qe program the fed funds rate was 200 basis points lower the trade war had not yet begun the fed s reverse qe program was still another year off and the fed s balance sheet was a half trillion dollars larger yet the earnings recession still happened and the stock market went absolutely nowhere for two full years with a couple of steep double digit percentage point drops mixed in the earnings recession was only bailed out by trump s massive corporate tax cut an unprecedented stimulus package from china and global qe that was spitting out around 100 billion of monetary confetti each month but those conditions are not likely to be repeated and that means that the global economy must stand on its own debt disabled legs for the first time in over a decade sadly it should end up taking much more than an abeyance with rate hikes to levitate stock prices after this next plunge in asset prices the fed will be quickly cutting interest rates back to zero percent and all global central banks will be forced to re engage with a massive protracted and record breaking round of qe this will also be combined with a humongous global fiscal stimulus package that will serve to push bankrupt nations further into insolvency it may be possible to rescue the stock market in nominal terms using this type of fiscal and monetary madness however it also means the already endangered middle class will take a giant step towards extinction and this is why the timing of precious metals ownership will be more crucial than ever

following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance the strong momentum that we experienced in first quarter has continued into the second quarter where we delivered our highest quarterly level of revenues and adjusted ebitda in the company s history we also reached a company milestone with opening our 100th branch during the quarter to put this in perspective we have grown our branch network a compounded annual growth rate of 11 over the last five years this is the result of our long term strategy of expanding our geographic footprint with a combination of accretive container based acquisitions and greenfield openings we re also closing on our 100 000 units in our rental fleet which has grown at a similar rate over the last five years now turning to our geographic venues our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across all of the sales markets with total revenue in second quarter increasing by 25 year over year driven by both higher sales and leasing revenues sales revenues were up 27 in the quarter mostly due to two large sales in industrial and education sector which contributed approximately 2 million of the 3 6 million increase the remaining increase was spread evenly across all sectors leasing revenues increased by 24 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across all our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results our core portable storage also continue to perform at the high end of our expectations driven by consistent execution and broad based demand across the majority of our end markets demand for our ground level storage continued to show very high demand as these two products generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 30 of which over half was organic growth taking into account all the pac van s product lines organic rental revenue growth was 17 for the quarter and 18 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing our business plan including gain traction on a number of initiatives such as our national account program our online ordering capabilities and our recent introduction of pv 3 safety containers we are particularly excited about this new innovative product which offers the industry s only emergency exit feature as well as an upgraded option to including tier solar powered lighting pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customer base and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 84 for the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business particularly into adjacent markets during the second quarter we completed one acquisition in new hampshire increasing our presence in the new england region we also opened a greenfield location in tampa florida adding our fourth branch in florida we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the us and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid container business in north america once again delivered a very strong quarter generating year over year leasing revenues and adjusted ebitda growth of 37 and 57 respectively while oil and gas production activity in the both permian and eagle ford basins remained healthy the increase in volatility in oil prices during the quarter created caution among some of our customers as a result we had a small decline in fleet utilization our north american manufacturing operations posted a 29 year over year increase in sales to external customers and delivered its fifth quarter in a row of positive stand alone ebitda this ongoing improvement is due to increased demand in especially tanks and other steel related products now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum posting second quarter growth in leasing revenues of 9 in local currency basis marking its ninth year over year increase over last 10 quarters sales revenues were down year over year due to two large sales that occurred last year in second quarter that were not repeated this year excluding the impact of those two transactions sales revenues would have increased by 30 in local currency total reported revenues for the quarter in us dollars were adversely impacted by the approximate 7 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in oil wells leasing revenue was spread across almost all of its markets were noticeable increases in construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increase in average units on lease combined with higher average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and as a extent they become available accretive acquisitions during the quarter we opened one additional location in the state of victoria increasing our branch count in asia pacific to 37 to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america and the ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to exceed our goals for this year also providing us with optimism about the future our hardworking employees continue to execute on our proven business strategy and their dedication to the company has led to our outstanding and record breaking financial performance i ll now turn the call over to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we will be filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time the document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal second quarter financial results total revenues were 98 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 92 1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 6 leasing revenues were 63 5 million an increase of approximately 18 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 67 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 60 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 34 5 million in the quarter down from 38 1 million in the second quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the second quarter totaled 63 9 million compared with 51 1 million for the year ago period an increase of 25 increases occurred across all sectors but primarily in the oil and gas commercial and construction sectors revenues in our north american manufacturing operations for the second quarter were 3 6 million including intercompany sales of 946 000 to our north american leasing operation this comparison to 3 5 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 1 4 million as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations saw increased demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the second quarter totaled 31 4 million compared to 38 9 million for the year ago period a decrease of 19 the decrease in revenues was driven primarily in the utilities and transportation sectors as two large sales totaling 10 5 million which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were not repeated this year excluding the impact of these two large sales revenues would have increased by 18 mostly driven by increases in the moving and storage constructions and industrial sectors as jody mentioned total revenues were adversely impacted by the approximate 7 decline in the australian dollar compared to the us dollars between the periods leasing revenues increased by 2 on a year over year basis and 9 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the construction consumer and industrial sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 29 7 million in the quarter compared to 25 2 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 18 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 30 up from 27 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 this was the eight consecutive year quarter excuse me of year over year adjusted ebitda growth it marks the first time in the company s history that we have surpassed 100 million adjusted ebitda mark on a trailing 12 month basis in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 22 million in the second quarter compared to 16 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 38 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 15 4 million up 32 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 6 6 million up 57 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 228 000 for the quarter compared to 73 000 last year s second quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the second quarter was 8 6 million compared to 10 2 million in the year ago period on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda decreased by approximately 9 driven by the absence of the two large sales that occurred in last year s second quarter interest expense for the second quarter was 8 9 million a decrease of 0 5 million from the year ago period the decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense of 1 5 million between the periods in the asia pacific area due to lower average borrowings or lower weighted average interest rate of 8 9 for the second quarter of fiscal year 19 versus 9 9 in the year ago period and a weaker australian dollar in north america interest expense increased by 1 million from the second quarter 2018 mostly due to a higher weighted average interest rate of 7 2 versus 5 9 last year offset somewhat by lower average borrowings between the periods net loss attributable to common shareholders in the second quarter was 5 1 million or 0 17 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 2 1 million or 0 08 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were non cash charges of 9 3 million and 1 7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 18 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for the dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first six months of fiscal 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 30 1 million compared to 18 million in the prior year quarter an increase of 67 now turning to our balance sheet at december 31 the company had a net leverage ratio of 4 times for the trailing 12 months our lowest level in four years the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible at royal wolf and of course our strong financial performance also during the quarter we paid off the entire filo portion of our north american credit facility we replaced this higher cost debt with lower cost revolver borrowings in the credit facility which we also amended and expanded freeing up additional borrowing base capacity now turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our excellent operating results in the second quarter and our ongoing positive outlook we are increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2019 so many exchange rates the australian dollar versus the us dollar averages 0 71 during the rest of the rest of the fiscal year we now expect the consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 270 million 290 million and the consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase between 20 and 25 in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur for the remainder of the fiscal year this now concludes our prepared comments i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brent thielman with da davidson brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks good morning jody e miller director chief executive officer and president good morning charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson co analyst hey jody it seems like the liquid containment business was pretty immune to the commodity price swings in the quarter that you did talk about some impact utilization rates has that deepened or is it stabilized since quarter end maybe just an update on where the market is there jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i think it stabilized to be honest a lot of the change that we saw as we had some consolidation of our customer base it took a couple of months to get that kind of sorted out and there s typically always a little bit of the seasonal downturn after thanksgiving kind of going into the first calendar quarter where things kind of get caught up but if you look at the rig counts and activity i think it s pretty stable and our levels are gradually kind of coming back brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay and then i guess outside of oil and gas i mean it seems like most of the engines are humming here in pac van can you just talk about maybe some of the best markets for you around the country and we are seeing particular pockets of strength jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i would say to be honest it s pretty much universal across the board i think the team has done a great job with the strategy and carrying out the business plan and we ve really seen good trends across the us there is not really any real high down spots real high spots as well it s been very consistent and the team has done its good job executing and we continue to see a very positive outlook on the portable storage and office side i think some of our new products also evaded in some of the increase brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay and then i guess my last question jody just in the asia pacific i guess as you think about the outlook and the guidance how confident are you that you can kind of maintain that decent revenue growth call it local currency just kind of seems like the australian economy could feel the brunt at a slower china economy here jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah we haven t seen much and there is some huge infrastructure builds that should help in the coming quarters as well but key drive around those markets there is tower cranes and just a tremendous amount of construction activity containers are very accepted in that market so there is a very high demand for the use of containers across the board in almost all sectors so we feel like it s going to be pretty consistent we feel like there is upside on the building construction side the infrastructure piece should help us so we re pretty confident that the inaudible sustain their current path brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay thank you jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger with oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst thank you hey good morning guys jody e miller director chief executive officer and president good morning scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst chuck i guess if we could start what would you say the primary drivers across the whole company of the increased guidance and outlook in obviously parts of the strong quarter it look like things really improved across the board but i want to to hear just kind of inaudible what you think were the main drivers of what pushed you higher for the year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think certainly in north america i think the economy is solid we ve seen growth across all sectors in particularly product line wise our ground level offices are doing very very well and i ve stated really for the last few quarters that there is much more tailwinds and headwinds so we feel pretty bullish about well where we re going but i would say generally a strong economy jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah scott this is jody i d just say if you look at all of our product lines across the board they re doing very well led by the glo and storage side that all segments are doing very well and trending positive scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst great thanks and on in pac van i ve couple questions there obviously glo has been very successful do you think there we re going to see an industry shift is it just glos are kind of emerging and so they are going to be incremental to what s going on in the industry or might they eat into some other products over time and then secondly jody if you could just talk a little bit to what you saw with seasonal rentals for containers and what that competitive environment looks like thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president sure thanks yeah i mean i think glos are definitely growing in popularity the ease of setup where they can settle in the ground especially for sub contractors they can be moved very easily they don t have to be skirted and anchor those types of things so the glo product itself i think is becoming more and more popular and more widely used the mobile offices we ve not seen any decline there they re very strong and it still continue to do very well also they re just kind of two separate applications that i do think there is a trend in the glo side that becoming more popular all the time and then regarding your seasonal question we did see an increase in seasonal business this year it was back kind of what i would say a normalized level it was a nice increase for the year about 400k or so nothing too drastic but there are still a nice increase in the retail side brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks and just following on that specifically to the seasonal how is pricing in that category for you and then taking a step back how is pricing overall in the pac van segment thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president we continue to see price increases across the board we saw probably a little bit better pricing on the mobile modular side i think the consolidation industry has been good and it helps the industry as well so that s been very positive as well but the storage in glo side had nice increase as well brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks and then just switching over to toward lone star the kind of the same question what re you seeing in pricing you already touched a little bit upon the pause in utilization there what s the pricing environment like as we had a really nice run in oil and gas prices and then had a bit of a hiccup so where does pricing stand and what do you see for the coming quarters jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i would phrase it is more stabilized now we were getting having pretty good success in moving the prices up every quarter and going back and some customers have seen as much as two and three price increases over the last year and a half or so as the market continued to be more positive i would say with oil prices going down beginning of last quarter it kind of put us in a situation not to ask and so we ve kind of seen the pricing kind of stabilize that we see oil and gas continue to be positive then we ll go back and ask for some more price increases but the way i would phrase it right now is kind of stabilize pricing brent thielman d a davidson co analyst all right thanks appreciate you fielding all the questions jody e miller director chief executive officer and president you bet thank you scott operator your next question comes from private investor luis fernandez ph jody e miller director chief executive officer and president thanks luis luis fernandez private investor analyst yes hello good morning jody e miller director chief executive officer and president hey luis luis fernandez private investor analyst hello all right my first question is on free cash flow chuck you mentioned 34 million was that six months or 12 months charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer that s six months luis fernandez private investor analyst okay 6 months for sort of multiple speakers million charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer year to date luis fernandez private investor analyst yeah inaudible on the release you mentioned 19 million in operating cash flow for the six months charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer okay yeah the 19 million that s in the release is the operating activities for gaap whereas the 34 million is the free cash flow luis fernandez private investor analyst right okay just 34 million for six months all right inaudible pretty well right then the other question is on jody you mentioned you guys selling new products i couldn t hear you well on that could you expand on those please jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah so we introduced what we call the pv 3 safety container and the wolf lock in asia pacific it s a new innovative product on the container side it has internal walking mechanisms it s very one handle easy opening unit that s the most impressive thing about it it s got an internal emergency release so if someone were to get locked and or trapped in the container there is one lever to pull and it will release to let you out of the container and it s the only product in the industry like that so we feel like it s going to be very well accepted as far as safety and ease of use and simplicity and security it allows luis fernandez private investor analyst all right and then how much impact do you expect from these new products are they minor or they could be the other jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah so we just rolled out the product not long ago we also rolled out solar lighting because the containers are pretty dark when you open the doors there s no lights so we ve got a innovative products that the panels we can still stack and deliver the units with panels to very nice light kit as well for the units but it s still too early to say that we have high expectations that our thought process is after people see it why wouldn t they want it in the future so we obviously feel like it s going to take off and do very well for us luis fernandez private investor analyst all right good and then finally on pricing on lone star regarding the peak where do you think we re now multiple speakers from 20 yeah sorry jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah so i think so yeah i mean we re not anywhere even close to where we were back in the day i think this first little peak until the oil prices went down i think we were in good shape if oil price stays in the range it is now or a little higher which most are predicting then i think there is more upside on the pricing for sure but if you look at where it is now it s less than two thirds of where it was in the peak and there is a lot of runway ahead if we could get back to those levels but i think it ll be a more steady slower gradual increase it s what we re foreseeing in the future as long as stability is there on pricing luis fernandez private investor analyst okay good and then one last one the derivative cost in the convertible one that goes away going forward right christopher a wilson vice president general counsel and secretary i m sorry luis what was the question on the derivative luis fernandez private investor analyst there is an expense based on the conversion of it that goes away going forward yeah all right christopher a wilson vice president general counsel and secretary no doesn t go away for a while that what derivative represents is a minimum return provision for buys in capital on the shares on the convertible note it s 1 75 and so until they actually sell and realize down the road it s going to stay with us luis fernandez private investor analyst okay all right i thought it was multiple speakers charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer non cash it goes up and down if our stock goes up it will go down luis fernandez private investor analyst okay yeah i thought it would since this was already converted and go away but all right thanks for clarifying christopher a wilson vice president general counsel and secretary sure luis fernandez private investor analyst that s all for me thanks for taking the questions christopher a wilson vice president general counsel and secretary thanks luis thank you jody e miller director chief executive officer and president thank you operator operator instructions our next

yes good morning toby slodden private investor analyst hey congratulations consistently you just did another great quarter so thank you this is kind of a broader based question when you look at the financials to what extent were the finance was affected by their on assuming high demand you saw and like let s call it a disaster prone areas like florida texas and california jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah it was pretty small we obviously deliver units into those areas that were affected but if you look at it as a whole as far as affecting the full company numbers it was very minimal but obviously we try to service that area as best we can and help the folks out and optimize the opportunity but if you look at it as a whole it s not a large piece at all very small toby slodden private investor analyst were you surprised by that jody e miller director chief executive officer and president in regards to the impact or the toby slodden private investor analyst yes yeah just a little bit i would have expected to see a larger impact jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah it takes a while on those rebuilds we ve always found that you don t see 100s and 100s of units going out day one we ve set up drop yards there in the panama city area we ve also added resources and added equipment at a fast pace but when you re looking at a company that s got 60 some ranches in the us and the volume that we do even several 100s units even 1 000 units going out for an isolated area it s still not a huge impact overall but it s obviously something we re going to try to optimize the best we can but and we re definitely are we re adding heading yards and equipment to service that area put through the rebuild that s going to happen for a long time it s not something that just toby slodden private investor analyst okay thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah toby slodden private investor

begin with a brief discussion of our operations and then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide a financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance the strong momentum that we experienced in first quarter has continued into the second quarter where we delivered our highest quarterly level of revenues and adjusted ebitda in the company s history we also reached a company milestone with opening our 100th branch during the quarter to put this in perspective we have grown our branch network a compounded annual growth rate of 11 over the last five years this is the result of our long term strategy of expanding our geographic footprint with a combination of accretive container based acquisitions and greenfield openings we re also closing on our 100 000 units in our rental fleet which has grown at a similar rate over the last five years now turning to our geographic venues our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across all of the sales markets with total revenue in second quarter increasing by 25 year over year driven by both higher sales and leasing revenues sales revenues were up 27 in the quarter mostly due to two large sales in industrial and education sector which contributed approximately 2 million of the 3 6 million increase the remaining increase was spread evenly across all sectors leasing revenues increased by 24 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across all our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results our core portable storage also continue to perform at the high end of our expectations driven by consistent execution and broad based demand across the majority of our end markets demand for our ground level storage continued to show very high demand as these two products generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 30 of which over half was organic growth taking into account all the pac van s product lines organic rental revenue growth was 17 for the quarter and 18 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing our business plan including gain traction on a number of initiatives such as our national account program our online ordering capabilities and our recent introduction of pv 3 safety containers we are particularly excited about this new innovative product which offers the industry s only emergency exit feature as well as an upgraded option to including tier solar powered lighting pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customer base and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 84 for the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business particularly into adjacent markets during the second quarter we completed one acquisition in new hampshire increasing our presence in the new england region we also opened a greenfield location in tampa florida adding our fourth branch in florida we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the us and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid container business in north america once again delivered a very strong quarter generating year over year leasing revenues and adjusted ebitda growth of 37 and 57 respectively while oil and gas production activity in the both permian and eagle ford basins remained healthy the increase in volatility in oil prices during the quarter created caution among some of our customers as a result we had a small decline in fleet utilization our north american manufacturing operations posted a 29 year over year increase in sales to external customers and delivered its fifth quarter in a row of positive stand alone ebitda this ongoing improvement is due to increased demand in especially tanks and other steel related products now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum posting second quarter growth in leasing revenues of 9 in local currency basis marking its ninth year over year increase over last 10 quarters sales revenues were down year over year due to two large sales that occurred last year in second quarter that were not repeated this year excluding the impact of those two transactions sales revenues would have increased by 30 in local currency total reported revenues for the quarter in us dollars were adversely impacted by the approximate 7 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in oil wells leasing revenue was spread across almost all of its markets were noticeable increases in construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increase in average units on lease combined with higher average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and as a extent they become available accretive acquisitions during the quarter we opened one additional location in the state of victoria increasing our branch count in asia pacific to 37 to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america and the ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to exceed our goals for this year also providing us with optimism about the future our hardworking employees continue to execute on our proven business strategy and their dedication to the company has led to our outstanding and record breaking financial performance i ll now turn the call over to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we will be filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time the document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal second quarter financial results total revenues were 98 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 92 1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 6 leasing revenues were 63 5 million an increase of approximately 18 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 67 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 60 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 34 5 million in the quarter down from 38 1 million in the second quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the second quarter totaled 63 9 million compared with 51 1 million for the year ago period an increase of 25 increases occurred across all sectors but primarily in the oil and gas commercial and construction sectors revenues in our north american manufacturing operations for the second quarter were 3 6 million including intercompany sales of 946 000 to our north american leasing operation this comparison to 3 5 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 1 4 million as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations saw increased demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the second quarter totaled 31 4 million compared to 38 9 million for the year ago period a decrease of 19 the decrease in revenues was driven primarily in the utilities and transportation sectors as two large sales totaling 10 5 million which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 were not repeated this year excluding the impact of these two large sales revenues would have increased by 18 mostly driven by increases in the moving and storage constructions and industrial sectors as jody mentioned total revenues were adversely impacted by the approximate 7 decline in the australian dollar compared to the us dollars between the periods leasing revenues increased by 2 on a year over year basis and 9 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the construction consumer and industrial sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 29 7 million in the quarter compared to 25 2 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 18 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 30 up from 27 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 this was the eight consecutive year quarter excuse me of year over year adjusted ebitda growth it marks the first time in the company s history that we have surpassed 100 million adjusted ebitda mark on a trailing 12 month basis in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 22 million in the second quarter compared to 16 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 38 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 15 4 million up 32 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 6 6 million up 57 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 228 000 for the quarter compared to 73 000 last year s second quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the second quarter was 8 6 million compared to 10 2 million in the year ago period on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda decreased by approximately 9 driven by the absence of the two large sales that occurred in last year s second quarter interest expense for the second quarter was 8 9 million a decrease of 0 5 million from the year ago period the decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense of 1 5 million between the periods in the asia pacific area due to lower average borrowings or lower weighted average interest rate of 8 9 for the second quarter of fiscal year 19 versus 9 9 in the year ago period and a weaker australian dollar in north america interest expense increased by 1 million from the second quarter 2018 mostly due to a higher weighted average interest rate of 7 2 versus 5 9 last year offset somewhat by lower average borrowings between the periods net loss attributable to common shareholders in the second quarter was 5 1 million or 0 17 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 2 1 million or 0 08 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were non cash charges of 9 3 million and 1 7 million in fiscal years 2019 and 18 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for the dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first six months of fiscal 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 30 1 million compared to 18 million in the prior year quarter an increase of 67 now turning to our balance sheet at december 31 the company had a net leverage ratio of 4 times for the trailing 12 months our lowest level in four years the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible at royal wolf and of course our strong financial performance also during the quarter we paid off the entire filo portion of our north american credit facility we replaced this higher cost debt with lower cost revolver borrowings in the credit facility which we also amended and expanded freeing up additional borrowing base capacity now turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our excellent operating results in the second quarter and our ongoing positive outlook we are increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2019 so many exchange rates the australian dollar versus the us dollar averages 0 71 during the rest of the rest of the fiscal year we now expect the consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 270 million 290 million and the consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase between 20 and 25 in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur for the remainder of the fiscal year this now concludes our prepared comments i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of brent thielman with da davidson brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks good morning jody e miller director chief executive officer and president good morning charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent brent thielman d a davidson co analyst hey jody it seems like the liquid containment business was pretty immune to the commodity price swings in the quarter that you did talk about some impact utilization rates has that deepened or is it stabilized since quarter end maybe just an update on where the market is there jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i think it stabilized to be honest a lot of the change that we saw as we had some consolidation of our customer base it took a couple of months to get that kind of sorted out and there s typically always a little bit of the seasonal downturn after thanksgiving kind of going into the first calendar quarter where things kind of get caught up but if you look at the rig counts and activity i think it s pretty stable and our levels are gradually kind of coming back brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay and then i guess outside of oil and gas i mean it seems like most of the engines are humming here in pac van can you just talk about maybe some of the best markets for you around the country and we are seeing particular pockets of strength jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i would say to be honest it s pretty much universal across the board i think the team has done a great job with the strategy and carrying out the business plan and we ve really seen good trends across the us there is not really any real high down spots real high spots as well it s been very consistent and the team has done its good job executing and we continue to see a very positive outlook on the portable storage and office side i think some of our new products also evaded in some of the increase brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay and then i guess my last question jody just in the asia pacific i guess as you think about the outlook and the guidance how confident are you that you can kind of maintain that decent revenue growth call it local currency just kind of seems like the australian economy could feel the brunt at a slower china economy here jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah we haven t seen much and there is some huge infrastructure builds that should help in the coming quarters as well but key drive around those markets there is tower cranes and just a tremendous amount of construction activity containers are very accepted in that market so there is a very high demand for the use of containers across the board in almost all sectors so we feel like it s going to be pretty consistent we feel like there is upside on the building construction side the infrastructure piece should help us so we re pretty confident that the inaudible sustain their current path brent thielman d a davidson co analyst okay thank you jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah operator your next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger with oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst thank you hey good morning guys jody e miller director chief executive officer and president good morning scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst chuck i guess if we could start what would you say the primary drivers across the whole company of the increased guidance and outlook in obviously parts of the strong quarter it look like things really improved across the board but i want to to hear just kind of inaudible what you think were the main drivers of what pushed you higher for the year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think certainly in north america i think the economy is solid we ve seen growth across all sectors in particularly product line wise our ground level offices are doing very very well and i ve stated really for the last few quarters that there is much more tailwinds and headwinds so we feel pretty bullish about well where we re going but i would say generally a strong economy jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah scott this is jody i d just say if you look at all of our product lines across the board they re doing very well led by the glo and storage side that all segments are doing very well and trending positive scott schneeberger oppenheimer co inc analyst great thanks and on in pac van i ve couple questions there obviously glo has been very successful do you think there we re going to see an industry shift is it just glos are kind of emerging and so they are going to be incremental to what s going on in the industry or might they eat into some other products over time and then secondly jody if you could just talk a little bit to what you saw with seasonal rentals for containers and what that competitive environment looks like thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president sure thanks yeah i mean i think glos are definitely growing in popularity the ease of setup where they can settle in the ground especially for sub contractors they can be moved very easily they don t have to be skirted and anchor those types of things so the glo product itself i think is becoming more and more popular and more widely used the mobile offices we ve not seen any decline there they re very strong and it still continue to do very well also they re just kind of two separate applications that i do think there is a trend in the glo side that becoming more popular all the time and then regarding your seasonal question we did see an increase in seasonal business this year it was back kind of what i would say a normalized level it was a nice increase for the year about 400k or so nothing too drastic but there are still a nice increase in the retail side brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks and just following on that specifically to the seasonal how is pricing in that category for you and then taking a step back how is pricing overall in the pac van segment thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president we continue to see price increases across the board we saw probably a little bit better pricing on the mobile modular side i think the consolidation industry has been good and it helps the industry as well so that s been very positive as well but the storage in glo side had nice increase as well brent thielman d a davidson co analyst thanks and then just switching over to toward lone star the kind of the same question what re you seeing in pricing you already touched a little bit upon the pause in utilization there what s the pricing environment like as we had a really nice run in oil and gas prices and then had a bit of a hiccup so where does pricing stand and what do you see for the coming quarters jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah i would phrase it is more stabilized now we were getting having pretty good success in moving the prices up every quarter and going back and some customers have seen as much as two and three price increases over the last year and a half or so as the market continued to be more positive i would say with oil prices going down beginning of last quarter it kind of put us in a situation not to ask and so we ve kind of seen the pricing kind of stabilize that we see oil and gas continue to be positive then we ll go back and ask for some more price increases but the way i would phrase it right now is kind of stabilize pricing brent thielman d a davidson co analyst all right thanks appreciate you fielding all the questions jody e miller director chief executive officer and president you bet thank you scott operator your next question comes from private investor luis fernandez ph jody e miller director chief executive officer and president thanks luis luis fernandez private investor analyst yes hello good morning

call the pv 3 safety container and the wolf lock in asia pacific it s a new innovative product on the container side it has internal walking mechanisms it s very one handle easy opening unit that s the most impressive thing about it it s got an internal emergency release so if someone were to get locked and or trapped in the container there is one lever to pull and it will release to let you out of the container and it s the only product in the industry like that so we feel like it s going to be very well accepted as far as safety and ease of use and simplicity and security it allows luis fernandez private investor analyst all right and then how much impact do you expect from these new products are they minor or they could be the other jody e miller director chief executive officer and

innovative products that the panels we can still stack and deliver the units with panels to very nice light kit as well for the units but it s still too early to say that we have high expectations

all right good and then finally on pricing on lone star regarding the peak where do you think we re now multiple speakers from 20 yeah sorry jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah so i think so yeah i mean we re not anywhere even close to where we were back in the day i think this first little peak until the oil prices went down i think we were in good shape if

thirds of where it was in the peak and there is a lot of runway ahead if we could get back to those levels but i think it ll be a more steady slower gradual increase it s what we re foreseeing in the future as long as stability is there on pricing luis fernandez private investor analyst okay good and then one last one the derivative cost in the convertible one that goes away going forward right

jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah it takes a while on those rebuilds we ve always found that you don t see 100s and 100s of units going out day one we ve set up drop yards there in the panama city area we ve also added resources and added equipment at a fast pace but when you re looking at a company that s got 60 some ranches in the us and the volume that we do even several 100s units even 1 000 units going out for an isolated area it s still not a huge impact overall but it s obviously something we re going to try to optimize the best we can but and we re definitely are we re adding heading yards and equipment to service that area put through the rebuild that s going to happen for a long time it s not something that just toby slodden private investor analyst okay thanks jody e miller director chief executive officer and president yeah toby slodden private investor analyst thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions i would

news analysis since january the signal released by the chinese communist regime has been very clear it will invest in urban rail transit construction to stimulate the economy a repetition of the old trick used in 2009 whereby the government spent 4 trillion yuan 594 billion to revive the economy all these measures are not intended to serve as the savior of the world economy but to save the chinese economy and to reach the six stabilities the economic growth goals set by the politburo of the chinese communist party central committee in august 2018 they represent stabilities in the areas of employment finance foreign trade foreign investment domestic investment and development targets ever since made in china 2025 became the key target of the u s china trade war in order to cope with the outflow of manufacturing orders the continued economic decline and the increasing unemployment pressure china has to return to the old path of expanding credit and increasing government spending why is chinese economy still hungry for capital after five consecutive rrr cuts the one percent bank reserve requirement ratio rrr cut and the release of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 billion worth of new loans in early january this year was quite mind boggling on top of that an official of the state owned assets supervision and administration commission sasac revealed on jan 16 that the new policy required that the role of government bonds be strengthened as a benchmark financial asset and can be used as quasi currency these have triggered a public outcry china s central bank is practically issuing a credit card directly to ministry of finance now the question is after five consecutive rrr cuts why is china s financial situation still tight and it is necessary to release a large amount of government bonds to serve as quasi currency the answer is china s massive debts have become an unresolvable problem the enormous debts have become a such big mess that even the chinese government has a hard time sorting them out as the amount of debts in 2018 is still an unknown we have to use the 2017 data to analyze and discuss the situation according to official data from the chinese government at the end of 2017 total debt had exceeded 200 trillion yuan 30 trillion china s per capita debt had reached 170 000 yuan about 25 372 and the total debt was a whopping 200 percent of china s gdp estimates by international financial institutions are much more serious an estimate based on some verifiable data from china showed that by the end of 2017 debt to gdp ratio is 364 percent bloomberg surveyed 21 economists in march last year and according to median of their estimates china s total debt will reach 260 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2018 basically unchanged from a year ago corporate bonds and local government debts account for a big percentage of the total debts considering the borrowers ability to repay these debts a serious debt crisis may occur at anytime central bank s rrr cuts are intended to avoid this crisis and they have two purposes one is for the repayment of the debts the other is they hope the expanded credit funds that is the increased release of currency can help boost the real economy for example a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 222 5 billion were released via one percent rrr cut on jan 4 2019 according to a reuters report 900 billion yuan 133 5 billion was used for investments the remaining 600 billion yuan 89 billion was used to pay back maturing medium term lending facility m lf loans to stabilize the financial markets china s development model to stimulate economy through investments has long suffered diminishing marginal utility according to the international monetary fund imf investment funds must be tripled for china to maintain the same economic growth rate as before that is why the financial market is always hungry for additional funds despite central bank s constant quantitative easing policies no way out there are several so called grey rhinoceroses for the chinese economy among them is huge debt from government spending on the construction of railroads roads and airports now that all completed projects of high speed rails and subways are in deep debt why would the national development and reform commission ndrc intensively approve more than 1 2 trillion yuan of urban rail projects in the recent two months and still regard infrastructure as the key to the stable investment for governments the losses of the high speed rail and the subway are verifiable facts since the opening of china s first high speed rail china railway corporation has always been in debt in 2018 the company s debts were as high as over 4 trillion yuan 593 billion some may argue that the high speed rail is not the focus of government investment this year as its focus is on urban rail or subway instead however subways are constantly losing money as well according to a research report the overall development of china s urban rail transit industry by the end of 2016 a total of 43 cities have been approved for the construction of subways with a total planned mileage of about 8 600 kilometers 5 344 miles looking at the level of individual subway routes except for beijing metro line 4 beijing metro airport line and shanghai metro line 1 all other lines are operating at a loss the investment behavior of the chinese regime can never be understood from an economic perspective it needs to be understood from a political perspective for example the slogan of this round of government investment is make up the weak point to achieve stable investment however urban rail projects should not be considered a weak point subways in the first and second tier cities are seriously oversupplied for the 50 third tier cities at least there is no urgent need for subway construction the reason why local governments are vying to build subways is simply because it is a money burning project according to data publicized by zhao chenxi a spokesperson of the ndrc the average cost of subways is about 700 million yuan per kilometer the main source of construction funds is government financial funds and indirect financing the operation mainly relies on financial subsidies so whether it makes a profit or not is not a matter of concern at least for chinese officials once the application for subway construction is approved local government will achieve at least three stability goals stable investment employment and expectations it takes several years to build a subway as long as these officials can achieve those three stabilities during their tenure and ensure local economic growth they will be able to stabilize their official titles or even get promotion that is why chinese local government are wearing new shoes but still taking the same old road the government focuses on exploring underground transportations and keeps spending on infrastructure construction stability depends on whether the u s is willing to let china off the hook the remaining two stabilities are stable foreign trade and stable foreign investment the latter determines the former affected by u s china trade frictions and the slowing economic growth china s trade surplus in 2018 fell by 16 2 percent to a total of 352 billion the lowest since 2013 the most noteworthy is that china s trade surplus with the united states reached 323 billion an increase of 17 percent from the previous year surpassing the historical record of 276 billion in 2017 these data indicate that 90 percent of china s trade surplus in 2018 came from the united states this situation shows how unrealistic it is for the united states to cut off all economic ties with china as proposed by some u s experts and why china must end the trade war as soon as possible china s foreign trade mainly relies on foreign capital funded companies especially taiwanese capital taiwanese businessmen have opened about 100 000 factories and companies in mainland china china s top 10 exports to the united states are all foreign funded enterprises eight of them are taiwanese seventy percent of china s top 100 exports to the u s are foreign funded enterprises 40 percent are taiwanese companies while only 30 percent are pure chinese companies presently foreign investors are very worried about the impact of an increase in tariffs as a result of the u s china trade war many of them are considering moving their companies out of china which would eventually lead to global industrial restructuring on jan 18 both bloomberg and reuters quoted information sources on major developments in u s china negotiations bloomberg revealed that china had offered to increase its imports from the u s by a combined value of 1 trillion in the next six years to balance the huge trade deficit between the united states and china reuters reported that the united states demands regular reviews of china s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal and could again resort to tariffs if it deems beijing has violated the agreement whether china can purchase 1 trillion worth of u s goods in the future involves u s regulations on exports to china with existing regulations the united states cannot provide this amount of goods the regular review proposal still dependent on future negotiations at this stage will help end the trade war and will be greatly helpful for china in achieving two of its stability goals stabilizing foreign trade and stabilizing foreign investment the six stabilities are meant to stabilize bubbles china s new slogan the so called six stabilities is actually meant to stable an economic bubble the bubble of real estate market it has been reported that the total market value of real estate in china is as high as 65 trillion while the total combined market value of real estate in the united states the european union and japan is only 60 trillion although the accuracy of this data is yet to be ascertained there is no doubt that chinese real estate is the biggest bubble in human history in the past 100 years there have been nearly one hundred economic crises of various scale in times of peace nine out of ten economic crises stemmed from real estate the 1986 1991 real estate bubble in japan was too painful to recall for the japanese when japan s bubble economy was at the peak of its prosperity combined land prices of tokyo alone was equivalent to the combined land price of the entire united states the bursting of the real estate bubble set housing prices into a protracted decline and the japanese economy into the lost two decades according to some researchers excluding all other losses real estate and stock price drops alone caused a loss of wealth of 1 500 trillion yen equivalent to the sum of japan s nationwide personal financial assets which is the sum of japan s gdp over three years at the time any country relying on credit expansion to develop its economy will eventually create a real estate bubble according to the 2018 global wealth report published by credit suisse research institute csri by mid 2018 china s family wealth ranked second in the world the 2017 hurun wealth report claimed that one in every 940 people in china has a net worth of 10 million yuan about 1 48 million domestic research revealed that real estate accounts for more than 70 percent of china s household assets in recent years some property owners fearing the loss of household wealth launched protests against real estate developers when they offer price cuts and it happened in many locations across china this phenomenon is undoubtedly a chinese characteristic real estate binds the government banks and property owners into a community of shared interests together they go all out to maintain this huge bubble for their own interests the injection of additional currency into the markets at the beginning of 2019 has made the long suffering and helpless local governments feel relieved government officials and relevant industries may think that another round of development opportunities is now on the horizon these short sighted people are unwilling to think deeply it s actually a new round of drinking poison to quench a raging thirst premier li keqiang gave a speech at a forum on jan 15 saying it is necessary to keep the economy growth rate within an appropriate range we must avoid big ups and downs and definitely cannot allow the economy to fall off a cliff his words are by no means a declaration of further development but a call for stable burst of the bubble that is the bubble should slowly deflate under the control of the government a drastic burst must be avoided at all costs
the new year got off to a rocky start with an extended federal government shutdown and instability in the global markets yet there is optimism that the u s construction industry will continue to see favorable investment and activity in the months ahead to give you a better perspective on what to expect rental magazine asked economists from some of the leading construction industry organizations to share their insights and outlooks on what we may expect from 2019 and beyond highway and bridge construction rm travelers experienced plenty of highway and bridge construction in 2018 giving the appearance that infrastructure spending in this sector at least was trending upward of course appearances don t always reflect reality how did federal state and local spending on highway and bridge construction in 2018 compare to the previous year and do you see more funds earmarked for rebuilding the infrastructure this year anirban basu chief economist for the associated builders and contractors abc infrastructure investment was very strong in 2018 due in large measure to improved state and local government finances significant spending growth we observable in much of the nation in categories such as water systems transit systems highways and flood control ken simonson chief economist associated general contractors of america agc after shrinking by 4 percent in 2017 highway and street construction spending increased 6 percent in the first 10 months of 2018 compared to the same period the year before the increase resulted not from higher federal funding but from states that have raised fuel tax rates or other funding sources in the past few years and from more toll construction by both traditional toll agencies and by public private partnerships it appears spending will increase again in 2019 but not by as large a percentage as in 2018 ihs markit spending on highways streets declined in 2017 largely due to a wait and see attitude as the at that time incoming administration had touted grand infrastructure plans as the year wore on and no plan was announced or passed state and local governments started making arrangements for spending in 2018 overall spending on highways streets is expected to increase by 1 6 percent over 2017 levels looking ahead to 2019 there currently is no federal plan in place for increased investment in infrastructure however after the mid term elections there is a stronger expectation that some type of federal funding plan can be achieved in 2019 funding any federal bill remains the key headwind but state and local governments have been taking a stronger role in raising revenues to undertake needed improvements we expect that spending growth in the highways streets segment will expand at an accelerated rate in 2019 source jeannine cataldi dr alison premo black senior vice president and chief economist american road transportation association artba public highway street and related investment by state and local governments is expected to increase to 66 5 billion in 2019 from 63 4 billion in 2018 this is the second year of consecutive growth for public highway construction the real value of public highway work when adjusted for inflation fell to 60 6 billion in 2017 down from 64 5 billion in 2016 after falling 2 percent in 2018 to 31 2 billion the real value of bridge and tunnel construction work is expected to increase to 31 7 billion in 2019 an increase of 1 5 percent increased investment at the federal state and local level will continue to support the growing market major developments include 1 increased federal investment through the fy 2018 appropriations bill and the 2015 fast act law 2 the approval of numerous state and local ballot initiatives to raise transportation revenues in 2016 2017 and 2018 and 3 the action by 30 states to raise or adjust their motor fuel tax rates and other fees over the last six years federal highway investment received a boost from the fy 2018 appropriations bill congress approved 2 5 billion for highway programs in addition to an increase of 930 million approved as part of the core highway program under the 2015 fast act law the market impact of the general fund investment from the appropriations bill will depend on how quickly states obligate the funding nearly 2 billion will be available to states using the same formula as the federal aid highway program but states can take up to four years to obligate this money unlike the traditional program where funds must be obligated within the same fiscal year the remaining 500 million will be distributed through the federal and tribal lands program and a competitive highway bridge program one wild card in the forecast is the outlook for the reauthorization of the fast act and the ability of congress to find additional revenues to support the highway trust fund if states start delaying projects in response to uncertainty over the future of the federal aid highway program then it would temper 2019 market growth overall highway construction market activity is expected to increase in about half of the states and washington d c in 2019 the market should be steady in another five states with activity expected to slow down in the remaining 20 states building construction rm construction in the commercial and housing markets seemed to be strong again in 2018 in most parts of the country what are the major drivers of this construction and do you anticipate this level of new construction to be sustained in 2019 in both market segments what areas of the country expect to see a continued uptick in construction activity abc while apartment construction remained elevated in 2018 total spending is no longer climbing quickly single family home construction slumped due in large measure to higher mortgage rates commercial construction by contrast was red hot in a number of segments including hotels and data centers agc spending was very closely balanced in 2018 among residential private nonresidential and public construction in addition the spending increases were widely spread across the nation all but six states added construction employees between october 2017 and october 2018 in 2019 i expect slightly less growth in public construction except for airport and k 12 school construction private nonresidential categories will be modestly positive with the strongest categories being pipelines warehouses and data centers residential construction growth will be helped by an increase in multifamily most states will continue to add workers if contractors can find them robert dietz svp chief economist national association of home builders nahb while the single family construction market is expected to post a gain for 2018 it will be at a smaller growth rate than we expected at the start of the year a nearly 100 basis point increase in mortgage interest rates over the course of 2018 combined with the cumulate effect of prior home price increases has reduced housing affordability to a 10 year low our expectation is that mortgage rates will continue to rise alongside gains for the 10 year rate given a tight labor market and the fed s intended policy to continue to tighten monetary policy albeit at a slower rate than expected a year ago for 2019 we expect a small gain for single family construction but housing affordability will hold back construction volume going into 2020 for multifamily development we expect roughly flat conditions with the market leveling off this level of apartment construction however is higher than we estimated last year given the 2018 single family slowdown nahb expects home construction growth to continue to be concentrated in the west and the south where job and population gains are strong this is particularly true for markets in the mountain state such as montana idaho and utah ihs markit commercial construction remained healthy in 2018 led by spending in the warehouse office and lodging segments warehouse spending is expected to slow but remain above 10 percent for the year office and lodging spending are expected to end 2018 with stronger growth than in the previous year tax cuts enacted in 2017 had some benefits to businesses the outlook for 2019 is for moderate spending growth in the commercial market tariffs enacted through 2018 are having some impact and we expect that office and lodging will grow but at slower rates through the year the housing market has been flat through 2018 with an expected growth rate for construction spending of less than one percent for the year weaker than growth of 8 percent in 2017 rising mortgage rates and rising prices have made housing less affordable in addition costs to build homes are rising and builders are finding it is more profitable to construct larger homes which tend to fall outside of many potential homeowner price points these headwinds will keep the overall housing market flat in 2019 areas that are expected to see stronger activity will be in the south and west markets where there is room to build these are also areas with stronger population growth source jeannine cataldi employment rm low unemployment is good for workers but not so good for employers in need of both skilled and semi skilled help in fact almost everywhere one turns employers cite a labor shortage as a serious issue whereas the long term solution seems to lie in retraining workers and developing more apprenticeship programs the near term for employers will likely lead to higher wages along with more reliance on work visa programs and efficiencies generated by new technologies do you see this labor challenge continuing to plague the construction industry in 2019 and if so what can businesses do to mitigate its impact abc yes skills shortages will continue to plague contractors in 2019 and likely beyond retirement of some of the nation s most experienced skilled and dedicated construction workers will persist for the foreseeable future as will inadequate entry of younger workers while expanded apprenticeship programs retraining and other techniques will help construction s skills shortages will likely ultimately be solved by the emergence and diffusion of new technologies including robotics drones 3d printing artificial intelligence and modularization agc yes the worker shortage will intensify as more sectors compete for workers contractors need to adopt wide variety of approaches to recruit retain and substitute for workers nahb as of october 2018 there were nearly 300 000 open construction sector jobs a significant increase over a year ago while the housing market slowdown will ease some of the upward pressure on the count of unfilled construction sector positions we expect the skilled labor shortage to remain a key supply side constraint for the construction industry solving the industry labor woes will take a concerted effort of builders working through state and local home building and industry associations alongside national organizations like the home builders institute and the national housing endowment in partnership with trade schools and community colleges for home building the labor shortage will also increase the market share of modular and panelized construction although those market segments in total currently represent less than 4 percent of total single family construction nonetheless even a small gain in that share will help lift the industry s labor productivity and help builders build more with less ihs markit tight labor market conditions in the construction market will persist in 2019 resulting in yet another year of labor shortages and strong wage growth in the industry the good news is the construction labor market is responding to demand the construction industry added 225 000 workers through november compared to 2017 we also expect some demand side relief as the positive effects of the tax cuts and jobs act subside real nonresidential spending growth will slow from 5 5 percent growth in 2018 to 2 7 percent growth in 2019 rising interest rates will also weigh on the residential sector real residential spending will decline 1 1 percent in 2019 the bad news is the construction industry is in the midst of a demographic transition and is expected to retire 30 percent of its workforce over the next ten years while demand growth next year is expected to slow and the pipeline of younger workers is improving the outflow of experienced workers will keep construction labor markets tight leading to an acceleration in average industry wages from 3 1 percent growth in 2018 to 3 6 percent growth in 2019 source emily crowley artba recruiting training and retaining workers will continue to be an issue at the local state and regional level in 2019 industry wages for employees on job sites were up 3 percent in 2018 on average longer term changes in technology will help drive increased productivity to address labor challenges despite these challenges half of highway and bridge contractors have significant capacity to increase construction work above current levels according to the latest results of artba s quarterly market survey fourteen percent of respondents said they are working at below 75 percent capacity and another 36 percent are working at 75 to 90 percent capacity and could take on more work raw material costs rm the administration s trade policies have caused alarm in some quarters with tariffs already reflecting higher costs of certain raw materials including steel if tariffs remain a constant in 2019 what impact will they likely have on the cost of raw materials and what sectors of the construction industry will be most impacted what other forces may play an instrumental role in raw material costs in 2019 abc there will be many factors shaping construction materials prices in 2019 one of them will be a weakening global economy which will generally help to suppress further price increases indeed the recent decline in oil prices is at least partially attributable to weaker than anticipated global demand moreover domestic supply has been rising in certain instances in response to tariffs and higher prices this appears to be the case with steel and softwood lumber further the u s dollar is likely to remain strong in 2019 which would tend to further suppress construction material price increases the implication is that materials prices in 2019 may not rise as rapidly as they did during much of 2018 agc steel tariffs will affect even more contractors than in 2018 when some were protected by having pre ordered steel or bought from inventories contractors may also find some customers delaying or canceling projects because their production costs have increased or their export markets have dried up nahb tariffs on canadian softwood lumber produced a large amount of price volatility in 2018 during the summer of 2018 higher lumber costs were adding 8 000 per new single family home additional tariffs on steel aluminum and other chinese goods could increase development costs by 1 billion or more dollars in 2019 offsetting some of the benefits of the 2017 tax cuts moreover the higher costs produced by tariffs represent an inflation risk thus adding pressure to increase interest rates and slow the overall economy a new u s canadian softwood lumber agreement is needed and broader trade issues need to be resolved quickly to allow the economy to grow ihs markit construction material costs are rising at levels last seen before the recession inputs to construction index tracked by the bureau of labor statistics is rising close to 7 5 percent in 2018 this aggregate index includes materials and energy that goes into construction but excludes labor therefore it is a good representation of the topline inflation that builders face with higher raw material prices throughout 2017 and 2018 behind this high escalation in 2018 are important drivers such as fabricated steel 10 percent price increase or refined petroleum products close to 30 percent price increase section 232 tariffs and other trade decisions certainly played an important role in the escalation of prices for raw materials such as steel and aluminum we expect section 232 tariffs to stay in place in 2019 however prices for steel and aluminum will be lower compared to 2018 they have already begun to drop while part of the strength in pricing in the united states can be explained by tariffs the other part of the explanation is the strength of the us economy with fiscal stimulus boosting growth and solid gains in income we expect fourth quarter gdp growth to come in at 2 5 percent bringing growth over all for 2018 to 3 1 percent however for next year we expect dynamics such as slowing global growth a strong dollar fading fiscal stimulus tightening monetary policy a hesitant stock market the effects of recent tariffs and the approach to capacity constraints which will point to a slowing pace in us growth that will also have a tempering effect on demand and raw material prices source deni koenhemsi artba artba estimates overall highway and bridge project costs which remained below general inflation between 2013 and 2016 rose 2 7 percent in 2017 and 3 8 percent in 2018 largely due to increased costs for diesel fuel and materials prices for the materials used in highway construction projects were up an average of 8 percent in 2018 this increase is largely driven by the cost of diesel fuel and other energy inputs which were up an average of 26 percent for highway contractors according to the u s bureau of labor statistics bls other sectors of the construction industry also saw similar price increases according to bls price data the average selling price of key highway materials inputs in 2018 were up for asphalt 6 percent compared to 2017 cement 2 percent concrete block and brick 2 percent aggregates 3 percent ready mix concrete 4 percent iron and steel 11 percent and diesel fuel 36 percent the uncertainty created by the steel and aluminum tariffs enacted in march 2018 will continue to have an impact on the highway construction market steel is an important input for transportation construction for every 1 spent on highway and bridge construction 10 cents goes toward steel related materials it is difficult to isolate the impact of tariffs on the price of steel related products from other market forces such as the cost of energy transportation or input materials a 2003 report by the u s international trade commission usitc found that the economic impact of the steel tariffs implemented under the bush administration in 2002 on the construction industry was mixed while 56 percent of contractors reported spot prices for steel had changed about 67 percent of construction firms indicated there had not been a change in contract prices of the contractors surveyed 83 percent indicated there had not been any major contract modifications after the tariffs were implemented bls price data shows that average annual prices in 2018 for steel manufacturers making more material intensive products such as steel bars tubes well casings and conduits were up 12 to 14 percent compared to 2017 steel related products that include more labor inputs such as bridge expansions joints structural steel scaffolding gratins railings and highway guardrails were up 6 to 8 percent in 2018 compared to average prices in 2017 overall economic outlook for 2019 rm is it fair to say that gdp growth in 2018 exceeded expectations if so what were the drivers and do you see similar growth for 2019 and beyond abc gdp growth in 2018 roughly equaled expectations many economists predicted 3 percent growth this year and that appears to be what the economy delivered next year will usher forth a period of slower economic growth with corporate investment softening agc expansion will continue in 2019 but the stimulus provided by the 2017 tax cut and jobs act will fade and tariffs may be more of a drag than in 2018 i have no prediction beyond 2019 but so far see no reason to expect a recession nahb 2018 gdp growth came in just under 3 percent where nahb had forecasted it given the lift provided by tax reform and tax cuts for 2019 we are calling for a slower growth rate of 2 5 percent and closer to 1 percent for 2020 as higher interest rates slow more than just the housing market our modeling shows that the fed will likely only raise rates twice in 2019 resulting in a pause to evaluate market data on the promising side the housing market will benefit from favorable demographic tailwinds including the millennials increasingly moving from rentership to homeownership in fact due to this aging the u s has seen nine straight quarters of fairly robust growth of demand on the ownership side of the housing market moreover a near 50 year low for the unemployment rate supports demand for both rental and for sale housing however a near 100 basis point increase in mortgage rates has had stronger than expected impacts on housing demand this year this summer and fall this was clearly reflected in the november edition of the nahb wells fargo housing market index which dropped 8 points to a level of 60 in november still positive but it was the lowest reading in two years and the largest drop in four years unless income growth accelerates markedly housing affordability can be expected to decline further in 2019 which will produce a real estate related drag on the economy ihs markit our current outlook is for overall 2018 gdp growth to reach 3 1 percent the best since 2004 stimulus from the 2017 tax act and 2018 budget acts still accommodative monetary policy healthy consumer balance sheets firm gains in employment and income and high levels of both consumer and business confidence will propel the economy through 2019 at a slower but still above trend 2 4 percent pace this will nudge the unemployment rate to a cyclical low of 3 4 percent while core inflation edges above 2 percent by late 2019 the economic environment will be shifting stimulus from recent tax cuts and spending increases will be fading and a fiscal contraction in 2020 can only be avoided by legislation that may prove a challenge for the new divided congress tightening monetary policy will have turned restrictive global growth which peaked in 2017 will be slowing even as the dollar remains elevated the negative impact of recently enacted tariffs will be accumulating and the demographically driven housing recovery will be cresting the economy s ability to grow will be constrained by its proximity to capacity a slowdown seems inevitable and a downturn increasingly likely to communicate these risks the forecast shows the economy slowing through trend in 2020 and then entering mild growth recession in 2021 making 2018 as good as it gets for now source us economics commentary ihs markit

of the schengen area and it had more control over its own borders than it chose to exercise the politicos have an easy whipping boy in brussels uk officials say that after brexit they can enter into free trade agreements with other countries but it is not like the eu is standing still on february 1 the eu japan free trade agreement went into effect the eu has free trade agreements with australia new zealand vietnam mexico canada mercosur and singapore the size of the eu market gives it negotiating power in trade talks the uk gdp is about 2 6 trillion to say it does not have the eu s heft is to state the obvious but to suggest that the uk can strike just as favorable agreements seems naive at best and disingenuous at worst the irish border issue cannot be resolved all of the stakeholders say the customs border cannot be between the republic of ireland and northern ireland the democratic union party from northern ireland that allows the tories to govern after losing its majority insists that the border cannot be between northern ireland and the rest of britain the non binding referendum in 2016 instructed parliament to leave the eu now it turns out there is no majority in parliament for any particular way arguably the house of commons needs more instructions from the people and postponing article 50 until after another referendum is one scenario however it was a very close decision last time and some irregularities there is some risk that the remainers would win despite the mess of brexit labour continues to trail behind the tories in opinion polls labour leader corbyn has been unable to broaden his party s appeal but he did offer another way to prime minister may he made five demands in exchange for labour s support one of them was staying in the customs union which would resolve the knotty problem of the irish border may is not ready for that yet she sides with those tories that believe that staying in the customs union is not a sufficient exit samuel johnson said that when a man knows he will be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully the march 29 departure is more than a fortnight away the minds are not sufficiently concentrated hope seems to decay at the square root of time and as the zero hour is approached and alternative exits are blocked the choice may come down to a no deal exit and a later softer divorce trade is another issue that must go to the brink what white house economic adviser called the varsity team of mnuchin and lighthizer are in beijing next week to continue high level trade talks ahead of the early march deadline reports suggest that while china is willing to talk about a wider range of us demands its position has not changed much from the start it is willing to buy more us goods and reduce or eliminate the trade imbalance it has already begun opening up more of its markets to foreign businesses it has adopted more stringent protections of intellectual property rights china cannot commit to the kind of structural reforms the us demands it is pursued policies in direct contradiction of the imf and washington consensus and it has literally lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty the us wants the chinese state to withdraw from the economy while there is an intuitive appeal but the closer it is examined the less insightful it becomes imagine chinese officials demand that the us government withdraws from the housing market where through its ownership of fannie mae and freddie mac it nationalized america s mortgage lending imagine chinese officials complained when the us injected capital into all the large banks whether they asked for it or not if the size of the state is measured as expenditures as a percentage of gdp than it is the us state that is the outlier for how small it is rather than the size of the chinese state many critics see the us government as having encroached on the markets to an unprecedented extent and now the us is insisting the chinese state withdraws it is an unrealistic demand that is tantamount to unilateral disarmament moreover the us has this knack for turning a necessity into a universal virtue in the 1980s when the free trade administration thought it knew better than the markets it coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market it has now successfully championed the g7 and g20 to formally recognize and endorse markets determining exchange rates it was reported last week that trump and xi are unlikely to meet by the end of the month schedule conflicts were cited but it is understood as confirming kudlow s assessment that the two sides are still far apart in addition to substantive issues a key criticism of past agreements by many in the trump administration lies with a lack of sufficiently robust enforcement trust but verify makes more sense when you can see the deployment of missiles with satellites it is more infinitely more difficult with these issues also us officials have been critical of existing ajudication and conflict resolution mechanisms but have not yet offered a politically realistic alternative the us administrations rhetoric does not match its action after lambasting nafta as the worst agreement ever the trump administration has submitted a new treaty for approval that is very similar to the older one modernized with what had been negotiated under tpp trans pacific partnership from which trump withdrew and more robust domestic content requirements the trade agreement with south korea is not too dissimilar either if such a pattern prevails it will imply that after all the drama when everything is said and done the us china relationship is not going to change very much china will reduce the bilateral trade imbalance with the us leave aside the fact that this managed trade may be challenged by others at the wto it is in china s interest to de claw american protectionism in the recent past the protectionists argued china was taking unfair advantage by maintaining an undervalued exchange rate now many models show the yuan near fair value now the protectionist blame other chinese practices some of which do not violate wto rules the us will not be able to convince a majority to change the rules because at least in part the same brush that that paints china would tar many others the larger the technology gap the greater the incentive to close it americans are quite willing to see it as a moral issue though when they were on the weak side of the technology gap say in the second half of the 19th century in steel production they too resorted to extralegal methods often china does not have to steal intellectual property right because foreign businesses agree under the terms of securing large lucrative contracts this one of the things that alstom and siemens whose marriage was rejected by european authorities reportedly have in common for example as part of conditions for over 1 bln in orders each was required to transfer technology to the chinese state owned rail car manufacturer which is now the world s largest train maker for more than 20 years before trump took office there were regular high level meetings between us and chinese officials the trump administration end the practice would it be surprising to see the talks resume for the first time ever the long term rivalry between the us and china will not be resolved here and now contingent advantage is sought here and now given the trump administration s apparent sensitivity to the stock market performance we suspect the tariff freeze will be extended as talks are said to continue to make progress and perhaps around the middle of the year a deal is struck that reduces the bilateral imbalance and establishes some structure for talks negotiations besides brexit and trade a third issue that will remain unresolved in the days ahead is the state of the global economy the synchronized expansion of 2017 had two legacies the first was that collectively the central banks would reduce their balance sheet expansion and by early 2019 it would turn to contraction the second was that by the end of 2018 there was concern about a synchronized downturn we submit the situation is more complicated the reduction of boj purchases is because it complemented its qe with yield curve control it needs to buy fewer bonds to achieve the same results the 10 year jgb yields about minus three basis points about the least in two years some observers argued last year that the ecb was the only source of demand for some peripheral european bonds this has proved wide of the mark demand for sovereign paper in the opening weeks of the year has been strong including for italian bonds the 10 year german bund yield slipped below 10 bp to a two year low the curve is negative out for nine years we expect the ecb will resist through offsetting mechanisms the premature shrinking of its balance sheet from banks paying back loans under the previous targeted long term refinancing operations the us economy surged to over 4 annualized growth in the middle of last year as the fiscal stimulus kicked in but it was always understood to be unsustainable the world s biggest economy but 2 5 growth was is expected in q4 18 is still above trend and is stronger than most of the high income countries growth in q1 19 will take a hit from the record long government shutdown the cold snap and the weakness quirk in the first part of the year that is common even if not fully explicable since the great financial crisis the us reports december retail sales households splurged in november when retail sales excluding autos gasoline and building materials jumped by 0 9 a still strong 0 4 gain is expected in december if so it would be the strongest three months for core retail sales in seven years january industrial output and manufacturing production may have ground to a halt in january but the early data for february like the empire state manufacturing index is expected to rebound meanwhile headline january cpi was likely dragged lower by the drop in oil prices but the core rate is likely to remain firm a little above 2 the world s second economy restarts after the week long celebration of the lunar new year given that it is the most important trading partner for some many countries chinese import and export figures are closely watched china s trade surplus is poised to narrow sharply in january chinese reserve figures always attract attention a small increase in reserves might not translate into more treasury holdings but it would lend support to ideas that the downside pressure on the currency eased in january when the yuan rose above 2 6 against the dollar low cpi and ppi readings would play on fears of deflationary impulses and a disappointingly weak report could spur speculation of a rate cut or a reduction in the required reserve ratios data from europe will not shed much fresh light however data last week gives the first hints that germany has worked through its auto issue the flash pmi readings are due february 21 and some improvement is looking likely the uk has a full slate of economic reports including q4 gdp the bloomberg consensus calls for a 0 3 quarterly pace for 1 4 year over year which would match the 2018 average and make for the weakest year since 2009 s contraction the gdp data will take the bite from the december data which clears the deck for the january data it includes cpi flat and retail sales a small rise is expected after a large drop in december lastly japan will report q4 gdp the world s third largest economy contracted by 0 6 in q3 18 largely due to natural disasters while there is no doubt the economy recovered in q4 it probably was not economy to offset the decline the median forecast is for the japanese economy to have expanded by 0 4 in q4 as both consumption and investment rebounded disappointingly the gdp deflator may have slipped further to 0 4 from 0 3
jerome powell threw wall street a lifeline recently when he decided to temporarily take a pause with the fed s rate hiking campaign the fed head also indicated that the process of credit destruction known as quantitative tightening may soon be brought to an end this move towards donning a dovish plume caused the total value of equities to soar back to a level that is now 137 of gdp for some context that valuation is over 30 percentage points higher than it was at the start of great recession and over 90 percentage points greater than 1985 so the salient question for investors is will a slightly dovish fomc be enough to support the massively overvalued market the s p 500 is now trading at over 16x forward earnings but the growth rate of that earnings will plunge from over 20 last year to a minus 0 8 in q1 of this year according to factset it might have made sense to pay 19x earnings back in 2018 because it was justified by a commensurate rate of earnings growth but only a fool would pay 16x or 17x earnings if growth is actually negative the only reason why that would make sense is if investors were convinced eps growth was about to soar back towards the unusually strong rate of growth enjoyed last year and for that to be the case several stars have to align perfectly the structural problems that are leading to sharp slowdowns in europe china and japan all have to be resolved favorably and in a very short period of time and of course global central banks begin another round of massive and coordinated of qe in addition the trade war must also be resolved quickly and in a way that does not inflict any further damage to the ailing economy in china not only does china have to agree on a myriad of concessions including eliminating its trade surplus with the u s and renouncing its practice of intellectual property theft but the communist nation must also agree to subject itself to rigorous monitoring and enforcement mechanisms not only this but any eventual deal must be constructed in a way that ensures increasing china s dependence on imports does not negatively affect domestic production additionally china s government must be able to re stimulate its growth by forcing yet more debt upon its economy which is already so overleveraged that it has begun to crash in addition the chaos that surrounds washington must abate quickly this means future government shutdowns must be averted and that there will not be presidential indictments from the soon to be released mueller probe also the upcoming conflagrations and brinksmanship over funding the government and increasing the debt ceiling must not adversely affect consumer sentiment but by far the most important of all these factors is the fed it must turn out to be the case that the previous 9 rate hikes and 500 billion worth of currency destruction through qt haven t already been enough to push the economy and stock market over the edge especially in view of the fact that the balance sheet reduction process is still ongoing it is prudent to point out that the fed last stopped raising rates in the summer of 2006 but that certainly didn t turn out to be the all clear sign for the economy a mere twelve months later the stock market began to crash and 18 months after the fed s last hike the real estate crisis and great recession began back in 2006 the global economy was booming with growth of over 4 in sharp contrast today we have parts of europe in a recession while japan s gdp is contracting there is now a sharp slowdown in china from well over 10 growth in 2006 to the 6 range today also the u s economy has slowed from 4 2 in q2 of last year to around 1 at the start of this year the point here is the world isn t growing like it was 13 years ago or even where it was a year ago it is now teetering on recession this means there is a huge difference between the point in which the fed is going dovish this time around if you can indeed categorize a dovish fed as one that is still in the process of destroying 10 s of billions of dollars each month through its reverse qe program it is true that the fed stopped hiking the funds rate at 5 25 back in 2006 while today it is just below 2 5 therefore wall street shills take solace in the fact that rates are at a lower point now than they were in the last hiking cycle so they conclude with an alacrity that today s level of interest rates will turn out to be innocuous however as already mentioned stock prices are much higher relative to gdp today than in 2006 and debt levels today dwarf what was evident at the start of the great recession the fact is that total non financial debt in the u s has surged from 33 3t 231 of gdp at the start of the great recession in december of 2007 to 51 3t 249 of gdp as of q3 2018 the bottom line is the economy is lugging around an extra 18 trillion of debt that it has to service on top of what it could not bear a decade ago therefore it is logical to conclude after raising the fed funds rate 9 times since december 2015 and also for the first time in history destroying 500 billion from its quantitative tightening program that the fed has already tightened enough to send earnings and gdp into a recession despite the sharp slowdown in the global economy the perma bulls dismiss the idea of an earnings recession that lasts more than one quarter this is primarily because the fed has gone on hold with its monetary policy however this ignores the earnings recession that occurred only a few years back the s p 500 eps for the calendar year 2014 was 119 06 for 2015 it was 118 76 and for 2016 it was 119 31 it should be noted that the earnings recession of 2014 2016 occurred in a much more favorable macroeconomic environment the ecb was still in the throes of its qe program the fed funds rate was 200 basis points lower the trade war had not yet begun the fed s reverse qe program was still another year off and the fed s balance sheet was a half trillion dollars larger yet the earnings recession still happened and the stock market went absolutely nowhere for two full years with a couple of steep double digit percentage point drops mixed in the earnings recession was only bailed out by trump s massive corporate tax cut an unprecedented stimulus package from china and global qe that was spitting out around 100 billion of monetary confetti each month but those conditions are not likely to be repeated and that means that the global economy must stand on its own debt disabled legs for the first time in over a decade sadly it should end up taking much more than an abeyance with rate hikes to levitate stock prices after this next plunge in asset prices the fed will be quickly cutting interest rates back to zero percent and all global central banks will be forced to re engage with a massive protracted and record breaking round of qe this will also be combined with a humongous global fiscal stimulus package that will serve to push bankrupt nations further into insolvency it may be possible to rescue the stock market in nominal terms using this type of fiscal and monetary madness however it also means the already endangered middle class will take a giant step towards extinction and this is why the timing of precious metals ownership will be more crucial than ever
edinburgh there is a push in zimbabwe to take the south african rand as its currency the latest call to adopt the rand comes from former finance minister tendai biti who is a senior figure in the opposition movement for democratic change periodically there has been vigorous debate in zimbabwe on the benefits and disadvantages of taking on the rand in january zimbabwe s finance and economic development minister mthuli ncube told bulawayo news 24 that the country would not adopt the south african rand as it does not have adequate resources to do so he said at a political meeting that while he had advocated for the adoption of the rand before he came into office he had realised the country will still need to get us dollars to be able to import the rand if you are going to argue for the adoption of the rand first of all you have to acquire the rand and we need us dollars to purchase the rand he said at the time adding that zimbabwe would need its own currency in the long term south africa is zimbabwe s biggest trading partner importing most of its food and other goods from its southern neighbour jackie cameron by paul richardson and antony sguazzin bloomberg zimbabwe should adopt south africa s rand as its currency one of a series of fundamental reforms needed to restore economic stability in the country former finance minister tendai biti said his call is an endorsement of government efforts to link zimbabwe s economy to neighbouring south africa s currency as it grapples with a foreign exchange shortage that s spawned the fastest price increases since hyperinflation a decade ago zimbabwe abolished its own currency in 2009 and mainly uses the us dollar the american currency is too strong for the zimbabwean economy biti said friday in an interview in johannesburg joining the so called common monetary area in which namibia lesotho and eswatini peg their currencies to the rand would reduce costs he said the advantage of joining a rand monetary union would be that it would foist some much needed discipline on the zimbabwean economy biti said it would also enhance regional integration by giving manufacturers in the country access to 300 million consumers in southern africa compared with the 100 000 he estimates can still afford goods usually bought by the middle class in zimbabwe he said biti who served as finance minister from february 2009 until september 2013 is deputy chairman of the opposition movement for democratic change miracle of failure zimbabwe is considering pegging a planned new currency to the rand one of several proposals being discussed by the government the harare based financial gazette reported last week it may be favoured because south africa is the country s biggest trading partner it said the rand has had a strong start to the year gaining 5 that makes it the second best performing emerging markets currency based on a basket selected by bloomberg behind the russian ruble in addition to the dollar zimbabwe s central bank also prints quasi greenbacks called bond notes and an electronic currency known as rtgs to fund rampant government spending and stem the shortage of foreign exchange that s resulted in a convoluted system of exchange rates with consumers charged different prices depending on how they pay even though the government insists all the securities are at par with the dollar biti said both the bond notes and rtgs should be scrapped inflation reached an estimated 500bn percent in 2008 before the zimbabwe dollar was scrapped the rate rose to 42 in december from 31 in november price growth risks are entering another hyper inflationary cycle driven by the government s insatiable appetite to spend money it doesn t have biti said to have two hyper inflationary spells in a period of 10 years is a miracle of failure biti said visited 672 times 2 visit s today
divergences in monetary policy were also becoming more pronounced across emerging markets while some economies such as brazil and colombia reduced borrowing costs to help stimulate growth others notably indonesia and the czech republic joined the fed in raising rates with the aim of maintaining financial stability it was not just the federal reserve and the people s bank of china that were parting ways a succession of us interest rate increases coupled with expectations of further tightening this year as america s economy powered ahead contrasted starkly with a slowdown in growth in the euro zone by early november the spread between us and german 10 year bond yields had increased to nearly 2 8 percentage points its widest level in almost three decades in the middle of november last year the yield on one year chinese government debt fell below its american counterpart for the first time ever according to data from bloomberg dropping to 2 5 per cent as beijing s shift towards more growth supportive measures gathered pace the yield gap between the two countries 10 year bonds had also narrowed sharply dropping to just 30 basis points as the divergence between chinese and american monetary policy gained momentum yet since the beginning of this year a synchronised global slowdown driven by a sharp deceleration in china and europe has taken root the publication last tuesday of survey data on global manufacturing and service sector output compiled by ihs markit showed that growth slowed to its weakest level last month since september 2016 this has brought about a shift towards looser or at least less tight policy stances in both advanced and developing economies an employee uses a robotic arm while working on a siemens angiography system on the assembly line at the siemens ag healthineers factory in forchheim germany in july 2017 a survey of global manufacturing and services output showed that growth slowed to its weakest level in january since september 2016 photo bloomberg the dovish tilt is being led by the fed in a dramatic change to its outlook in december when it raised rates and signalled further hikes this year the fed announced at its meeting last month that it would be patient before making any future adjustment it even hinted that the next move could be a rate cut if america s economy which remains buoyant succumbs to the global slowdown this abrupt reversal on the part of the world s most influential central bank has changed the policy landscape making it easier for other central banks to move in a more dovish direction last wednesday philip lowe head of the reserve bank of australia warned of an accumulation of domestic and external risks which made a rate cut more likely causing the australian dollar a proxy for sentiment towards china to suffer its steepest daily decline since last august the following day the reserve bank of india unexpectedly cut rates citing subdued inflation central banks in other emerging markets that hiked rates last year notably the philippines and the czech republic are also striking a more dovish tone shaktikanta das governor of the reserve bank of india announced a surprise 25 basis point cut to the country s interest rate last week photo reuters however it is in europe where the scope for sharper reversals is most apparent on thursday the bank of england slashed its forecast for growth in britain this year from 1 7 to 1 2 per cent as it shelved plans for further rate increases warning that the risk of a recession would rise if the uk left the european union at the end of march without a deal and no transition arrangements in place the same day the european commission painted a bleak picture of growth in the euro zone forecasting that italy which is already in recession will barely grow this year while germany will expand by just 1 1 per cent as i argued previously this leaves the european central bank which terminated its quantitative easing programme last december in an awkward position if even the fed is giving itself room to cut rates when america s economy is still growing at a relatively brisk pace then the ecb which downgraded its outlook for the euro zone last month should have already eliminated the possibility of a rate hike later this year a more dovish stance is only a matter of time the fed led shift towards a looser policy stance has already contributed to an easing of financial conditions across developed and emerging markets global stocks are up more than 7 per cent this year while spreads on corporate bonds have narrowed significantly however the us dollar which began to weaken in december as investors started pricing in a more dovish fed has strengthened markedly since the beginning of this month the dollar index a gauge of the greenback s performance against a basket of other currencies has enjoyed its longest winning streak in two years this is because the us although showing signs of slowing is still in a stronger position than the world s other leading economies the fed may have turned dovish but it is china and europe that are the epicentre of the slowdown benefiting the greenback still divergences in global monetary policy have narrowed markedly over the past several weeks as the clamour for more forceful stimulus measures in china intensifies it is the degree of dovishness on the part of fed and in

have been drilled and completed with 12 currently on production well performance on average is exceeding the updated type curves presented at our investor day on november 15 2018 the company s focus on cost reduction has resulted in an average well cost of 3 6 million on the first 14 wells significantly below forecasted cost estimates the final two wells off the 5 18 pad have been fractured with

delivery contract for 15 000 mmcf per day to northern border ventura for us 10 5 million or cad 14 million the decision to monetize the contract was due to an expansion in the forward curve spread between aeco and northern border ventura gas pricing the recent downward swing in oil prices also allowed the company to restructure part of its existing hedge book by removing a 1 000 barrel a day wti swap in the third quarter of 2019 for cash to obsidian energy of approximately 500 000 2019 development and revised guidance in early december the alberta government announced a mandatory curtailment program curtailment to relieve excess supply of crude oil and bitumen in western canada since the announcement there has been a meaningful contraction of canadian differentials improving the outlook for western canadian producers obsidian energy is supportive of these actions and views them as a near term positive step for the energy industry in western canada in light of the curtailment obsidian energy has elected to defer a four well pad with two cardium wells and two deep basin wells to the second half of 2019 the deferral will reduce first half 2019 capital expenditures by approximately 20 million to 45 million our first half 2019 drilling program now consists of five willesden green cardium wells which is underway with production expected near the end of march based on preliminary estimates the company expects first quarter 2019 light and heavy oil production to be approximately 15 750 16 250 barrels per day net to obsidian energy which reflects the curtailment requirements for the quarter total production for the first quarter of 2019 including natural gas liquids and natural gas is expected to be approximately 27 000 27 500 boe per day net to obsidian energy currently the company has approximately 2 200 boe per day behind pipe and if the curtailment requirements were to be lifted or reduced we would bring those volumes on production the full year 2019 optimization budget has been reduced by 3 million in favour of adding one willesden green cardium well to the second half 2019 drilling program for a total of 16 willesden green cardium wells and two deep basin wells with no changes to our full year capital estimate the company continues to evaluate its capital allocation decisions on an ongoing basis at this time we view the servicing of our credit facility and the cardium development in willesden green as the most prudent use of investment dollars in our portfolio due to mandated curtailments and the decision to shift capital into the second half of 2019 obsidian energy is revising its guidance for full year production and growth rates with reduced volumes there will be follow on affects to operating and general

venezuela the straw that breaks the empire s back by peter koenig february 10 2019 information clearing house venezuela in the limelight on practically all the written audio and visual mainstream media as well as alternative media a purposeful constant drip of outright lies and half truths fake news as well as misleading information of all shades and hues about venezuela is drumming our brains slowly bending our minds towards believing that yes the us has a vital interest in meddling in venezuela and bringing about regime change because of primarily the huge reserves of oil but also of gold coltan and other rare minerals and finally simply because washington needs full control of its backyard but and yes there is a huge but as even some of the respected progressive alternative media pretend to know amidst all that recognition of the anglozionist empire s evil hands in venezuela their but claims that venezuela specifically presidents chavez and now maduro are not blameless in their economic chaos this distorts already the entire picture and serves the empire and all those who are hesitant because they have no clue whom to support in this antagonistic us attempt for regime change for example one alternative news article starts it is true that some of venezuela s economic problems are due to the ineptitudes of the bolivarian government s socialist command economy but this overlooks the role played by the united states the united nations and the european union bingo with such a low blow beginning the uninformed reader is already primed to discount much of the interference by washington and its minions some of the so called progressive writers have already been brain smeared by calling nicol√°s maduro a dictator when in fact there is hardly any country farther away from a dictatorship than venezuela in the last 20 years and since comandante hugo chavez frias was first elected in 1998 and came to power in 1999 venezuela had another 25 fully democratic elections of which 6 took place in the last year and a half they were all largely observed by the us based carter institute the latin american celac some were even watched by the european union eu the very vassal states that are now siding with washington in calling president maduro an illegitimate dictator and instead they support the real illegitimate never elected us cia trained and appointed juan guaid√≥ former president carter once said of all the elections he and his institute observed the ones in venezuela were by far the most transparent and democratic ones by september 2017 the carter center had observed 104 elections in 39 countries are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter despite this evidence washington paid and corrupted anglozionist msm are screaming and spreading lies election fraud and nicol√°s maduro is illegal a dictator oppressing his people depriving them of food and medication sowing famine he has to go such lies are repeated at nauseatum in a world flooded by pyramid dollars fake money the presstitute media have no money problem dollars the funding source for the massive lie propaganda are just printed as debt never to be repaid again so why worry the same zionists who control the media also control the western money machines i e the fed wall street the bis bank for international settlement the so called central bank of central banks the european central bank the bank of england and the banks of london the western public armchair warriors all the way to caviar socialists believe these lies that s how our unqualified brains apparently work a recent independent poll found that 86 of all venezuelans including from the opposition want no interference by the us and her puppet allies but want to remain a sovereign state deciding themselves on how to resolve their internal problem economics and otherwise let me tell you something if mr maduro would be a dictator and all the diabolical adjectives that he is smeared with were to apply he would have long ago stopped the western propaganda machine which is the western controlled media in venezuela they control 90 of the news in venezuela but he didn t and doesn t because he believes in freedom of speech and freedom of the media even if the media are really nothing more than abject western lie machine presstitute mr maduro is generous enough not to close them down which any dictator of which there are now many in latin america take your pick argentina chile ecuador brazil colombia paraguay uruguay guatemala honduras would have done long ago from the very beginning when hugo chavez was first elected in 1998 washington attempted to topple him to bring about r√©gime change the first real coup attempt took place on 11 april 2002 under full command by washington chavez was ousted for less than 2 days when an on swell of people and the vast majority of the military requested his reinstatement chavez was brought back from his island seclusion and thus the directly washington led coup d √©tat was defeated the revolution will not be televised but the pressure mounted with economic sanctions becoming ever bolder and in the case of venezuela they had severe economic and humanitarian impacts because venezuela imports close to 90 of her food and medication still today and most of it from the us both chavez and maduro had very little leeway of doing differently what they have already done sanctions boycotts outside money manipulations driving inflation to astronomical levels and constant smear propaganda these predicaments are biting hard the us has a firm grip on venezuela s dollar dependency last week washington confiscated about us 23 billion of venezuela s reserve money in us banks blocked them from use by the legitimate maduro government and instead handed them to their us appointed puppet never elected president juan guaid√≥ he is now able to use venezuela s money in his us eu and lima group supported shadow government will he dare i don t think so however he has already invited us petrol companies to come to venezuela and invest in and take over the petrol industry of course it will not happen as president maduro stays in power firmly backed by the military all of this sounds like a bad joke did you ever hear of juan guaid√≥ before the us and her european vassals almost unanimously and obediently aped washington in supporting him likewise the bank of england withheld 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan reserve gold refusing to respond to the maduro government s request to return the gold to caracas both cases represent an extreme breach of confidence up to now it was ethically commercially and financially unthinkable that reserve money and gold deposited in foreign banks would not be safe from hooligan theft because that s what it is what the us is doing stealing other countries money that was deposited in good fate in their banks in a recent interview with rt president maduro said there was absolutely no need for humanitarian aid as the un suggested prompted by the us this so called humanitarian aid has everywhere in the world only served to infiltrate foreign and destabilizing elements into countries just look at syria libya iraq afghanistan to name just a few while the us 23 billion blocked in new york banks could have supplied venezuela with 20 years worth of medication for the venezuelan people maduro asserted venezuela has enough liquidity to feed and medicate her people however what this latest trump plunder the money and gold confiscation does is hammering one more nail in the western monetary system s suicide coffin it sends an ever clearer signal to the rest of the world to those that haven t noticed yet the anglozionist empire cannot i repeat cannot be trusted ever and the european union is intrinsically and vassalically linked to the washington rogue state not to be trusted either there is virtually no circumstance under which a countries assets in western foreign lands as bank deposits or foreign investments are safe it will prompt a move away from the dollar system away from the western also entirely privately owned swft international transfer system by which sanctions can be enacted
20 year of eurozone and gold the old continent is dying the euro is on the brink of collapse this is what you can often hear in the press but is that really the case we invite you to read our today s article about the development of the eurozone in the last twenty years and find out what are the real prospect of the euro and what does it imply for the gold market in december we celebrated 40 years of market reforms in china in january there was another important anniversary 20 years of the euro area so let s move from east asia to europe analyzing the economic situation of the eurozone and its implications for gold after years of negotiations and preparations the euro was launched on january 1st 1999 initially the shared currency was only virtual and the national currencies were still legal tenders used in circulation for ordinary citizens little changed however the exchange rates between national currencies were locked at fixed rates against each other while the european central bank took control over their monetary policy the euro notes and coins entered the circulation three years later the first members included austria belgium finland france germany ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain greece joined the club in 2001 thought it should not have done as it turned out later since then seven more countries slovenia cyprus malta slovakia estonia latvia lithuania entered the eurozone at the beginning everything was running smoothly but then the financial crisis hit the eurozone heavily revealing significant defects in its architecture the fatal flaw is that there is a currency union with the several independent fiscal policies it was quite perverse as the great recession erupted in america however the us with its unified fiscal and political system overcame the crisis relatively quickly on the contrary the eurozone suffered a prolonged depression as the financial crisis morphed into the sovereign debt crisis only when mario draghi famously pledged the ecb would do whatever it takes to preserve the euro the market turmoil calmed the truth is that the europe s monetary union is still unfinished as there is neither a true banking union nor a capital market union this is because the euro was the political project from the beginning not an economic one it was never an optimal currency area but the idea was that the euro would push european countries toward deeper integration making wars impossible as economists we are thus a bit skeptical of the prospects of the common currency and the whole bloc indeed as the chart below shows the eurozone performed worse than the us the former economy grew 31 4 percent by q3 2018 compared to 50 5 percent for the latter chart 1 real gdp growth in the eurozone blue line and in the us red line from q1 1999 to q3 2018 as an index where q1 1999 100 however the pace of growth was also lower than in the us before the introduction of the euro and the common currency did not prevent the whole bloc from growing although the performance differed among the countries actually the euro s performance has been demonized its performance has not been as poor as one could expect given the moderate growth in the gdp and all those gloomy headlines just look at the chart below which presents the eur usd exchange rate since the creation of the euro chart 2 eur usd exchange rate from january 1999 to december 2018 as one can see the euro s value against the us dollar was initially 1 1812 from then to the end of 2018 it dropped to 1 1456 or 3 percent not so bad given that fact that it is used in several economically distinct countries what are the implications for the gold market quite important as it turns out please look at the chart above once again although the correlation is not perfect it s clear that the performance of euro which is the second widely used reserve currency in the world is significantly linked to the gold prices it s true that the eurozone faces many problems including still weak banking system or the rise in populism but investors should acknowledge that the euro area is more robust today than it was at the start of the greek sovereign debt crisis for example the european policy makers established the rescue fund and launched the banking union moreover despite the populist revolution almost 75 percent of the eurozone s population support the euro even in italy almost 70 percent supports the common currency and funny enough when the risk premium increased italy s new government also started to express more sympathy towards the euro all this means that the euro is out of the danger zone at least in the short run actually the slowdown of the u s and china s expansion could push investors towards the euro denominated assets especially when the ecb starts finally hiking its interest rates if that happens and the euro strengthens against the us dollar in the second half of 2019 the price of gold may go up thank you if you enjoyed the

to their business the operating environment in texas remains challenging near term with low occupancy and one of the lowest medicaid reimbursement rates in the country we are working cooperatively with daybreak by providing near term liquidity relief via a 2 5 million rent deferral for each of the first and second quarters of 2019 which preserves omega s long term economics from the lease mr

ffo to be between 3 00 and 3 12 per diluted share bob stephenson omega s cfo commented our 2019 guidance assumes that the medequities merger will be completed in the second quarter it also reflects

expect to redeploy most of the cash proceeds from the orianna transaction by mid year however the timing is very unpredictable mr stephenson concluded subject to equity market conditions we may decide to issue equity under our atm to continue to de lever which may significantly impact our guidance and we have therefore expanded our guidance range versus previous years further in order to provide

securities and exchange commission s regulation g a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance financial position or cash flows that exclude amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts that are included in the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the income statement balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statements of the company or include amounts or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts that are excluded from the most directly comparable financial measure so calculated and presented as used in this press release gaap refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america pursuant to the requirements of regulation g the company has provided reconciliations of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the company calculates and reports ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit and consequently ffo is defined as net income computed in accordance with gaap adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items primarily depreciation and amortization and impairments on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis the company believes that ffo adjusted ffo and fad are important supplemental measures of its operating performance because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue ffo described herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other real estate investment trusts or reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from the company adjusted ffo is calculated as ffo excluding the impact of non cash stock based compensation and certain revenue and expense items identified above fad is calculated as adjusted ffo less non cash interest expense and non cash revenue such as straight line rent the company believes these measures provide an enhanced measure of the operating performance of the company s core portfolio as a reit the company s computation of adjusted ffo and fad are not comparable to the nareit definition of ffo or to similar measures reported by other reits but the company believes that they are appropriate measures for this company the company uses these non gaap measures among the criteria to measure the operating performance of its business the company also uses adjusted ffo among the performance metrics for performance based compensation of officers the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation amortization impairments on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits the company offers these measures to assist the users of its financial statements in analyzing its operating performance and not as measures of liquidity or cash flow these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as measures of liquidity alternatives to net income or indicators of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap investors and potential investors in the company s securities should not rely on these non gaap measures as substitutes for any gaap measure including net income the following tables present selected

international monetary fund imf managing director christine lagarde on sunday asked pakistan to take decisive actions indicating that the fund remained inflexible in its conditions to impose new taxes and increase tariffs a prerequisite for the bailout package the development took place during a meeting between lagarde and prime minister imran khan in dubai on the sidelines of the world government summit hosted by the united arab emirates it is the first high level meeting between pm imran and the imf top management i also highlighted that decisive policies and a strong package of economic reforms would enable pakistan to restore the resilience of its economy and lay the foundations for stronger and more inclusive growth an imf handout quoted the md as saying but both the sides have agreed to remain engaged to narrow down differences on policy actions that are required to qualify for the programme that pakistan is negotiating since november 2018 the imf described meeting with the pm as constructive but the tone of its brief handout suggests that the imf top management endorsed the stance of the imf staff that is negotiating with pakistan in september last pakistan had decided to negotiate a bailout package to avoid default on its international debt obligations but things are not moving at pakistan s desired pace due to the pakistan tehreek e insaf pti government s reluctance to take politically unpopular decisions the imf is not satisfied with the previous increase in electricity and gas prices and is seeking further upward adjustments in tariffs according to the sources the imf has also demanded a complete and meaningful free float exchange rate regime which the government is not ready to concede despite extremely low level of foreign currency reserves which too built by taking loans from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates the pti government is also pumping dollars in the market to defend the value of the rupee the third major area is the fiscal policy as despite presenting two supplementary budgets the budget deficit is expected to remain around last year s level of 6 6 of the gross domestic product the sources said the imf was also asking for a permanent solution to the circular debt and commodity operations estimated over rs2 trillion the imf staff led by its washington based chief harald finger has demanded of pakistan to take some of these measures upfront before holding of the executive board meeting the imf wanted that some of the remaining measures should be taken in the first year of the programme the government is willing to take most of these measures but it differs with the timing and pace suggested by the imf finance minister asad umar is more inclined to spread these tough policy actions over the three year period of the proposed package the finance minister told the pm s economic advisory council last week that the current imf demands were not in the interests of pakistan and would put unbearable burden on the masses in this background the meeting between pm imran and lagarde was arranged for half an hour according to people privy to the decision the imf handout stated that lagarde had a good and constructive meeting with imran during which we discussed recent economic developments and prospects for pakistan in the context of ongoing discussions towards an imf supported programme she reiterated imf s support for pakistan but sought decisive actions as emphasised in the new government s policy agenda protecting the poor and strengthening governance are key priorities to improve people s living standards in a sustainable manner she added in the handout the ministry of finance also issued a handout on the pm s meeting that did not shed much light on the discussions the finance ministry s handout stated that pm imran appreciated the imf s support to pakistan and shared his vision of nation building he reiterated the government s commitment for undertaking structural and governance reforms and strengthening social protection in the country it is also politically difficult for the government to take unpopular actions due to thin majority that it enjoys in the national assembly na due to some differences among the coalition partners the pti government had prorogued the na session that had been called to approve the supplementary finance bill without general debate on it stated the handout quoting the pm now the pti has decided to give two cabinet berths one each in punjab and centre to pml q its important ally the session will be held this week special assistant to the pm on media affairs iftikhar durrani said after conclusion of debate on supplementary finance bill in the senate the government has called the national assembly session on february 18 according to the finance ministry the imf md acknowledged the steps taken so far by the pakistan government for stabilising the economy and will remain engaged in supporting pakistan in sustaining its economic recovery the two sides agreed to work together on policy priorities and reforms aimed at reducing imbalances and laying the foundations of a job creating growth path in pakistan according to the finance ministry deliberations between pakistani authorities and the imf staff would continue to finalise an agreement on the contours of a programme it added

presidential contest will likely be a straight contest between incumbent muhammadu buhari of the ruling all progressives congress apc and challenger atiku abubakar of the people s democratic party pdp dozens of other candidates will be competing these include oby ezekwesili the former minister and founder of the bring back our girls movement professor kingsley moghalu the former deputy governor of the central bank of nigeria and omoyele sowore the owner of the media outlet sahara reporters but when it comes down to it it will be a two horse race idayat hassan observers hesitate to predict outcomes for nigeria s 2019 presidential and national assembly elections scheduled for saturday feb 16 but there is a consensus that with little ideological difference between the two major parties it will depend on a host of factors varying by states in this complex federal system in addition notes a recent news release based on 2018 gallup polls only a minority of nigerians trust the honesty of their political system although it s still not terribly high nigerians are almost three times as confident in the honesty of their elections ahead of their next presidential one on feb 16 than they were in 2014 before their last election roughly a third of nigerians 34 now say they have confidence in the honesty of the country s elections compared with 13 in 2014 the issues for ordinary nigerians will remain the same after as before the election corruption the economy and security but the fact that there has been vigorous debate and civil society input during the election campaign seems to indicate further consolidation of functioning albeit challenged democratic institutions surveys by afrobarometer show that despite their doubts most nigerians strongly support elections and party competition but offer mixed assessments of the quality of their elections and largely mistrust the electoral commission this africafocus bulletin contains two analytical overview articles on the election from november and december respectively by idayat hassan of the centre for development and democracy in abuja and by carl levan of american university in washington dc both articles discuss

in late january when her party switched its support to the incumbent muhammadu buhari election season is in full swing in nigeria in the presidential contest we now know it will likely be a straight contest between incumbent muhammadu buhari of the ruling all progressives congress apc and challenger atiku abubakar of the people s democratic party pdp dozens of other candidates will be competing these include oby ezekwesili the former minister and founder of the bring back our girls movement professor kingsley moghalu the former deputy governor of the central bank of nigeria and omoyele sowore the owner of the media outlet sahara reporters but when it comes down to it it will be a two horse race this will not be the first time buhari 75 and atiku 71 have faced one another both men contested the 2007 presidential elections coming a distant second and third behind the pdp s umaru yar adua in 2014 the two met again in the apc primaries with buhari emerging victorious these past races offer little guidance however for how the 2019 presidential election between these two gladiators of nigerian politics might play out there are two ways of assessing their chances of electoral success by looking at the main issues and where they stand on them and by looking at the electoral maths required to win and seeing how they are each faring the issues first the issues nigerian voters have many concerns but for many the key concerns are the same three that dominated the 2015 elections corruption in 2015 buhari drew heavily on his reputation as incorruptible as he vowed to root out corruption in 2019 he will undoubtedly reiterate this promise and has some things to boast about his government claims to have recovered n1 trillion 2 75 billion in stolen assets it has made giant strides in implementing the treasury single account tsa to reduce leakages and it has overseen the conviction of two former governors many however see president buhari s war on corruption as disappointing in particular critics accuse the government of only targeting political opponents while allowing its cronies to go scot free in this campaign though the ruling apc has a clear advantage on this issue the pdp is remembered for plundering the state during its previous sixteen years in power meanwhile its flag bearer the former vice president from 1999 to 2007 is one of the country s richest politicians and has faced several allegations of fraud in some circles atiku s very name is synonymous with highlevel graft many of the fiercest accusations against the pdp candidate have come from former president olusegun obasanjo after the two fell out dramatically in 2006 obasanjo repeatedly insisted that his former deputy was corrupt and unfit for office that was at least until a few weeks ago when obasanjo changed tack it remains to be seen if this reconciliation will alleviate the heavy cloud of corruption hanging over atiku s head economy buhari s main challenge in office has been the struggling economy which plunged into recession in 2016 it has since recovered but growth remains slow before buhari took office in 2015 one us dollar bought between n199 and n220 it recently stabilised at around n360 having soared to an all time high of n450 given this context atiku is promising to revitalise the economy and emphasising his experience atiku has business interests across nigeria and claims to have provided 50 000 direct jobs and 250 000 indirect jobs he will likely talk up the fact that he oversaw the privatisation efforts under obasanjo though the apc may respond by claiming atiku fraudulently enriched himself through this same process his selection of peter obi former anambra state governor and an astute business man as his running mate further boosts his economic credentials meanwhile his related promises to restructure the federal system and devote a minimum of 21 of the budget to education may also win him some supporters for buhari the economy may be a weakness but he will also have the advantage of incumbency his administration is currently implementing social intervention programmes said to be touching the lives of thousands in recent months it has also launched a collateral free loan scheme for micro businesses which could win sympathies among many nationwide security in office president buhari has made significant progress combating boko haram the insurgents previously controlled a sizeable portion of the north east but are now a weakened force buhari is lauded for his actions in this area but atiku may also seek credit for mobilising hunters to wade off the militants in his native adamawa while the threat from boko haram may have diminished to an extent however insecurity pervades much of the rest of the country nigeria faces the escalating herders farmers conflict biafra separationist agitations armed banditry and kidnapping to name a few buhari has been seen to be slow to respond to many of these threats and has been accused of only caring about issues that affect his own ethnic group electoral maths atiku can mount a serious challenge in the 2019 elections he is up against a candidate who spent seven months in treating an undisclosed ailment and whose national approval rating is at just 40 according to buharimeter the pdp challenger can also rely on the full party machinery now he has won the primaries and draw on the influence of party stalwarts meanwhile the formation of the opposition coalition of united political parties cupp means there will be fewer candidates to split the anti apc vote that being said the incumbent has the advantage in 2015 buhari won by a significant margin of 2 5 million votes although his record in office has been mixed 2019 looks like his election to lose below is a breakdown of the race in nigeria s six geopolitical zones for context there are currently 84 271 832 registered voters nationwide in 2011 buhari got 12 2 million votes 32 to goodluck jonathan s 22 5 million 59 in 2015 buhari got 15 4 million votes 54 to jonathan s 12 9 million 45 north west 2011 results buhari 6 453 437 60 43 jonathan 3 466 924 32 46 2015 results buhari 7 115 199 81 34 jonathan 1 352 071 15 46 2019 registered voters 20 122 934 as at august 2018 president buhari is adored by peasants in northern nigeria he is popularly referred to by them as mai gaskiya which translates roughly to trustworthy in hausa according to a source the more buhari is criticised the more people in the north love him the north west by far nigeria s most populous zone is particularly strong buhari territory in both 2011 and 2015 he won all seven states his approval rating here is 58 kano state alone has 5 462 898 registered voters as at august 2018 making it the country s second biggest voting bloc after lagos governor abdullahi umar ganduje wields extensive influence in this state and has promised buhari a gargantuan 5 million votes in the presidential poll the governor already delivered 2 9 million votes for buhari in the apc s questionable primaries there are a couple of factors going against the apc however firstly the conduct of the apc primaries has created some discontent within the party and secondly former kano governor rabiu kwankwaso who helped buhari win big in 2015 has defected to the pdp and declared his full support for atiku north east 2011 results buhari 3 660 919 63 42 jonathan 1 832 651 31 75 2015 results buhari 2 848 678 75 28 jonathan 796 588 21 05 2019 registered voters 11 170 847 as at august 2018 buhari is similarly well liked in the north east where he is credited with suppressing boko haram and bringing normalcy to adamawa borno and yobe states this zone has also benefited significantly from patronage politics under buhari who has recruited many of his top lieutenants from the north east his approval rating here is 57 atiku is from the north east specifically adamawa state he also has some important allies in the zone in gombe governor ibrahim hassan dankwambo will help him win votes and in taraba former minister aisha alhassan will also exert her influence in atiku s favour having recently walked out of the apc helped by popular frustrations at taraba s ongoing insecurity alhassan s extensive influence means she is likely to help maintain the pdp s record of winning this state however atiku faces an uphill battle everywhere else in a zone that voted overwhelming for buhari in 2015 north central 2011 results buhari 1 744 575 31 87 jonathan 3 376 570 61 69 2015 results buhari 2 411 013 56 24 jonathan 1 715 818 40 03 2019 registered voters 13 333 435 as at august 2018 the north central zone is traditionally nigeria s swing region in 2011 buhari only won in niger state in 2015 he won four states kwara kogi benue and niger and lost in relatively close races in plateau nasarawa and the federal capital territory fct abuja in 2019 buhari may find it harder going than the last time many people are unhappy with the government s response to herder farmer clashes which have ravaged plateau and benue states in particular meanwhile political realignments in several states could make things tough for buhari two defections to the pdp stand out in particular bukola saraki the senate president and former kwara governor and samuel ortom governor of benue their switches of allegiance could make this zone more competitive south west 2011 results buhari 321 609 7 05 jonathan 2 836 417 62 22 2015 results buhari 2 433 122 53 6 jonathan 1 821 416 40 12 2019 registered voters 16 341 312 as at august 2018 the south west will be closely fought in 2015 the pdp only won one of the six states here but still managed to get 40 12 of the vote some believe the apc will do better in 2019 than in the last elections this is in part thanks to buhari s decision to posthumously honour mko abiola the winner of the annulled 1993 presidential elections and move democracy day to the 12 june the date of that vote abiola who grew up in ogun state is still celebrated in the south west and around nigeria buhari is also aided by the fact the apc can draw on the influence of all six governors in the south west the prominent former lagos governor bola tinubu and his ogun born vice president yemi osinbajo some factors could undermine the party s fortunes however the apc primaries have created some disgruntled figures many voters see the administration s performance in the past few years as lacklustre and the powerful church could yet play a significant and thus far unclear role the huge redeemed christian church of god in lagos may back osinbajo which would consolidate support for buhari but others like televangelist tunde bakare who first publicly announced the candidature of oby ezekwisili could encourage voters to support her potentially drawing votes away from the leading candidates south east 2011 results buhari 20 335 0 40 jonathan 4 985 246 98 69 2015 results buhari 198 248 7 04 jonathan 2 464 906 87 55 2019 registered voters 10 154 748 as at august 2018 the apc and buhari brands play poorly in the south east and they are even less popular following their handling of the biafra secessionist movement many in the south east believe the region is marginalised and the indigenous people of biafra ipob has been agitating for independence in the past few years the government has responded heavy handedly with clampdowns and arrests all this means that the pdp is likely to do very well here once again the fact that atiku picked peter obi a former anambra governor as his running mate will further attract support the downside for the pdp is that the south east is the zone with the fewest registered voters accounting for just 12 04 of the nationwide total turnout also tends be low in 2015 it was just 39 in this region and it could remain low especially with ipob calling on supporters to boycott all elections until the government agrees to hold a referendum on independence south south 2011 results buhari 49 978 0 79 jonathan 6 128 963 96 92 2015 results buhari 418 890 7 96 jonathan 4 714 725 89 66 2019 registered voters 13 148 556 as at august 2018 the south south will also largely back the pdp as it did overwhelmingly in 2011 and 2015 the region and in particular the populous rivers state will likely be a vote bank for atiku in these efforts the party will be aided by nyesom wike the rivers state governor a powerful pdp mobiliser buhari will not mount a serious challenge to atiku in the south south but he might expect his meagre 7 96 vote share from 2015 to increase following the defections of two former governors akwa ibom s godswill akpabio and delta s emmanuel uduaghan to the apc other recent sources worth noting on the elections idayat hassan from

dead heat election allafrica guest column dec 8 2018 by carl levan lagos a few weeks after muhammadu buhari s stunning electoral victory in 2015 he declared from the first day of my administration boko haram will know the strength of our collective will and commitment to rid this nation of terror and bring back peace and normalcy to all the affected areas since he penned that promise in the new york times nigeria has suffered at least 5 757 deaths attributable to boko haram 2 984 blamed on state actors and another 4 013 that point to some combination of the two according to council on foreign relations data in addition hundreds of shiite religious minorities died at the hands of the military violence between farmers and pastoralists has exploded and a secessionist movement in the southeast is simmering at the moment the february 2019 presidential election in nigeria appears to be a dead heat a september poll by national noi reported that 43 of nigerians approved of buhari s performance 42 disapproved and a rather sizeable 15 of the population was up for grabs research for my new book and some survey data suggest that buhari s record on insecurity is not necessarily critical to winning the 2019 election in response to an open ended survey question in 2017 afrobarometer found unemployment and management of the economy ranked first and second 53 percent and 35 percent respectively among citizens priorities insecurity was not mentioned i found that insecurity and specifically concern about boko haram related violence ranked high among citizens minds in the two years or so before the 2015 election but buhari s all progressive congress apc won on a platform that emphasized economic growth anticorruption and electoral integrity through a content analysis of 929 coded references i found that the apc and the then incumbent people s democratic party pdp systematically emphasized different issues one unexpected finding concerned the non issues that the pdp talked about the party barons were more likely to campaign by attending funerals weddings and parties the pdp also failed to capitalize on some of its strengths including gender and some modest improvements for women during president goodluck jonathan s tenure the apc mentioned such social issues twice as much despite buhari s outdated views on women these findings are important because they demonstrate that there were substantive differences between what nigeria s parties talked about in 2015 while these differences might not amount to the ideological contrasts nostalgically recalled from postindependence era it does suggest that issues and party platforms are starting to matter my statistical analysis of survey data shows that president jonathan s team sought to mobilize the party s base by cultivating political polarization on the issue of insecurity in the end poorer more economically pessimistic voters rallied to buhari i found that citizens evaluation of past economic performance self reported level of wealth and expectations for which party would improve the economy all strongly correlated with voting intentions in 2015 once again the ruling party is vulnerable on the economic issues nigeria s economy contracted by 1 6 percent in 2016 inflation remains high around 11 percent though oil prices have recovered and the world bank s forecast for 2018 is about 2 1 percent gdp growth this does not appear to give buhari a strong issue to run on in such situations the classic african story is for politicians to turn to social cleavages to mobilize voters in 2015 i found that religion predicted nigerians voting preferences even more reliably than ethnicity specifically an individual s selfidentification as a muslim corresponded with a nearly 56 percent decline in support for goodluck jonathan the incumbent christian president from the south these results hold up even after controlling for factors that could interfere with the predicted relationship such as income education gender age and the popularity of a state s governor this mitigates some of the good news from my findings about the pdp and the apc campaigning on different issues and the politicization of religion is a warning for future electoral contests however for 2019 both candidates are northern muslims buhari is squaring off against former vice president atiku abubakar from adamawa one of the northeastern states heavily impacted by boko haram the two candidates will therefore need to distinguish themselves on the issues in order to win anti corruption remains buhari s strongest card to play two former governors joshua dariye and jolly nyame have both been sentenced while corruption investigations are common and allegations are an impulsive political habit convictions of highlevel officials are very rare despite the lagging economy buhari might construct an effective message there as i show in my book voting on the economy is not simply about evaluations about past performance or a voters subjective condition it is also about whether voters believe the candidate offers a convincing message of hope however such a message has been contaminated by buhari s credibility gap in other areas as president jonathan learned with the bringbackourgirls movement mishandling one policy area results in reputational spillover to other areas president buhari recently had to offer a proof of life in response to bizarre allegations flooding social media that he was no longer alive and the government was using a body double this appears intended to cynically evoke memories of president umaru musa yar adua s long absence from public view due to poor health in 2010 buhari also left the country for seven weeks to receive medical treatment more importantly buhari s administration has often misled the public about progress against boko haram most recently the military very publicly disputed casualty figures in recent battles since larger losses by the army would imply that the insurgency remains deadly and buhari has not lived up to his 2015 campaign promises the islamic state west africa s province iswap currently claims to control areas such as buni gari and apparently the military did not successfully re take the towns of arge and kangarwa at its worst the administration has put civilians at the center of this propaganda war refugees international earlier this year noted that humanitarian agencies could not reach 930 000 people in need of assistance due to military restrictions on movement and many internally displaced persons idps were being pressured to return a veneer of normalcy with former victims returning home would create compelling optimistic optics however the northeast remains anything but normal the united nations estimated in september that 7 7 million people require humanitarian assistance in borno yobe and adamawa states thus even if insecurity and the humanitarian crisis are not the priority they were for voters in 2015 they could hurt his chances by influencing the public s assessment of his promises my analysis of the last election also offers an important finding that should inform both the conduct and the content of the current presidential campaigns in 2015 voters demanded electoral integrity and rewarded the party that offered it voters need to believe the probity of the democratic process itself and in the long run all nigerians win with free and fair elections africafocus bulletin is an independent electronic publication providing reposted

the federal government is mustering the political will to coerce revenue generation through high profile individuals ministerial departments and agencies and others to fittingly submit to the federation account what is due to government odimegwu onwumere unearths that millions of dollars have been lost to tax defaulters and the private sector is dogged to say that businesses provide for themselves power water roads etc being the reason taxes are paid upon the many tax policies by the successive governments suggesting the contrary however this article traces that nigerians would be profitably inclined to paying taxes only if the revenues ensuing from such taxes are wisely utilised for socio economic infrastructure development of the assorted parts of the country thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe it was a season of fear and desperation as the federal government fg vowed not to leave any stone hiding tax defaulters unturned especially among the political class hence the fg mounted its satellite at all corners to apprehend tax violators in an effort in making sure that the fg s promise was kept the executive chairman federal inland revenue service firs mr tunde fowler urged the nigeria police force to assist the agency in the battle against tax defaulters the livid fowler was not happy that over 40 000 people or so in the rank and file were yet to pay their tax he told the acting inspector general of police mohammed abubakar adamu when the later paid a courtesy visit to the revenue house in abuja in february this year that the agency would not allow tax violators to rest till they comply with the directive of the agency from its check of tax evaders from 45 000 persons on firs record the heated fowler said that the sum of n23 billion was realised through a close up of over n100 million owned by each as turnover in their accounts it was grasped that such foray as the government integrated financial and management information system and remita put defaulters at a corner when they noticed that the authorities had evidences against them expensive and expansive buildings at choice places across the country were beamed with government s searchlight in some states the fg had the support of governors with state governments reveling building documents of owners lagos and abuja became the first where the fg mounted its battle in the fight for tax compliance heralding battle it was less than three weeks in the month of march 2018 to the expiration of voluntary asset and income declaration scheme vaids a federal government amnesty programme keyed in from july 1 2017 to march 31 2018 for tax defaulters to voluntarily regularise their tax profiles this pet programme was however attended to with pressure from politicians ex governors and other dignitaries for the authorities to extend the tax amnesty expiry date before she was disgraced out of office over alleged certificate forgery last year the then minister of finance mrs kemi adeosun had amplified that defaulters of tax who refused to comply with the amnesty programme would be named shamed and prosecuted they were majority among the political class research revealed in the same vein fowler had in an interview on february 26 2018 advised high flying nigerians with tax burdens to take lead of the vaids as political social or economic distinction would not separate them from sanctions for non compliance while at the first annual lecture of the lagos state professorial chair of tax and fiscal matters held at the ade ajayi auditorium of the university of lagos in december 2017 adeosun said that only 40 million taxable adults in nigeria pay taxes out of 70 million she went further to say that about 13 per cent of nigerians who were active tax payers only paid given that their taxes were deducted under the pay as you earn paye category but in a speech delivered on june 29 2017 by the then acting president of the federal republic of nigeria professor yemi osinbajo titled how tax paying nigerian can curb corruption make govts responsible it was a different version to the claim by adeosun professor osinbajo said according to the federal inland revenue service the total number of tax payers in nigeria is just 14 million of this number 96 have their taxes deducted at source from their salaries under the p a y e system while just 4 comply under direct assessment so the vast majority of nigerians do not pay taxes there was experts opinion revealing that over 180 million nigerians living in nigeria bvn exposed that individual account holders were more than 30 5 million as at january 2018 the national identity management company nimc showed a data base of 22 million nigerians according to statistics it was believed that infinitesimal number out of the working population paid taxes this exposition was made through data which was mined it was further gathered that the government was able to get the assets of many of the high profile individuals through its data mining programme dubbed project lighthouse high profile individuals were not at rest when they observed that government had exhumed their net worth with proof of where they hid many of their assets many tax defaulters were however contacted by the vaids office the tax war went berserk concerning taxing nigerians abroad but adeosun in august 2017 during a facebook live video chat tagged tax thursday seemingly cleared air on the nigerian government s plan on diaspora taxes she said it is not for every nigerian it is for nigerians resident for tax purposes if you are a nigerian resident for tax purposes it means you live in nigeria for 195 days of the year the highlight of the double statements from officials was a proof that there were many challenges and prospects in the tax system in nigeria evidence was the lack of statistical data experts said that poor tax administration andmultiplicity of taxes characterised the system something that nigeria inherited from the colonial administration based on 1948 british tax laws these laws were mainly structured on revenue generation and it prompted the income tax management act itma of 1961 where personal incomes were taxed throughout the country since then many amendments have been made to the 1961 itima actthat yielded little or no result seemingly the project lighthouse was able to be successful through data harvested from government agencies such as the corporate affairs commission the nigeria customs service and the nigerian communications commission outcome of vaids some politicians complied with the vaids many others were yet to comply but the outcome of compliers boosted the image of nigeria in the world tax ranking index fowler was also happy with the vaids the world bank was first to recognise this when it upgraded the country s tax collection ranking from number 171 to 157 analysts believed that the ranking was the efforts of the government of president muhammadu buhari through its reformed national tax policy in making sure that gross domestic product gained above six percent from tax revenues it was believed that the world bank supported the country so much in the reform our reporter learnt that because of vaids number of tax payers was raised to 42 percent or from 13 million to 19 2 million in 2017 this boosted the morale of the firs and it geared up to push nigeria above 14 of its contemporaries resultant of the ranking from number 171 to number 157 while fowler thanked the nigeria police force for the aid they have been rendering so far in the cause to battle tax evaders he pointed out that the agency collected a total of n5 320 trillion of tax revenue in 2018 being the highest in the history of revenue gathering of the commission but in an interview of january 27 2018 mr oseni elamah executive secretary joint tax board had said nigeria targeted n320bn revenue from vaids this was against n3 307 trillion it made in 2016 and n4 027 trillion it made in 2017 however while these huge sums were collected fowler showed uneasiness that there was decrease in the percentage of the taxes collected for example it was 2 6 in 2016 as against 2 48 in 2017 and 2 14 in 2018 before buhari government it did not meet the eyes why these huge sums of money were recovered from tax evaders in 2018 and many of the high profile individuals were yet to comply with the amnesty programme for tax defaulters exactly seven years this year there was the new personal income tax amendment act that mandated workers that included president governors their deputies ministers and bigwigs in politics to pay taxes out of their incomes the then chairman joint tax board ifueko omoigui okauru disclosed this at a media briefing to officially uncover the new act in abuja this patronizing project was aimed at bringing the personal income tax act to match with the nigerian economy with regards to understanding how the act was affecting low and middle income earners the then president goodluck jonathan was it who signed this into law in june 2017 and also evaluated income excused from tax to include bonds subjected by government and corporate entities mrs omoigui okauru who doubled then as the executive chairman federal inland revenue service firs highlighted the amendments were after over 19 years such exercise was conducted which was dubbed personal income tax act pita 1993 checks revealed that the new tax table buttressed that the primary n300 000 of income garnered would magnetize seven per cent tax rate the source went further to say that about 11 per cent was earmarked to be paid as tax on n300 000 preceding the former income 15 per cent on n500 000 19 per cent on the next n500 000 21 per cent on n1 6million and 24 per cent tax rate on incomes that were more than n3 2million discordant tunes in 2011 the lagos state government started the implementation of its land use charge law where landed property owners were forced to pay a percentage of the value of their property to the government yearly in order to shore up their internally generated revenue igr and many states joined lagos in this chorus everybody group and could be noticed to be looking for a soft ground or reason to evade or collect tax in the country on october 28 2018 some stakeholders in the private sector like the manufacturers association of nigeria man lagos chamber of commerce industry lcci were a thorn in the neck of government not to heed to any advise or call to increase value added tax vat rather government should carve a niche for itself to build on tax net and not the other these bewildered groups hinged their view on what they described as nigeria s weak economy which would not be in tandem for increase in tax rate in whatever language used in doing so it was learnt that the stakeholders were bemused when the international monetary fund imf lent its voice to the government to review the country s tax policies the call by imf was that the richest should be taxed three percent of the country s population broadening the tax support and supplementing conformity on vat those who knew better told the authorities that the imf increase in vat was a bad advise at a time nigeria was grappling with economy difficulties according to a presentation by the director general man mr segun ajayi kadir businesses do not like tax given that it is not favourable to their costs and it devours into their profits however the imf advise came at a wrong time when the country was struggling with flimsy economic growth ajayi kadir went further to state that it s unfortunate that businesses were already providing for themselves the services the government ought to have given them been the reason taxes were paid according to him businesses are covering the areas of power water roads etc for themselves being the reason taxes were paid therefore pushing up vat will be devastating at this period tax system hijacked by politicians when the oyo state government sealed up former president olusegun obasanjo farms and over forty other business firms in the state in september 2018 some politicians and political analysts labeled the move as a political witch hunt but the government in a swift reaction through the chairman oyo state board of internal revenue oybir mr bicci alli said during the oybir sensitisation and enlightenment meeting with the members of the organised private sectors and chambers of commerce under the aegis of manufacturers association of nigeria man oyo state chapter at man house jericho road ibadan that the move was occasioned by the recalcitrant behaviour of the affected firms to habituate with the tax laws of the state after a resounding long notice were given to them by september 11 2018 the peoples democratic party pdp through its spokesman kola ologbondiyan showed anger that the economic and financial crimes commission efcc had not investigated and prosecuted the all progressives congress apc leader asiwaju bola tinubu over allegations of tax fraud amounting to n160 billion taxes by a company linked to him according the source nigerians can now see how the same ibrahim magu led efcc which rushes to pounce on arrest and lock up innocent nigerians particularly perceived political opponents of president buhari without investigation has practically gone frozen and toothless because a member of the apc cabal is involved does it not smack of hypocrisy that president buhari who boasted that he was going to jail more looters has been looking the other way while presidency officials suppress investigations since whistle blowers alerted that alpha beta a company linked with his party leader asiwaju tinubu allegedly swindled nigerians to the tune of a whopping n160 billion in tax fraud is it not equally hypocritical that under the same president buhari s watch where the federal inland revenue service firs has threatened to block the bank accounts of tax evaders a leader of his party had been dragged before the efcc yet mr president is pretending to be unaware remove hijackers in november 2018 while at the signing of memorandum of understanding mou with the association of national accountants of nigeria anan in lagos dr cyril ede president chartered institute of taxation of nigeria citn hinged the need to remove hijackers in the tax environment in synergy with other expert financial bodies by july 21 2017 executive director of the civil society legislative advocacy centre cislac mr auwal rafsanjani in abuja had called on the independent national electoral commission inec to force political parties to include tax agenda in their manifestos ahead of 2019 elections this was part of an eight point communiqu√© said rafsanjani issued at the end of a stakeholders interface on the national tax policy the federal government is commended for adopting a consultative approach in the development of the new policy and reflecting inputs from stakeholders including the national tax justice and governance platform the review of the national tax policy was long overdue considering the challenges identified in the tax system under the previous policy the new policy emphasises the ability to pay principle focus on progressive tax rates promoting equality avoidance of multiple taxation explicit grievance mechanisms transparency and accountability frameworks said rafsanjani on november 6 2017 a former deputy governor of the central bank of nigeria and 2019 presidential hopeful prof kingsley moghalu in an interview blamed the federal and state governments of being lame duck in their approach to revenue generation while this lasted a tax expert mr abulazeez musa who also heads public engagement department of oxfam in nigeria on may 3 2018 advised the federal government to espouse progressive taxation system to heighten revenue generation for evenhandedness in the country s fiscal governance system using vaids as a case study with the federal government applying to the national assembly to grant it permission for 5 5 billion in borrowing moghalu hinted that it was not farfetched to say that over 60 per cent of revenues earned by nigeria were already meant for debt servicing why nigerians hardly pay tax in a public presentation of march 13 2018 by a public figure in nigeria reuben abati titled lagos state and the politics of taxation our reporter traced the cause many nigerians hardly pay their taxes abati buttressed that given the temerity nobody enjoys to pay taxes he went memory lane to point out the many historical and cultural features to this he gave an instance that the community always frowned at the taxman owing to the fact that he was not a well known member of the community against this backdrop investigations showed that many countries of the world had been into wars and revolutions in their attempts to collect or not to pay taxes abati voiced that in the yoruba land for instance there were wars in the 18thand 19th centuries in rejections of what was known as isakole ground rent to the sovereign or owo asingba service to chiefs and kings as a form of tribute he translated these to mean symbols of dominance over political authority and or economic activities creating a slave master relationship among dominant dominated groups abati gave another instance in the area of what he called the famous aba women s riot of 1929 he narrated that the riot was in protestation against what he called the draconian warrant chiefs saddled with power by the rapacious colonial administration who were in the habit of direct taxation of market women there was the abeokuta women s union awu led by mrs funmilayo ransome kuti in late 1940s that objected to the taxation of women in the egba division abati gave instances of the many rebellions against taxation in nigeria and surmised that the introduction of vaids and a new national tax policy ntp in 2017 by the buhari administration many nigerians would consider the vaids a joke given the historical and cultural features why nigerians refused to pay tax however opinion leaders considered the near failed tax policies in the country as a detestable indictment they were of the belief that nigeria had lost focus and was out of touch with reality they pointed out that nigeria abandoned common sense to utilise revenue from crude oil when oil was booming rather the country s spurious leaders allegedly stole billions of dollars that accrued from oil to their foreign bank accounts they frowned saying that lawmakers and top civil servants were laws unto themselves unlike in countries like america and britain where lawmakers paid income tax on their earnings and were ever ready to present any extra income outside their parliamentarian duties they pointed out that such income was taxed and well documented by their tax authorities nonetheless the good looking moghalu was amazed that the country was becoming heavily indebted after a former president olusegun obasanjo 1999 2007 cleared the inherited debts that the governments before his accumulated moghalu did not believe in the economics which stated that with nigeria s debt to gross domestic product gdp ratio at 19 per cent that the country was safe to incessant borrowing what matters is the debt service to revenue ratio he said just like moghalu the chairman of bgl plc and former minister of finance dr kalu idika kalu had in august 18 2010 at the 6th aelex legal practitioners and arbitrators lecture in lagos taught that nigerians would be constructively predisposed to paying taxes if the revenues accruable from such taxes were sensibly utilised for socio economic infrastructure

picture credit ap recently the white house has been pushing its america first stance in the world trade organization wto by controversial appeals to a national security exception in response to the trump tariffs several wto members have brought dispute settlement cases against the u s the world bank is next in the firing line reportedly the white house will announce david malpass as the nominee for president of the world bank after jim yong kim s resignation well before the end of his five year term in 2022 in the 2016 election malpass served as trump s economic advisor a year later he was appointed undersecretary for international affairs in the u s department of the treasury but he is an odd choice to head the world bank a bit like selecting a coal ceo to head the struggle against climate change an america first world bank like u s representative of trade robert lighthizer malpass began his political career in the 1980s reagan administration seeking to contain the rise of japan through the section 301 of the 1974 trade act the same unilateral legislation trump is exploiting against china in the current trade dispute during his 15 years as chief economist at bear stearns malpass was not known for his economic foresight a year before the global crisis he wrote that housing and debt market corrections will probably add to the length of the u s economic expansion and amidst lingering crisis he urged for higher interest rates during his tenure as under secretary of the treasury for international affairs malpass has taken an aggressive position against china in early 2018 he slammed china s non market behavior advocating stronger responses when trump s tariff wars began some 20 career staff quit malpass s unit in less than a year opposing the administration s unilateral trade policies and malpass s poor leadership style to malpass the world bank is a giant sprawl of international organizations that create mountains of debt without solving problems he promotes a new debt transparency initiative that would shed more light on the international liabilities of the world s governments such an initiative would not target america s 22 trillion pile of sovereign debt but china s belt and road initiative bri should he walk the talk this could cause a fatal rift in world bank as of november 2018 the largest recipients of world bank loans were india 859 million in 2018 and china 370 million in 2018 malpass could subject china and its loans to a politicized scrutiny effectively extending u s investment reviews through the bank in that view his nomination has done nothing to diminish china s concerns that the existing international institutions will not accommodate it toward an america first imf since the bretton woods the president of the world bank has been an american while the international monetary fund imf has been led by a european both institutions are located in washington d c and work closely with each other as international extensions of the u s department of the treasury as critics contend amid the 2008 crisis fall imf chief dominique strauss kahn managed to achieve g20 cooperation that contained the global free fall in exchange advanced economies pledged commitment to global governance reforms in multilateral development banks yet those reforms were ignored after strauss kahn was replaced with french finance minister christine lagarde as global managing partner of u s headquartered baker mckenzie lagarde lived full time in chicago until 2005 through the nomination process she was subject of a legal investigation over alleged abuse of power in the tapie affair in 2016 a french court found her guilty of negligence but did not impose a penalty that s how lagarde was re appointed for another five year term at the imf imf s economic stance is shifting toward washington as well recently lagarde appointed gina gopinath as the imf chief economist to succeed maurice obstfeld gopinath is a veteran u s economist and co director at national bureau of economic research in her most recent work she has been an outspoken advocate of the u s dollar whose dominance she expects to continue largely undisturbed she has cooperated with former imf economic counselor kenneth rogoff who has for years criticized china s debt as opposed to u s debt as a global risk since 2011 brics economies brazil russia india china and south africa have stressed that the selection of the imf chief on the basis of nationality undermines its international legitimacy in a 2015 interview even jim yong kim predicted that you will never again see an imf or a world bank election without very strong contention coming especially from the developing world despite the 2010 cosmetic reforms advanced economies continue to dominate world bank voting shares over emerging economies today the seven major advanced economies account for 45 and the largest seven emerging economies comprise almost 30 of the world economy nevertheless advanced countries still control nearly 40 of world bank voting shares as opposed to only 9 15 for emerging economies figure figure advanced and emerging economies economic versus voting power nominal gdp 2019 voting power 2019 ibrd ida world bank the world bank comprises the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which provides loans to middle income economies and the international development association ida which targets low income economies the former accounts for 15 the latter 9 of total votes there is a gap between emerging economies economic power and their voice in the international community and the gap is deepening since emerging economies are growing relatively faster their economic share will exceed that of advanced economies within a decade or two from reforms to retrenchment since the early 2010s china has been promoting the huge multi decade belt and road initiative bri which seeks to energize industrialization and modernization in many large emerging and developing economies the obama administration took a skeptical view of the initiative which the trump administration has branded as a national security risk to america in october 2013 china proposed creating a new multilateral development bank the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib in the obama era the white house stayed out of the aiib and tried but failed to prevent its partners and allies from joining the bank a year later brazil russia india china and south africa launched the new development bank ndb to accelerate lending on infrastructure projects the obama white house sought to marginalize it while the trump administration sees cooperative activities with potential eurasian hegemons as a national security risk as the world bank may face a divisive political struggle u s interests are growing more prominent at the imf while the wto has been targeted by trade hawks attempts by emerging and developing economies to help themselves are shunned as security threats to american interests meanwhile the west s multilateral development banks are bailing out rich european economies targeting poorer ones and sanctioning those that oppose washington s unilateralism the gap between the multipolar 21st century world economy and an aging west which created its prosperity through colonial plunder in the 19th century is progressively deepening that serves neither america s nor emerging powers long term interests
by amy s will the china s economic collapse happen in 2019 i have been warning for years that the greatest and final economic collapse in this century would be china now that cracks in the great red dragon s economy are widening it s time to prepare for the china s yuan crash and the great depression in china china has a unique state driven model of capitalism that clueless economists have hailed as the new model for economic success but i say china s yuan and economy will fail drastically proving once and for all that government planned economies do not work as well as free market capitalism balanced by democracy every indicator of economic health in china is down on top of apple s slumping sales here car sales have plunged for the first time in 20 years property sales housing construction foreign investment december imports and exports are all slowing and the job market has gotten a lot tougher chinese policymakers are struggling to turn around the rapidly weakening economy the world s second largest with growth in 2018 at its lowest rate for 28 years and the government showing its alarm has been censoring bad news about the imminent economic collapse for months a raft of bad financial data in recent weeks suggests the turnaround efforts so far have not worked raising alarm about how bad things might get especially if the trade war with the united states drags on china s economic woes along with a worrying decline in european manufacturing have sparked fears of a global economic collapse there is no way this can end any way other than very very badly the question is when will an economic collapse come the answer is sadly sooner than you d like i expect major problems in china likely by the summer or fall when the economic collapse and china s yuan crash will occur there won t be an effective help from the u s europe or japan and it will shocking the whole world it will make the u s financial crisis look like a sunday afternoon picnic 100 certainty the economy will collapse prepare for the imminent economic collapse so what will happen after the collapse or what is the reason for it what will happen is united states of america canada south america will become one nation called north american union or no just the same as the eurozone another sign of weakness in the dollar is of countries turning to precious metals such as gold and silver as a safe haven for a failing currency while the west is downplaying really scoffing at the importance of gold and silver to protect their fiat dollar which dislikes a hard asset backing the east has been steadily building up its purchases and converting its large supply of us dollars into the precious metals the west had better be alert to this or they may find themselves in a weakened position with respect to the east when the global economy collapses china japan and other asian countries will all unite as well to become an asian union africa and middle eastern countries will unite back at home we will have a new currency called amero this is why there is little concern about border control the problem is is we american s will not stand for it they know this the us is just as vulnerable as any superpower in the past to decline the first major one being the roman empire to assume that the us could not be subject to decline is a gross error and perhaps a sign of arrogance unfortunately i predict that the global economy will collapse from a black swan event sooner rather than later how we can predict the next financial crisis the 2007 2008 financial crisis you might think was an unpredictable one time crash but didier sornette and his financial crisis observatory have plotted a set of early warning signs for unstable growing systems tracking the moment when any bubble is about to pop and he s seeing it happen again right now this is not anylonger a speculation the world economy will collapse civil unrest will occur it is only a matter of when a few months or slightly more the world is going down and the new world order is here null we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us prepare for the imminent economic collapse make sure everyone is aware of the situation in order to prepare for economic collapse you will have to make sure that your whole family is on board with your preparations this means informing them in honest terms what is about to happen and telling them what they should be doing make sure everyone takes the situation seriously otherwise they will not be mentally prepared in the event that economic collapse actually occurs 1 start an emergency fund if you are living paycheck to paycheck and you lose your job during an economic collapse you are at risk for losing your home and living in poverty it won t be easy to find another job and replace your income your goal should be to save up enough to cover six months of expenses in your emergency fund 2 have cash on hand depending on where you have it money in your emergency fund might be hard to liquidate bonds for example must be sold and other investments like cd s might charge fees for early withdrawal also if you have a savings account with an online bank instead of a brick and mortar institution it might take several days to withdraw your money it s important to have cash that you can access easily either from a savings account or a cash box in your home this can tide you over in an emergency until you can access money in your emergency fund 3 generate an additional source of income start a home business as a second source of income if you lose your job because of an economic collapse it might be difficult or even impossible to find another job having an alternative source of income can help you to keep your home and avoid poverty n addition think about how likely it will be that people will require these services in an economic collapse people may need basic necessities like clean water or food 4 get out of debt in a financial collapse many people are going to lose their jobs and their homes to prepare for this possibility you should make a plan to get out of debt as quickly as possible this way if you do lose your job you don t have to worry about finding a way to pay these bills the worst kind of debt to have is credit card debt because of the high interest rates that many people have carrying a balance on a credit card can cost you a great deal of money 5 stockpile food the kind of food you store up for an emergency is different from the groceries you purchase each week you need to get food that is non perishable does not have to be refrigerated and will provide you with the nutrition you need to survive it may be very different from the food you are used to eating but you will be glad you have it if you ever need it purchase food that does not have to be refrigerated or frozen so you don t have to worry about power outages include foods highly nutritious foods that are easy to store such as dried foods nuts beans canned meat and vegetables and powdered milk for comfort foods avoid snack foods that will quickly expire instead stock up on spaghetti and spaghetti sauce soups sugar and honey for canning and baking dried fruit coffee and tea and hard candy here s just a glimpse of what you ll find inside carnivore s bible you ll discover the ancient meat preservation method that will make your mouth water enjoying the delicious sweet smoky taste of beef pork or link sausages for months to come without any refrigeration chemicals preservatives or additives and you can prepare everything in your back yard or balcony in one afternoon i promise it will be more relaxing than taking the day off to go fishing you ll also learn how to get rid of the toxic canned food from the supermarket and preserve your own healthy delicious vegetables and fruits all you need is granddad bob s secret canning trick to instantly kill bacteria and parasites 6 create an emergency kit this is a collection of household items you might need in an emergency in the event of an economic collapse you may not be able to shop for these supplies so it s important to have them on hand keep your supplies in a container that s easy to carry in case you have to evacuate for some reason 7 choose your shelter type a standalone shelter is a separate building that is designed to withstand natural disasters or man made weapons or attacks an internal shelter is a room within your home that has been designed to protect you from the elements or other hazards in an economic collapse power systems may fail and looters and scavengers may threaten your home take precautions to protect yourself 8 purchase self defense tools self defense tools are generally non lethal they are used to fend off an attack by rendering the attacker ineffective you can use everyday objects such as baseball bats or keys but these may not be as effective as tools designed for your protection

a guest post from ben richardson associate professor in international political economy at the university of warwick ben researches trade and development with a focus on agricultural commodities he is author of sugar polity 2015 and is currently completing an ersc project working beyond the border european union trade agreements and international labour standards on which this post is based awarded annually for the best novel in the english language the man booker prize has established itself as a major event in the british cultural calendar its fiftieth anniversary was commemorated accordingly a documentary on the bbc a festival at the southbank centre a reception at buckingham palace for former winners but the prize harbours a darker history one which this anglocentric story of literary triumph firmly seals within the distant past the prize takes its name from its initial sponsor booker mcconnell one of the preeminent companies of the british empire the commercial lifeblood of booker had been sugar and its heartland was british guiana a colony on the northern tip of south america indeed so dominant was the company in the country s affairs that it became known simply as booker s guiana bringing a rare shaft of light onto this imperial relationship the winner of the booker prize in 1977 john berger used his acceptance speech to publicly denounce the company s exploitative practices in what by then had become the independent state of guyana fusing race and class politics he symbolically dedicated half his prize money to the black panthers and their ongoing resistance in the west indies both as black people and workers while berger s intervention retains critical force it requires contemporary renewal booker s has long since gone divesting from the country and diversifying into other activities like wholesaling slowly erasing public memory of their colonial past for guyana meanwhile the preeminent issue in the sugar industry is no longer exploitation but expulsion with mounting economic pressures linked to trade reforms in europe erupting in plantation closures mass redundancy and political discontent the ongoing celebration of the man booker prize thus provides a way to reconnect these developmental stories and consider again what the legacies of british imperialism mean for both modern day guyana and the uk the fight against sugar imperialism it was a friendship between two white british expatriates based in the caribbean the writer ian fleming and the chairman of booker mcconnell jock campbell which first led the company into the literary business fleming had wanted to reduce the taxes he was paying on the james bond books and did so by selling the copyrights to booker mcconnell in 1964 creating what would become its profitable author s division shortly after when two enterprising publishers sought sponsorship of a prize for english language novels written in the commonwealth it was to this division that they turned for funds campbell s interest in supporting the arts can be seen as part of his broader commitment to what we would now call socially responsible business campbell had been a powerful reforming force within booker mcconnell driven by his guilt at seeing first hand how his own family had made their fortune in british guiana as told to the historian clem seecharan campbell recalled on the day i got there i was conscious that this had all been built on first of all slavery and then cheap labour he was right records collated at the ucl legacies of british slave ownership database show that after the abolition of slavery in 1833 and decision by the british government to compensate slave owners for their loss of property nine members of the campbell family successfully claimed for 2 261 slaves they were awarded 106 556 by the british state around 13m in today s money the campbell family firm merged with booker in 1939 the latter had grown significantly during the nineteenth century haphazardly acquiring indebted plantations that were struggling to compete against subsidised european sugar beet imported from the continent quickly ascending the corporate hierarchy one of jock campbell s most notable achievements was to negotiate the 1951 commonwealth sugar agreement with the british ministry of food this guaranteed fixed imports of sugar by britain at prices offering reasonable remuneration to efficient producers a concept cleverly appropriated from its post war policy toward domestic farmers as set out in the 1947 agricultural act benefitting from more stable revenue flows into booker mcconnell campbell oversaw paternalist initiatives to improve the housing health and social welfare of workers and as part of his broader support for decolonisation advanced a guianisation of the industry through training and promotion for the agitators of independence this was insufficient chief among these was cheddi jagan a descendant of the hundreds of thousands of british subjects in india who had been transported to guiana as indentured labour following the eventual manumission of african slaves this was a mass migration orchestrated by the british state and sponsored by planters like the bookers and campbells which tied workers to specific plantations until they earned their legal freedom after a given number of years jagan s way of seeing the world was indelibly coloured by the violence he witnessed on these plantations and other places controlled by colonial capital neatly encapsulating this worldview the map on the very first page of his autobiography the west on trial depicted guyana not by electoral constituencies or sites of national significance but simply by commodities sugar plantations along the coast bauxite mines along the rivers timber concessions in the forested interior jagan s sense of injustice found expression in revolutionary marxism which he used to articulate his fight against sugar imperialism counter posed against campbell s social reformism his position was uncompromising nothing less than full nationalisation of the sugar mills cane land transport networks and irrigation systems would suffice through the autonomous labour movement and in particular the militant sugar workers who would form the guiana agricultural workers union gawu jagan oversaw a number of strikes to further the cause of trade union recognition taking tactical advantage of the need for sugar cane to be cut and milled at precisely the right moment in the harvest season to cause maximum disruption and to appeal to disenfranchised people across the colony the political wing of this movement the people s progressive party extended its ideological ambition beyond just sugar declaring its intent to build a just socialist society in which the industries of the country shall be socially and democratically owned in 1968 the same year as the booker prize was launched guyana finally had its first general election as an independent state the struggle for independence had been intensified by the military and political interventions of the uk and us both had perceived a threat in jagan s ideology another cuban revolution and state seizure of foreign owned property could not countenanced more than just stalling decolonisation anglo american machinations deliberately splintered the fragile multi ethnic coalition of the people s progressive party pitting its indo guyanese and afro guyanese constituents against one another consequently many industrial relations disputes escalated into racialised conflicts as scab labour of african descent was recruited on behalf of booker and used to undermine strikes by predominantly indian sugar workers one infamous clash occurred in 1964 when a strike breaker drove a tractor through protestors squatting outside a sugar mill killing a woman named kowsilla a defining moment for the sugar workers a bust of kowsilla still sits in the gawu office today pride of place alongside pictures of marx and lenin with covert financial support from the us it was the people s national congress the renamed faction of the people s progressive party led by the afro guyanese leader forbes burnham which presided over independence rigging and winning the ensuing election despite the political animosity jagan was determined to realise his vision and so subsequently offered critical support to his former party ally in order that the burnham government might press ahead with nationalisation of the sugar industry foreclosing the formation of a broader opposition to the ruling regime with multi ethnic parties like the working peoples alliance led by radical black intellectual walter rodney with jagan s backing nationalisation of the sugar industry was completed in 1976 albeit by compensating booker rather than expropriating them at a stroke a company accounting for almost one third of the country s gdp was put under state ownership renamed and reclaimed as guysuco the guyana sugar corporation any hopes that this would induce cross party socialist unity in the country soon disappeared disagreement over profit sharing led to an industry wide strike by gawu members lasting an incredible 135 days supported from afar by dock workers in the uk who refused to unload what guyanese sugar was exported this compounded the mismanagement of burnham s one party state which had become increasingly self serving and detached from its initial ethnic constituency manning guysuco with politically favoured appointments who awarded contracts to their own business interests as the economy began to collapse straining under the debt incurred by nationalisation of the sugar and bauxite industries further state repression and mass emigration followed driven by this exodus guyana still has one of the highest emigrant populations in the world with over one in three citizens living outside the country a people twice diasporised to borrow stuart hall s term the conflict over industrial restructuring the colonial ties of ownership had been severed in guyana but those of trade lived on following the uk s accession to the european economic community in 1973 the commonwealth sugar agreement evolved into the sugar protocol its supporters included jock campbell who was by now a peer in the house of lords as well as tate lyle soon to become the uk s sole refiner of cane sugar as with its predecessor the sugar protocol had the deliberate effect of locking suppliers and buyers together through a formal trade agreement and insulating both from the vicissitudes of the world market the difference was that this time it had to be shoehorned into europe s common agricultural policy the resulting arrangement used tariffs to restrict imports and guarantee high stable prices to european beet farmers and some former sugar colonies including guyana which were granted preferential market access this came under repeated attack from sugar exporters excluded from the sugar protocol and in favour of free trade this external pressure was mirrored internally as the european commission sought consistency with the multilateral trade rules agreed on within the world trade organisation wto and were prepared to sacrifice elements of the common agricultural policy to do it triggered by a dispute brought to the wto by australia brazil and thailand the eu began a decade long overhaul of its tightly managed sugar regime loosening controls over supply and lowering domestic prices to world market levels the sugar protocol was unilaterally renounced and its signatories effectively paid off with development aid in guyana which exported the vast majority of its sugar to the eu the price cut was a painful wound to suffer in both commercial and moral terms compared to other sugar exporters guysuco has been relatively high cost attempts had been made after the burnham era to make it commercially viable booker was brought back to manage the company under contract part of a broader structural adjustment programme orchestrated by the international monetary fund to resuscitate guyana s ailing economy industrial relations improved too after cheddi jagan had been brought to power in 1992 thanks ironically to belated us support for free and fair elections in the country jagan s people s progressive party and gawu were tied together by a shared destiny and inter personal networks making collective bargaining between the state owned company and the dominant trade union less conflictual yet this alliance made decisions around restructuring difficult to take given that any loss of jobs or wages would hurt the party s electoral base the industry had turned from cash cow to sacred cow the historic animosity to booker also threw up challenges as well as providing management functions booker had been approached in 2000 to oversee construction of a brand new sugar mill and plantation in one of the country s largest ever capital investments after this ran into operational difficulties the government tore up the contract booker sued and was vindicated by the courts awarded 664 000 in fees owed the indo guyanese alliance governing the sugar industry came to an end in 2015 when the people s progressive party was defeated in the general election by a coalition of parties including a successor to burnham s people s national congress and removed from office after 23 years in power regime change happened at a critical juncture the eu price cut and subsequent decline in export revenues had made industrial restructuring all but inevitable seeing this coming a national commission had been established to set out a roadmap which involved privatising the industry reducing manual labour costs through mechanisation and developing spin off businesses in biofuel and aquaculture to provide alternate jobs as the country s single biggest employer it was also agreed that guysuco had to avoid swingeing redundancies though at the same time must not take on any more risky expansions the new government was accused of reneging on this plan mills and plantations were closed down with seven thousand workers around the half the company s payroll losing their jobs the majority permanently and with delays in their severance pay meanwhile the state agency given oversight of privatisation immediately took on more debt borrowing 110m to fund capital expenditure and make guysuco assets more attractive to buyers the ripple effects of these decisions have been seismic small scale farmers who grew cane for the mills lost their buyer local shops and markets saw custom disappear neighbourhood councils and the national insurance scheme suffered shortfalls in tax contributions there are future impacts to brace for too chiefly a heightened flood risk to residents in the low lying coastal cities of new amsterdam and georgetown should guysuco no longer provide its water management functions of dredging canals and pumping rainwater out over the seawall criticism of the government by opposition politicians and trade union leaders has been scathing interpreting their decisions as incompetent and callous the latter position intentionally hinting at the inter ethnic conflicts that have punctuated the country s past indeed it was this supposed mishandling of sugar restructuring that one mp cited in his reasons for defecting in no confidence vote in december 2018 effectively bringing down the government by triggering the process for an early general election the legacies of booker s guiana looking back three centuries of imperialism created a deep seated dependency on sugar that could not be overcome through political decolonisation and economic nationalisation reliance on an export commodity whose market value would continue to fall relative to other traded goods the buffer provided by preferential trade arrangements notwithstanding meant that guyana would always need to diversify its economy but such a transformation was rendered implausible by the systematic repatriation of profits during the period of foreign ownership and the country s deeply entrenched role as raw sugar supplier which limited the possibilities for building inter industry linkages to serve as alternative sources of growth and employment articulated within the tradition of dependency theory which had its own rich heritage in the caribbean the guyanese situation can be seen as one of underdevelopment an export industry in the periphery is abandoned by the metropolitan power that first created it with the poverty left behind mistakenly interpreted as an endemic feature of the region and its supposed failure to integrate into international markets looking forward the focus in guyana is now on another primary commodity one poised to revolutionise the country and begin a new chapter in its history in 2015 exxonmobil made its first significant oil discovery in the guyana basin it has now located offshore over three billion barrels of recoverable oil a reserve equivalent to iraq on a per capita basis commercial drilling is expected to begin in 2020 and will likely triple the country s gdp though questions have been asked of the favourable royalty rates granted to exxon there is no doubt that state finances will receive a sizeable fillip raising the stakes at the next general election to an unprecedented level indeed the sheer anticipation of a commodity boom is already having an effect large swathes of former cane land have been made available for gated communities and entertainment complexes to serve expatriate workers while training schemes and corporate responsibility initiatives have sought to convince guyanese society of the gilded era that black gold will bring seen in respect to the rise and fall of cane cultivation though the developmental strategy of oil extraction loses much of its lustre though it heralds a definitive break from sugar imperialism it also re inscribes the country into a similar set of power relations this time with american capital the financial asymmetry alone is stark exxon s quarterly profits are bigger than guyana s annual gdp what will this mean for state sovereignty electoral democracy economic diversification and ecological stability the answers suggested by booker s guiana are not encouraging consider the parallels in the imminent environmental contradiction whereby investments in coastal infrastructure and property funded by oil wealth will at the same time be imperilled by the sea level rises and extreme weather events caused by fossil fuel burning a heightened vulnerability that will long outlast exxon s presence despite the successive ruptures between the british motherland and its sugar colony the legacies of booker s guiana remain relevant to the uk too the labour of enslaved indentured and proletarianised workers on the sugar plantations enabled an accumulation of capital that has been inherited and transformed by subsequent generations reproducing inequalities of wealth that sustain disparities between the two countries today erasing this racialised exploitation is to whitewash british economic development a move laid bare by studies on slavery and its abolition showing for instance how compensation for slave owners was reinvested into the railways and credit lines of the industrial revolution to best remember the colonial past of booker is to bring such processes into the present this can be seen at tate lyle for instance which used its profits from decades of sugar refining to grow into a multinational food ingredients company selling off its non core sugar division in 2010 it can be seen at tesco too which in 2017 bought up booker s wholesale division for near 4 billion to help it retail to restaurants and corner shops as it does to high street customers it is there in the food and drink industry the uk s largest manufacturing sector which has long benefitted from a steady supply of affordable sugar shipped from former british colonies and finally it is buried in the cultural capital of the uk those testaments to artistic achievement that began life with money made through empire from the tate modern gallery to the man booker prize

debt to a complete disconnection of russian government banks from the global dollar transaction system congress s first hearings following its elections will be held on 12 february in the financial committee of the house of representatives according to an announcement on the department s official website the topic will be the use of sanctions and economic statecraft in addressing us national security and foreign policy challenges although the committee intends to consider all the countries that are currently under us sanctions including iran north korea and venezuela there will be a particular focus on russia according to the memorandum on the committee s website since 2014 the us has imposed sanctions on russian physical entities companies and government organs for interference in elections aggression in ukraine and in crimea a chemical attack in the uk activity in syria non compliance with sanctions against north korea and human rights abuses but these measures have proven to be insufficient to deter russia s attacks on us interests and its assault on global values the memorandum states the committee will thus consider ways to increase economic pressure on russia in 2018 10 bills were put forward in congress on measures against russia the first s 2313 h r 4884 was put forward on 16 january and required the blocking of six russian government banks gazprom rosneft and lukoil the prohibition of investments in new government debt and the expansion of sanctions against officials and oligarchs the bill h r 5428 from 5 april required the blocking of assets and the banning of dollar transactions for seven russian government banks sberbank vtb bank gazprombank bank of moscow rosselkhozbank promsvyazbank and veb and the imposition of restrictions on derivatives bill s 2780 h r 6475 h r 6573 was put forward on 26 april and demanded that russia be recognized as state that sponsors terrorism the next document h r 5910 appeared on 29 may and required cyber sanctions in response to russia s misinformation campaign on 18 july a bill was put forward in the senate s 3229 to outright ban the financing of russian energy projects at same time a bill was put forward in the house of representatives with a milder set of sanctions against government banks h r 6423 with restrictions being imposed on only three of them on 1 august all of these initiatives were summarized in a final bill s 3336 which received support from both parties in addition to new sanctions against officials and oligarchs it requires that at least one russian government bank must be cut off from dollar transactions and that foreign investors must be banned from buying new bonds issued by the russian government sanctions against government banks would be the most dangerous scenario for russia essentially this would mean that the system for handling dollars in the country would breakdown observes rosbank analyst yevgeny koshelev all transactions in us dollars take place through correspondent accounts with american banks if these banks are banned from operating with russian banks russia s central bank and finance ministry will be forced to use their own reserves to rescue the situation and the conversion of dollar deposits into rubles will become a reality you can expect waves of capital outflow from the russian market which will lead to increased pressure on the ruble commented vladimir tikhomirov chief economist at bcs in august the exchange rate will jump to 76 rubles per dollar and the economy will decline yet again russia s central bank will have to raise the key interest rate to 8 75 and possibly even implement moderate control over capital movement tikhomirov wrote there is more at stake than just congress s initiatives a second round of sanctions from the donald trump administration for the skripals poisoning is still pending new sanctions are also being prepared for the kerch strait incident and the kremlin s refusal to return the detained sailors to kyiv us special representative for ukraine kurt volker warned on 31 january the tightening of sanctions will take place in the next few months and the measures that have been announced may still be expanded upon moody s international rating agency predicts the ban on purchasing new russian government debt may be expanded to an outright ban on even holding russian government bonds sanctions against the secondary market the same ban may also be imposed on bonds issued by banks if the sanctions are stricter than expected it could lead to a new lowering of russia

investing in emerging economies is rarely for the faint hearted while gains tend to be amplified relative to developed world equities losses are too and a long term horizon is very much recommended and 2018 was a tough one for emerging market investors with the msci em index declining 14 52 just shy of 2015 s 14 92 and its third year of double digit losses since 2009 by comparison msci world lost less than 9 emerging market debt suffered too there were myriad factors that conspired to dent emerging markets including a strengthening dollar continued interest rate rises from the us federal reserve and trade tensions between the us and china despite these being clear headwinds chetan sehgal manager of templeton emerging markets investment trust tem thinks the scale of the sell off in emerging market assets was an absolute crisis of confidence towards the end of october we were starting to think the market was becoming far too pessimistic because although fundamentals did get impacted during the year valuations started reflecting a far worse outcome he says as a result a rebound was expected that s maybe happened quicker than might have been hoped the msci em index is already up 8 98 through the first 36 days of 2019 so a lot of that negativity has been discounted already so where does that leave valuations clearly they had become attractive towards the tail end of last year and while some of the value may have disappeared sharpish msci world has actually outperformed the em index on a relative basis then there s a case for more gains emerging market headwinds recede add to that the trio of headwinds from 2018 beginning to abate and we could see emerging assets rally through the course of the next 11 months indeed the us dollar has begun to soften already the fed is becoming increasingly dovish and markets are pricing in zero rate hikes this year and potential cuts in 2020 and china and the us are locked in talks to end the trade war with a resolution expected before february is out so things are looking up and that s reflected in recent changes to growth forecasts from the international monetary fund imf developed market growth is now expected to slow from 2 3 in 2018 to 2 and 1 7 in 2019 and 2020 respectively for emerging markets while growth in 2019 is set to slow from 4 6 in 2018 to 4 5 next year it should then accelerate to 4 9 in 2020 this is important to highlight says kevin daly investment director for global emerging market debt at aberdeen standard investments that s because the em dm growth premium the difference in growth between emerging and developed economies closely correlates with the performance of emerging market currencies when the differential fell from 6 in 2009 to 2 in 2015 due to emerging market growth slowing the emerging market fx spot price fell by around a third should that reverse therefore emerging market currencies which daly says are undervalued in historic terms should bounce back improving corporate governance templeton s sehgal is still positive that emerging market equities have further to rally another reason for his confidence is improvements in corporate governance in some of the largest companies in the universe i think people are missing this point a lot he says a lot of the largest companies which never used to return money to shareholders have now started looking at active share buybacks this point is reflected by ben peters and chris elliott managers of the evenlode global income fund while their fund has no direct exposure to emerging market stocks currently they say they are looking for opportunities we do have a number of emerging market listed businesses in our sight and we certainly wouldn t preclude that through time providing we can get comfortable with the governance arrangements says peters trevor greetham head of multi asset at royal london asset management says his funds upped their exposure and went overweight emerging markets at the end of 2018 for reasons outlined previously if you believe china is easing policy and the fed is pausing that s a period you might expect emerging markets to outperform explains hiroki hashimoto senior quantitative analyst at rlam that s part of the reason we were very short emerging markets last year went to neutral and now we re overweight morningstar investment management see value in some areas too unloved areas such as emerging europe offer decent reward for risk on the equity side while both hard and local currency emerging market debt is also attractive due to high relative yields on the debt side daly thinks local currency bonds look attractive relative to 10 year treasuries with real yields on the former around 300 basis points higher than real rates on the latter what could spoil the party there are risks of course should a trade deal not materialise china will continue to be in the spotlight that said investors are likely to move on to worrying over slowing growth in china even if we get a positive outcome on trade says daly but officials in china continue to have plenty of levers left to pull to support steady levels of growth moving forward moreover even if the trade argument will be easily put to bed sehgal notes the longer term issue that underlies america s hostility towards china namely the fact china is challenging the us s place as the world s great financial superpower will remain finally a fly in the ointment would be the possibility of the us dollar defying predictions of its imminent demise and continuing to strengthen it s not the consensus view but it s one that research provider capital economics puts forward we expect the greenback to be a major beneficiary together with the yen of a move away from risky assets as growth in the world s largest economies slows says analysts at the firm downturns in the us stock market which have regularly coincided with those in the us economy have been accompanied by a stronger dollar during the last two recessions we are not forecasting a recession this time around but we still expect growth in the us economy to slow sharply

once again the federal reserve has upended markets investors had been bracing for the fed to keep raising interest rates and shrinking its vast portfolio of assets the equivalent of tapping on the brakes of the united states economy but this year the central bank has signaled that it was backing off much has been written about the stock market s joyful reaction to the fed s altered approach but the impact was much broader than that the central bank s shift cascaded through markets around the world in ways large and small here s a look at the consequences of the fed s new tone stocks the fed s change of heart helped halt and partly reverse december s brutal stock sell off on dec 24 the s p 500 was down nearly 20 percent from its recent high

after the synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 came the asynchronous growth of 2018 when most countries other than the united states started to experience slowdowns worries about u s inflation the federal reserve s policy trajectory ongoing trade wars italian budget and debt woes china s slowdown and emerging market fragilities led to a sharp fall in global equity markets toward the end of the year the good news at the start of 2019 is that the risk of an outright global recession is low the bad news is that we are heading into a year of synchronized global deceleration growth will fall toward and in some cases below potential in most regions to be sure the year started with a rally in risky assets u s and global equities after the bloodbath of the last quarter of 2018 when worries about fed interest rate hikes and about chinese and u s growth tanked many markets since then the fed has pivoted toward renewed dovishness the u s has maintained solid growth and china s macroeconomic easing has shown some promise of containing the slowdown there eight big risks whether these relatively positive conditions last will depend on many factors the first thing to consider is the fed markets are now pricing in the fed s monetary policy pause for the entire year but the labor market remains robust were wages to accelerate and produce even moderate inflation above 2 fears of at least two more rate hikes this year would return possibly shocking markets spx 0 47 and leading to a tightening of financial conditions that in turn would revive concerns about u s growth second as the slowdown in china continues the government s current mix of modest monetary credit and fiscal stimulus could prove inadequate given the lack of private sector confidence and high levels of overcapacity and leverage if worries about a chinese slowdown resurface markets could be severely affected on the other hand a stabilization of growth would duly renew market confidence a related factor is trade while an escalation of the sino american conflict would hamper global growth a continuation of the current truce via a deal on trade would reassure markets even as the two countries geopolitical and technology rivalry continues to build over time fourth the eurozone is slowing down and it remains to be seen whether it is heading toward lower potential growth or something worse the outcome will be determined both by national level variables such as political developments in france italy and germany and broader regional and global factors obviously a hard brexit would negatively affect business and investor confidence in the united kingdom and the european union alike president donald trump extending his trade war to the european automotive sector would severely undercut growth across the eu not just in germany finally much will depend on how euroskeptic parties fare in the european parliament elections this may and that in turn will add to the uncertainties surrounding european central bank president mario draghi s successor and the future of eurozone monetary policy american dysfunctional politics fifth america s dysfunctional domestic politics could add to uncertainties globally the recent government shutdown suggests that every upcoming negotiation over the budget and the debt ceiling will turn into a partisan war of attrition an expected report from the special counsel robert mueller may or may not lead to impeachment proceedings against trump and by the end of the year the fiscal stimulus from the republican tax cuts will become a fiscal drag possibly weakening growth sixth equity markets in the u s and elsewhere are still overvalued even after the recent correction as wage costs rise weaker u s earnings and profit margins in the coming months could be an unwelcome surprise with highly indebted firms facing the possibility of rising short and long term borrowing costs and with many tech stocks in need of further corrections the danger of another risk off episode and market correction can t be ruled out seventh oil prices may be driven down by a coming supply glut owing to shale production in the u s a potential regime change in venezuela leading to expectations of greater production over time and failures by opec countries to cooperate with one another to constrain output while low oil prices are good for consumers they tend to weaken u s stocks and markets in oil exporting economies raising concerns about corporate defaults in the energy and related sectors as happened in early 2016 finally the outlook for many emerging market economies will depend on the aforementioned global uncertainties the chief risks include slowdowns in the u s or china higher u s inflation and a subsequent tightening by the fed trade wars a stronger dollar and falling oil and commodity prices silver linings though there is a cloud over the global economy the silver lining is that it has made the major central banks more dovish starting with the fed and the people s bank of china and quickly followed by the european central bank the bank of england the bank of japan and others still the fact that most central banks are in a highly accommodative position means that there is little room for additional monetary easing and even if fiscal policy weren t constrained in most regions of the world stimulus tends to come only after a growth stall is already underway and usually with a significant lag there may be enough positive factors to make this a relatively decent if mediocre year for the global economy but if some of the negative scenarios outlined above materialize the synchronized slowdown of 2019 could lead to a global growth stall and sharp market downturn in 2020 source project

after making substantial progress early on overseas adoption of the offshore yuan cnh has plateaued since 2016 news analysis since the mid 2000s beijing has sought to internationalize its currency the renminbi yuan china established the first overseas dim sum bonds in 2009 and has since done significant marketing on its currency abroad beijing has railed against the global business community s adoption of the u s dollar as the de facto global currency and established multiple cross border exchange linkages but after making substantial progress early on overseas adoption of the offshore yuan cnh has plateaued since 2016 cnh is the symbol for offshore yuan available to trade by foreign investors this is in contrast to cny which is the onshore yuan the value of which is fixed by the people s bank of china standard chartered bank s renminbi globalization index which has tracked the internationalization of the yuan currency since 2011 recorded a value of 1 920 as of november 2018 a 45 point decline from october and a whopping 556 point or 22 percent decline from its peak in september 2015 standard chartered a dominant bank in asia and across emerging markets is thought to have the most comprehensive data on the cnh currency the yuan s lackluster foreign adoption in recent years despite efforts by beijing is thought to be a product of lower cross border payment volumes lackluster primary cnh dim sum bond issuances and declining trade volumes dim sum issuances have waned in recent years beginning in 2015 when beijing began devaluing its currency aggressively an action that spooked both foreign issuers and investors other data confirms this trend swift the international messaging platform used by banks and other financial institutions in cross border money transfers also shows global cnh adoption stagnating cnh is ranked eighth globally for international payments with a market share of 1 14 percent as of december 2018 that trails major currencies such as the australian dollar the swiss franc and the canadian dollar to be eighth globally is not bad on its own but the results are disappointing when compared to the same swift survey from december 2016 two years ago cnh also ranked eighth globally with a 1 13 percent market share that s an increase of 0 01 percent in two years for the world s no 2 economy london as global center for cnh trading the trends are more interesting at a micro level as the bulk of overseas cnh trading has been coalescing around one financial hub london has quietly taken the lead as the biggest yuan trading center outside of china more than 36 1 percent of all cnh transactions outside of mainland china took place there in december 2018 according to the most recent swift data that figure eclipses the 29 6 percent market share by hong kong and it s far from a fluke in fact the offshore usd cnh trading pair was the seventh most liquid averaging daily transaction volumes of 73 billion as of october 2018 according to the most recent data from the bank of england which reports information twice annually in april and october surprisingly the usd cnh cny trading pair was more active than eur gbp euro to british pound and eur jpy euro to japanese yen pairs so what to make of this apparently even before the uk voted to remove itself from the european union it had been courting china to establish london as the main international cnh transaction hub former conservative prime minister david cameron first saw establishing relations with china as a top priority for years the uk s enthusiasm for china was often in conflict with washington s and even its own interests despite well documented struggles of britain s steel industry due to china s steel dumping downing street blocked numerous proposals by the european commission to increase tariffs on cheap chinese steel imports in terms of tax revenues for the royal family it has paid off until now the eu is china s top single trade partner and much of that trade including currency exchange goes through the uk but as the uk crashes towards a no deal brexit in march its days as the main global cnh trading hub could be numbered chinese companies and financial institutions may need to pivot to a new european hub a number of large banks have set up infrastructure and moved staff to paris and frankfurt ahead of brexit and if they can lure investors and companies trading with china away from london the uk may have little left to show for its wooing of chinese interests

after jerome powell became fed chairman in 2017 this publication made the not so bold prediction that he would bail out financial markets when necessary although he doesn t have a doctoral degree and was talking and walking tough for most of his tenure but when markets crashed 20 percent in the last quarter of 2018 due to powell s incessant raising of rates tough talk and reduction of the fed balance sheet he got cold feet as expected and flip flopped with some very accommodative language this talking up the market culminated in a very meek federal open markets committee fomc statement at the end of january containing this line the committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy but that s all it is at the moment just pleasant talk no action although the fed is clearly positioning itself to act in the near future the markets did expect more rate increases in 2019 but a january boost wasn t a foregone conclusion even before powell s sweet talking started in early january the same with the reduction of the balance sheet or quantitative tightening qt the only thing that has changed is the language the fed will continue to reduce its balance sheet by a maximum of 50 billion per month which in reality is closer to 30 billion to 40 billion because only a limited amount of assets mature or run off every month so despite the sweet talk nothing has changed from late december when markets were staring into the abyss discounting the future however financial markets are often removed from reality and try to discount the future so the optimism is partly justified since the fed has now clearly communicated it won t step further on the brakes of increasing rates and may remove its foot from the brake of qt anytime it pleases before the verbal course correction markets had to expect more rate increases and a continuation of qt not a pretty picture now the picture looks better because markets know that if economic or financial conditions worsen the fed will be there to have their back as always this time is different this is nothing new it happens all the time from big crises such as those of long term capital management in 1998 and the 2008 crisis to smaller incidents like the u s debt downgrade of 2011 and the china jitters of 2016 however the smaller cases are more instructive to understand the context we are operating in and in those cases it s not all about the fed in 2011 for example when europe and the euro came within an inch of collapsing the european central bank ecb saved the day by expanding its balance sheet i e printing money by a trillion dollars with its clunky long term refinancing operations ltro of course those loans should have been repaid and the balance sheet reduced but they got replaced by the ecb s quantitative easing qe program a couple of years later which has now also come to an end in 2011 action was desperately needed as the fed had just stopped its second round of qe worth 600 billion by june of 2011 and the united states sovereign debt was downgraded a notch in an unprecedented move by standard poor s over the summer markets were very jittery at that time although they never declined the 20 percent that would classify the period as a bear market it was pretty close though so for most of 2011 central banks were still in expansion mode and had to save the markets by expanding even more it worked including the fed s strategy to take risk out of the market by buying longer term bonds and selling shorter maturities the so called operation twist which began in late 2011 in 2012 markets were down double digits in the summer in the wake of the greece bailout and still lingering concerns about the eurozone at that time the ecb was in expansion mode with ltro and the fed was leveling off its second round of qe when then chairman ben bernanke stepped on the gas again by announcing another round of qe in september printing 40 billion per month of course mario draghi did his bit of verbal acrobatics by promising the ecb would do whatever it takes to save the euro aside from draghi whose ecb was still expanding its balance sheet with various ltros the fed took tangible action by boosting its balance sheet with qe3 it s important to note that during those years the global central bank and credit cycle had never even turned negative it was just stocks that were scared of a eurozone crisis china scare the latest mini crisis came when china had some significant problems with its economy and currency in late 2015 and early 2016 during that time the fed had already stopped qe and was slowly raising rates and the ecb and the bank of japan boj were still in expansion mode to arrest this double digit market drop it never made it to 20 percent bear market territory like right now the fed had to delay its tightening schedule the chinese had to order the state banking system to expand money like there was no tomorrow and the ecb and the boj kept printing this set up is different now not only haven t central banks increased their liquidity injections all except for the boj have completely stopped their expansionary policies and the fed has even tightened for almost two years globally we aren t even close to 2016 2012 or 2011 when some central banks were still in expansion mode and ready to put the foot on the gas again at a moment s notice the fed and the ecb are talking about moving in that direction but the chinese have become desperate again and have boosted their aggregate financing by the highest amount on record 685 billion in january but they are on their own this time and the question is whether they can arrest a global credit down cycle on their own so far the fed is only promising to brake less not to inject another round of liquidity into the system although that step may come in the future but only after economic and financial conditions worsen again credit cycle in the meantime this is bad news because although central banks can act swiftly and print new money at a whim they are akin to the captains of oil tankers they can issue the order to change course and turn the wheel but the credit system the tanker will take a while to adjust its direction and the global credit tanker is turning into full blown deflation mode thanks to two years of actual and relative central bank tightening we are starting to see the beginning of u s dollar credit stress in emerging markets such as turkey and argentina and also in domestic financial markets such as leveraged loans the biggest indicator of a complete deflation cycle is the inversion of the yield curve or when short term debt yields more than long term debt because investors pile into long term government debt as the safest investment in an economic downturn the most common measure of this inversion is the difference between 10 year and 2 year treasury bonds which are only 0 2 percent apart other maturity mixes like the 1 year to 7 year are at parity and the 2 year to 5 year is negative the action in government debt markets is just a symptom of what is happening in the real economy we are at a point when the yield curve shift begins to impact future growth by slowing credit extensions or even throwing them into reverse credit standards for commercial and industrial loans tightened in the fourth quarter tighter standards and weaker demand were also in evidence in real estate and consumer loans wrote research firm ts lombard to see how long it takes for the tanker to turn around after credit deflation has set in we merely have to go back to some of the larger crises and stock market corrections like 2008 and 2001 which took years to reverse even after the fed cut rates and rapidly boosted its balance sheet mostly before the economy entered a recession and the credit system started to deflate in earnest and this is exactly what s different this time while the global financial credit tanker was merely stalling in 2011 2012 and 2016 and the central bank captains just had to put their foot on the gas and increase speed right now they have to turn the tanker around from deflation to inflation again but the question is how far it will go ts lombard thinks there is still a chance before the 1 year to 10 year yield curve inverts which has historically preceded recessions with the exception of 1965 the fed acted early in that case to prevent a recession which is why ts lombard thinks the fed will completely ease off the brakes during its march meeting and taper the balance sheet reduction whether that will be enough to turn the tanker and avoid a recession remains to be seen if not global central banks will be forced to step on the gas hard again and add a few serial numbers to their qe programs views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect

published monday 11 february 2019 print disqus by keith weiner monetary metals last week in part i of this essay we discussed why a central planner cannot know the right interest rate central planner s macroeconomic aggregate measures like gdp are blind to the problem of capital consumption including especially capital consumption caused by the central plan itself gdp has an intrinsic bias towards consumption and makes no distinction between consumption of the yield on capital and consumption of the capital per se between selling the golden egg and cooking the goose that lays golden eggs one could quibble with this and say that well really the central planners should use a different metric this is not satisfying it demands the retort if there is a better metric than gdp then why aren t they using it now gdp is itself supposed to be that better metric nominal gdp targeting is the darling central plan proposal of the right supposedly better than consumer price index and unemployment as modern monetary theory is the darling of the left there is no way a central planner could set the rate anyways last week we said we would look at the other premise from the surest way to overthrow capitalism there is no way a central planner could set the right rate even if he knew it s one thing to argue that the central planners haven t got a metric to help them know the right rate it s another to argue that no such metric exists but let s go beyond that and concede for a moment that the central planner somehow does know the right rate how is he supposed to set it one problem in setting the right rate is that the very question presumes that the right rate is static or at least that it does not move in realtime but of course in a real market prices are moving constantly here is a graph of the federal funds rate which is dictated directly by our central planners there is one glitch because this graph shows the effective rate which may sometimes deviate from the number dictated by the fed but this square stair step pattern looks nothing like any real market price another flaw in the very idea of centrally planning interest is to think of the economy in low resolution terms for example many might say that inflation is moderate unemployment is low and gdp is growing at best this is like looking at a duck gliding in the water above the surface the duck appears calm below the waterline the bird is paddling like mad let s put this view into explicit words we realize that few would do this clear and explicit statements are practically taboo in certain topics but here goes there are only a few variables and each variable can be described in the language you see on paintbrushes at the home improvement store good better best this view oversimplifies the economy the way a low resolution fax remember fax machines of a picture of the grand canyon oversimplifies the experience of hiking down to the bottom camping there and then rafting down the river this view may be sufficient for the evening news but you will never get anywhere in understanding economics by looking at gdp cpi and unemployment in paintbrush terms suppose someone proposes raising the tax on the rich and not just taxing their income but also taxing their wealth and you say it won t be good that person retorts that we had higher taxes in the 1950 s and gdp was growing faster how would you answer that not with the paintbrush model of macroeconomic metrics change occurs at the margin if carl menger taught us anything it s that change occurs at the margin if you hike the minimum wage by one penny someone is laid off the marginal worker the very definition of marginal worker is the one who will lose his job if the profit earned by his employer declines it is not only oversimplifying but it misses the point entirely if you say that the economy is fine after raising the minimum wage the resolution of gdp may be too low to see it like the fax of the grand canyon picture but someone lost his job when the new law took effect a business somewhere was put under every change in the economy ripples through countless variables the central planner does not even know what those variables are as the person looking at the fax can t tell the color of your raft and the planner wouldn t know what to do with all those changes to all those margins even if the data was pouring into his computer system the price of latte rose 10 cents in portland the price of espresso dropped a penny in portland the price of cement went up 5 in phoenix the wage in boston median or mean fell 25 cents the price of roofing shingles went down 10 in phoenix the price of sand fell 13 cents in new orleans the price of 2x4 lumber went up 1 in baton rouge the price of you get the idea each of the sellers and buyers involved in all of those markets cares a great deal about those price changes and each has some power to alter the price for example the marginal coffee consumer in portland can switch from latte to espresso the marginal driveway paver in phoenix can switch from concrete to asphalt and the marginal sawmill can send more lumber to louisiana this brings us to a theory of prices based on the individual economic actor there is not one right price of cement not even one right price of cement in phoenix each producer has a price below which he will not produce this is based partly on cost of course including cost of capital and also his minimum acceptable profit which may in turn depend on what other things he could produce and sell and what profits he could make doing those things at the same time each buyer of concrete also has a price above which he finds a substitute or walks away he may substitute asphalt for concrete or he may walk away because he can make more money doing something else altogether a simple market you can think of three concrete producers one with a walkaway point of 80 one at 75 and one at 70 and four concrete consumers whose walkaway points are 65 64 62 50 and 61 mr 65 could sell it in tucson for 70 but it will cost him 2 to truck it down and he s not willing to work for less than 3 the 64 guy can sell concrete pavers but it s not worth the effort at any price above 64 the 62 5 bid comes from a maker of concrete curbing and so on 70 is the marginal offer price or just simply the offer 65 is the marginal bid price or simply the bid if this is a snapshot of our market at 9 01am monday morning then there is no purchase or sale of concrete then at 10 04am a building contractor comes to the market he has a contract to build a million dollar home he is not so sensitive to the price of concrete he needs concrete to deliver the house he is obligated to deliver so he goes to the 70 producer and orders 50 cubic yards this contractor takes the offer price it s a busy day as another contractor orders some concrete and another now the 70 producer has sold his full production capacity for the week so he withdraws his offer to sell we say that the marginal offer has been lifted or simply the offer has been pushed up the last concrete order for the day is at 75 5 higher than the day before in our example we have three potential producers who ask 80 75 and 70 we have four potential consumers who bid 65 64 62 50 and 61 and we have three building contractors who take the best offer of 70 which of these is the right price now the problem is not merely that macro statistics are low resolution like that fax of the picture of the grand canyon tour it is that we cannot even agree whether we mean 1000 feet into the bright angel trail looking down or whether we mean base camp looking up or whether we re rafting on the colorado river looking at the rapids ahead in high resolution we can see that each participant has his own right price and is not willing to move above or below it respectively and each participant who takes the offer or bid does so because it s right for him at that time the low res monochrome fax simply indicates that the price of concrete went up 5 as we started our discussion above concrete is simple whereas interest is the most complex phenomenon of all the phenomena in the markets there are many more participants in the market as every wage earner is a saver or would be if we didn t have central banking and ponzi retirement schemes and every business is a potential borrower the price of every productive capital asset including stocks and real estate depends on the interest rate even the simple concrete market scenario of 9 participants one morning in phoenix shows that there is not one right price and the closing price tells us nothing about them or their needs or the drivers of those needs it should be clear that the right price of concrete cannot be described and if that s so then the same applies a thousandfold to the right price of interest as we are demonstrating for investors interest is not a simple market only a free market can know the right interest rate and there is there is no way a central planner could set the right rate even if he knew in the end these statements are saying the same thing that s because the mechanism for setting the right price is the same mechanism as for knowing the right price in the first place even to arrive at the low resolution answer that concrete goes from 70 yesterday to 75 today those 9 market participants have to do business or refrain from doing business respectively so price incentivizes some of them to act and some of them not to act and their action or inaction in turn affects prices how could you separate these two phenomena how could you dictate the price of 75 to whom would you dictate it the makers of pavers and curbing won t accept even 70 much less 75 will you also dictate what their customers are willing to pay for pavers and curbs will you dictate to their customer s customers in turn landscapers and commercial property owners what pavers and curbing ought to be worth to them this would never work you either have to dictate to everyone what they will get and in what quantities or else you let them pursue their interests the middle of the road the idea that the central planner can dictate one price leaving the rest to the free market is unstable and unsustainable it offers some participants a too low price so they demand more and more of the good and others a too high price so they go under if the price they re fixing is interest then you get wholesale capital destruction which we write a lot about supply and demand fundamentals the prices of the metals fell slightly we are continually amazed at how many commentators both mainstream and alternative are invested literally and figuratively in the everything is cured story mainstreamers are comfortable that the fed is listening the fed is responsive etc and of course the spread between junk and treasury bonds has been narrowing a bit since the start of the year well at least the first half of january and oil has been rallying as one would expect in a case of robust demand well it looks to be rolling over in february and the alternative finance people point to the technicals of copper which has been rallying since january though not last week though this is not a sign of everything being fixed but of the inflation is coming story both mistake the temporary rise of other currencies as a drop in the dollar but think about it this is what is supposed to happen if the economy is good everyone worldwide borrows more dollars it s the reserve currency which they use to finance everything from commodities to bonds in other currencies this is not dollar repudiation but when the system is working as intended as we write this sunday evening we see red in most currencies including the yuan watch this carefully as keith discussed with brent johnson and zach abraham on know your risk radio we likely have a period of strong dollar and strong gold ahead of us it remains to be seen if silver will be included with gold if currencies are to begin falling again and if the junk bond spread keeps widening watch out let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was flat this week here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price gold appears slightly scarcer at least in the near contract not really in the gold continuous basis the monetary metals gold fundamental price was unchanged this week still 1 391 now let s look at silver the scarcity of silver i e cobasis the red line rose but keep in mind this is the march contract which is rapidly moving towards first notice day and hence under selling pressure which pushes down the basis and pushes up the cobasis key to our response to ted butler the silver continuous basis fell a bit the monetary metals silver fundamental price fell over half a buck to 16 09 digg this article

security is still aiming to reach a deal on monday the government just had a historic partial shutdown earlier this year after trump failed to get support from the democrats on funding for the border

would force ice agents to focus on arresting and deporting serious criminals white house acting chief of staff mick mulvaney warned that he absolutely cannot rule out another shutdown and he added trump cannot sign everything they put in front of him there ll be some things that simply we couldn t agree to uk and swiss signed agreement to protect gbp 32b trade relationship after brexit uk and switzerland signed an agreement on sunday that will protect gbp 32b trade relationship between the two countries with the agreement both countries will continue to trade on preferential terms after brexit that is the two countries could continue to trade freely without new tariffs but financial services are not included in the deal uk trade minister liam fox hailed that switzerland is one of the most valuable trading partners that we are seeking continuity for and this is of huge economic importance to uk businesses so i m delighted to be here in bern ensuring continuity for 15 000 british exporters fox added that not only will this help to support jobs throughout the uk but it will also be a solid foundation for us to build an even stronger trading relationship with switzerland as we leave the eu rbnz to stand pat this week might deliver more dovish tone rbnz is widely expected to keep ocr unchanged at 1 75 this week the central bank would likely reiterate the stance that the next move in the ocr could be up or down and the tone of the overall announcement could be tiled to the dovish side as both global and domestic environment deteriorated since november meeting rbnz might also downgrade growth forecasts while the majority of market participants judge that the policy rate has bottomed at the current 1 75 some believe that further rate cut is possible we expect there would be no rate change at least until second half of 2020 more in rbnz preview turning more dovish while affirming next move can be up or down global slowdown brexit and trade war the three main themes global slowdown brexit and us china trade talks will be the three main themes this week gdp data from uk japan germany and eurozone reveal how poorly respective economy performed in at the end

of iom on jan 12 a fishing boat carrying more than 100 indian migrants the precise number is not known left the munambam harbour in kerala its destination was new zealand more than 11 000 kilometres away it was the first known attempt by migrants to reach new zealand by boat from india if they took the shortest route via the straits between indonesia and australia they would face rough seas beset by frequent storms and typhoons the fate of the passengers around 50 residents from a refugee community in new delhi and the rest from the southern state of tamil nadu is a mystery and the people who organised the journey remain unidentified missing somewhere at sea is all mj sojan the lead investigator in the case can say referring to the lost souls who left behind 70 bags that were recovered by the police at the busy indian port they had to leave to find jobs to eat said sugana dhandapani the mother of one intended migrant who ultimately decided not to board the boat with his wife and daughter they have been promised work in new zealand she told reuters people have been setting off in boats from south and southeast asia to australia and other destinations for decades most are fleeing conflicts in the likes of iran and afghanistan but a boatload of indians is a disturbing new development say migration experts it also underlines the growing problem of unemployment in india which rose to a 45 year high of 6 1 in the 2017 18 fiscal year the government of prime minister narendra modi which prides itself on job creation was accused of suppressing the official figure fearing backlash in an election year india s economy has been growing by about 7 annually but growth has been uneven which means there are not enough new jobs young people make up a significant share of the unemployed with 18 7 of urban males aged between 15 and 29 without work for their female counterparts the figure is 27 2 as india struggles to create jobs for the one million young people who enter its workforce each month there are fears that the country could one day become a producer of economic migrants on a scale matching that of the philippines runkun lives in a makeshift shelter built by her son in 2005 along an uncompleted railway in poipet cambodia with her daughter and grandchildren they rely on remittances from her children working in thailand photos courtesy of iom benjamin suomela the southeast asian country has been among asia s 10 fastest growing economies in recent years but its unemployment rate is still the highest among developing countries in the region at 5 1 the asian development bank adb estimated in 2013 that as many as 7 million filipinos about 17 of the workforce had gone overseas in search of jobs at some point the philippine statistics authority psa says the unemployment rate is the lowest since 2013 but it still translates into 2 2 million people without work compared with 41 3 million who are employed the rates among younger people are staggering 44 6 in the 15 24 age group and 30 3 among those aged 25 to 34 although the unemployment rate in the philippines is at a record low the world bank points out that underemployment remains near its decade long average of 18 20 moreover many workers who have made the shift out of agriculture are now in low end service jobs so while employment has increased between 2006 and 2015 average wages have remained stagnant that helps explain why so many filipinos 2 3 million from april to september 2017 according to pas continue to seek better opportunities abroad workers aged 30 to 34 comprised 21 7 of the total followed by those aged 25 to 29 years at 20 4 more than one third of all overseas filipino workers are employed in menial jobs by destination saudi arabia topped the table at 25 4 followed by the united arab emirates 15 3 kuwait 6 7 and hong kong 6 5 challenges in thailand the number of workers from thailand who travel abroad is low relative to some regional peers but eyebrows were raised recently when it was reported that as many as 120 000 thais were working illegally in south korea taiwan is another popular destination embarrassing wrote one thai facebook user commenting on a bangkok post report about the increase in thais travelling to south korea as tourists who ended up overstaying as illegal labourers at the same time thailand in recent years has been the centre of unwanted international attention for mistreatment of migrant workers numbering in the millions that helped explain the great sigh of relief heard in official circles when the european union recently lifted its yellow card against the thai fishing industry which had been the source of some of the most egregious abuses making headlines around the world but advocates for migrant workers say that the fight against illegal unreported and unregulated fishing iuu still has a long way to go as well they say abuses in sectors such as construction and agriculture merit closer investigation the international organization for migration iom in its thailand migration report 2019 released last month acknowledged that the government had taken important steps to combat human trafficking and exploitative working conditions for migrants this included reforms to laws and regulatory bodies to manage the fishery sector but many migrants continue to face hardship and remain vulnerable to abuse the report said policy responses risk leaving migrants vulnerable and unsure of their legal status in thailand said benjamin harkins the report s editor and while progressive policies guarantee migrants access to many essential services regardless of legal status including education and healthcare barriers still limit their use in practice he said only 51 of all eligible migrants are currently enrolled in the public health insurance system while up to 200 000 migrant children remain out of school the report notes according to the iom thailand now hosts approximately 4 9 million non thai residents a substantial increased from 3 7 million in 2014 the majority are from cambodia laos myanmar and vietnam clmv with an estimated 3 9 million documented and undocumented workers other major groups include an estimated 480 000 stateless people 110 000 skilled professionals and 100 000 refugees and asylum seekers constituting over 10 of the total labour force migrant workers in thailand are thought to contribute between 4 3 and 6 6 of the country s us 455 billion gdp for migrants and their family members employment in thailand supports a better living standards and poverty reduction in their home countries where up to 2 8 billion in remittances are sent annually to the clmv countries alone the figure could be as much as 10 billion if informal remittances are taken into consideration but despite gaining financial benefits many migrant workers in thailand are still being abused by their employers debt and migration the world has experienced a dramatic rise in migration in the past few decades with some 247 million people estimated to be working outside their home countries in 2013 according a report by the asian development bank about 80 million or 30 of all migrants were from asia pacific led by china 13 8 million india 9 6 million and bangladesh 7 5 million their main destinations include the united states and other high income organisation for economic co operation and development countries as well as middle eastern countries such the united arab emirates saudi arabia kuwait and qatar the region also has significant intraregional migration such as from bangladesh to india myanmar to thailand and indonesia to malaysia the adb said greater migration has dramatically increased remittances to asia pacific countries from 104 billion in 2006 to 252 billion in 2017 the top three recipients were india 72 2 billion china 63 9 billion and the philippines 29 7 billion former victims of human trafficking in cambodia photo courtesy of iom while migration can provide a better living standard for some debt can prevent migrant workers in the region from realising the benefits of their mobility and cause them to return home worse off than they were before a study by the iom has found it said that one in six returned migrants in the greater mekong subregion was struggling with debt upon return to their country of origin yet indebtedness is an important factor in the decision making process of migrants so there is a risk that some will go abroad again maryann bylander assistant professor of sociology at lewis clark college took a closer look at how debt compels and influences migration in a report titled debt and the migration experience insights from southeast asia the link is most pronounced in cambodia where more than 40 of rural remittance receiving households report repayment of debt as the main use of the money they receive debt can also facilitate migration through wage reductions or loans taken out by migrants for their families as well debt has a way of shaping the overall migration experience when migrants are in debt they can experience migration very differently particularly when they owe money to their employers which can deepen the hierarchy and asymmetry between employers and employees she told asia focus in this situation migrants are more likely to find themselves in a situation of exploitative work or immobility as a result of debt while debt can also create tremendous pressure to send remittances and it might encourage risky choices such risky choices often include choosing to remain in jobs with poor working conditions the increasing cost of migration and recruitment in the region often borne by employees causes prospective migrants to borrow heavily in order to cover the cost of labour recruitment full repayment of these loans can take years wage deductions used by employers to cover recruitment costs can also inhibit workers from changing jobs or leaving the report added in its most severe form debt can create the risk of forced labour or human trafficking it can also complicate the potential of migrants to return if they still owe money which makes it harder for them to find their feet according to survey data collected by the iom and the international labour organization in 2016 from 1 808 returned migrant workers in clmv who took jobs in thailand and malaysia around 9 came home still in debt but the figure for cambodia was 24 we want to see the migration story end in something positive for those who go abroad and for their families but there is actually a mixed set of results here where some people are coming back even more indebted from the cost of their migration or other kinds of costs ms bylander added in addition to reduced financial status indebted returnees also reported social and psychological struggles in the form of shame embarrassment and discrimination in their communities as well as harassment and violence from lenders such pressures subsequently provide strong incentives for them and their families to migrate again the study recommends the need to lower migration costs by ensuring that recruitment costs are borne by employers as well as the need to encourage and simplify access to legal migration pathways that eliminate the need for brokers and middlemen expanded monitoring of labour rights violations in countries of destination is also recommended recommendations for countries of origin include strengthening social protection programmes to eliminate the use of loans for basic needs improving oversight and regulation around credit provision and ensuring grievance outlets and hotlines for aspiring current and returned migrants
demands for a green new deal gnd are a beacon of hope in an otherwise dystopian contemporary landscape in her platform document for example newly elected representative and democratic socialist alexandria ocasio cortez states that it s time to shift course and implement a gnd a transformation that implements structural changes to our political and financial systems in order to alter the trajectory of our environment ocasio cortez is not alone other members of the insurgent left who have embraced the idea of a gnd include recently elected michigan democrat rashida tlaib and florida gubernatorial candidate andrew gillum for these candidates a gnd would confront the twin threats of a brewing capitalist crisis based on stagnating wages and a biocrisis that includes not just climate change but also a massive loss of biodiversity often referred to as the sixth extinction increasing scarcity of fresh water desertification and loss of marine fisheries among other crises traditionally these twin threats have seemed insuperable precisely because the solution to one would exacerbate the other creating new jobs in order to address the economic crisis would contribute to economic growth that ravages the environment conversely protecting the environment would mean cutting growth and thereby contributing to a worsening economic picture the idea of a gnd promises an exit from this contradiction through the creation of legions of good green jobs as ocasio cortez puts it in her platform a gnd that is based on radically addressing climate change is a potential path toward a more equitable economy with increased employment and widespread financial security for all it s a win win scenario the notion of a gnd of course harkens back to the policies adopted under the administration of president franklin delano roosevelt to pull the u s out of the great depression but there is also another precedent one that is all too seldom acknowledged in today s references to a gnd debates that circulated after the great recession of 2008 about how to jump start advanced capitalist economies while also dealing with the gathering climate crisis prominent advocates of a gnd after 2008 included the united nations environmental program unep the green european foundation and the center for american progress in response to the proposals put forward by these prominent progressive institutions members of the climate justice movement articulated a number of radical critiques of the growth oriented underpinnings of gnd programs for these critics a gnd must be centered on targeted de growth of industrial production and a rejection of the imperial mode of living that characterizes the energy and resource intensive lifestyles of the wealthy in the global north notions of a gnd that remain tethered to a capitalist economic system predicated on ceaseless compound growth rates climate justice activists argued would simply exacerbate the underlying biocrisis these critiques of proposals for a gnd are freshly salient in the context of efforts by insurgent socialists in the u s today to offer solutions to the twin economic and environmental crises of contemporary capitalism in what follows i sketch a genealogy of the gnd idea beginning with an assessment of the highly flawed nature of the new deal during the 1930s and continuing with a critical account of the major gnd proposals of the period following the great recession of 2008 the essay concludes with some suggestions about what a genuine exit from the present crisis might entail what in other words a wholesale program of ecological and economic reconstruction might require as the green think tank bios recently noted we currently lack viable models of economic governance since the dominant economic theories of today were all developed during an era of energetic and material abundance it is precisely such unexamined and yet ubiquitous assumptions about ceaseless growth that we must overturn and yet doing so raises the very serious specter of mass unemployment and attendant social turmoil we are already faced with a global upsurge of popular authoritarianism and we have only begun to experience the economic and ecological disruptions that the twin crisis holds in store to suggest that there is an easy win win approach within a capitalist economic system that we can have our environmental cake and continue with current levels of frenetic consumption is to cultivate the most rash form of naivet√© about the increasing unsustainability of capitalism in both economic and ecological terms it will not be enough to reframe ideas of de growth away from overwhelmingly negative associations with locally woven organic carrot pants and pathogen encrusted compost toilets to ones of abundant and meaningful time for engagement with other people in projects of collective transformation we need to be clear that such a transformation in values must come within the context of carefully managed policies of ecological reconstruction that move us very quickly to complete energy transition while also building social resilience through the expansion of non consumption based sectors of the economy such an ecological and social reconstruction cannot take place within the framework of a capitalist economy new deal illusions contrary to widely accepted myths concerning the efficacy of programs such as the works progress administration established under fdr during the 1930s the new deal did not solve the contradictions of capitalism unemployment spiked from 4 2 percent of the labor force in 1928 to 23 6 percent in 1932 the worst moment of the great depression then fell back down to 16 percent in 1936 but climbed back up to 19 percent in 1938 1 it was ultimately the u s entry into world war ii and the massive state orchestrated transformation of the economy onto a wartime footing that dramatically brought unemployment down in addition despite nostalgic ideas about the universalistic or nonracial character of the new deal most new deal policies were anything but race neutral or for that matter gender neutral some programs like the initial social security old age pension program were established on a racially invidious albeit officially race neutral basis that excluded agricultural and domestic workers from coverage at a time when those categories included nearly 90 percent of black workers 2 other new deal programs like fdr s housing policy gave federal support to the creation and reproduction of an explicitly racially exclusive residential housing industry this does not mean to say that women and people of color in the united states did not find ways to take advantage of new deal policies but again it is hard to imagine that the benefits of these policies would have become as widely distributed as they did without the impact of wartime mobilization for this reason advocacy of a gnd today often slides quickly into rhetoric of full scale social and economic mobilization along the lines of world war ii so for instance alexandria ocasio cortez s platform document states that we need to avoid a worldwide refugee crisis by waging a war for climate justice through the mobilization of our population and our government environmental activist and writer bill mckibben goes even further by declaring that we re under attack from climate change and our only hope is to mobilize like we did in world war ii 3 while they draw attention to the massive scale of mobilization that is now necessary in order to avoid planetary ecocide there are some problems with such rhetoric for one thing it implicitly equates nature with the behavior of fascist powers like nazi germany but of course climate change is not some authoritarian despot bent on totalitarian rule but rather a result of the escalating carbon emissions generated by a specific economic system fossil fueled capitalism mckibben is not so much concerned with the exactitude of the analogy though what he s really trying to do is to establish the legitimacy of the kind of wholesale industrial retooling that took place in the united states during world war ii a retooling that in this case would involve a massive buildout of the country s capacity for renewable energy generation mckibben cites mark wilson s book destructive creation university of pennsylvania press 2016 to challenge the notion that private industry rolled up its sleeves and went to war instead mckibben argues business had to be dragged into the war effort kicking and screaming and according to wilson it was public capital that built most of the stuff not wall street if firms refused to take directions from public authorities mckibben declares fdr ordered them seized in his account of a state controlled economy dedicated to full employment mckibben is careful to steer clear of the word socialism but that of course is what he is advocating and yet it is his refusal to broach this mobilizing idea that makes his plangent question of whether we can find the collective governance will to fight back in this war against global warming as we once fought fascism so ironic surely we will never be able to mobilize our collective will for such a fight unless we are able to speak frankly about the need for institutions and forms of public governance necessary to embody that will such organs of collective will only emerge from widespread acceptance of the notion that solidarity and the public good are important ideals to fight for but the problems with invocations of the new deal and of wartime mobilization run deeper as matt huber has argued the new deal helped catalyze a wholesale transformation of life in the united states one centered on mass consumption of cheap energy 4 fdr believed that cheap energy was central to what he termed abundant life and consequently helped oversee a transformation in social and energy policies that paved the way to the culture of conspicuous consumption which dominated postwar america during the period from 1932 to 1942 for example the federal government spent roughly 4 billion on highway construction creating the precedent for the 1956 federal highway act and the creation of the massive u s interstate highway system 5 public funds were used during these years to create the auto highway suburb complex ensuring private mobility for white homeowners and abundant profits for capital no thought was given to the environmental impact of this new sprawling geography of mass consumption but today with per capita carbon emissions in the united states at roughly double the levels of those in europe the impact is dramatically clear in addition this domestic geography of fossil fueled consumption also necessitated interventionist imperial policies around the globe an imperial cartography established when fdr met saudi king abdul aziz aboard a u s battleship anchored in the suez canal in 1945 during this meeting fdr fatefully pledged political and military support to the oil rich dictatorship a mobilization based on endless expansion of a capitalist economy thus generated both environmental and political outcomes whose devastating contradictions are all too evident today the great recession and proposals for gnd a genealogy of proposals for a gnd takes us back to precedents such as the pearce commission s blueprint for a green economy published in britain in 1989 and before that to earlier ecological debates that include the brundtland report s exploration of the prospects for sustainable growth 1987 and the club of rome s famous report on the limits to growth 1972 as the title of the latter explicitly highlights the contradictions between economic growth and a finite terrestrial resource base are prominent in the earlier moments of these conjoined economic and environmental proposals for example despite advocating sustainable growth the brundtland report alludes to a tension between sustainability and economic growth that might entail making painful choices in order to ward off environmental collapse by the time of the great recession of 2008 however such fears had been thoroughly banished in its 2009 plan for a global green new deal ggnd unep argued that the world economy needs the stimulus provided by a ggnd because the unregulated market cannot resurrect itself on its own the unep proposal thus envisages the ggnd as a kind of keynesian state based economic stimulus package for an ailing global capitalist economy the idea quickly garnered support from some of the key institutional incarnations of that order the world trade organization the international monetary fund and the world bank among others as a liberal alternative to the draconian austerity programs imposed around the world after the 2008 crash the ggnd held many attractions for liberal commentators and members of the public not only did it intend to revive the world s economic fortunes but it promised to do this through investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies that boosted the image of a clean green capitalist order on the horizon yet many of the solutions advocated by the unep proposal were of a neoliberal stamp including the idea of dealing with the spiraling carbon emissions caused by fossil fuel consumption through global carbon markets in addition there was little understanding in the document of the underlying contradictions in measures such as improvements in energy efficiency within a capitalist context historically such efficiency measures have promoted fresh rounds of economic growth rather than reduction in the cycles of material consumption 6 underlying these arguments for a program of keynesian environmentalism is the assumption that economic growth is beneficial as the unep report put it the greening of economies need not be a drag on growth on the contrary the greening of economies has the potential to be a new engine of growth a net generator of decent jobs and a vital strategy to eliminate persistent poverty 7 these ideas have become widely accepted as is evident from the writing of bill mckibben who argues that a global mobilization to defeat climate change wouldn t wreck our economy or throw coal miners out of work quite the contrary gearing up to stop global warming would provide a host of social and economic benefits just as world war ii did it would save lives it would produce an awful lot of jobs it would provide safer better paying employment to energy workers it would rescue the world s struggling economies and fighting this war would be socially transformative just as world war ii sped up the push for racial and gender equality a climate campaign should focus its first efforts on the frontline communities most poisoned by the fossil fuel era 8 mckibben s insistence on economic and environmental justice for the frontline communities most adversely impacted by fossil capitalism is dramatically different from the priorities in the unep report but his faith in the egalitarian impact of gnd is not wholly distinct from the assumptions about the benefits of keynesian stimulus to capitalist economies that underlie that report in addition the idea that the present hyper consumptionist economic system should be retained through massive conversion of existing energy generation from fossil fuels to renewable energy fails to address the deeper roots of the present biocrisis which lie in the capitalist imperative to grow ceaselessly we all may wish for the kind of social transformation mckibben advocates but we need to be extremely wary of gnd proposals that do not imagine such transformations through a wholesale shift away from the inequalities generated by the capitalist system growth only seems like a viable proposition to gnd advocates because of assumptions that economic expansion can be decoupled from increasing energy consumption this idea of decoupling is most ardently expounded by the breakthrough institute in its ecomodernist manifesto which argues that intensifying many human activities particularly farming energy extraction forestry and settlement so that they use less land and interfere less with the natural world is the key to decoupling human development from environmental impacts such arguments are perplexing given the fact that the global economy is five times the size it was after world war ii and is expanding at such an exponential rate that it will be eighty times that size by 2100 as commentators such as david harvey have pointed out this rate of growth is totally at odds with the finite resource base and increasingly fragile environment on which humanity depends 9 to obscure the glaring contradiction of infinite economic expansion on a self evidently limited planet advocates of growth typically distinguish between relative and absolute decoupling there is significant evidence they argue for declining resource intensities or relative decoupling over the last thirty years for example global carbon intensity fell from around one kilogram per dollar of economic activity to just under 770 grams per dollar 10 but improvements such as these in carbon and energy intensity were more than offset by massive increases in the scale of economic activity in general not only is there no evidence therefore for overall reductions in resource throughput absolute decoupling but global carbon emissions from energy use have actually increased by 40 percent since 1990 the kyoto protocol base year in addition when one factors in global consumption of a range of nonfuel minerals such as iron ore and bauxite global resource intensities have actually intensified dramatically in recent decades as tim jackson explains estimated rates of declining carbon intensity about equal projected population growth rates but under business as usual scenarios annual growth rates of 1 4 percent in income mean that by 2050 the advanced industrialized nations will be emitting 80 percent more carbon than we are at present 11 to make matters worse such alarming statistics do not include estimates of carbon emissions from industrial behemoths like china to which the west has displaced much of its industrial activities as these statistics underline the ecomodernists assertions about decoupling are dramatically contradicted by the relentless increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere notwithstanding periodic downturns in the rate of emissions in addition there is scant evidence to support the idea that a gnd would be successful in economic terms in fact the outcome might be precisely the opposite with gnd programs finding their economic viability contingent on a continuation of precisely the environmentally destructive expansionist tendencies that they set out to ameliorate indeed economists such as bill blackwater have argued that in order for massive green investment programs to be successful as investments they require underlying growth in the consumer economy to at least continue at the global level and within the west to accelerate at the end of the day in other words environmental keynesianism is predicated on economic expansion since new growth means that fresh resources need to be exploited any environmental benefits of more efficient technology and a transition to renewable energy will ultimately be undermined and the biocrisis will intensify another prominent element of gnd proposals such as the one advanced by the center for american progress also merits caution the idea that green jobs that entail higher skill levels better working conditions and better wages will ameliorate today s glaring economic and social inequalities unfortunately evidence suggests many of the common assumptions associated with green jobs are far too optimistic green jobs it should be noted do not necessarily use fewer environmental resources in fact they tend to be quite resource intensive in addition since most green jobs are located in sectors like agriculture construction waste and water management and manufacturing there is little evidence that green jobs are better jobs than average jobs on the contrary statistical evidence suggests that in terms of working conditions green jobs are actually worse than average jobs 12 in addition to the problem of green jobs questionable quality there is also substantial evidence to suggest that green jobs will not improve gender inequity since most green jobs are in sectors with extremely low female participation a crash program of ecological and social reconstruction proposals for a gnd typically advocate a raft of interventions that include not only full scale transition to renewable energy but also investment in other forms of green technology including energy efficiency as well as the improvement of transportation and energy infrastructures we need to fight for these transformations as a minimum condition to avert planetary ecocide but we should be clear that by themselves they will not solve either the biocrisis or the myriad contradictions that afflict contemporary capitalism the basic problem is that the biosphere is limited but economic growth under capitalism is boundless with this boundless economic growth comes necessary exploitation of nature and of frontline communities in the form of extreme extraction along with the forms of ruination and dispossession that attend extreme extraction economic growth also produces toxic byproducts that decades of environmental justice struggles have shown disproportionately affect people of color in the advanced capitalist nations as well as large swaths of the global south proposals for genuine ecological and social reconstruction therefore cannot simply substitute renewable energy for fossil fuels while leaving the current global system of spiraling production and consumption untouched instead the growth based presuppositions of the new deal and environmental keynesianism must be challenged what we really need in other words is a crash program to shrink those sectors of the economy that are environmentally destructive while in tandem sectors that do no environmental damage are expanded the latter is necessary not only because unemployment must not be allowed to spike as we shift away from fossil capitalism a development that might discredit the transition program in addition the so called caring economy should be built up because it is vitally concerned with building social resilience an absolutely essential project given the increasing climate chaos that will inevitably afflict global society given the amount of carbon already in circulation this program should be thought of as investment in essential social infrastructure since these sectors of the economy disproportionately employ people who are relatively marginalized by the capitalist system a program of building social infrastructure would also help ameliorate the galloping inequality of contemporary capitalism specific concrete demands that should be advanced within a program of ecological reconstruction should thus involve not just a shift to 100 percent renewable power but also a reduction in total energy consumption in addition such a program would entail a radical diminution in the imperial mode of living that characterizes elites in the global north and south with their mega mansions and first class flights around the planet it would involve a drastic cut in the industrial production of useless products with producers forced to guarantee the durability of anything they manufacture it would involve the rebuilding of cities to emphasize mass transit and walkability and it would necessarily hinge on an end to today s environmentally destructive and socially corrosive hyper militarism a program of ecological and social reconstruction that involves simultaneous growth and shrinkage means that it is important to think carefully about currently popular demands such as a universal job guarantee might such a guarantee not lead to an expansion of destructive jobs while it makes sense to fight against the precariousness and austerity that are central features of neoliberal capitalism the imperative of a crash program to shrink environmentally destructive production and consumption means careful planning of the economy in a manner antithetical to dominant doctrines that represent command economies as inherently inefficient instead forms of collective planning must be created that are founded in the understanding that the crash program of ecological reconstruction should shift the forms and conceptions of labor that are central to contemporary global capitalism this involves not just material transformation but also a transvaluation that elevates public service and social care beyond this though the notion of a universal job guarantee leaves current structures of excessive production and consumption untouched in other words it maintains the cycle of escalating production and consumption that was central to the new deal and that was inherited by current programs of environmental keynesianism what we really need is not just fewer bullshit jobs but less work work at present is not just excessive but also unequal and oppressive the average amount of work done has increased in many countries in recent decades and it has also grown more lopsided between those who work in the formal sector who tend to be men and those whose work is unpaid overwhelmingly women as men work more women are increasingly left alone to engage in unpaid domestic labor fueling wider gender inequality 13 working less as feminists demanded in the 1970s could help foster a more equitable distribution of the labor of social reproduction in addition it turns out that working too much also destroys the planet a number of studies have found correlations between working hours and ecological destruction 14 the united states has some of the longest work hours of any developed country and not coincidentally also has one of the highest levels of energy consumption excessive work some scholars have concluded leads to time scarcity that leads to a more environmentally damaging mix of consumption and lifestyle practices 15 instead of staying at home and cooking a meal together in other words time scarce yuppies tend to order food from take out joints generating masses of garbage in the process among 29 high income countries in fact countries with shorter working hours tend to have lower ecological footprints and carbon footprints and carbon dioxide emissions 16 working less in other words would decrease the scale of production and consumption it would leave more time for social interaction and pleasure what such a program of ecological reconstruction would ultimately be reaching for then would be a new definition of the good life against the current obsession with gdp with insatiable growth and entrepreneurial self assertion ecological reconstruction would involve the growth of leisure and freedom from both toxic pollution and competition 17 as we struggle for this new definition of the good life it is worth remembering that one of the primary demands of radicals in congress in the early years of the great depression was for a thirty hour work week it was to forestall this demand for less work put before congress by senator hugo black in 1933 that the national industrial recovery administration a key plank in the new deal was launched 18 collective bargaining in the search for higher wages and levels of consumption was thus substituted for less work today as agitation for a gnd becomes a rallying cry for many

we ve enjoyed years of recovery since the great financial crisis by literally papering over our problems with newly printed money instead of addressing their root causes but we ve now arrived at the awkward part of the story when all of our prior mistakes finally catch up with us and the plot heads in a much darker direction despite more than a decade of an all hands on deck propping up of the financial markets all the central bankers have to show for it is the widest wealth gap in history coupled with stagnant wages that and a skyrocketing cost of living b s from the bls depending on which oecd country you live in you can take your official inflation measure and multiply it by either a 2x or a 3x to get the true rate for example in the us we ve been told that inflation is running at just under 2 for years in reality it s been trucking along at closer to 4 to 6 for rural and urban dwellers respectively to summarize the situation simply the central banks have been printing up new money and then handing most of it to the wealthy via qe which boosts the prices of the assets the rich own then they put on a good show of worrying about inflation being too low when the government

average selling price as a real world shopper that s how much more cash you have to spend to buy a car today vs a decade ago however according to the bls new car prices have only increased by 6 6 over the same time frame in fact in the bls eyes prices today are exactly the same as they were 5 years ago 2013 vs 2018 source to compare apples to apples the bls says that new cars are the exact same price with zero inflation between 2013 and mid 2018 yet the real world data says that new cars went up by 17 in price so which is it is it a 0 increase or a 17 increase well the answer lies in all of the mumbo jumbo adjustments that the bls uses such as hedonics in attempt to convince us that our pockets are not being picked in broad daylight for a refresher in the many tricks used by the bls watch chapter 18 of the crash course fuzzy numbers the bls has a lot of fancy explanations for their math but the simple fact remains that a new car will cost you 17 more real cash dollars than it did

very low or even 0 cost of living adjustments cola which are based on the bls reported inflation numbers there s an even more subtle and corrosive effect that results from being lied to by those in authority with each fib the populace loses more and more trust and at some tipping point bang they re suddenly protesting the streets wearing yellow vests it may take a while but eventually folks catch on to the idea that fairness and justice are merely fantasies of the middle class both the rich and the poor already know better but once the middle class loses its faith in the dream then it becomes a lot harder to convince them that another massive tax break for corporations is really in their best interest the unease grows as increasing concern spreads across the social landscape for reasons well beyond the financial fibs outlined above it s becoming increasingly difficult to follow the competing narratives in play for example the economy is either doing great or it s busy imploding technology promises an amazing future or it s ruining our minds the world is awash with cheap fossil fuels or peak oil is in play and our standard of living is at risk either man made global warming is an imminent existential threat or there s nothing to worry about making sense of all these and many other competing narratives is a full time job almost nobody s got the time for that lurking beneath every one of these dueling plot lines is this nasty inescapable realization our entire way of life is unsustainable it s simply not possible to extract exponentially more raw materials year over year forever we all know that it s not a difficult concept to grasp but the entirety of our political system the mainstream media and our economy are all predicated on the opposite being true that endless exponential growth lies ahead like all delusions this false belief will have a terminal encounter with the limits of reality at some point there will come a time when attempts at further growth are counterproductive and cause more harm than benefit in fact we ve already entered that period we know that growth is killing the planet yet each day we are bombarded with messages imploring us all to invest in and hope for more growth those who have been paying attention know quantitatively as well as morally that more growth is not the answer yet it s the only path forward offered by those in power stuck between an impossible idea and the strident repetition of its opposite the populace grows ever more anxious we can all see and feel that the end of the growth narrative is near yet not even the barest glimmer of that inevitability is debated in the news or in any halls of power at least not publicly who knows what they re saying to each other privately perhaps something very different as evidenced by the rise in doomsday prep by the super rich as the social anxiety grows over facing a dimming future our feckless western press exploits that emotional tension to sell more consumer products and push political agendas committing sins of commission and omission in the process outright lies are published key issues are left entirely out of the conversation just look at the dearth of coverage on europe s yellow vest protests and alternative information sources are denounced as peddlers of fake news or russian agents often it seems as if what s truly important is intentionally avoided while that which is absolutely un important is minutely examined with excruciating repetition as i recently chronicled the very bottom of the terrestrial and oceanic food pyramids are being knocked out this is an existential threat to our species but it s hardly addressed in the mainstream media it should front page news in a sustained and complete call for action

of years to develop or maybe it will be a political flashpoint resulting in war a conflict resulting in even a temporary blockade of the free flow of global trade so critical for keeping all of our

having been so obviously comprehensively and repeatedly lied to over the years it s kind of hard to ask people to embrace shared sacrifice during tough times after the political and financial elites greedily lined their own pockets at the expense of everyone else during the good days the best of chris martenson
the fear trade is back all of the major currencies fell sharply this week as investors flocked into the safety of the us dollar big deadlines are looming in the month of february and investors are worried that they will result in more uneasiness than relief prime minister may needs to deliver significant progress on brexit negotiations to parliament on february 13th or the government will present a motion that would allow mps a greater control of the brexit process funding for the us government runs out on february 15th and a new funding bill needs to be passed by to avoid another shutdown the us commerce department is also set to publish a report on the car industry by february 17th that will make a recommendation on european car tariffs the us and china have until the beginning of next month to reach a trade agreement but based on president trump s comment that he will not be meeting with president xi before the deadline the talks are not going well global growth is also a problem with central banks around the world echoing the same concerns about downside risks so in light all of this its hard for investors not to be concerned but there s still hope treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trade negotiator robert lighthizer are headed to beijing this week for another round of talks and cnbc reported on friday that the march deadline of 12 01am or 0501 gmt on march 2 could move via telephone if it is not the us will proceed with increasing tariffs to 25 from 10 on 200b worth of chinese imports the us economy will also be in focus next week with cpi retail sales the empire state manufacturing index and university of michigan consumer sentiment reports scheduled for release if these reports surprise to the downside stocks will sell off further and usd jpy could drop below 109 if they surprise to the upside and show stabilization which is feasible given the recovery in oil prices last month and end of year holiday shopping it will give investors even more reasons to buy us dollars meanwhile the canadian labor market is on fire economists were only looking for an addition of 5k jobs but instead more than 65k jobs were created in the month of january which puts the 5 month average just under 50k jobs per month private sector hiring was exceptionally strong which will soften the blow of weaker global growth this report also reinforces the bank of canada s view that the economy is on solid footing but as governor poloz said there s nowhere to hide from brexit or trade fights so there s no reason to raise rates usd cad which pulled back after rallying in the front of the week will take its cue from oil in the week ahead persistently soft eurozone data prevented eur usd from rallying at all this week the single currency quietly slipped lower as weaker german factory orders were followed by a decline in industrial production and a narrower trade balance the slow speed of the sell off shows just how much support there is underneath 1 13 the fundamentals are clearly skewed against the euro and with the us dollar rising and stocks falling on risk aversion the pair should be trading comfortably below 1 13 it hasn t done so yet but we think its only a matter of time before new year to date lows are seen fourth quarter gdp numbers are due for release next week and given the central bank s concerns and the contraction in german retail sales the risk is to the downside for the report

last week the dollar is trading at its best level so far this year against the rising to almost jpy110 30 it has been fraying resistance around jpy110 for more than two weeks some are linking the yen

today europe the u k economy contracted by 0 4 in december to shave q4 to 0 2 from 0 6 in q3 economists had looked for a flat december and a 0 3 expansion in q4 consumption held up but business investment slid 1 4 after a 1 1 decline in q3 government spending jumped exports slowed and imports increased over the quarter the dismal economic performance in december renders remaining data from

norway s softer headline inflation figures with a 0 5 decline in the headline and a 0 7 decline in the underlying rate saw the krone sell off many expect the norges bank to hike rates next month the euro briefly dipped below 1 13 in the european morning for the first time since last month s ecb meeting the intraday technical readings are stretched the low for the year is 1 1290 and in december the euro s low was 1 1270 it is the sixth consecutive session of euro losses sterling is drifting lower back toward last week s mini crash low near 1 2855 intraday resistance is seen near 1 29230

america this week includes argentine and brazilian pension reforms the u s reports and industrial output at least seven fed officials speak this week canada reports new house prices and existing home sales u s budget talks reportedly broke down over the weekend the dispute was not over funding for the wall and so some are optimistic that either the talks will resume or a small extension will be granted just before the weekend the is trading in narrow ranges around the pre weekend close a little below cad1 3280 it was mostly in a cad1 3230 cad1 3330 range at the end of last week and this looks sufficient today for its part the dollar index is nosing in on the year s high that was set on january 2 near 96 95 the 2018 high was set in december near 97 70 it is the eighth consecutive advancing session the greenback remains stuck in a mxn19 00 mxn19 20 trading range we see it more likely as a base than a top but this has yet to be proven lastly we note that the gapped lower last thursday that gap is found between 2719 3 and 2724 1 a close above the top of that band would be technically constructive

determined that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level as of march 31 2018 and the reporting periods thereafter the company is evaluating whether this material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting resulted in a misstatement in the company s financial statements included in the annual report on form 10 k for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 and the impact on the financial statements of the company as of december 31 2018 including disclosures the company is specifically evaluating whether certain debt balances

operating revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in the company s oil and gas services driven by decreased flight activity in its asia pacific region its canada operations within its americas

services in its africa region additionally revenue decreased by 7 8 million in the december 2018 quarter compared to the december 2017 quarter due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in the company s europe caspian and asia pacific regions related to the strengthening of the u s dollar versus the british pound sterling and australian dollar the gaap net loss and diluted

to recover its approximately 12 million deposit but cannot predict the outcome of such action or whether it will be successful in recovering any portion of this amount the year over year change in gaap net loss and diluted loss per share were primarily driven by lower revenue in the december 2018 quarter discussed above higher interest expense higher loss on disposal of assets and higher rent

adjusted ebitda as well as higher interest expense however a more favorable adjusted tax rate in the december 2018 quarter more than offset these negative changes the december 2017 quarter was also impacted by special items as reflected in the table at the end of this release liquidity and financial flexibility the company s december 31 2018 liquidity of 236 9 million was down 83 million from

overthrown prime minister seeking to reinvent himself as man of the people in a trial that has now been postponed kuala lumpur malaysia while he was prime minister najib razak was often accused of being woefully out of touch with ordinary citizens lives but now out of office and facing dozens of criminal charges in connection to an extraordinary multibillion dollar scandal at malaysia s 1mdb state investment fund the 65 year old seems to be reinventing himself as a man of the people gone are the italian cut suits with their carefully coordinated ties and pocket handkerchiefs his wife rosmah mansor in her tailor made traditional silk outfits accessorised with diamonds is nowhere to be seen these days najib rocking a hoodie and kicks is hanging out with young bikers riding pillion on the back of a moped every moment is shared on his social media accounts and captioned with the slogan apa malu bossku what s there to be ashamed about boss there s even a range of t shirts najib s new look comes as the prosecution prepared to lay out its case against najib in the kuala lumpur high court the first time a malaysian leader will be in the dock on criminal allegations including money laundering bribery and abuse of power the trial was scheduled to take place on tuesday however late on monday najib s lawyer said it was postponed pending an appeal by najib no new date was set the us department of justice says that 4 5bn was siphoned from 1mdb to fund everything from luxury apartments to expensive jewellery and even the hollywood film wolf of wall street some of the money from the sovereign wealth fund which najib set up in 2009 is alleged to have ended up in the former prime minister s personal bank account it s actually classic populism meredith weiss an expert on politics in southeast asia at the university of albany in new york who travels regularly to malaysia said of najib s public persona in the lead up to the trial it s such a contrast from before the election it s an effort to make himself look cool before it was really the images of grandeur playing up the wealth ignorance and vendetta the scale of the corruption at 1mdb was one of the reasons for may 2018 s election shock which propelled the opposition pakatan harapan into government the first defeat for najib s party the united malays national organisation umno and its barisan nasional coalition in six decades malaysians watched agog last year as the police wheeled out shopping trolleys laden with designer handbags bags of cash and expensive jewellery from properties linked to najib and his family investigators later revealed the haul was worth as much as 273m it took 22 people six counting machines and three days to count all the cash which came in 26 different currencies najib has denied any wrongdoing in an interview with al jazeera s 101 east programme last year he said he was not aware of what was going on at the fund even though as the country s prime minister he chaired 1mdb s board of advisers and as its finance minister was authorised to sign off on its major financial transactions in a song he released over social media in january a re working in malay of the manhattans soul classic kiss and say goodbye he accused the government of spreading lies and wanting revenge najib s defence and strategy will mainly be ignorance and vendetta said asrul hadi abdullah sani a political analyst in kuala lumpur it will be very difficult for him to argue otherwise political career born in july 1953 in the sleepy rural town of kuala lipis when malaysia was still malaya and a british colony najib was the first child of abdul razak hussein the man who would go on to become independent malaysia s second prime minister his uncle would become the third like many children of the country s elite then and now he was sent overseas as a teenager first attending malvern college one of britain s most expensive private schools and later doing a degree in industrial economics at university of nottingham but in 1976 razak died and najib was thrust into politics taking his father s old seat in pekan a small town hugging the banks of the pahang river on malaysia s east coast buoyed by his father s reputation najib s political rise was assured the youngest member of the federal parliament soon became at the state level the youngest chief minister he came into politics at a very young age he did quite well as a chief minister even though he was the youngest many people really liked him said saifuddin abdullah who worked alongside najib in umno and government before resigning from the party in 2015 you can easily like him he has very good pr there s no doubt about it added saifuddin who is now malaysia s foreign minister this is someone who has been in politics since they were 23 said oh ei sun a political analyst who worked with najib when he first became prime minister so there is a sense of entitlement after stints as education minister and defence minister najib became deputy prime minister in 2004 he took the top job five years later vowing to build an economically and politically dynamic malaysia and double per capita income to 15 000 by 2020 the plan aimed to diversify the economy beyond natural resources into areas such as green energy and technology and reduce subsidies politically the focus was supposed to be on the removal of repressive laws that allowed for detention without trial and strengthening democracy for saifuddin it was the promise of transformation that caught his attention he seemed to be saying all the right things he told al jazeera najib s urbane manner made him popular on the international stage and he and rosmah made frequent foreign trips rubbing shoulders with world leaders at the united nations general assembly cosying up to tech titans such as china s jack ma and playing golf with ex us president barack obama domestically however support for the long ruling barisan continued to fall in the 2013 election the coalition lost the popular vote for the first time although the winner takes it all voting system magnified by the disproportionate influence of its rural heartlands helped barisan stay in office while the reform programme stalled a goods and services tax further undermined support for najib s government but he was about to be faced with an even more serious challenge to his authority scandal tainted fund at its launch in 2009 1mdb was touted as a multibillion dollar investment by a saudi oil firm petrosaudi with a remit to target new industries that would create jobs for malaysians later there were multibillion dollar deals with the united arab emirates to develop the massive tun razak exchange development in kuala lumpur as well as bankroll oil and gas projects 180521061745763 but suspicions about the fund s investment strategy began to emerge with critics pointing to ballooning debt and asking questions about the fate of funds raised from earlier bond issues there were questions too over najib s stepson riza aziz and how he had got together the money to make the film the wolf of wall street a 2013 tale of financial excess and debauchery starring hollywood superstar leonardo di caprio suspicions also focused on a young party loving malaysian financier who was often seen with riza and whose name appears in the film s credits jho low whose whereabouts are currently unknown as the story gathered momentum and pressure mounted najib launched an investigation but then came the bombshell the campaigning blog sarawak report and the wall street journal reported that hundreds of millions of dollars had been deposited into najib s personal bank account shortly before the 2013 election najib denied ever receiving money for personal gain saying it was a donation from a saudi prince that was then returned but on the defensive the prime minister revealed there was a harder edge to his seemingly charming public image in july 2015 he stunned malaysia by firing the attorney general who had been leading the 1mdb investigation and removing senior ministers who had questioned him over events at the fund the edge a local business publication that had reported extensively on 1mdb was suspended for three months while access to sarawak report and other critical sources was blocked opposition politicians who had raised concerns about 1mdb found themselves prevented from leaving the country and critics found themselves facing charges under a sedition law najib had earlier promised to repeal his behaviour fits with that broad pattern where you consolidate power at the expense of the ruling elite said lee morgenbesser an expert on authoritarian governments at australia s griffith university then he had this corruption scandal that left him little room for manoeuvre for oh the political analyst najib could often seem cold and detached but he was also a good listener who was comfortable with figures and charts he recalls najib chatting with christine lagarde the current head of the international monetary fund who was then finance minister of france they were throwing economic terms at each other comparing notes he said i thought here is someone who knows his portfolio najib insists that when it came to 1mdb he was not aware of what was going on in october 2018 he told al jazeera s 101 east that he was proud of what he had done as prime minister and would be vindicated there was progress in country najib said of his years in power there was more wealth in the country when i left so i m proud of the record that i achieved as prime minister najib faces nearly 40 counts rosmah around 20 former allies are also due in court on corruption charges with appeals the cases could take years to grind their way through the courts keeping najib in the spotlight even without his regular social media updates but history is likely to prove a more demanding judge than the bikers in their bossku shirts najib s legacy will be the historic loss of barisan nasional asrul hadi said he cannot escape that no matter what he says on social media platforms unfortunately for tun abdul razak hussein the name razak will be associated with najib and 1mdb for generations to come
washington ap president donald trump is declaring exoneration prematurely in the russia investigation he s tweeting that republican sen richard burr who chairs the senate intelligence committee has announced the panel found no collusion or conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign during the 2016 election that s taking it too far burr did say in a published interview that he had found no evidence so far of collusion after two years of investigation but the probe is continuing burr also indicated the committee s final report may not even reach a conclusion on the question leaving it up to the public to decide trump is also taking undue credit for the economy and falsely asserting a sudden turnaround under his watch claiming job growth from the twilight of the obama administration as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement a look some of the claims from the past week and the reality russia investigation trump senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this tweet sunday trump the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump russia tweet friday the facts trump is overstating it burr r n c did tell cbs that he could not conclude there was collusion during the 2016 election based on the available evidence after his panel interviewed more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than 300 000 pages of documents but burr also allowed that some questions raised during the russia probe could occupy the committee for the next decade if we write a report based upon the facts that we have then we don t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia he said in the interview that appeared thursday burr s comment was similar to what he has frequently said over the last two years in august for instance burr told the associated press that there is no factual evidence today that we ve received on collusion or conspiracy between russia and trump s campaign but that he s still open on the issue burr s comment last week was not an official declaration on behalf of the committee exonerating trump of collusion and the chairman suggested that its final report may not draw a conclusion what i m telling you is that i m going to present as best we can the facts to you and to the american people burr told cbs and you ll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that by whatever definition that s collusion the senate committee s work is separate from that of special counsel robert mueller who is also probing russian election interference questions of collusion and possible obstruction of justice by the trump campaign ___ economy trump we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the u s would be in a depression right now we were heading down tweet saturday the facts there s no evidence of a sudden economic turnaround under trump s watch let alone one that averted a depression the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but not out of line with obama s record it was just the fastest in four years economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated compared with 2016 and 2017 and most partly credit trump s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending the economy is on pace to grow at roughly 3 percent in 2018 which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015 when it expanded 2 9 percent under obama independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech tuesday the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess zz here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 of these jobs were added during that term and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers mary clare

president rouhani s budget proposal for the upcoming iranian year will see the government run a deficit amounting to about 10 percent of gdp or 60 percent of the state s general budget excluding oil revenues and withdrawals from the national development fund rather than increase tax collection to ease budget gaps the rouhani administration plans to tap iran s nascent debt markets to cover its public spending requirements rouhani s cabinet intends to issue at least irr 5 trillion government treasury bills and sukuk bonds in the next iranian calendar year for debts already nearing their maturity it will have to repay close to irr 3 3 trillion in 2019 20 the recourse to debt markets has economic commentators increasingly concerned over state s ability to cover rising liabilities in the coming years the concern extends to the think tank of the iranian parliament their assessment is that over the next four to five years iran s government debt may reach 50 70 percent of gdp leaving little fiscal space according to the sixth development plan 2016 21 the government is required to keep government debt including the debt of state owned enterprises at below 40 percent of gdp but it looks likely that the government will exceed this level should iran s government debt exceed 70 percent of gdp the fiscal position would be high risk meanwhile by 2021 interest charges on bonds will constitute 4 percent of gdp while the total budget deficit is meant to remain below 3 percent of gdp according to parliamentary researchers looking worldwide high government debt is associated with financial crises according to data from the oecd two third of countries hit by the 2009 financial crises were those whose government debt to gdp ratio exceeded 60 percent when looking to the fraction of the total debt ratio it is important to consider both the numerator and the denominator the fact that government bonds in iran offer 20 percent returns means that interest payments can quickly balloon unlike japan or the united states where interest rates on government bonds are zero percent and 2 4 percent respectively keeping tabs on fiscal space in iran requires accounting for the cost of the debt to the government not merely the amount of debt issued moreover given that iran has experienced limited economic growth in recent years and is poised to enter a recession its fiscal space is expected to decrease according to the study conducted by the center for the management of debt and financial assets of iran this proportion was approximately 55 6 percent in 2015 putting aside the risks posed by the rouhani governments turn to debt markets it is worth asking whether there have been any clear macroeconomic benefits in the assessment of parliament researchers the rouhani administration s turn to debt markets is only sensible if increased government spending helps generate economic growth but with government revenues expected to stagnate it is unlikely that rouhani will have sufficient means to encourage the infrastructure projects and other investments to keep iran s economic growth at the 2 5 percent level experienced in the first six months of this iranian year particularly given the reimposition of us secondary sanctions low or negative growth rates combined with the high interest rates of debt securities mean that the government s insatiable appetite to underwrite its budget through bond markets may backfire forcing the central bank of iran to print more money to pay debts exacerbating the cycle of inflation and devaluation to the detriment of the whole economy to avoid such an outcome the rouhani government must match its turn to debt markets with an effort to expand the tax base photo credit irna
by ellen brown february 09 2019 ellenbrown com modern monetary theory mmt is getting significant media attention these days after alexandria ocasio cortez said in an interview that it should be a larger part of our conversation when it comes to funding the green new deal according to mmt the government can spend what it needs without worrying about deficits mmt expert and bernie sanders advisor prof stephanie kelton says the government actually creates money when it spends the real limit on spending is not an artificially imposed debt ceiling but a lack of labor and materials to do the work leading to generalized price inflation only when that real ceiling is hit does the money need to be taxed back and then not to fund government spending but to shrink the money supply in an economy that has run out of resources to put the extra money to work predictably critics have been quick to rebut calling the trend to endorse mmt disturbing and a joke that s not funny in a february 1st post on the daily reckoning brian maher darkly envisioned bernie sanders getting elected in 2020 and implementing quantitative easing for the people based on mmt theories to debunk the notion that governments can just print the money to solve their economic problems he raise the specter of venezuela where money is everywhere but bare essentials are out of reach for many the storefronts are empty unemployment is at 33 and inflation is predicted to hit 1 000 000 by the end of the year blogger arnold kling also pointed to the venezuelan hyperinflation he described mmt as the doctrine that because the government prints money it can spend whatever it wants until it can t he said to me the hyperinflation in venezuela exemplifies what happens when a country reaches the it can t point the country is not at full employment but the government can t seem to spend its way out of difficulty somebody should ask these mmt rock stars about the venezuela example i m not an mmt rock star and won t try to expound on its subtleties i would submit that under existing regulations the government cannot actually create money when it spends but that it should be able to in fact mmters have acknowledged that problem but it s a subject for another article what i want to address here is the hyperinflation issue and why venezuelan hyperinflation and qe for the people are completely different animals what is different about venezuela venezuela s problems are not the result of the government issuing money and using it to hire people to build infrastructure provide essential services and expand economic development if it were unemployment would not be at 33 percent and climbing venezuela has a problem that the us does not have and will never have it owes massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself namely us dollars when oil its principal resource was booming venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule but when oil plummeted the government was reduced to printing venezuelan bolivars and selling them for us dollars on international currency exchanges as speculators drove up the price of dollars more and more printing was required by the government massively deflating the national currency it was the same problem suffered by weimar germany and zimbabwe the two classic examples of hyperinflation typically raised to silence proponents of government expansion of the money supply before venezuela suffered the same fate prof michael hudson an economic rock star who supports mmt principles has studied the hyperinflation question extensively he confirms that those disasters were not due to governments issuing money to stimulate the economy rather he writes every hyperinflation in history has been caused by foreign debt service collapsing the exchange rate the problem almost always has resulted from wartime foreign currency strains not domestic spending venezuela and other countries that are carrying massive debts in currencies that are not their own are not sovereign governments that are sovereign can and have engaged in issuing their own currencies for infrastructure and development quite successfully a number of contemporary and historical examples were discussed in my earlier articles including in japan china australia and canada although venezuela is not technically at war it is suffering from foreign currency strains triggered by aggressive attacks by a foreign power us economic sanctions have been going on for years causing at least 20 billion in losses to the country about 7 billion of its assets are now being held hostage by the us which has waged an undeclared war against venezuela ever since george w bush s failed military coup against president hugo chavez in 2002 chavez boldly announced the bolivarian revolution a series of economic and social reforms that dramatically reduced poverty and illiteracy and improved health and living conditions for millions of venezuelans the reforms which included nationalizing key components of the nation s economy made chavez a hero to millions of people and the enemy of venezuela s oligarchs nicolas maduro was elected president following chavez s death in 2013 and vowed to continue the bolivarian revolution like saddam hussein and omar qaddafi before him he defiantly announced that venezuela would not be trading oil in us dollars following sanctions imposed by president trump the notorious elliott abrams has now been appointed as special envoy to venezuela considered a criminal by many for covering up massacres committed by us backed death squads in central america abrams was among the prominent neocons closely linked to bush s failed venezuelan coup in 2002 national security advisor john bolton is another key neocon architect advocating regime change in venezuela at a january 28 press conference he held a yellow legal pad prominently displaying the words 5 000 troops to colombia a country that shares a border with venezuela apparently the neocon contingent feels they have unfinished business there bolton does not even pretend that it s all about restoring democracy he said on fox news it will make a big difference to the united states economically if we could have american oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in venezuela as president nixon said of us tactics against allende s government in chile the point of sanctions and military threats is to squeeze the country economically killing the public banking revolution in venezuela it may be about more than oil which recently hit record lows in the market the us hardly needs to invade a country to replenish its supplies as with libya and iraq another motive may be to suppress the banking revolution initiated by venezuela s upstart leaders the banking crisis of 2009 10 exposed the corruption and systemic weakness of venezuelan banks some banks were engaged in questionable business practices others were seriously undercapitalized others were apparently lending top executives large sums of money at least one financier could not prove where he got the money to buy the banks he owned rather than bailing out the culprits as was done in the us in 2009 the government nationalized seven venezuelan banks accounting for around 12 of the nation s bank deposits in 2010 more were taken over the government arrested at least 16 bankers and issued more than 40 corruption related arrest warrants for others who had fled the country by the end of march 2011 only 37 banks were left down from 59 at the end of november 2009 state owned institutions took a larger role holding 35 of assets as of march 2011 while foreign institutions held just 13 2 of assets over the howls of the media in 2010 chavez took the bold step of passing legislation defining the banking industry as one of public service the legislation specified that 5 of the banks net profits must go towards funding community council projects designed and implemented by communities for the benefit of communities the venezuelan government directed the allocation of bank credit to preferred sectors of the economy and it increasingly became involved in the operations of private financial institutions by law nearly half the lending portfolios of venezuelan banks had to be directed to particular mandated sectors of the economy including small business and agriculture in an april 2012 article called venezuela increases banks obligatory social contributions u s and europe do not rachael boothroyd said that the venezuelan government was requiring the banks to give back housing was declared a constitutional right and venezuelan banks were obliged to contribute 15 of their yearly earnings to securing it the government s great housing mission aimed to build 2 7 million free houses for low income families before 2019 the goal was to create a social banking system that contributed to the development of society rather than simply siphoning off its wealth boothroyd wrote venezuelans are in the fortunate position of having a national government which prioritizes their life quality wellbeing and development over the health of bankers and lobbyists pay checks if the 2009 financial crisis demonstrated anything it was that capitalism is quite simply incapable of regulating itself and that is precisely where progressive governments and progressive government legislation needs to step in that is also where the progressive wing of the democratic party is stepping in in the us and why aoc s proposals evoke howls in the media of the sort seen in venezuela article i section 8 of the constitution gives congress the power to create the nation s money supply congress needs to exercise that power key to restoring our economic sovereignty is to reclaim the power to issue money from a commercial banking system that acknowledges no public responsibility beyond maximizing profits for its shareholders bank created money is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states including federal deposit insurance access to the fed s lending window and government bailouts when things go wrong if we the people are backing the currency it should be issued by the people through their representative government today however our government does not adequately represent the people we first need to take our government back and that is what aoc and her congressional allies are attempting to do this article was first published on truthdig com ellen brown is an attorney founder of the public banking institute and author of twelve books including web of debt and the public bank solution a 13th book titled banking on the people democratizing finance in the digital age is due out soon she also co hosts a radio program on prn fm called

caracas venezuela ap when jose humberto vivas needs to trade dollars for venezuelan bolivars he usually flouts the nation s rigid exchange controls by turning to illegal currency traders but last week vivas put a few hundred dollars in his wallet and headed to an exchange house regulated by venezuela s socialist government lured by the seemingly improbable prospect of an official rate that is more inviting than the black market rate i haven t been here in years vivas said as he stood in line outside italcambio a normally lifeless exchange house in downtown caracas protected by tinted windows

28 by 50 percent eclipsing the parallel black market rate the government now buys 1 for 3 303 bolivars while the informal market buys them at 3 120 bolivars according to the website dolartoday it is the first time the official exchange rate has been higher than that of the black market since currency controls were put in place more than a decade ago analysts said the controls were implemented in 2003 by hugo chavez the late president who initiated venezuela s socialist system and have frequently made the simple task of exchanging money into a stressful ordeal that involves searching for illegal currency dealers logging into websites banned by the government and sending wire transfers to foreign banks but as maduro s government runs out of hard currency amid an onslaught of international pressure and economic sanctions it is tacking in a markedly capitalist direction encouraging venezuelans to sell their greenbacks to the local financial system in a statement issued jan 29 the central bank described the devaluation as an economic stabilization measure aimed at controlling hyperinflation by undermining the black market analysts called it a desperate gambit to raise hard cash in a country now beset by severe u s oil sanctions that could cost the government up to 11 billion in revenue over the next 12 months without one of its most important sources of income venezuela will be hard pressed to purchase food and other imports potentially worsening shortages and deepening its economic collapse russ dallen ceo at caracas capital markets said dollars could now come into venezuela s empty state coffers through state regulated wire transfers from the estimated 3 million venezuelan migrants who have fled the country s instability up until now they have mostly

the official exchange rate something that would have been unfeasible a few weeks ago but the strategy is controversial maduro s opponents argue that selling dollars to the government is tantamount to funding repression others say the move will not eliminate the longstanding spread between the two rates which has often allowed richer venezuelans to take advantage of the distortion and pocket juicy profits asdrubal oliveros an economic consultant based in caracas predicts the amount of money the venezuelan government can raise through currency markets will fall short of what it needs to remedy

by northmantrader warning rant alert the global central bank easy money experiment has failed and it is past time that central bankers stopped bullshitting us and just admitted it europe is about to enter a recession and rates are still negative the us fed just tried to reduce its balance sheet with the greatest economic backwind in years tax cuts record buybacks 3 gdp growth and still they failed miserably forced once again to halt all rate hike efforts after 10 years of being non stop accommodative the fed tried for 3 months to not be accommodative and it blew up in their face as the bottom dropped out of markets only emergency liquidity calls from cabo by treasury secretary mnuchin and a complete 180 degree reversal by the fed stopped the bleeding again and so once again the fed is asking us to play chase the dot plot always dangling higher rate forecast targets that never come to fruition not playing anymore for 10 years we ve watched the dot plot being moved further and further into the future only to see it all flat line again now with a renewed halt in rate hikes and an end to reducing the balance sheet the conclusion is pretty clear the fed is trapped the ecb is trapped the boj is trapped all doomed to intervene forever and ever amen always afraid to see markets go through a process of repricing and squeezing out the artificial asset inflation that 10 years of permanent intervention have wrought all are too afraid of the next recession and aim to avoid it at all costs and who can blame them the prospect of entering a global recession without enough ammunition to deal with it is a frightening prospect and don t think for a minute that the next rounds of stimulus i e qe4 and negative rates will have the same effect as last time already the current effect is very questionable the us has been stumbling from lower highs on the fed funds rate for decades with that stimulus of ever lower rates producing ever less real gdp growth the trend is so well established it s no surprise that markets once again puked once the 10 year yield hit its 30 year trend line and hence it s also no surprise that the fed desperate to re inflate asset prices and to repair the market damage once again caved as spx broke its trend if you look at the world through a linear lens they of course stepped in at precisely the spot where they always step in with no sign that liquidity has ever been normalized but unlike 2016 there s no great new stimulus coming and this is precisely why markets are starting to price in rate cuts the end of the rate raising cycle and it s why janet yellen is also already talking about rate cuts that s called the end of the easing cycle and is practically begging for this conclusion hey federalreserve here s your trend based dot plot just admit it and we can all move on pic twitter com pqvbygzmvb sven henrich northmantrader february 6 2019 bulls will tell you it s all bullish because a dovish fed has been the spark for higher equity prices for the past 10 years problem is the last 3 times the fed has ended its rate hike cycle and proceeded to an easing cycle a recession soon followed so the same crowd that told you to buy stocks last year because of global synchronized growth is now telling you to buy stocks because the fed is now easy due to a global synchronized slowdown that will prove to be temporary please talk is already of a melt up either now or after a rate cut given their reaction investors now realize the importance of the powell put it even raises the possibility of a late 90s style meltup the question is whether we need another december style meltdown and fed rate cuts before markets get bubbly or whether the policy shift announced so far is already sufficient problem with that theory is that the fed appears to be expecting more than a temporary slowdown see for now the fed has signaled it might merely halt its balance sheet reduction program but if they intend to merely pause or halt its reduction program why are they openly discussing buying bonds again and not on an emergency basis but on a regular basis not kidding u s central bankers are currently debating whether it should confine its controversial tool of bond buying to purely emergency situations or if it should turn to that tool more regularly san francisco federal reserve bank president mary daly said on friday stop bullshitting us reality is what was promised to be emergency measures during the financial crisis have become permanent measures what was promised to be reverted to normal can t be reverted too great has been the debt expansion during the easy money years giving both governments and corporations license to load up on debt and now they can t normalize they can t raise rates and they can t stop intervening the emerging truth central banks will never normalize rates they will never revert their balance sheets to pre crisis levels and they will never stop interfering with markets but they will not admit this to the public what they will do is sanctimoniously complain about income inequality the very income inequality they have helped propagate for decades powell last week speaking at a town hall in washington d c to a group of educators the central bank leader said his greatest economic fears lie outside the fed s purview specifically he called for more aggressive policies to address income inequality wages at the middle and lower levels have grown much more slowly than those at the higher end he said we want prosperity to be widely shared we need policies to make that happen powell added out of the fed s purview seriously that s revisionist history in the making as central bank policies have helped to greatly exacerbate wealth inequality by inflating the asset classes owned by the few to not acknowledge this is to be revealed to not be serious about the issue after all what has screwed the middle class has helped produce the system we have now a system that produces ever more wealth for the few at the expense of the many but you wouldn t be able to tell this from the fed pablum about how it only cares about doing a good job for the american people sounds good right except public debt to gdp is 104 corporate debt is over 9 trillion with over half being bbb rated we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us but unemployment is low times should be good and happy instead we see waves of populism borne out of discontentment and fear destabilizing the entire western world populism and nationalism usually come as a result of high unemployment and in the context of recessions and economic angst it is these environments that breed political extremism and instability not now they are already here why consider how our current form of capitalism works major u s banks shaved about 21 billion from their tax bills last year almost double the irs s annual budget as the industry benefited more than many others from the republican tax overhaul on average the banks saw their effective tax rates fall below 19 percent from the roughly 28 percent they paid in 2016 and while the breaks set off a gusher of payouts to shareholders firms cut thousands of jobs and saw their lending growth slow specifically 23 firms boosted dividends and stock buybacks by 23 percent and they eliminated almost 4 300 jobs and few have signaled plans to cut thousands more why because they can and technology enables it indeed bac s ceo recently boasted how technology allowed him to eliminated over 100 000 jobs at bac in the past decade the whispers of the future are all around us already artificial intelligence and robotic process automation has helped the firm s wall street divisions cut 84 000 work hours a year his reward oh you guessed it finally wage growth t co plx9ixcajf sven henrich northmantrader february 8 2019 a 15 wage increase in a year when bac stock dropped 15 despite dividends and buybacks when 22m a year are not enough you get a corporate tax cut lay off more people and make 25 6m per year instead greed greed and more f ing greed and cheap money was the explanation in the rant of the financial crisis still the greatest financial crisis explanation rant ever see if you note anything different 10 years later wankingbankers pic twitter com fhutyesjqd sven henrich northmantrader january 24 2019 nothing s changed see you can t lose in corporate america as to the rest well your real disposable income is stuck in neutral but don t worry the fed is ready to give it back to you the people by doing the same thing they ve done for the past 10 years bullshit the people yesterday the imf warned of a global economic storm as growth undershoots even their downward revisions from january paul krugman is now warning of a recession morgan stanley just slashed euro zone 2019 gdp forecast to 1 0 from 1 6 a not trivial cut the bank also cut inflation bond yield euro forecasts and pushes out ecb s first rate hike to june 2020 given this backdrop i have to ask this question q what happens when we enter a recession with over 100 public debt to gdp over 9 trillion in corporate debt and a fed still carrying a 4 trillion balance sheet a nobody knows sven henrich northmantrader february 11 2019 and it s really true nobody knows and neither would we know the efficacy of any renewed central bank measures although for now one must acknowledge their awesome power once again as complete policy capitulation has again managed to re inflate the assets owned by the few wealth inequality is just terrible but we only care about doing a good job for the american people don t you know it all rings hollow and central bankers can t be taken seriously on bemoaning wealth income inequality when they themselves keep perpetuating it easy money policies have enabled the greatest debt expansion in our lifetimes enabled politicians to ignore all meaningful structural reforms and the resulting wealth and income inequality has greatly contributed to political movements of populism and discontentment but none of this is acknowledged by powell or draghi or kuroda the central bank overlords or yellen or bernanke or anyone in power none of them bear any responsibility right who does nobody of course but who pays for it all everybody for when the next recession comes corporations will have the greatest incentive ever to automate downsize apply new ai technologies etc the signs are already there just check the banking sector there s always money for dividends and buybacks and ceo pay raises now watch what we can do with downsizing careful folks 4 unemployment is not the place to be complacent about coming job gains watch those layoff announcements they are a rising slowly but surely reality check no new highs without dovish capitulating central banks no new highs without artificial liquidity and or intervention 10 years after the financial crisis this remains the primary price discovery dynamic markets remain entirely dependent on running to their central bank daddies for help every time they get in trouble this is the expectation central banks have set and this is the role they continue to play markets are spoiled trust fund kids the age of permanent intervention began in 2008 the correction of 2018 just made central bankers finally admit it as they failed to stay non accommodative for not even 3 months before caving 10 years after the financial crisis we are staring at a global economic slowdown with central banks never having normalized and as a result having a lot less ammunition at their disposal to react the global economy is riddled with the highest debt loads ever while the few have become richer than ever think people are angry now watch the next recession the saddest part in all this is that the financial crisis gave a loud enough warning and a call to action we as a global society wasted the opportunity for meaningful structural reform instead we doubled down on the system that was already in place and now we re left hoping hoping that the powell put will be as good as the yellen put and the bernanke put before that cause the

johannesburg zimbabwe should adopt south africa s rand as its currency one of a series of fundamental reforms needed to restore economic stability in the country former finance minister tendai biti said his call is an endorsement of government efforts to link zimbabwe s economy to neighbouring south africa s currency as it grapples with a foreign exchange shortage that s spawned the fastest price increases since hyperinflation a decade ago zimbabwe abolished its own currency in 2009 and mainly uses the us dollar the american currency is too strong for the zimbabwean economy biti said friday in an interview in johannesburg joining the so called common monetary area in which namibia lesotho and eswatini peg their currencies to the rand would reduce costs he said the advantage of joining a rand monetary union would be that it would foist some much needed discipline on the zimbabwean economy biti said it would also enhance regional integration by giving manufacturers in the country access to 300 million consumers in southern africa compared with the 100 000 he estimates can still afford goods usually bought by the middle class in zimbabwe he said biti who served as finance minister from february 2009 until september 2013 is deputy chairman of the opposition movement for democratic change miracle of failure zimbabwe is considering pegging a planned new currency to the rand one of several proposals being discussed by the government the harare based financial gazette reported last week it may be favoured because south africa is the country s biggest trading partner it said the rand has had a strong start to the year gaining 5 per cent that makes it the second best performing emerging markets currency based on a basket selected by bloomberg behind the russian rouble in addition to the dollar zimbabwe s central bank also prints quasi greenbacks called bond notes and an electronic currency known as rtgs to fund rampant government spending and stem the shortage of foreign exchange that s resulted in a convoluted system of exchange rates with consumers charged different prices depending on how they pay even though the government insists all the securities are at par with the dollar biti said both the bond notes and rtgs should be scrapped inflation reached an estimated 500 billion per cent in 2008 before the zimbabwe dollar was scrapped the rate rose to 42 per cent in december from 31 per cent in november price growth risks are entering another hyperinflationary cycle driven by the government s insatiable appetite to spend money it doesn t have biti said

unlocking smes potential with better funding capital is crucial in driving sustainable small and medium enterprises smes growth but accessing it has remained a daunting task for many operators still earth capital finance limited sel capital managing director ceo segun opaleye speaks with collins nweze on the company s research report detailing the state of sme sector and what should be done to bridge funding gaps and other challenges facing it opaleye highlights various funding options for smes and what operators banks and government should do to unlock the potential in the sector the economies of great nations thrive on the strength and capabilities of their small and medium enterprises smes for nigeria the central bank cbn defines smes as enterprises with asset base excluding land of between n5 million and n500 million and labour force of 11 to 300 people they are also seen as the engine block of the economy supporting job and wealth creation for the citizenry for smes to achieve these goals of creating jobs stimulating growth and development of the economy operators easy access to credit must be promoted and guaranteed in asia europe and north america smes play significant roles in their emergence as global economic powers the same cannot be said of nigeria as smes have performed below expectations because of lack of access to finance as it is hard to raise external finance and the few shareholders make raising internal finance difficulty other challenges include poor infrastructure access to markets and government policies inconsistency to reverse this trend and put nigeria s smes on sound footing still earth capital finance limited sel capital released its research report titled stimulating smes for growth sel capital is a multi faceted financial services company offering tailored financial services and solutions to individuals companies and the public sector it provides a diversified range of financial services including corporate finance advisory project finance structured finance smes support services wealth management and agency services its managing director segun opaleye said the report was the company s way of helping smes overcome the challenges facing their operations through insights to support operators decision making process and government regulatory agencies in their roles in making smes the bedrock of the economy opaleye said smes vary from country to country and they are defined by the role they play in the economy as well as policies and programmes designed by agencies or institutions to guide their operations though there are characteristics peculiar to them smes are mostly unquoted with restricted ownership to few individuals and they are not micro businesses that exist to employ just owner he said to fund their operations smes initially turn to internal and external sources of finance internal sources include personal savings borrowings from family and friends and credit from local cooperative societies but as business expands they require greater pool of funds than is made available by these sources to meet business financing needs the external sources of finance provide wider access to large pools of funds which are required for smes to exploit growth and investment opportunities he said smes can expand operations by identifying and utilising business opportunities with better access to finance structured specifically to cater to identified needs such funding he added will come from financial institutions such as finance companies commercial banks development finance institutions government grants and funds and venture capital funds according to the sel capital report a large percentage of smes in high income countries operate in the formal sector and contribute over 50 per cent to gross domestic product gdp they also account for more than 90 per cent of all firms outside the white collar jobs sector thereby constituting a major source of employment overview of the sme sector in nigeria the report explained that most recent micro small and medium msmes survey conducted by the small and medium enterprises development agency smedan showed that the number of smes increased by over 100 per cent between 2010 and 2013 from 17 2 million in 2010 to 37 million and contributed about 48 5 per cent to gdp in 2013 the msmes contribution to exportation also accounted for 7 27 per cent of total exports the smes also account for the employment of about 60 million people and have become the most important vehicle of employment generation entrepreneurial training and development in the country but they face daunting challenges hurdles before smes the report said about 80 per cent of smes are stifled because of poor financing it said the problem of financing smes is not so much the sources of funds but it is accessibility stringent conditions set by financial institutions lack of adequate collateral and credit information and cost of accessing funds which stem from the uneconomic deployment of available resources are to blame it said operators it said also have difficulty in registering companies even as constricted regulatory framework creates a hostile environment to successfully conduct business activities in the country issues around corruption bureaucratic bottlenecks and high charges tariffs are some of the factors contributing to the difficulty of conducting business for smes in nigeria the report said it added that poor record keeping technical problems competence and lack of essential and required expertise in production procurement maintenance marketing and finances have always led to funds misapplication wrong and costly decision making for sme business owners the report said smes are burdened with enormous multiple taxes and tax related issues which affect profitability smes are also taxed with multiple levies from various government agencies and parastatals which affect business activities negatively it said the smes also face inadequate infrastructure which ranges from shortage of water supply inadequate transport systems and poor electricity supply to improper solid waste management this infrastructure inadequacies lead to high operating costs for smes which often contend with high costs of imported materials and poor access to raw materials in local markets it added also policies directed towards smes are often un comprehensive and lack coordination linkages with other established programmes and policies as a result these programmes policies do not have the desired effect on smes lack of adequate data on smes also makes planning difficult and impedes confidence in the sector besides volatility in the exchange rate output and inflation often impact negatively on the business activities and operating capacities of smes smes dependent on importation of raw materials often struggle with exchange rate fluctuations and inflation also lack of access to modern technology and infrastructure to support this technology hinders the growth of smes in sectors which require technology to enhance productivity the report said global trends vs nigeria smes the sel capital report explained that in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd region united states united kingdom japan germany and france among others smes account for 99 per cent of all firms 70 per cent of jobs and generate between 50 to 60 per cent value added on average it said the oecd countries use special policies to spur smes growth and innovation by providing business environments conducive to growth adopting policies which encourage innovation and technology transfer improving access to finance and supporting development of strategic resources particularly technology for instance the united kingdom uk set up the british business bank bbb in 2014 to improve access to finance for smaller uk businesses the bbb works with partner companies including banks leasing companies and venture capital funds to lend and invest indirectly in smes it has supported over 48 000 smes in the uk with about 3 1 billion in the brics comprising of brazil russia india china and south africa smes represent about 90 per cent of total firms in the economies and create a buffer for high unemployment rates particularly in china and india where population is high the report said early policy making in brics economies has notably improved smes performance over the years particularly with establishment of specialised institutions like sebrae brazilian micro and small business support service smes in india are estimated to be about 42 5 million employing about 109 million people an estimated 40 per cent of the workforce the report showed that in transition economies like the mint economies mexico indonesia nigeria and turkey smes have been recognised as playing a vital role in employment creation and poverty alleviation sme businesses are the major source of income to low income households they account for about 85 to 90 per cent of employment and contribute about 50 per cent to gdp the smes account for employment of about 60 million people in nigeria about 84 per cent of the total work force but have remained largely informal without legal and financial protection survey carried out by smedan in 2013 indicated that about 96 per cent of smes are not officially registered and 70 per cent do not have viable business plans while 65 2 per cent of smes do not have insurance cover way forward for smes the sel capital report said although nigeria is currently one of the best improvers on the ease of doing business index more reforms are needed to improve the rating and create a more enabling environment for smes growth and development it said the improvements in the macro economic indicators gdp inflation and exchange rates and macro economic stability and regulatory policies will also significantly address some of the challenges facing smes opaleye insisted that deliberate intervention by the government is required to improve economy perception at the global view and unlock the potentials in the sme sector on poor access to finance he explained that to support smes growth the government and financial institutions needed to create measures supporting sales cash flows and working capital as well as measures enhancing smes access to bank lending on innovation opaleye said the sme sector requires effective innovative schemes that can bring together small enterprises in various industries to exploit the immense national business opportunities the government is also expected to actively encourage investments in the sme sector and growth of new business to generate employment and alleviate poverty the sufficient information on new technology and innovations will ensure global competitiveness in terms of product quality and pricing and improve export earnings from smes he said on infrastructure development he said it is important to create an enabling business environment where businesses can operate without limitations imposed by stifling conditions investment in the development of infrastructure particularly implementation of the power sector reform policies is also critical in improving the ease of doing business and improving productivity of smes opaleye urged the government to carry out institutional reforms by championing the creation of support systems targeted directly to offer support to smes existing institutions should be realigned to effectively utilise their service offerings to smes on capacity development he said smes require capacity building in areas of technical and management skill development to effectively run the businesses initiatives to deepen entrepreneurship capabilities among business owners will improve the lifespan of the average nigerian sme

red baiting appears to be a crucial part of president trump s reelection campaign he regularly accuses democrats of wanting to turn america into another venezuela in the state of the union address he went straight from denouncing the maduro regime to proclaiming here in the united states we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country on the present trajectory it won t be long before trump like a latter day richard nixon will be accusing sen kamala d harris d calif of being pink right down to her underwear having emigrated to the united states as a small boy from the soviet union i am instinctively suspicious of socialism and inveterately opposed to communism but it is cretinous to conflate sen bernie sanders i vt and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y with nicol√°s maduro they may all call themselves socialists but that s all they have in common trump s attack makes as much sense as suggesting that the democratic party is made up of kim jong un loyalists because the official name of north korea is the democratic people s republic of korea the free market economist friedrich hayek warned of this confusion in his book the road to serfdom socialism he noted may mean and is often used to describe merely the ideals of social justice greater equality and security which are the ultimate aims of socialism but it could also describe the means that some socialists used to achieve their objectives in this sense socialism means the abolition of private enterprise of private ownership of the means of production and the creation of a system of a planned economy in which the entrepreneur working for profit is replaced by a central planning body obviously sanders ocasio cortez represent the former strain of socialism and maduro the latter even if sanders has been foolish enough to praise venezuela in the past advertisement maduro and his predecessor hugo ch√°vez grossly mismanaged the state oil company which accounts for almost all of venezuela s exports they expanded the government by cobbling up more than 500 private companies and they imposed controls on prices imports and foreign exchange when oil prices sank maduro piled up debts and printed money the result is hyperinflation 377 678 percent and counting and an economic free fall worse than the one the united states experienced during the great depression along the way ch√°vez and maduro crushed the remnants of democracy rigging elections and locking up or killing political opponents follow this author max boot s opinions follow this is one model of socialism the same approach that has been applied in cuba and the soviet union but there are many other varieties that are far more benign france has had socialist presidents on and off since the 1920s and it remains a free country socialists have ruled in many south american countries without ushering in disaster sanders himself cites the scandinavian model the achievement of denmark norway and sweden is indeed remarkable those countries are roughly as wealthy as the united states on a per capita basis but they have less income inequality and a stronger social safety net by some measures moreover they are freer economically and politically than the united states they show that a free market welfare state isn t an oxymoron advertisement so there is nothing sinister about wanting to emulate the scandinavian example but that doesn t necessarily mean it s practical the scandinavians have lower corporate tax rates than the united states but much higher individual taxes according to the tax foundation the top marginal tax rate of 60 percent in denmark applies to all income over 1 2 times the average income in denmark from the american perspective this means that all income over 60 000 1 2 times the average income of about 50 000 in the united states would be taxed at 60 percent the scandinavian countries also charge hefty value added taxes of 25 percent on consumption the united states doesn t have a national sales tax and the average rate for state sales taxes is only 7 percent in all scandinavians pay 25 488 a head in taxes compared with 14 793 a head in the united states 72 percent more this is what it takes to finance a scandinavian style social welfare state it can t be done simply by raising marginal tax rates on the wealthiest taxpayers to 70 percent as ocasio cortez suggests because few taxpayers pay the top rate it requires a massive tax hike on the middle class there is a good reason sanders and ocasio cortez aren t advocating this it s unpopular support for medicare for all plummets from 71 percent to 37 percent if people are told it will require most americans to pay more in taxes we are far more likely to do what we have done before and add new social welfare benefits with deficit spending that s not the scandinavian way in those countries government debt averages 35 percent of gdp in the united states it s 108 percent of gdp and climbing fiscal responsibility is one lesson that sanders and ocasio cortez refuse to learn from the scandinavians that doesn t mean that they are trying to turn the united states into venezuela it does mean that turning america into scandinavia will be a lot harder than they imagine

caracas venezuela when jose humberto vivas needs to trade dollars for venezuelan bolivars he usually flouts the nation s rigid exchange controls by turning to illegal currency traders but last week vivas put a few hundred dollars in his wallet and headed to an exchange house regulated by venezuela s socialist government lured by the seemingly improbable prospect of an official rate that is more inviting than the black market rate i haven t been here in years vivas said as he stood in line outside italcambio a normally lifeless exchange house in downtown caracas protected by tinted windows and an armed security guard who inspects customers ids there s a long wait here and it takes days to get the money transferred to your account but it might be worth it said vivas who makes a living from selling dairy products little noticed amid the turmoil unleashed by the opposition s renewed push to oust president nicolas maduro venezuela s central bank devalued the country s currency on jan 28 by 50 per cent eclipsing the parallel black market rate the government now buys 1 for 3 303 bolivars while the informal market buys them at 3 120 bolivars according to the website dolartoday it is the first time the official exchange rate has been higher than that of the black market since currency controls were put in place more than a decade ago analysts said the controls were implemented in 2003 by hugo chavez the late president who initiated venezuela s socialist system and have frequently made the simple task of exchanging money into a stressful ordeal that involves searching for illegal currency dealers logging into websites banned by the government and sending wire transfers to foreign banks but as maduro s government runs out of hard currency amid an onslaught of international pressure and economic sanctions it is tacking in a markedly capitalist direction encouraging venezuelans to sell their greenbacks to the local financial system in a statement issued jan 29 the central bank described the devaluation as an economic stabilization measure aimed at controlling hyperinflation by undermining the black market analysts called it a desperate gambit to raise hard cash in a country now beset by severe u s oil sanctions that could cost the government up to 11 billion in revenue over the next 12 months without one of its most important sources of income venezuela will be hard pressed to purchase food and other imports potentially worsening shortages and deepening its economic collapse russ dallen ceo at caracas capital markets said dollars could now come into venezuela s empty state coffers through state regulated wire transfers from the estimated 3 million venezuelan migrants who have fled the country s instability up until now they have mostly used black market traders to an estimated 1 billion a year to loved ones but could be enticed into the official system if the official exchange rate stays favourable they are going for the diaspora dollars dallen said of maduro s administration the government is also attempting to gain more dollars from rich venezuelans and a few straggling tourists who use their foreign credit cards at the official exchange rate something that would have been unfeasible a few weeks ago but the strategy is controversial maduro s opponents argue that selling dollars to the government is tantamount to funding repression others say the move will not eliminate the longstanding spread between the two rates which has often allowed richer venezuelans to take advantage of the distortion and pocket juicy profits asdrubal oliveros an economic consultant based in caracas predicts the amount of money the venezuelan government can raise through currency markets will fall short of what it needs to remedy its financial woes strict requirements mandated by u s sanctions could also force some foreign banks to stop funding credit card transactions in venezuela altogether as bank of america recently announced the government and its state owned entities currently owe around 150 billion to creditors around the world while the country s foreign currency reserves have fallen to just 8 billion forced to meet interest payments on the few remaining loans and bonds the government hasn t yet defaulted on the maduro administration must finance its huge budget deficit by printing even more bolivars further accelerating prices last year inflation in the south american country hit 1 million per cent hyperinflation is a fiscal problem oliveros said if you don t control your expenditures and reduce deficits you will not be able to tackle it meanwhile other obstacles could limit the central bank s efforts to raise dollars currently it takes four days an eternity in today s venezuela for the bolivars purchased at state regulated exchange houses to be deposited into a person s account cash exchanges have been impossible for months due to shortages of bolivar bills reliability speed and convenience carry a lot of weight in currency exchanges oliveros said last week dozens of people trying to sell small amounts of dollars and euros at the official rate were turned away from exchange houses after trading was suspended due to a glitch with the central bank s currency platform it s so frustrating said adolfo estanford a lawyer who had hoped to get 20 worth of bolivars he said he needed the money for food and transport everything here is so improvised he said i feel like i ve been made a fool of ___ manuel rueda on twitter manuel rueda the associated press

just weeks into the new year north american equity markets are off to a strong start in canada the s p tsx composite index has rallied more than 1 200 points or nearly 9 per cent out of the 29 trading sessions year to date the s p tsx has closed higher 22 of these days equity markets are being driven higher in part by positive earnings reports according to a report released last week by refinitiv while only 10 per cent of companies in the s p tsx have reported their quarterly earnings to date more than 70 per cent of them have reported better than expected earnings the numbers are also impressive in the united states of the 66 per cent of companies in the s p 500 that have reported quarterly earnings 71 per cent have reported earnings beats meanwhile valuations remain attractive for instance the s p tsx is trading at a price to earnings multiple of about 14 times the 2019 consensus estimate well below its five year historical average multiple of roughly 17 times will the positive stock market momentum continue bruce cooper chief executive and chief investment officer of td asset management shared his 2019 market outlook in a recent conversation with the globe and mail here are highlights what is your outlook for equity markets we were more cautious last year and then right at the very beginning of this year we became more positive there are three reasons the first is while we expect global growth to decelerate we do not anticipate a recession the second factor we think central banks are close to the end of their tightening cycles third would be valuations last year equity markets broadly were pretty lacklustre the combination of falling stock prices and rising earnings meant that valuations by the beginning of this year had become more attractive what stock market regions may experience the highest returns we tend to think about four geographical buckets the united states canada what we call international primarily europe and japan and the fourth bucket would be emerging markets if we think about those four categories the u s has been our favourite market for a while and we continue to like it when we upgraded equities in january we also came out with a more favourable view of emerging markets so those would be our two favourite markets today u s and emerging with canada next and international would be the last what are your return expectations broadly for equities we are thinking mid to high single digits i would say we are in a little bit of a lower return world economic growth is slowing interest rates remain low equities broadly have been going up for 10 years i said equity valuations were reasonable i didn t say they were cheap they are reasonable are your return expectations based on earnings growth or multiple expansion i think over the next couple of years you are going to get mid single digit earnings growth it wouldn t surprise me if in 2019 earnings growth was in the low single digits but as you look out to 2020 it could do a bit better than that it wouldn t shock me if you got a tiny bit of multiple expansion and the reason for that is we are very firmly planted in the lower for longer interest rate camp what stage of this secular bull market are we in i think the cycles will be much longer today than they were historically this cycle has been 10 years the last cycle was eight years the previous cycle to that was around 10 years big declines in equity markets tend to be associated with recessions or put differently i think equity markets can continue going up over time as long as the economy is reasonably positive with canada we do worry about the high level of household debt as i mentioned earlier of our four geographic categories for stocks canada is third and certainly the high level of household debt is one of the concerns i think that will lead to slower economic growth in the country the other big overhang are the issues around the energy sector particularly the building of pipelines so i think valuations in certain parts of the canadian market will remain depressed until we have visibility on what s going to happen with pipelines which is why we are a little more cautious on canadian equities compared with u s or emerging markets in late 2018 we saw extreme moves in the market do you believe 2019 will be a volatile year volatility is normal in equity markets 2017 was unusual because volatility was so low there are lots of real issues trade is certainly at the top of our list the dispute between china and the united states is very important we do expect trade frictions between the u s and china to be persistent they could run for years and years and during that wax and wane a little bit what is a potential catalyst that could lift equity markets meaningfully higher when i think about our three themes central bank easing is probably the one that is most likely a catalyst we are firmly in the lower for longer camp we think we are close to the end of the tightening cycle it wouldn t shock me if there were either zero or one increase this year in both canada and the u s even more important is where the 10 year yield goes we do not see it going meaningfully higher from here the reason it peaked is because growth is slow so earnings growth will be slow the good news is if you don t go into a recession as we don t think we will it should p e multiples are there certain sectors that you favour within canada our canadian equity funds have been overweight on the banking side two themes come together there one is with growth slowing we think it s important to stay at the quality end of the investment spectrum that tends to be our bias at all times but it s certainly our bias now within the canadian context banks are very diversified businesses they have good exposure to the u s with many different earnings streams we think they meet that quality metric another thing in an environment where interest rates remain low stocks that have good yields and can consistently grow their dividends continue to be very attractive is the low canadian market sentiment a contrarian indicator suggesting upside for the market i don t think i have ever seen sentiment as negative as it is now in all of my years i think the biggest challenge for canada is that we are just not seeing a lot of global interest in our stocks i think that s part of what s depressing the price to earnings multiples the way i look at it it should create a long term opportunity i don t know if that opportunity will bear fruit in 2019 or if it will take longer i think the valuations do embed a reasonable amount of skepticism and negativity about canada within fixed income you shifted your recommendations at the beginning of the year when we upgraded equities we also upgraded investment grade corporate bonds and high yield bonds and downgraded government bonds this is fairly consistent with a more risk tolerant approach and the impetus for that was that spreads last year widened quite a bit on corporate debt what s your call on the canadian dollar we are cautious on the canadian dollar our bias would be for it to continue to deteriorate albeit modestly if you think about the two big negative drivers high debt and this oil challenge both of those will tend to impede investment with gold off to a strong start in 2019 is this a time to be bullish on bullion we are neither here nor there on gold we tend to view it as portfolio insurance and because we are relatively more optimistic now our feeling is that the need for insurance is not high do you hold a perspective that deviates from consensus i think we are differentiated in that we have turned more optimistic this year after having been more negative last year this interview has been edited and condensed

as donald trump rhapsodised on tuesday night about the unprecedented economic boom he is seeing across america central bankers in australia india and the uk were preparing to join a broader retreat from plans to tighten monetary policy hours after the us president finished his state of the union address in the house chamber philip lowe the governor of the reserve bank of australia stood up to warn of an accumulation of downside risks including trade skirmishes between china and the us rising populism and brexit the next move in interest rates could be down he said instead of up the reserve bank of india which has been under pressure from prime minister narendra modi to ease policy trimmed rates by a quarter point a day later the same day the bank of england ditched plans for multiple rate hikes their dovish pivots followed what was by far the most significant policy u turn to date a decision by federal reserve chairman jay powell on january 30 to shelve any plans to lift rates further because of possible risks to us growth the wariness descending over leading central banks is a jarring contrast to the buoyant mood this time last year at the gathering of business and political leaders in davos switzerland in january 2018 optimism was simmering with one survey of bosses putting confidence at its highest for six years the imf hailed the broadest synchronised global upsurge since the start of the decade with 120 economies enjoying a pick up in growth that picture has now darkened an update from the imf last month bemoaned the backdrop of weakening financial market sentiment trade policy uncertainty and concerns about china s outlook growth in advanced economies will slow from an estimated 2 3 per cent in 2018 to 2 per cent in 2019 and 1 7 per cent in 2020 it said global manufacturing activity is at a two and a half year low you are getting a much more sober assessment of global growth says mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz what has gone wrong the sea change reflects in part a realisation that policymakers became overly bullish last year says mr el erian the fed in particular over reached by signalling four increases in interest rates for 2018 when the global economy was still fragile he says its new found caution is providing air cover for other central banks to mark down their own rate expectations the key turning point came in the fourth quarter when markets suddenly began to wake up to a host of political hazards including the danger of a further worsening in trade relations between the us and china that tightening in financial conditions was enough to shave 0 4 per cent from growth in us output after six months says isabelle mateos y lago a strategist at the blackrock investment institute since then between a third and a quarter of that tightening has been reversed as equities rebounded but central banks still had no choice but to respond she says it makes sense to lift the foot off the brake the us domestic economy has continued to put in a robust performance with the number of new jobs in january coming in well ahead of wall street expectations and wage growth running comfortably above inflation but corporate giants in the s p 500 index which generate over a third of their earnings overseas are sounding the alarm about faltering overseas demand in markets including china where the government has been battling against a slowdown smaller us firms are feeling the global chill as well rob parmentier president of marquis yachts which employs 350 people in green bay wisconsin says that while domestic demand is firm the tit for tat imposition of tariffs has clobbered his international business it is not getting bad it is dead he says bluntly the addition of a 25 per cent tariff on us boat exports to europe has been punishing he adds it is twofold not only the tariffs but europe has never really come back from their recession the fed which led the world s major central banks in beginning to tighten in 2015 has been at the centre of the recent outbreak of dovishness mr powell presided over a quarter point increase in rates on december 19 but his attempts to couple that rise with reassuring messaging about future moves fell flat the danger sign came when equities were sold off after the chairman repeated well worn language insisting the reduction of the central bank s balance sheet will run on automatic pilot wall street s dyspeptic reaction to his words underscored to policymakers just how fragile market sentiment had become business confidence has since been dented by the record long federal government shutdown while brexit discussions have floundered moreover hopes of progress in trade talks with china have sunk as mr trump has ruled out a direct meeting with chinese president xi jinping before his march 1 deadline for a deal with us inflation as tepid as ever the fed has set aside recent worries about economic overheating focusing instead on what central bankers like to call downside risks rate rises are for the time being off the agenda indeed if the current ceasefire over trade is reversed analysts will start asking about rate reductions in the us were trade talks between the us and china to break down altogether accompanied by full blown hostilities with europe over auto trade america could be pushed into an outright recession according to deutsche bank its analysts further flag the risks of a sharper chinese slowdown and a no deal brexit the mood of unease at the fed is being mirrored elsewhere the australian central bank this week shifted to a more cautious outlook amid concerns that steep falls in house prices and the slowdown in china could choke off domestic growth unemployment in australia fell to 5 per cent in december its lowest rate since 2011 but there are growing concerns that a weakening housing market is hitting household consumption with retail sales unexpectedly falling by 0 4 per cent in december compared with the previous month evidence of the deteriorating housing market is on show every weekend in sydney and melbourne where once bustling saturday housing auctions now struggle to attract even a handful of buyers just four in every 10 homes put up for sale in december were sold in the traditional roadside auctions prices in australia s two biggest cities have fallen 12 per cent and 9 per cent respectively from peaks achieved in 2017 shane oliver amp economist predicts that prices could fall by as much as 25 per cent from their peak levels stephen king an economic adviser to hsbc sees good reason for central bankers to be treading carefully of 37 countries he recently examined only eight have reduced their aggregate debt ratios compared with the beginning of the financial crisis this means central banks will naturally be more cautious in raising rates he argues if you thought the crisis was associated with debt in some senses we are in a more vulnerable state now some of the biggest questions hang over europe the european commission on thursday slashed its growth forecast for this year to 1 3 per cent from 1 9 per cent marking down outlooks for major economies including germany it is now predicting the weakest expansion in italy for five years the european central bank has sounded the alarm about the impact of trade tensions and brexit only weeks after it stopped expanding its 2 6tn quantitative easing programme but ms mateos y lago at blackrock says she fears the political barriers to restarting that particular stimulus plan are too high for the ecb to hurdle warning we are worried the eurozone is not very well equipped to meet a significant slowdown in the economy one of the ironies behind the changing mood among central bankers is that the most prominent u turn has occurred in what is arguably the most resilient looking major economy the us bill dunkelberg the chief economist at the national federation of independent business dismisses sombre talk saying the biggest immediate concern for firms is a shortage of labour it looks like everyone is getting into a tizzy over whether europe is going to slow down or india or china he says that will have some impact for the us but i think we are getting carried away here mr trump who described the us as the hottest economy anywhere not even close in his state of the union speech would no doubt agree some analysts wonder whether having become overly hawkish last year the fed has now overcorrected the us is relatively less exposed to trade which in the past has allowed it to avoid importing nasty foreign crises to its own shores but as the federal shutdown showed earlier this year it is also a country that is prone to self inflicted economic wounds potentially destabilising battles loom in congress over the need to raise the ceiling on the us s national debt meanwhile the clock is ticking on mr trump s trade truce with china having been badly burnt by the market sell off late last year mr powell is determined to play things safer in 2019 by putting the tightening cycle on hold for a swelling band of central banks in other parts of the world there is ample reason to follow suit

new york new york u s stocks were directionless on monday with the main focus continuing to be on the china u s trade negotiations and the potential for another u s government shutdown there was optimism on the potential of lawmakers and the the president to do a deal on border security to avert a second shutdown while speculation on the trade situation continued to be relatively upbeat at the close of trading monday the dow jones industrial average was down 53 22 points or 0 21 at 25 053 11 the standard and poor s 500 was little changed adding 1 92 points or 0 07 to 2 709 8 the nasdaq composite rose 9 71 points or 0 13 to 7 307 91 the big mover on monday was the u s dollar which surged against all the major currencies adding to recent strength which has seen the currency rebound sharply since the start of the year the euro tumbled to 1 1277 by the new york close on monday while the british pound fell sharply to 1 2860 the japanese yen tumbled to 110 36 the swiss franc fell to 1 003 the canadian dollar was weaker at 1 3304 the australian dollar dropped to 0 7063 the new zealand dollar eased to 0 6733 only the russian ruble advanced against the dollar adding 0 17 on the day to 65 85 taking its gains for the year to 3 the ruble was buoyed by moody s upgrade on friday of russian sovereign debt
the state budget is about priorities there are constant demands for more spending but a limited number of dollars collected by state taxes when something is imperative like a campaign promise to fix the roads lawmakers have to determine what other areas of the state budget have lower priority spending interests hate this situation few will point out that some budget items should be lower priorities than others rarer still are those that point out wasteful duplicative or ineffective spending lawmakers seeking to find more money for road repairs should consider six recommendations that could yield over 770 million annually but someone has to do it so here are some areas that ought to get greater scrutiny from lawmakers in 2019 university subsidies while the state reduced its support for state universities from 2000 to 2012 it increased it by 22 percent since then even with universities getting more money from taxpayers tuition has risen and the number of michigan residents earning degrees is down so it s unclear what taxpayers have received for their extra spending adjusting payments to both inflation and the number of full time resident students would save 223 4 million great start readiness what should be a simple voucher program for poor people to afford preschool is a bureaucratic mess and layered on top of other programs to help low income families with preschool costs it s likely that the state is giving money to some parents who can afford their children s preschool on their own though the number is unclear this hasn t stopped the state from pumping more money into the program and without clear outcomes it ought to be pared back returning to 2011 levels adjusted for inflation would save 131 7 million enhancement grants extra money for pet projects has popped up in recent budgets there are other ways to finance these projects if they are necessary and their backers should turn to local governments or their own resources rather than the state taxpayer legislators currently write the bill language for these grants in a way that avoids the supermajority requirements that should apply the state ought to stop this spending and that would free up 115 5 million extra school retirement payments the state manages a school retirement system and most school employees must participate it promised employees and retirees 76 billion but has only set aside 62 percent of what is needed to fulfill those promises to both catch up on pension obligations and set aside money for benefits being earned by workers the state requires district administrators to give the pension system 38 percent of what school employees earn in 2012 lawmakers decided to cap that amount and have the state taxpayer pay for the excess in the latest budget policymakers spend 100 million beyond that obligation and this can be reduced doing so would shift some of the responsibility for teacher retirement back to schools the state would still be on the hook for the 1 billion cost of the cap employee premium sharing the state has required its employees to pay for a portion of their health insurance starting in 2012 health costs are a mess and the state has fallen behind private sector averages increasing the employees share of the health insurance premium to match private sector averages would save 55 million business subsidy programs the state takes money from taxpayers and gives it to the business owners it selects in the name of economic development this is ineffective and wasteful and it s an open question whether the programs are designed to give money to politically important businesses rather than economically important ones there is 144 3 million for these programs in the budget with more spent on other industry favors and administrative costs the state could also save another few hundred million by not authorizing more deals from programs through tax capture which sends state tax revenue to select companies instead of the state treasury the ideas presented here total 770 million in potential savings there are of course consequences for cutting the budget someone is affected by every dollar spent and someone will also ask for more but lawmakers have priorities they need to ask where taxpayers get the best return for their dollars the items above are worth a discussion as our new policymakers search for resources to accomplish their goals james m hohman is the director of fiscal policy at the mackinac center for public policy
washington ap president donald trump is declaring exoneration prematurely in the russia investigation he s tweeting that republican sen richard burr who chairs the senate intelligence committee has announced the panel found no collusion or conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign during the 2016 election that s taking it too far burr did say in a published interview that he had found no evidence so far of collusion after two years of investigation but the probe is continuing burr also indicated the committee s final report may not even reach a conclusion on the question leaving it up to the public to decide trump is also taking undue credit for the economy and falsely asserting a sudden turnaround under his watch claiming job growth from the twilight of the obama administration as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement a look some of the claims from the past week and the reality russia investigation trump senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this tweet sunday trump the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump russia tweet friday the facts trump is overstating it burr r n c did tell cbs that he could not conclude there was collusion during the 2016 election based on the available evidence after his panel interviewed more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than 300 000 pages of documents but burr also allowed that some questions raised during the russia probe could occupy the committee for the next decade if we write a report based upon the facts that we have then we don t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia he said in the interview that appeared thursday burr s comment was similar to what he has frequently said over the last two years in august for instance burr told the associated press that there is no factual evidence today that we ve received on collusion or conspiracy between russia and trump s campaign but that he s still open on the issue burr s comment last week was not an official declaration on behalf of the committee exonerating trump of collusion and the chairman suggested that its final report may not draw a conclusion what i m telling you is that i m going to present as best we can the facts to you and to the american people burr told cbs and you ll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that by whatever definition that s collusion the senate committee s work is separate from that of special counsel robert mueller who is also probing russian election interference questions of collusion and possible obstruction of justice by the trump campaign ___ economy trump we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the u s would be in a depression right now we were heading down tweet saturday the facts there s no evidence of a sudden economic turnaround under trump s watch let alone one that averted a depression the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but not out of line with obama s record it was just the fastest in four years economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated compared with 2016 and 2017 and most partly credit trump s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending the economy is on pace to grow at roughly 3 percent in 2018 which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015 when it expanded 2 9 percent under obama independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech tuesday the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess zz here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 of these jobs were added during that term and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers mary clare

by david haggith as happened with the first housing market crash that began in 2007 but didn t become widely recognized until mid 2008 the present housing crisis began exploding one story at a time last summer and this blog was perhaps the first to state that summer s change was the turning point from decades of ascent into a collapse in housing sales and prices i said the same thing back in 2007 and people didn t believe me then either the present housing market crash like the last was created by the federal reserve artificially pressing mortgage rates down then down further and then down as deep they dared push for years and years falling interest allowed people with flat incomes to keep purchasing increasingly expensive homes since people buy payments more than house prices housing prices kept rising as payments were kept in line via these artificial interest reductions the fed s ill conceived plan however was never sustainable prior to the last housing market crash and is not now i ve said throughout the great recession and ensuing years that sooner or later we d get to the point where the fed would have to raise rates and i ve said its quantitative tightening will certainly raise rates as much as it increase in stated interbank lending interest targets i ve also said that by the time the fed started raising rates housing prices would be unaffordable without the fed s artificially lowered interest therefore the market would have to crash all over again because all over again people would find themselves underwater on their mortgages and now here we are us banks have not started to go down but they are feeling serious pressure as this article will point out while eight months of statistics now prove housing is relentlessly falling with no hint of letting up as i wrote in my first premium post 2019 economic headwinds look like storm of the century housing market crash 2 0 is one of the numerous forces that will be knocking the us economy down in 2019 the rest of the global economy is already down further than the us the principle driver in housing market crash 2 0 is the federal reserve s great recovery rewind the downsizing of its balance sheet which tightens financial conditions this i said two years ago would cause mortgage rates to start rising one year ago and you can now see that mortgage rates did exactly that all of last year mortgage rates rose only a minuscule blip when the fed started with a tiny rolloff tightening near the end of 2017 even as i had said the fed s unwind would not likely cause any serious damage to the economy until january 2018 rates however immediately ramped up steeply went the fed doubled its roll off rate in january which was when i said the balance sheet unwind would start to have serious market impacts this has hit stocks bonds and housing the worst so far since the housing market is one of the major areas where americans store wealth and since it is an industry that buys products and labor from a multitude of other industries a decline in housing impacts the economy more than any other industry us housing market crash 2 0 here is the path us housing prices had been following until the market rolled over and here is a play by play of how the housing market crash has gone since i made my brazen summer proclamation that it had arrived on schedule june july 2018 average housing demand in the us was reported to have fallen 9 6 percent in june yoy while the number of listings increased overall 15 fewer offers were made on homes which is probably why the inventory grew in many major markets however inventory declined agents in so cal reported bidding wars were cooling down where homes had been getting 10 15 offers causing a bidding war they were now just getting one or two prices continued to climb or remained high because sales have to slump a lot before sellers become willing to accept the harsh reality that their homes in which they have so much of their wealth invested are not worth as much as they were as inventory rises buyers become more choosy and make offers on only the best priced homes rather than bid prices up as a result prices stall so do buyers until eventually their waiting overcomes seller inertia and sellers start to move down to find the more deeply coalesced pool of buyers in affluent areas however prices already began to fall in part this jolt down at the top was due to the trump tax cuts which funded some cuts by curbing deductions for mortgage interest and particularly for property tax that hit areas like manhattan westchester county new jersey and connecticut the hardest because of their high property taxes that had been paid on behalf of the wealthy via income tax breaks property tax bills in westchester county one of the highest in the nation commonly hit 50 000 per year or more on a quarterly basis purchases nationally plunged 18 in the second quarter august 2018 near the end of summer reports like the following started to appear for the first time in almost a decade we all think next year is going to be a tough year for real estate sales said matthew roach a property attorney in yorktown heights new york some buyers are saying look i m not going to spend more than 35 000 in taxes said angela retelny a broker at compass houses have to be reduced because their taxes are just way too high for the price range the state of the market is such that you re seeing dramatic price reductions every single day every hour pretty much she said bloomberg but it was not just high end markets that hit the skids farms in the midwest had been seeing rising bankruptcies for a few years and finally broke above the peak they hit in the last housing market crash the rise in farm bankruptcies however had little to do with mortgage rates or housing prices and everything to do with commodity prices particularly dairy however as goes the farm business so goes the sale of the farm more people selling in distressed conditions coupled to fewer people interested in buying into a failing industry equals tougher sales and so this distress was certain to flow out into declining sales and prices fire sales of land and equipment due to distress last summer are now well underway the impact hit first in delinquent ag loans in the upper midwest which rose when measured against the farm capital backing those loans to strike a level worse than what was seen in the pit of the great recession the kansas city fed predicted farm income would worsen into 2019 the trump trade war certainly isn t helping during this same time my wife and i putting my belief in a housing market crash to practice listed our farm in the hope of selling near the peak possibly renting and then buying back in at a lower price in a couple of years we hope to retire our mortgage so that we can more easily retire five years from now we both have jobs that are fairly recession proof so we re not too concerned about needing to grow our own food still if we can t sell at near peak value we ll happily hold on here since the farm produces relatively passive income we let other people rent agricultural use and do 90 of the work if things ever did go extremely bad we can grow a huge amount of food in a valley that always has abundant mountain water so we ll be happy to sell at peak value but happy to sit it out here if we re already too late to get that value september 2018 by the end of summer on the east coast some markets like connecticut saw a rise in people choosing to wait out the foreseeable housing market crash by renting even at 10 000 a month for higher end homes in hopes of buying low at the bottom of the market in a not too distant future several east coast counties saw rentals rising sharply as sales fell just as sharply owners also began choosing to rent out homes rather than sell them at a loss because losses on a primary residence are not deductible but if a home has been rented for two years it can be converted into an investment property so that at least the loss can be deducted from taxes they may have also hoped that by renting they could wait out the decline in prices todd david miller a vice president of sales at the higgins group said that of the 57 million in sales his team has done so far this year primarily in the towns of westport and fairfield almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach these are mainly higher end transactions and the majority of them had to sell at a loss mr miller said they don t want to put any more money into real estate right now we re going through this era of uncertainty and what do buyers do when the near term seems uncertain they pause people are just nervous that values will continue to decline and for that reason more people are opting to rent if they are not forced to buy miller said the new york times october 2018 new home sales were expected to start rising again in october but instead fell miserably 8 9 mom that marked the seventh month of missed expectations the midwest led the slump that month falling a hard 22 but the fall was bad in all parts of the us at this point median prices began dropping nationally too down 3 6 as a result of a backlog from declining sales inventory began to soar climbing 7 4 in one month sentiment too had taken a bad plunge by october with the number of people who said they planned to buy a house in the next twelve months falling by half over the past year sales of new u s single family homes tumbled to a more than 2 1 2 year low in october amid sharp declines in all four regions further evidence that higher mortgage rates were hurting the housing market reuters the fed crush was fully on november 2018 by november mortgage rates across the united states had hit their highest level since the great recession 8 1 2 years earlier as a result new mortgage applications across the us fell to their lowest level since december 2014 since refinancing mostly happens when mortgage interest is lower than it was when a mortgage was taken out refis hit their lowest point since the year 2000 so clearly the fed has crushed mortgage activity by this point year on year sales had fallen for eight straight months across the nation the west coast with seattle leading the earlier procession in sales and prices had long been one of the nation s hottest markets which is why i stated at the start of last summer the housing market s initial decline in seattle was a bellwether for the whole us market while my one crow on a wire detractor insisted i didn t know a thing time has proven my summer proclamation that housing market crash 2 0 had begun to be dead on with seattle leading the recession in sales and prices since that proclamation inventories in the region have soared due to a buildup from declining sales lending limits have increased due to falling prices and less assurance on the part of banks that collateral will hold its value or that repossessions won t be the next wave king county where seattle is located has led the decline to where the number of single family homes on the market has doubled in just a year since my summer declaration king county has recorded a bruising fall in just half a year the median price plunged from its peak of 726 000 last spring to 644 000 in november according to mike rosenberg a seattle times real estate reporter this was the fastest price drop anywhere in the nation over 11 in half a year a crushing reversal from years before when rises 10 in a full year were seen as evidence of a superheated market so doesn t that make this flash frozen fall the last drop that steep was back at the start of the great recession in 2008 not a time for housing anyone wants to compare to in southern california home sales in november plunged 12 yoy in california however prices remain above their 2008 summit and have so far largely resisted following sales down nevertheless bank of america proclaimed we are calling it existing home sales have peaked la times noted if volatility in the stock market and washington significantly affects consumer confidence and business investment decisions in 2019 the housing market could be due for significant correction into 2020 richard k green director of the usc lusk center for real estate told the la times he is very pessimistic about the housing situation in southern california green warns prices could plunge 5 to 10 into 2020 even with the current level of economic growth zero hedge things looked just as stark in las vegas by november where out of the 10 000 homes on the market 7 000 of those had not received a single offer a figure 50 worse than the year before realtors started warning sellers not to panic which in itself easily becomes a self fulfilling warning in the last few years las vegas had risen to become one of the most overvalued markets in the nation it looks like prices have finally peaked now that they have risen out of site on the back of low interest loans and now that interest is higher and now that the trump tax cuts have stripped away some of the benefits of home ownership in favor of a larger general deduction that goes equally to renters or buyers by the end of november the us census bureau reported that new home sales had rolled off a cliff new homes sitting on the market were at their highest point in five years and unsold supply per quarter was growing at an alarming annualized rate of 33 meaning should it continue we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in another sign the market has turned under housing flips have flopped in the chicago area the flipper boom has nearly gone bust with properties taking longer to sell higher interest on loans to acquire and repair those fixers eats up more profit and increases the risk involved in flipping homes with profits sometimes now shifting into reverse flippers are backing out of the market the number of homes turned around by flippers in the chicago area went from a high of 7 600 in the first three quarters of 2017 to 4 000 in the first three quarters of 2018 across the nation the number of homes flipped dropped 12 december 2018 the median price of a home in manhattan fell below the one million dollar market for the first time in four years and it took 15 longer to sell even at those lower prices again real estate agents noted that the trump tax cuts were making the situation worse but particularly in high end markets relief started spreading to the boroughs too most of brooklyn s trendiest neighborhoods saw more than a fifth of sellers pressed to lower their asking price and in the pricy hamptons home purchases in the 4th quarter of 2018 crashed a full 35 the biggest quarterly fall since you guessed it the great recession in 2009 inventory is piling up across the city and that s good news for buyers in search of a bargain for sellers with dreams of making a big profit it s time for a reality check bloomberg most of us don t care what banksters are paying or getting for a home near their wall street office but the massive year end plunge in nyc and its surrounds is further evidence that the fall in home prices is not only unabated but worsening what started showing up at the top of the market in the hottest markets like seattle last summer is now as i said would be the case trending down to lower sectors just as seen in the spread from manhattan to the boroughs this is all terrible news for my crow if he had any integrity he d cannibalize and eat crow of course neither crows nor trolls ever have integrity however for those who would like to become first time home buyers someday this is news to crow about how you look at it depends on where you re standing someone might even be able to become a first time home buyer in manhattan in a couple of years if the fed doesn t quickly spin on its heals and reverse its great recovery rewind as it is already sounding ready to do nationally sales dropped 11 in december but the most valuable thing about december stats is that we get a final tally to reveal how the entire year went a total of 5 34 million homes sold in 2018 proving the year to have the largest annual drop about 10 in total home sales since you guessed it the bottom of the great recession eight years ago business insider summarized 2018 as the year that the us housing market took a dark turn as homebuying fell off a cliff and mortgage lenders saw a steep decline in applications originations and profits interest rates are partly to blame for the slide in housing but that s only half of the equation according to analysts it s too soon to panic but a deeper drought in housing is bad news for just about everybody not just the banks significant housing declines have foreshadowed nine of the 11 post war us recessions according to ubs the decline has been broad affecting every region in the us 2018 2019 housing market crash 2 0 appears inevitable given how far off the cliff we ve already fallen and how fast we re going down and here is where home buying sentiment now lies so eat crow crow in short sentiment across the nation is as bad as it has ever been it looks like how people feel after they ve already fallen off a cliff how hard is housing market crash 2 0 hitting banks at wells fargo mortgage banking revenues fell 50 to 467 million in the fourth quarter while originations declined 28 to 38 billion jpmorgan meanwhile saw mortgage income fall to 203 million a 46 drop from the same period last year originations fell 30 to 17 2 billion fifty percent looking forward pending sales are a forward looking indicator due to the lag of a month or two between a pending contract and closing the direction of movement in pending sales tells us where we ll most likely be in final sales a month or two down the road november s pending sales told us that sales in january when all reporting is completed in february will likely be down to their lowest since may 2014 and december s sales which were way down in november s pending report already came in worse way worse than november s actuals falling a whopping 2 2 from where they were in an already bad november so we can expect january s to do no better once all reports are in real estate bimbos had expected a 0 5 rise in december of course they were also ebulliently predicting a warm spring market for 2019 and recently were forced by facts to temper their predictions in my opinion real estate sales people as a group not all individuals fit somewhere among the following groups for lying 1 transportation sales people car dealers and horse traders 2 banksters 3 stock brokers and 4 politicians graph by wolf street it s been dripping down down down nar chief economist lawrence yun said frustrating that the housing market is not recovering wolf street pending sales strongly indicate that housing market crash 2 0 is still fully on track for 2019 moreover year on year declines have been worsening each month since the start of october even though interest rates improved in november that to me supports my view that the fed has already gone too far to stop the damage even if it quits tightening altogether on a longer term perspective consider the demographics school debt ridden under employed millennials who are more into buying experiences in life than things are not inclined to buy homes that are in the housing bubble price zone neither are baby boomers looking to retire which often involves downsizing none of this bothers me because my wife and i have the best of all worlds very low fixed interest a home we bought at the bottom of the market last time around a chance to sell now high or stay and keep reaping the rewards of living in a beautiful place i benefited from the last crash i hope others are able to reap the same same reward by turning the next bottom into their blessing it s all about seeing clearly what is coming so you can sell high and buy low it is what can happen to those who see reality clearly and don t live in economic denial like my crow who could only see what he wanted to see in praise of his choice for president my lone crow on a wire who scoffed at a good call because he didn t like it now looks like the fool i warned last summer he would prove to be he has fallen off the wire because he hasn t a leg left left to stand on all reports everywhere have come in against consistently month after month for over half a year i m not advising anyone as everyone s particular situation is different just saying what i ve done what i m doing and why i m saying what i believed would happen and is now happening so you can weigh all risks and possible rewards for yourself in your own context and your own ability to take risk in order to do as you feel best here is a picture of where we are in our developing 2018 2019 housing market crash after 2018 we look about like this 2018 pushed us just over the edge into a housing market crash that is as likely to continue sliding as the house in this picture at the top of a bluff that is giving way and i ve seen places in seattle that look exactly like that canada housing market crash one major difference between housing market crash 2 0 and the last time is that this one is already global the last one started in the us and mostly stayed in the us this one is rapidly building in several nations because it is part of the bursting of the everything bubble vancouver june july 2018 residential property sales fell 14 6 from june 2018 to july but a massive 30 1 from a year before the 2 070 transactions that took place were the fewest since the end of the last millennium buyers and sellers were both reportedly sitting things out in confusion as to whether recent price gains would continue or whether the housing bubble had already burst as of august prices had not started to drop sales of detached properties in july decreased 32 9 from a year before and apartments dropped 26 5 in fact july s sales were 29 3 below the 10 year average for july much of the plunge was attributed to vancouver s new law aimed at shutting out absentee asian buyers that were ramming up housing prices while leaving the homes abandoned to become derelict in high end neighborhoods so the decline is in large part intentional but if declining sales bring down prices the dangers of falling prices to people who find themselves underwater and to their banks remains just as high the topping of the canadian housing market looked like this canadian market looks like a bus crashing into a brick wall january 2019 the b c real estate association claimed the huge drop in british columbia housing sales was due to mortgage stress testing in spite of the plunge prices are holding in the province though no longer rising since last spring inventory is building to a level that will probably force prices down by or before summer australia housing market crash australia is faring even worse melbourne housing prices have plummeted at their fastest quarterly pace ever recorded less than two months ago australian housing regulators were warned to prepare contingency plans for a severe collapse in the housing market that could lead to a crisis situation the australian market peaked back in october 2017 it s been downhill ever since with momentum now hitting break neck speed sidney prices are down 12 from their peak experts have been left stunned after aussie house prices plunged at the fastest rate of decline ever seen and there s more pain to come we have seen the downturn accelerate over the last three months at 4 per cent down in melbourne that s the fastest rate of decline we ve ever seen of any rolling three month period and sydney is virtually the fastest outside a really brief period in the 80s sydney s total decline is now the worst since began collecting records in 1980 one analyst has even tipped falls of up to 30 per cent based on the revelation from the banking royal commission that almost all mortgages written between 2012 and 2016 over assess borrowing capacity news com au the defaults will be cascading in soon while melbourne and sidney are in an all out housing crash other cities in australia are feeling the pinch too every capital city marked declines except canberra as in the us and canada the most expensive end of the market is taking the biggest fall first melbourne and sidney however constitute half the value of australia s total housing market so a drop in only those two cities if the plunge were isolated could still be devastating to australian banks hong kong housing market crash even the world s hottest housing market is in decline in stock market terms one could say it has entered a correction after its longest streak of falling values since 2016 the price of existing homes is down

when i moved here you had to learn how to speak spanish says wendy gosselin a translator from brighton michigan who runs her own business and relocated to buenos aires a decade ago now you go into a restaurant and everyone s speaking english not long after michael legee moved to buenos aires from london in 2004 the 34 year old management consultant opened the natural deli a market and caf√© offering organic fare the concept of health food seemed so alien one local woman asked what are you trying to cure but business took off and within a year legee added a second deli he s aiming for ten i don t have much competition he says sam nadler and jordan metzner who both graduated from indiana university in 2005 opened a downtown burrito restaurant franchise even though they d been warned that argentines famously conservative in their food choices would not go for tex mex two years later their california burrito company often commands half hour lines during the lunch rush for the first few months we had no idea what we were doing nadler says but he says the low cost of starting a business gave them the freedom to make mistakes now we re having fun trying to bring something new to the marketplace buenos aires seems to be a place where people come to figure their lives out says kristie robinson 30 who moved to the city more than three years ago from london and founded the argentimes a biweekly english language newspaper if you come with some money saved up you can live comfortably for six months a year you can pretend you are in europe here for a quarter of the cost buenos aires fair winds in spanish has gone through many incarnations and is reinventing itself yet again and foreigners are playing a big part this time too thanks to a weak peso that attracts people from all over the capital city situated on the r√≠o de la plata one of the world s largest estuaries has long been described as the paris of south america but lately people have begun comparing it to paris of the 1920s emblematic as the place where artists intellectuals and others from around the world pursued their passions in new york i was just trying to pay the rent all the time says seth wulsin a 28 year old conceptual artist who moved to buenos aires in 2005 having time and space is really helpful it s the greatest gift wulsin s first project there involved strategically breaking exterior windows at a former buenos aires prison then empty and on the verge of demolition that had held political opponents of the notorious military dictatorship that controlled argentina from 1976 until 1983 when elections restored a democratic government the circumstances that have recently drawn so many foreigners to buenos aires arose in 2001 when the nation s economy collapsed a main cause was a 1990s monetary policy that pegged the argentine peso to the u s dollar an anti inflation measure that ended up stifling the economy the resulting depression combined with deficit spending financed by international borrowing undermined argentines confidence and led to a run on the banks in late 2001 the government responded with limits on withdrawals prompting riots and police clashes in which dozens of people nationwide were killed president fernando de la r√∫a resigned argentina defaulted on its loans the peso plummeted and argentines savings were nearly wiped out but the country turned into a bargain destination for people with foreign currencies the exchange rate this past april was 3 7 pesos per u s dollar tourism at least until the world financial collapse this past fall has boomed with some 2 5 million visitors to buenos aires in 2008 up more than sixfold since 2001 it turns out that a surprising number of them are sticking around martin frankel the head of expat connection which holds outings and seminars for english speaking foreigners says many people moving to buenos aires have no intention of staying forever but aren t just tourists either the line between expats and tourists is not as clear as it used to be he says there s a joke usually attributed to the mexican writer octavio paz mexicans descend from the aztecs peruvians from the incans and argentines from the boats argentina didn t really begin to open its doors to immigrants until after it gained independence from spain which had colonized it in 1580 and made buenos aires a capital in 1776 with the british defeat of spanish naval forces in 1805 argentina s criollos or people born in latin america of european lineage began to seek freedom from spanish rule criollo leaders voted to depose the spanish viceroy in buenos aires on may 25 1810 today the cabildo the building in which the criollos debated that action is a museum that commemorates the may revolution it fronts the plaza de mayo renamed for the event and a focal point of civic and political life still many in argentina remained loyal to spain it took jos√© de san mart√≠n the native son of a spanish officer to organize an army and urge lawmakers to declare independence from spain which they did on july 9 1816 mart√≠n went on to lead a liberating army throughout the continent before exiling himself beginning in 1824 to belgium england and france today his body rests in a mausoleum in the buenos aires metropolitan cathedral steps from the cabildo surrounded by three statues of female figures representing the nations that revere mart√≠n as a liberator argentina peru and chile blessed with wide open spaces and some of the world s most fertile lands the new nation with its 1853 constitution modeled after the united states turned to england for capital great britain invested in everything from railways and banks to meat processing plants today british landmarks abound the dome of the 1915 retiro railway station was designed by british architects and made with liverpool steel and the subway system the first in south america was designed by a british company in 1913 one of the subway lines the a still operates with the original wooden cars but newly independent argentina was missing an important component people in 1853 the argentine political thinker juan bautista alberdi declared that to govern is to populate and argentina embraced immigrants most of them from spain and italy between 1869 and 1914 the population grew from 1 8 million to 7 8 million by 1914 about 30 percent of argentina s population was foreign born nearly twice the percentage of immigrants in the united states at that time today the hotel de inmigrantes where until the 1950s newcomers were allowed to stay free for five days is the site of the immigration museum the boca neighborhood near the old port was the center of immigrant life particularly for italians it s now a tourist attraction on sundays caminito street is lined with souvenir sellers and tango dancers during the boom years early in the 20th century buenos aires upper classes developed what some called a money fetish and emulated europe s aristocracy especially paris as a result buenos aires acquired its answer to the avenue de l op√©ra and a world class opera house buenos aires is a great city of europe giving the sensation of premature growth but by its prodigious advancement the capital of a continent the french statesman georges clemenceau wrote after visiting in 1910 and in a 1913 book about his travels british diplomat james bryce seconded the notion buenos aires is something between paris and new york everybody seems to have money and to like spending it and to like letting everybody else know that it is being spent not everyone was impressed by the nation s eagerness to copy continental fashions after he visited buenos aires in 1923 the colombian writer jos√© mar√≠a vargas vila called argentina the nation of plagiarism it is at any rate a walkable city of intriguing neighborhoods while the middle class palermo district has gone wildly upscale with swank restaurants and boutique hotels san telmo has largely retained the downbeat character favored by backpackers who stay in the many hostels along its narrow cobblestone streets tourists pack the sunday artisan fair in plaza dorrego another place where tango dancers show off and visitors can buy antiques handicrafts and jewelry almost every neighborhood bears traces of two of the most dominant figures of the modern era president juan domingo per√≥n and his wife eva duarte or evita an official in the war ministry in the 1940s per√≥n rose to power by allying himself with the workers unions and was named vice president but his popularity troubled the military government of president edelmiro farrell he forced per√≥n to resign on october 9 1945 and then had him arrested a huge march eight days later organized by union leaders military allies and per√≥n s soon to be wife led to his release this show of support empowered per√≥n he won the 1946 presidential election and went on to nationalize industries and focus on the plight of workers making him widely popular but per√≥n had many detractors and no interest in hearing from them a fact many present day loyalists prefer to forget he silenced critics imprisoned opponents and pretty much destroyed any semblance of a free press by nationalizing radio networks and shutting down opposition newspapers he also played a key role in making argentina a haven for nazis it s estimated that somewhere between 3 000 and 8 000 germans austrians and croatians with links to the nazis entered the country in the postwar period about 300 were said to be war criminals evita argentina s most beloved first lady often acted as a mediator between unions and her husband s administration and helped poor people through an eponymous foundation that built schools and provided medical care housing and food she pushed for women s suffrage obtained in 1947 she died of cervical cancer in 1952 at age 33 evita vive evita lives is still a common graffito in the streets of buenos aires her much visited grave is inside the duarte family tomb at the recoleta cemetery and the evita museum located in a former home for destitute single mothers that she founded displays several of her flamboyant dresses and tells the story of her rise from actress to powerful politician and cult figure juan per√≥n was toppled by a military coup d √©tat led by eduardo lonardi in 1955 but in 1973 he returned from exile in spain and won the presidency a third time he died of a heart attack in 1974 at age 78 his body lies in a mausoleum in the quinta de san vicente the country house he bought with evita about 40 miles from the capital the house is open to visitors on weekends per√≥n s third wife isabel who was his vice president during his third term led the government for nearly two years after his death then in 1976 the military ousted her the beginning of modern argentina s darkest days the post per√≥n military government led for the first five years by jorge videla and for another two by a succession of two generals imprisoned tortured and murdered government critics and activists as many as 30 000 people disappeared human rights groups say the military s invasion of the british falkland islands islas malvinas in 1982 which argentina had long claimed was a move calculated to galvanize support for the regime it backfired when great britain to the junta s surprise moved quickly to defend the territory popular uprisings and dissent within the army forced president reynaldo bignone to call for elections held in 1983 initially the elected government of ra√∫l alfons√≠n who died this past march at age 82 was inclined to prosecute military leaders behind the atrocities but under pressure from the armed forces he approved amnesty laws in 1986 and 1987 that put an end to most of the ongoing trials president carlos sa√∫l menem who came to power in 1989 signed pardons in 1989 and 1990 that freed convicted officers to close a sad and black period of national history tens of thousands of outraged people protested the pardons argentines soon began openly acknowledging events of the recent past in a pivotal event adolfo scilingo a retired navy captain became the first former officer to state publicly that the military regime killed so called subversives saying in 1995 that prisoners had been drugged and thrown from airplanes into the sea in 1996 1997 things began to change and there started to be an opening to talk about the issue says alejandra oberti of open memory a group dedicated to increasing awareness of the dictatorship s horrors in 1998 the city s legislature approved a law to create memorial park which would include a monument to commemorate the victims of the dictatorship after the 2001 economic crisis argentina lived through a series of short term presidents until n√©stor kirchner was elected in 2003 and served four years emphasizing human rights in 2005 argentina s supreme court declared the amnesty laws unconstitutional new trials of former military officers implicated in human rights abuses began in july 2007 argentina s current president is kirchner s wife cristina fern√°ndez de kirchner a lawyer and former senator she has promised to prosecute government officials involved in political killings the new political and legal climate has emboldened human rights advocates for so many years we had to put up with people closing the door on our faces whenever we went to ask for something said mabel gutierrez leader of relatives of the detained and disappeared for political reasons in 1978 her 25 year old son alejandro vanished mabel gutierrez died of a heart attack this past april at age 77 adjacent to the memorial park is the monument to the victims of state terrorism inaugurated in 2007 the site still under construction and due to open this year is reminiscent of the vietnam veterans memorial in washington d c it consists of a walkway with tall walls that list each known victim and the year he or she disappeared the escuela mec√°nica de la armada esma the most notorious of the roughly 340 detention and torture sites in argentina during the dictatorship years also serves as an unofficial memorial of the approximately 5 000 prisoners who passed through its gates only around 200 survived human rights organizations are working alongside officials to turn part of the esma site into a museum of state sponsored terrorism to see the former navy school a visitor must join a scheduled tour it conveys the horror of the dictatorship years there are rooms where prisoners were tortured and drugged before their death flights and rooms where women gave birth to babies who were then taken away and placed with families sympathetic to the military regime it was on his first day in the city that wulsin the new york city transplant came across another notorious site the caseros prison i had no idea what it was but i quickly saw how the building had this really powerful effect on its surroundings he recalls it spanned an entire block rose 22 stories over a residential neighborhood where most of the buildings are two or three stories when he learned of its sordid history and that the building was set to be demolished he conceived an ambitious art project by strategically smashing the panes in the prison s large windows he created what appeared to be 48 large faces over 18 stories wulsin s project now lives on in photographs and is to be featured in a documentary movie pablo videla a political activist who was imprisoned by the junta for ten years serving two months in that building praises wulsin s work precisely because it symbolized how inmates were kept in the dark the project he says seems to bring out the faces of those of us who were inside even popular culture has begun to probe the dictatorship years in 2006 a prime time tv soap opera montecristo an adaptation of alexandre dumas the count of monte cristo riveted viewers with a plot that drew on the repression i had never seen the years of military dictatorship talked about so openly says maricel lobos a 31 year old argentine who watched the show it was exciting television doesn t open new doors says oberti the activist these shows can only be done at a time when people are willing to talk about these issues buenos aires is in fact a favorite film and television locale according to official figures more than 1 000 commercials were shot in the city in 2007 and 2008 half for overseas markets richard shpuntoff a 44 year old filmmaker who moved to buenos aires from the bronx in 2002 works as a script translator and on set interpreter the commercials allow the technical people to make a living shpuntoff says so they can then work on smaller independent productions in 2008 the director francis ford coppola filmed tetro in buenos aires about an italian immigrant family in the city a local production company built a version of wisteria lane just outside the city where the argentine colombian and brazilian versions of desperate housewives were filmed and dutch producers found the city s landscapes so enticing they filmed a television series here julia s tango about four dutch women who work at a bed and breakfast in the palermo neighborhood haunt of the great argentine writer and poet jorge luis borges the city s speedy evolution is also evident on the culinary scene nicolas vainberg a buenos aires native left the city in 1996 and lived in the united states for eight years mostly in hawaii and los angeles working in the service industry then he sold his house in california and returned to put the proceeds into a restaurant and martini bar mosoq which he runs with his wife who is peruvian they serve what could be described as modern peruvian cuisine white fish sashimi marinated with passion fruit juice cannelloni made with purple corn a decade ago he recalls all the restaurants had pretty much the same menu by now he says the restaurant scene has changed dramatically as for the art world argentina s richest woman mar√≠a amalia lacroze de fortabat recently opened the door to her collection in a new museum in the old puerto madero neighborhood where the city s most expensive condos apartments and opulent hotels tower above riverside streets lined with pricey restaurants the fortabat museum houses works by well known international artists such as pieter bruegel j m w turner and andy warhol as well as argentine artists including antonio berni and xul solar the other major newly accessible collection the privately owned malba founded by local

telmo neighborhood tamara stuby is a 46 year old artist from poughkeepsie new york who moved to buenos aires in 1995 and married an argentine artist with whom she runs a program called el basilisco which houses various artists for ten weeks it s a fantastic place to live and work stuby says of the city despite the similarities of today s buenos aires and paris of the 1920s there s a big difference the internet for every foreigner trying to integrate into an existing arts scene there s somebody else with a laptop working out of a buenos aires apartment for an overseas employer tom and maya frost a couple in their mid 40s outsourced themselves to buenos aires three years ago from the portland oregon area tom does the same work he did before importing asian jewelry to the united states we really hit the jackpot tom says it s such an amazing place the frosts have four daughters ages 18 to 22 and maya frost says they ve saved money for their education by living in argentina we re spending much less money per month we live a much better lifestyle and we have more time to hang out with our kids maya says what s not to like maya became so enamored with finding alternative ways for kids to get an overseas education while bypassing expensive study abroad programs that she wrote a book about it the new global student published last month i was surprised by how easy it was she

washington ap president donald trump is declaring exoneration prematurely in the russia investigation he s tweeting that republican sen richard burr who chairs the senate intelligence committee has announced the panel found no collusion or conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign during the 2016 election that s taking it too far burr did say in a published interview that he had found no evidence so far of collusion after two years of investigation but the probe is continuing burr also indicated the committee s final report may not even reach a conclusion on the question leaving it up to the public to decide trump is also taking undue credit for the economy and falsely asserting a sudden turnaround under his watch claiming job growth from the twilight of the obama administration as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement a look some of the claims from the past week and the reality russia investigation trump senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this tweet sunday trump the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump russia tweet friday the facts trump is overstating it burr r n c did tell cbs that he could not conclude there was collusion during the 2016 election based on the available evidence after his panel interviewed more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than 300 000 pages of documents but burr also allowed that some questions raised during the russia probe could occupy the committee for the next decade if we write a report based upon the facts that we have then we don t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia he said in the interview that appeared thursday burr s comment was similar to what he has frequently said over the last two years in august for instance burr told the associated press that there is no factual evidence today that we ve received on collusion or conspiracy between russia and trump s campaign but that he s still open on the issue burr s comment last week was not an official declaration on behalf of the committee exonerating trump of collusion and the chairman suggested that its final report may not draw a conclusion what i m telling you is that i m going to present as best we can the facts to you and to the american people burr told cbs and you ll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that by whatever definition that s collusion the senate committee s work is separate from that of special counsel robert mueller who is also probing russian election interference questions of collusion and possible obstruction of justice by the trump campaign ___ economy trump we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the u s would be in a depression right now we were heading down tweet saturday the facts there s no evidence of a sudden economic turnaround under trump s watch let alone one that averted a depression the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but not out of line with obama s record it was just the fastest in four years economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated compared with 2016 and 2017 and most partly credit trump s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending the economy is on pace to grow at roughly 3 percent in 2018 which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015 when it expanded 2 9 percent under obama independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do state of the union speech tuesday the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess zz here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 of these jobs were added during that term and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 or two thirds did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31

forma to adjust for the impact of the company s corporate reorganization completed in november 2018 advertisement advertisement during the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately 24 000 shares of

2017 valuation related items for the third quarter included a 67 2 million decrease in msr fair values partially offset by a 59 8 million increase from associated hedging activities we continued to grow our servicing portfolio which totaled 299 3 billion in upb at quarter end up 5 from september 30th and 22 from december 31st 2017 the year over year growth was driven by 67 billion in upb of production and origination activities along with approximately 18 billion in upb of bulk msr acquisitions advertisement advertisement turning to slide 4 our investment management segment delivered pre tax income of 2 5 million flat to the prior quarter and up from 1 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 net assets under management were 1 6 billion essentially unchanged from the prior quarter end and december 31st 2017 on november 1st the company completed the previously announced corporate reorganization that simplified its corporate structure through the conversion of all equity ownership to a single class of publicly traded common stock after quarter end pennymac financial completed the acquisition of an additional bulk ginnie mae msr portfolio with a upb of approximately 798 million also after quarter end we launched several new products to meet customer needs importantly we launched a home equity line of credit or heloc initially directed to select customers of our servicing portfolio that will offer them the opportunity to tap into their home equity while retaining their current first mortgage interest rate we also launched a prime non qualified mortgage loan product also known as prime non qm to our correspondent clients to offer them greater flexibility to provide borrowers with the right mortgage product to fit their needs both of these products benefit pennymac financial through our partnership with pennymac mortgage investment trust which has the ability to securitize and invest in heloc assets and prime non qm products ultimately driving growth in our investment management activities advertisement advertisement now let s turn to slide 5 and discuss the current market environment the fourth quarter saw increased market volatility as a result of global growth concerns and uncertainty regarding the trajectory of the federal reserve monetary policy however the federal reserve recently signaled it will be patient in regards to any future rate hikes which has helped reduce volatility during the fourth quarter the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate was 22 basis points higher on average than in the prior quarter however at quarter end mortgage rates retreated about 50 basis points from their mid quarter high of nearly 5 in mid november and have remained at those levels after year end driving expectations for a modest increase in refinance activity credit spreads widened and finished the year 40 basis points to 80 basis points wider than they were at september 30th as the increase in volatility during the quarter contributed to a higher premium for risk assets this year so far however spreads have substantially recovered a healthy overall economy low unemployment and favorable trends among home buying demographics in addition to slowing home price appreciation growth are driving a purchase market outlook that is expected to grow by mid single digit percentages over the next couple of years mortgage delinquencies improved further quarter over quarter with the total us loan delinquency rate falling to 3 9 at year end down from 4 at september 30th and 4 7 a year ago driven by a favorable us economy high quality mortgage underwriting standards and strong home prices advertisement advertisement now let s turn to slide 6 and review the composition of pennymac financial s balance sheet pennymac financial has developed into a leading independent non bank mortgage company as a result of its comprehensive mortgage platform and balanced model with profitable production and servicing businesses each with leadership positions in their respective markets we have achieved this position by building a high quality balance sheet utilizing modest leverage compared to our competitors with diversified liquidity sources nearly 5 billion of warehouse financing and a strong capital base we have also put in place a financing structure that provides cost effective term financing for the largest asset on pennymac financial s balance sheet mortgage servicing rights with flexibility that provides the company the ability to expand financing as the msr asset grows our financial position is further supported by a well developed and sophisticated risk management and governance infrastructure developed and overseen by our highly experienced executive management team our risk management infrastructure combines our extensive market expertise and technology to identify and monitor risks across the enterprise our strength is further supported by the steps we have taken to simplify our corporate structure converting all equity ownership of the company into a single class of publicly traded common stock this reorganization has the potential to expand the investor universe and demand for the company s stock and increased pennymac financial s market capitalization from approximately 500 million to 1 5 billion now let s turn to slide 7 to discuss our development and utilization of technology throughout pennymac financial s history we have focused on the utilization of technology to improve and streamline operations across the enterprise our technology utilization strategy involves a combination of systems developed in house using the expertise of our information technology development teams along with third party technology that we deploy strategically we place significant emphasis on creating innovative mortgage production and servicing systems that drive both cost savings and scale efficiencies as well as facilitates new business opportunities advertisement advertisement this includes a focus on both enhanced customer facing portals and interfaces as well as developing automated back office technologies that help improve profitability and realize new competitive advantages let s start with pricing and margin management systems these systems feature greater pricing granularity and real time pricing updates we are also in the process of developing a sophisticated loan bidding system that incorporates statistical analysis and machine learning next is our servicing system enhancements this multi year project is nearing completion with a focus on increasing the efficiency of our loan servicing platform key features include the automation of certain repetitive tasks and creating efficiencies to better serve our 1 5 million mortgage customers with this project we expect that we will realize additional cost savings across our loan servicing platform in terms of origination and fulfillment workflow the key element in this technology upgrade features rule based engines and applications in development to streamline workflow processes across the platform finally in our enterprise risk management area we are currently focused on installing a proprietary risk intelligence system that will enhance our risk monitoring capabilities across the organization and strengthen our capabilities to identify and mitigate risks as they emerge with that i now would like to turn the discussion over to david spector pennymac financial s president and chief executive officer to discuss our operational performance during the fourth quarter advertisement advertisement david a spector president and chief executive officer thank you stan on slide 8 let s begin with a review of market share and volume trends across pennymac financial s businesses according to fourth quarter industry data reported by inside mortgage finance pennymac financial remained the eighth largest servicer and became the third largest producer of mortgage loans pennymac increased its correspondent market share by over 3 percentage points during the fourth quarter growing production volumes while many of the larger correspondent channel participants saw their volumes decrease production volume this quarter was driven by strong growth on behalf of pmt in conventional conforming activity from which it creates and retains attractive credit risk transfer and msr investments turning to consumer direct our market share increased this quarter despite a modest quarter over quarter volume decrease as the overall retail market decreased even more we estimate that our servicing portfolio now represents over 2 7 of all mortgage debt outstanding in the us at quarter end up from 2 6 at september 30th finally net assets under management in our investment management business were 1 6 billion essentially unchanged from the prior quarter advertisement advertisement now let s turn to slide 9 and discuss correspondent production highlights correspondent acquisitions by pmt in the fourth quarter totaled 18 1 billion in upb up 9 from the prior quarter and up 17 from the fourth quarter of 2017 government loan acquisitions accounted for 49 of total correspondent acquisitions or 8 9 billion in upb in the fourth quarter down slightly from 9 billion in upb in the prior quarter and down 9 5 billion ph in upb in the fourth quarter of 2017 conventional conforming acquisitions for which pennymac financial performed fulfillment services for pmt totaled 9 billion in upb up 21 from the prior quarter and up 54 year over year as i mentioned earlier this volume supports pmt s creation of long term investments in crt from the majority of the conventional conforming loans that it acquires crt has been a major driver of pmt s improved performance and the higher loan volumes that are made possible as a result also drive growth in fee revenue for pennymac financial total lock volume in the fourth quarter was 19 1 billion in upb up 7 from the prior quarter and 20 year over year government locks totaled 9 billion in upb in the fourth quarter down 2 from the prior quarter and down 6 year over year conventional locks totaled 9 8 billion in upb up 15 from the prior quarter and up 56 year over year revenue per fallout adjusted government lock commitment was 29 basis points in the fourth quarter a decrease from 35 basis points in the prior quarter reflecting our focus on strategically maintaining our market leadership position the weighted average fulfillment fee paid by pmt to facilitate loan production on its behalf was 32 basis points in the fourth quarter down from 35 basis points for the previous quarter throughout 2018 we have benefited by receiving incentives under one of our master repurchase agreements to finance mortgage loans that satisfy certain consumer relief characteristics advertisement advertisement we expect to cease accruing the incentives beginning in the second quarter of 2019 while there can be no assurance we expect that the loss of such incentives will be partially offset by improvements in pricing margins purchase money loans accounted for 88 of our correspondent acquisition volume in the fourth quarter up from 87 in the prior quarter and 76 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we experienced substantial growth in our correspondent seller relationships during the fourth quarter reaching 710 correspondent clients at quarter end up from 655 at september 30 this growth reflects our ongoing strategic initiatives to attract community banks and credit unions which can derive significant benefits from the broad capabilities of our platform including interest rate risk management activities and a continued focus on growing our non delegated business in the fourth quarter we originated 120 million in upb of non delegated correspondent locks up 61 from 75 million in the prior quarter monthly production volumes remained strong in january with total correspondent loan acquisitions of 5 2 billion in upb up from 4 8 billion in january 2018 interest rate lock commitments in january also totaled 5 2 billion in upb up from 4 4 billion in january 2018 additionally in january we launched a prime non qm loan product that utilizes a technology based underwriting solution now let s turn to slide 10 and discuss consumer direct production highlights consumer direct production volume totaled 1 2 billion in upb in the fourth quarter down 8 from the prior quarter this decline was primarily driven by higher mortgage rates during most of the fourth quarter which adversely impacted our refinance driven volume as a result revenue per fallout adjusted consumer direct lock decreased modestly to 356 basis points in the fourth quarter from 363 basis points in the prior quarter the decline in mortgage rates at the end of december held through january and improved the benefits from refinancing for many of the 1 5 million borrowers in our servicing portfolio increasing demand for both rate and term and cash out refinance mortgages january consumer direct originations totaled 357 million in upb while locks totaled 761 million the committed pipeline was up from 593 million at quarter end to 790 million at january 31st after quarter end we launched our heloc product in our consumer direct channel designed to support the financing needs of our servicing portfolio customers while giving them a flexible way to use their home equity to finance a variety of purchases or expenses while maintaining their current first mortgage interest rate by taking this step pennymac financial is currently the only major non bank lender to directly offer heloc product our wholly owned subsidiary pennymac loan services has begun accepting applications from customers in five states including california florida oregon virginia and washington and will roll out the product to customers in additional states throughout the year as we expand our heloc program we also plan to offer to prospective customers who do not yet have a lending relationship with pennymac now let s turn to slide 11 and discuss broker direct channel highlights in the fourth quarter broker direct production volumes grew 80 totaling 199 1 million in upb the quarter over quarter growth was driven by the continued build out of our sales force as well as the addition of 161 broker relationships during the quarter the broker market environment has become increasingly competitive in recent months driving quarter over quarter revenue margins to 75 basis points from 84 basis points in the prior quarter during the fourth quarter we made progress in expanding our menu of products and features to our broker clients notably we launched fannie mae s homeready product an enterprise paid mortgage insurance otherwise known as epmi which will help support broker production growth throughout 2019 in january total channel originations were 66 million in upb while locks were 91 million in upb the committed pipeline was 73 million at january 31st essentially unchanged from the end of 2018 we also continued to enhance the capabilities of our broker portal also known as power this quarter we plan on releasing several new additions to our portal the most noteworthy of which are expanded notifications that facilitate enhanced origination status updates between the broker and the borrower and real time visibility for the broker into the status of their loan pipeline along with expansion of the systems capabilities to help manage it now let s turn to slide 12 and discuss servicing highlights our loan servicing portfolio grew to 299 3 billion in upb at the end of the fourth quarter up 5 from september 30th and up 22 from december 31st 2017 the quarter over quarter growth was primarily driven by organic production activities in addition to the completion of previously announced bulk acquisitions totaling 3 6 billion in upb after the quarter end we completed an additional bulk msr acquisition of 798 million in upb driven by higher average mortgage interest rates during the fourth quarter prepayment speed in pennymac financial s own portfolio which includes mostly ginnie mae msrs slowed to 9 8 from 12 3 in the prior quarter similarly the prepayment speeds of pennymac financial s sub service portfolio which includes mostly fannie mae and freddie mac msrs owned by pmt slowed to 7 5 from 8 7 in the prior quarter higher mortgage interest rates also led to a 49 quarterly decrease in ebo transaction volume which totaled 495 million in upb in the fourth quarter however the decline in mortgage rates in december has since increased the eligible buyout population and has improved ebo related economics and we anticipate an increase in ebo volumes and contribution to income in the first quarter of 2019 now let s turn to slide 13 and review the investment management segment pennymac financial benefited from a strong contribution in the investor management segment during the fourth quarter driven by incentive fees that were earned based upon pmt s continued strong performance pmt s earnings increased significantly in 2018 as a result of growing investments in crt and msr assets during the quarter we also made significant reduction to pmt s distressed loan investments through the completion of 267 million in upb of previously announced distressed loan sales as a result distressed loan investments now represent only 8 of pmt shareholders equity down from 22 a year ago while pmt continues to pursue its core investment strategies of crt and msr investments it is also partnering with pennymac financial to facilitate the build out of its product menu to include heloc and prime non qm loans and expand pmt s investment strategies we expect pmt will utilize its ability to invest in securitization interests backed by these new products originated by pennymac financial now i d like to turn the discussion over to andy chang pennymac financial s chief financial officer to review the fourth quarter s results andrew s chang senior managing director and chief financial officer thank you david i will highlight some of the key trends and factors in our financial results on the next couple of slides we encourage you to read our press release on fourth quarter earnings for further details slide 14 summarizes the impact of our hedging approach on earnings for the fourth quarter and full year our hedging strategy is designed to moderate the impact of volatility and interest rates on the fair value of the msr asset in the fourth quarter we recorded fair value losses on our msr asset totaling 67 3 million which resulted from expectations for increased prepayment activity in the future driven by lower mortgage rates at the end of the fourth quarter msr fair value losses were largely offset by 59 8 million in associated hedging gains and 0 5 million decrease in the fair value of the ess liability while there was significant volatility in interest rates throughout 2018 pennymac financial s approach to hedging the msr asset was successful as we recorded a 34 1 million gain in the msr fair value net of hedges and the ess liability now let s go to slide 15 and review the profitability of our servicing segment pretax income excluding valuation related changes was 44 5 million up from 29 9 million in the prior quarter and 28 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 this core operating profitability of our servicing segment has increased considerably over the last several quarters and reached its highest level thus far in the fourth quarter of 2018 operating revenue increased by approximately 20 million quarter over quarter driven by the 5 growth in our servicing portfolio due to organic production activity and the bulk msr acquisitions completed during the quarter operating expenses were flat to the prior quarter on a dollar basis and down as a percentage of our servicing portfolio s average upb credit losses and the provision for defaulted loans were in line with prior period levels ebo related revenue decreased from the prior quarter as a result of higher average interest rates during the fourth quarter as david mentioned higher mortgage rates also reduced the population of loans eligible for buyout resulting in fewer buyouts and lower transaction related expenses interest expense decreased by 4 million quarter over quarter interest expense in the third quarter was elevated due to the accelerated recognition of costs related to the refinancing of msr backed term notes overall the core financial performance of our servicing business remains strong and we are confident that investments we are making in our operations to capture greater efficiencies and scale will deliver meaningful cost savings in the future and with that i would like to turn it back over to stan for some closing remarks stanford l kurland executive chairman thank you andy pennymac financial is well positioned for growth in 2019 as we continue to pursue opportunities we find attractive we are proud of both a firmwide effort that resulted in the company becoming the first non bank lender to directly offer its customers a heloc product and the launch of a prime non qm loan product in our correspondent channel we continue to realize operational efficiencies across our enterprise such as in our servicing business as our investments in technology and portfolio growth add to greater efficiency and scale driving improved operating profits we remain focused on further development of our direct lending channels and building out our product menu to provide mortgage solutions that meet our customers evolving financial needs our scale platform and ability to adapt to a changing market environment are reasons why we expect to be a beneficiary of market consolidation and continue delivering strong financial performance in the future lastly we encourage

washington ap √¢ president donald trump is declaring exoneration prematurely in the russia investigation he s tweeting that republican sen richard burr who chairs the senate intelligence committee has announced the panel found no collusion or conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign during the 2016 election that s taking it too far burr did say in a published interview that he had found no evidence so far of collusion after two years of investigation but the probe is continuing burr also indicated the committee s final report may not even reach a conclusion on the question leaving it up to the public to decide trump is also taking undue credit for the economy and falsely asserting a sudden turnaround under his watch claiming job growth from the twilight of the obama administration as his own that overreach seen in his state of the union speech and other forums extends to his boast about the shrinking numbers of people on food stamps likewise a surge in energy production under president barack obama ended up on trump s ledger of achievement a look some of the claims from the past week and the reality russia investigation trump senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia is anybody really surprised by this √¢ tweet sunday trump the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between trump russia √¢ tweet friday the facts trump is overstating it burr r n c did tell cbs that he could not conclude there was collusion during the 2016 election based on the available evidence after his panel interviewed more than 200 witnesses and reviewed more than 300 000 pages of documents but burr also allowed that some questions raised during the russia probe could occupy the committee for the next decade if we write a report based upon the facts that we have then we don t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia he said in the interview that appeared thursday burr s comment was similar to what he has frequently said over the last two years in august for instance burr told the associated press that there is no factual evidence today that we ve received on collusion or conspiracy between russia and trump s campaign but that he s still open on the issue burr s comment last week was not an official declaration on behalf of the committee exonerating trump of collusion and the chairman suggested that its final report may not draw a conclusion what i m telling you is that i m going to present as best we can the facts to you and to the american people burr told cbs and you ll have to draw your own conclusion as to whether you think that by whatever definition that s collusion the senate committee s work is separate from that of special counsel robert mueller who is also probing russian election interference questions of collusion and possible obstruction of justice by the trump campaign ___ economy trump we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election the u s would be in a depression right now we were heading down √¢ tweet saturday the facts there s no evidence of a sudden economic turnaround under trump s watch let alone one that averted a depression the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3 8 percent last spring and summer a solid pace but not out of line with obama s record it was just the fastest in four years economists generally acknowledge that growth has accelerated compared with 2016 and 2017 and most partly credit trump s tax cuts for fueling more consumer and business spending the economy is on pace to grow at roughly 3 percent in 2018 which would be the first time since 2005 it would reach that mark yet it barely missed that cutoff in 2015 when it expanded 2 9 percent under obama independent economists expect slower growth this year as the effect of the trump administration s tax cuts fade trade tensions and slower global growth hold back exports and higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow to buy cars and homes ___ jobs trump we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs √¢ something which almost everyone said was impossible to do √¢ state of the union speech tuesday the facts that s not what he s done he s measuring from election day in november 2016 rather than when he took office on jan 20 2017 since january 2017 the u s has added 4 9 million jobs not 5 3 million of them 454 000 were in manufacturing not 600 000 according to the bureau of labor statistics trump apparently reasons that employers and investors were so encouraged by his victory that they stepped up their hiring and investing right after the nov 8 election but the economy simply does not turn on a dime like that and trump did not inherit a mess zz here s what history will record more jobs were created in obama s last two years 5 1 million than in trump s first two years 4 9 million growth in manufacturing employment began in obama s second term when 386 000 of these jobs were added during that term and accelerated under trump ___ food stamps trump nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps √¢ state of the union address the facts the number of people receiving food stamps actually hasn t declined nearly that much since trump took office or even since he was elected in january 2017 42 7 million people were using food stamps that declined to 38 6 million in september 2018 a drop of 4 1 million not nearly 5 million monthly comparisons don t mean much because the numbers go up and down over the short term a more meaningful measure is how many people were using food stamps on average over the course of a year by that measure the food stamp rolls declined by only 1 8 million in the 2017 and 2018 budget years even that period which began in october 2016 includes a substantial drop that happened under obama go back to october 2015 the start of the 2016 budget year and the drop is 3 9 million ___ energy trump we have unleashed a revolution in american energy √¢ the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world √¢ state of the union address the facts that depends on what the definition of we is his claim is true in the unlikely event he was also crediting obama and other recent presidents who were aggressive about energy production the government says the u s became the world s top natural gas producer in 2013 under the obama administration the u s now leads the world in oil production too under trump that s largely because of a boom in production from shale oil which also began under obama ___ health care trump the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions √¢ state of the union address the facts his rhetoric is at odds with his actions when it comes to protecting people with pre existing medical conditions in reality his administration is seeking in a lawsuit to eliminate such coverage his justice department is arguing in court that those protections in the obama era health law should fall the short term health plans trump often promotes as a bargain alternative offer no guarantee of covering pre existing conditions government lawyers said in legal filings last june that they will no longer defend key parts of the affordable care act including provisions that guarantee access to health insurance regardless of any medical conditions then attorney general jeff sessions wrote in a letter to congress that trump approved the legal strategy a federal judge in texas in december ruled the entire obama era law including coverage for pre existing conditions was unconstitutional because congress repealed its fines on uninsured people the suit has moved to the 5th u s circuit court of appeals in new orleans in the meantime the law s provisions remain in effect trump has hailed the initial court ruling as great and predicted that it would go to the supreme court and be upheld obama s health care law requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones bills supported in 2017 by trump and congressional republicans to repeal the law could have pushed up costs for people with pre existing conditions ___ immigrants jobs trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration reduced jobs √¢ state of the union address the facts employment data suggest that the influx of immigrants helps increase overall hiring for the u s economy rather than erode job growth the trend is clear in the government s monthly jobs report the statistics don t distinguish between immigrants who are in the u s legally and illegally nearly 64 percent of immigrants hold jobs compared with roughly 60 percent of workers born in the united states according to the labor department last year immigrants accounted for roughly 40 percent of the 2 4 million jobs added because a steady growth in the workforce helps the economy expand economists say fewer immigrants would equal slower growth and fewer jobs falling birth rates and the retirement of the vast generation of baby boomers mean fewer people will flow into the workforce in the coming years √¢ a drag on economic growth which will in turn probably limit hiring many economists have noted that adding immigrants would help maintain the flow of workers into the economy and support growth ___ immigrants wages trump working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration lower wages √¢ state of the union address the facts the weight of research suggests that immigrants have not suppressed wages david card an economist at the university of california berkeley first studied the issue in 1990 by reviewing the arrival of cuban migrants in miami during the 1980 mariel boat lift this historical rush of immigrants created a natural experiment to measure what then happened to incomes in the local area he concluded the influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less skilled workers giovanni peri an economist at the university of california davis studied immigration into california between 1960 and 2005 he wrote in a 2010 paper that it had essentially no effect on wages or employment of native born workers but many people seeking to reduce immigration rely on research from george borjas a harvard economist his research found that the arrival of cubans in the mariel boat lift caused wages to fall for native born high school dropouts in miami other economists have questioned his methodology in addition borjas findings would apply to a small fraction of u s jobholders today only about 6 2 percent of whom lack a high school degree other explanations for sluggish wage growth go beyond immigration they include the decline in unionization an intensified push to maximize corporate profits growing health insurance costs that supplant wages and the rise of a lower wage global labor force that in an intertwined worldwide economy can hinder pay growth for americans ___ labor force trump all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before √¢ state of the union address trump more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country one hundred fifty seven million people at work the facts yes but that s because the population has grown it s more than doubled since 1950 and in recent months it s been increasing by 150 000 to nearly 200 000 per month births are the primary driver of population growth with immigration also contributing in 2030 that s expected to change with immigration overtaking the natural increase from births exceeding deaths as for women the big question is whether greater percentages of them are working or searching for a job than at any point in history and on this count women have enjoyed better times women s labor force participation rate right now is 57 5 percent according to the labor department the rate has ticked up recently but it was higher in 2012 and peaked in 2000 at roughly 60 percent overall 63 2 percent of americans are working or looking for work that s a few ticks higher than when trump was inaugurated when it was 62 9 percent but far below the 2000 peak of 67 3 percent the rate has declined partly because of aging as a wave of baby boomers retire but even among younger workers it s below where it was nearly two decades ago ___ border el paso trump the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives √¢ state of the union address the facts that s a distorted picture of el paso where trump is going monday to showcase his push for a border wall el paso has never been considered one of the nation s most dangerous cities in fact its murder rate was less than half the national average in 2005 the year before the start of its border fence the city has experienced ebbs and flows in violent crime but they have largely mirrored national trends and been under national averages for decades ___ border security trump the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america √¢ state of the union address the facts whether the border is sufficiently secure or not cuts to the core of a heated national debate but it s far from lawless the number of people arrested for crossing illegally has plunged in the past decade and is near its lowest level since the mid 1990s illustrating a substantial downward trend in the number of migrants trying to sneak in border patrol personnel detection technology and physical barriers have increased in that time ___ legal immigration trump i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally √¢ state of the union address the facts his policy recommendations to date do not reflect this wish the plan he proposed upon taking office would have sharply limited the ability of citizens and permanent residents to bring in family which he derisively called chain migration the cato institute which favors more open immigration policies estimated his plan would cut the number of legal immigrants by up to 44 percent the largest cut to legal immigration since the 1920s according to data from the homeland security department about 750 000 of more than 1 1 million people who obtained green cards in 2017 √¢ or two thirds √¢ did so through family relations trump s plan called for limiting family based green cards to spouses and minor children of u s citizens and green card holders a dramatic cut he s also slashed the number of refugees the u s will accept for two straight years and he wants to eliminate diversity visas he s talked about switching to merit based instead of family based immigration and said at times that he wants to make it easier for temporary workers to work and graduates from top colleges to stay in the country but researchers have said the net effect of his proposals would be fewer legal immigrants __ middle east wars trump our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years √¢ state of the union address the facts trump exaggerated the length of the wars in iraq and afghanistan the war in afghanistan began in october 2001 in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks the invasion of iraq was in march 2003 the u s has been at war for a bit more than 17 years also he refers to fighting in the middle east iraq is in the middle east but afghanistan is in central asia ___ stacey abrams economy abrams former candidate for georgia governor in the democratic response to trump s speech the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living the facts the economy is doing better after the introduction of the trump administration s tax cuts than abrams suggests the number of people seeking unemployment benefits a proxy for layoffs briefly fell to a five decade low last month and average hourly pay is running ahead of inflation ___ tariffs trump we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods √¢ and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars √¢ state of the union address the facts this is misleading yes money from tariffs is going into the federal treasury but it s largely coming from u s businesses and consumers it s not foreign countries that are paying these import taxes by cutting a check to the government his reference to money coming into the treasury now belies the fact that tariffs go back to the founding of the country this revenue did not start with his increased tariffs on some goods from china tariffs did produce 41 3 billion in tax revenues in the last budget year according to the treasury department but that is a small fraction of a federal budget that exceeds 4 1 trillion the tariffs paid by u s companies also tend to result in higher prices for consumers which is what happened for washing machines after the trump administration imposed import taxes ___ drug pricing trump already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years √¢ state of the union address the facts trump is selectively citing statistics to exaggerate what seems to be a slowdown in prices a broader look at the data shows that drug prices are still rising but more moderately some independent experts say criticism from trump and congressional democrats may be causing pharmaceutical companies to show restraint the consumer price index for prescription drugs shows a o 6 percent reduction in prices in december 2018 when compared with december 2017 the biggest drop in nearly 50 years the government index tracks a set of medications including brand drugs and generics however that same index showed a 1 6 percent increase when comparing the full 12 months of 2018 with the entire previous year the annualized number gives you a better picture said economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum a nonprofit research organization it could be that something quirky happened in december separately an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press shows there were 2 712 price increases in the first half of this january as compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier ___ wages trump wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible √¢ state of the union address the facts this is an unsupported statement because the data on hourly wages for private workers only go back to 2006 not decades but data on wages for production workers date back to 1939 √¢ and trump s claim appears to be unfounded average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers are up 3 4 percent over the past year according to the labor department those wage gains were higher as recently as early 2009 and they were averaging roughly 4 percent before the start of the great recession in late 2007 there are other ways to track wage gains √¢ and those don t work in trump s favor either adjusted for inflation median weekly wages rose just 0 6 percent in 2018 the gains in weekly wages were 2 1 percent in 2015 ___ abrams migrant children abrams in the democratic response we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart the facts the cages that abrams mentions are actually chain link fences and the obama administration used them too children are held behind them inside holding border patrol facilities under the trump administration as well obama s administration detained large numbers of unaccompanied children inside chain link fences in 2014 images that circulated online of children in cages during the height of trump s family separations controversy were actually from 2014 when obama was in office children are placed in such areas by age and sex for safety reasons and are held for up to 72 hours by the border patrol the department of homeland security s inspector general visited five detention facilities for unaccompanied children on the texas border with mexico in late june during the height of the furor over family separations and found they appeared to comply with detention standards the government watchdog reported that cleanliness was inconsistent but that the children had access to toilets food drinks clean bedding and hygiene items at the height of the family separations about 2 400 children were separated since then 118 children were separated immigration officials are allowed to take a child from a parent in certain cases √¢ serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns that policy has long been in place and is separate from the now suspended zero tolerance trump administration policy that saw children separated from parents only because they had crossed illegally ___ human trafficking trump human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery √¢ state of the union address the facts his administration has not supplied evidence that women and girls are smuggled by the thousands across remote areas of the border for these purposes what has been established is nearly 80 percent of international trafficking victims cross through legal ports of entry a flow that would not be stopped by a border wall trump distorts how often trafficking victims come from the southern border according the counter trafficking data collaborative a global hub for trafficking statistics with data contributed by organizations from around the world the national human trafficking hotline a venture supported by federal money and operated by the anti trafficking group polaris began tracking individual victim records in 2015 from january through june 31 2018 it tracked 35 000 potential victims of those there was a near equal distribution between foreigners on one hand and u s citizens and legal permanent residents on the other most of the labor trafficking victims were foreign and most of the sex trafficking victims were u s citizens of foreign nationals mexico had the most frequently trafficked ___ associated press writers mary clare jalonick josh boak juliet linderman colleen long ricardo alonso zaldivar ellen knickmeyer jill colvin and lolita c baldor in
