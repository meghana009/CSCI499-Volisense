haiti at a crossroads an analysis of the drivers behind haitiâ s political crisis ijdh org boston ma port au prince haiti haiti s government supported by the u s and other governments in the global north is plunging the country deeper into a crisis of brutal political oppression and even more brutal corruption and economic mismanagement haitians pushed to the breaking point by murderous attacks by government gangs and police grinding currency depreciation 37 over last year and the disappearance of basic public services are fighting back on the streets in the press and on social media the institute for justice democracy in haiti which has brought haitians fight for justice to the u s for 15 years just issued a report explaining the short middle and long term causes of this crisis which brings pain and fear to haitians who have suffered enough but also opportunities to fight for a more just and prosperous haiti â may 2019 i introduction footnote help there s 158 footnotes in this

text that you were reading if you have the real estate on your monitor you might find that opening a second tab of the footnote section might save some time haiti is in the midst of an escalating political crisis that has repeatedly paralyzed the nation tens of thousands have been taking to the streets to protest president jovenel moã seâ s corruption economic mismanagement and impunity for human rights abuses 1 while the demonstrations have largely been peaceful some protests have resulted in property damage and clashes with police have at times turned deadly 2 during the ten days of protest in february that placed the country in lock down at least 34 people died and over 100 people were injured 3 people were unable to leave their homes to access food water and other basic necessities placing an already vulnerable population on the brink of a humanitarian emergency 4 the current wave of protests started in the summer of 2018 in response to a deteriorating economic situation and widespread government mismanagement including revelations that senior government officials across administrations embezzled billions of dollars from a subsidized oil fund known as petrocaribe 5 the movement is unprecedented in recent decades in its persistence and broad support base that spans a diverse range of social sectors protesters are demanding president moã seâ s resignationâ a call that is backed by a coalition of political parties many civil society organizations and senators and deputies including from the presidentâ s own political party 6 the president has in turn forced the removal of prime minister jean henry cã ant which resulted in a parliamentary no confidence vote that ended cã antâ s tenure on march 18 2019 7 president moã se is now forming a new government for the third time during his two years in office 8 the reshuffling of the cabinet is unlikely to resolve the current crisis protesters are demanding systemic reforms to increase government accountability and responsiveness to reign in widespread impunity for corruption and human rights violations and to give haitiâ s impoverished and marginalized a meaningful voice in governance 9 to fully understand the political crisis it is necessary to understand how political failures over the last several years have set the stage for the current protests and how those failures are enabled by longer term structural injustices this report seeks to put the current crisis in haiti into context by explaining the short medium and long term factors driving the unrest including detailing some of the gravest human rights violations in haiti during president moã seâ s tenure in the short term the petrocaribe scandal galvanized civil society and was the spark that brought haitians into the streets in the medium term the movement is a response to the moã se administrationâ s broader abuses of authority and de prioritization of the rights and needs of the impoverished majority president moã se assumed office without a true popular mandate having been elected in a low turnout process that left him beholden to foreign and elite interests and a patronage network over the impoverished majority 10 in office his administration has engaged in human rights abuses flouted the rule of law and mismanaged the economy in ways that disproportionately impact the poor 11 in the long term this administrationâ s failures are enabled by years of flawed elections a dysfunctional justice system and domestic and foreign economic policies that have impoverished the majority of haitians the drivers behind the movement reflect repeated failures by haitian leaders to serve their people but they are also the result of decisions made by actors outside of haiti while the international community has invested billions in building up rule of law institutions in haiti 12 powerful governments and international institutions have also exerted influence on haiti to forge ahead with problematic exclusionary elections and to accept a system of justice that allows foreign and elite actors to operate above the law 13 the faults of the decades long prioritization of short term stability over rule of law are now cracking if the international community is to support a sustainable way forward for haiti it must finally take its lead from haitians and support systemic reform that will be long and difficult systemic reform is the only way for haiti to emerge out of this crisis into a place of true stability ii immediate triggers while the economic and political situation in haiti has been deteriorating for several years the mass demonstrations that have come to characterize the crisis were triggered by several immediate factors the first round of protests erupted in july 2018 in response to a government announcement to end fuel subsidies that would have sharply increased the cost of transport cooking and other basic needs 14 the following month protesters returned to the streets to demand accountability for corruption propelled by a social media post by a haitian filmmaker asking â kot kã²b petwo karibe a â or â where is the petrocaribe money â 15 the demand for accountability for the missing funds went viral on social media and sparked the mass mobilization in the streets that have continued regularly since in february 2019 while the country was in virtual lockdown during petrocaribe demonstrations the arrest and subsequent unlawful release of a group of heavily armed foreign mercenaries further underscored the ability of the rich and powerful to operate above the law and became another rallying point for demonstrations 16 a fuel price hike in july 2018 simmering tensions exploded into massive protests after president moã se announced a fuel price hike that would have devastated haitiâ s poor majority17 who are already struggling to survive on 2 per day 18 the price increasesâ between 38 and 51 â were required earlier that year by the international monetary fund as a condition of its bailout of the haitian government 19 president moã se responded to the protests by suspending the price hike and replacing then prime minister jack guy lafontant to placate protesters 20 but he did not take further measures to address the rising costs of living and predatory corruption that made the price hikes so devastating in the first place the failure to address these deeper drivers made the situation ripe for further uprisings ijdh director brian concannon warned at the time that â if haitiâ s government does not confront poverty and corruption more unrest will follow â 21 b petrocaribe corruption scandal protests erupted again the following month and have now coalesced around demands for accountability for the disappearance of an estimated 3 8 billion from the petrocaribe fund which holds revenue from a low interest fuel loan program from venezuela intended to finance socioeconomic development in haiti 22 official investigations have implicated much of haitiâ s political class including numerous high level officials throughout recent administrations in the corruption scandal 23 in november 2017 the haitian senateâ s special commission of investigation released a 650 page report that identified 15 former ministers and top officials suspected of corruption and misappropriation of the public funds resulting in the loss of 1 7 billion 24 from may 2011 to january 2016 president moã seâ s predecessor and patron president michel martelly allegedly spent about 1 256 billion of the 1 7 billion 74 of all the money the haitian government took over a decade from the petrocaribe fund to finance projects that were either not finished or never started 25 president moã se is also personally implicated accused of overbilling the government on a 100 000 contract to install solar lamps back in 2013 26 the implication of so many high level officials in and close to this government has thwarted accountability at every level of government even within supposedly autonomous agencies 27 at the legislative level the senate obstructed investigations by blocking a vote on the commission report for four months 28 senators with the majority party then passed a resolution condemning the report as politically motivated in a clandestine session convened after opposition senators had left the building 29 in a move described as â exposing the cowardice of the senateâ the resolution referred the dossier to the cour superieur des comptes et du contentieux administratif cscca a governmental body that had already signed off on the contracts in questions at the time they were awarded 30 the cscca did issue an audit report in january 2019 that appears to be a serious attempt to advance the investigation 31 the report demonstrated that many state entities are delaying or denying the cooperation that the cscca needs to complete its work because of this the cscca only addressed projects where it had enough information in april 2019 the cscca announced that a follow up report was further delayed due to inadequate resources to complete the investigation 32 at the executive level president moã se unlawfully fired the director of ucref the financial crimes unit that produced an investigative report during the 2016 elections implicating president moã se in money laundering and replaced him with an unlawful â interimâ director more favorable to moã se 33 the new parliament dominated by president moã seâ s allies then passed a law that granted the executive de facto control over the entity greatly undermining its independence 34 finally at the judicial level criminal prosecutions have been slow to advance as of october 2018 private citizens had filed over 60 complaints in court which are now before an investigative judge assigned to the matter 35 according to a march 26 2019 statement from civil society group fondasyon je klere the judge ordered the freezing of bank accounts associated with some of the individuals and companies implicated in the scandal including haitiâ s former prime minister laurent lamothe and several former ministers 36 but no officials have been held criminally accountable for wrongdoing related to petrocaribe to date 37 civil society is pushing for accountability from the streets in haiti to social media around the world 38 massive protests were held in august november and december 2018 and february 2019 and are expected to continue president moã se has mostly responded to the protests with silence declining to address the concerns of the opposition during the ten day lockdown in february he waited until day four to issue a five minute statement that was widely criticized for lacking in substance 39 c arrest and release of foreign mercenaries at the height of the february protests the arrest and subsequent unlawful release to the united states of seven heavily armed foreign mercenaries further roiled the nation 40 haitian police intercepted the men in an unlicensed vehicle with a cache of automatic rifles and pistols outside the central bank 41 the men allegedly told the police they were â on a government mission â 42 they were arrested on weapons trafficking charges and held in haitian jail on the order of the minister of justice a close ally of president moã se they were later transferred into u s custody and taken to miami where u s authorities released them without charge 43 one of the men involved ex navy seal chris osman publicly lauded the release operation in a social media post stating â i have seen the weight of the u s government at work and itâ s a glorious thing â 44 while many of the details remain murky subsequent journalistic investigations suggest that the men were in haiti to provide security for a haitian businessman with close ties to the president who was moving 80 million from the petrocaribe fund into an account that the president controls in order to further consolidate power 45 osman has publicly contested this account countering that the groupâ s understanding of the mission was to provide security protection during the signing of a multimillion dollar infrastructure contract 46 while the true motives may not be known the incident eerily evocative of the u s marine occupation of haiti in 1914 that started with a seizure of haitiâ s gold reserves at the central bank47 sowed further anxiety at a time of intense insecurity in haiti the u s governmentâ s interference with the haitian justice system sparked particular outrage 48 and contravened the u s â s own policy of not intervening when u s citizens are before the haitian criminal justice system 49 as the bureau des avocats internationaux wrote in a letter to the u s ambassador denouncing the interference the action undermined stability sovereignty and the rule of law 50 it was a vivid reminder of the ways in which power interests operate above the law in haiti thus adding fuel to an already roiling fire iii medium term factors while the petrocaribe scandal has served as a catalyst for the recent protests the mobilization is also driven by a broader rejection of the moã se administrationâ s governance president moã se has lacked a popular mandate from the start and further alienated haitians through economic mismanagement and violent abuses of authority a lack of popular mandate beyond the immediate triggers haitiâ s political crisis can be traced back to the electoral process that brought president moã se into power 51 president moã se was elected in 2016 in the lowest voter turnout elections since the end of the duvalier dictatorship in 1987 52 the presidential elections took place during a protracted election cycle characterized by widespread fraud and violence much of it committed by president moã seâ s phtk party and its allies 53 fraud in the first attempt at the presidential elections forced a redo 54 the second time only about 20 of the eligible population voted due to a combination of disenfranchisement and disillusionment with the electoral system 55 president moã se received only 600 000 votes in a country of 10 million 56 the electoral machinations of president moã se and his party put him in haitiâ s national palace but without much popular support without a popular mandate to govern president moã se and his appointees have instead relied on a patronage network to support them 57 in order to maintain this network of supporters the government diverts funds from the treasury and from social programs resulting in further economic problems for an already impoverished country 58 president moã se has been accused of prioritizing the wishes of the powerful rather than policies to support the masses and has turned to repression to consolidate power in turn spurring further protests 59 b economic mismanagement the current protest movement is also a response to the moã se administrationâ s grave economic mismanagement which has had devastating consequences for the majority of haitians who are poor in order to feed its patronage machine the administration has both borrowed and printed substantial sums of money leading to a record deficit extreme inflation and sharp currency depreciation 60 the governmentâ s budget deficit has grown to a record 89 6 million since october and the national budget is nine months late 61 the haitian gourde has lost 37 of its value in the last year and in february inflation reached 17 after years in double digits 62 the moã se administrationâ s mismanagement has also hampered the release of international development assistance for example due to a flawed negotiation of a multi billion dollar toussaint louverture airport revitalization project agreement with the industrial and commercial bank of china that violated the regulations on interest rates imposed by the imf and world bank the haitian government has been forced to abandon the project and has failed to recoup 42 million already invested in it 63 furthermore the inter american development bank decided to suspend the disbursement of a 41 million grant for the construction of buildings to expand the caracol industrial park because of management problems including safety security and the high price of electricity 64 moreover the imf agreement with the haitian government of a three year loan of us 229 million negotiated in march is currently on hold and has not yet been put before the imf executive board for discussion and decision due to the current political situation in haiti and the governmentâ s failure to introduce its budget 65 meanwhile the haitian governmentâ s absence in major international conversations regarding the countryâ s development has stifled international investment for example in february 2018 the haitian government canceled its participation in a un high level donor retreat regarding infrastructure to address the ongoing cholera epidemic in protest of a united nations mission for justice support in haiti minujusth statement that welcomed the assignment of investigative judges in the petrocaribe court cases 66 as a result of the economic mismanagement millions of haitians who were living on the edge of desperation have fallen off that edge in recent years families cannot eat send their children to school or access the most basic healthcare 67 the countryâ s economic malaise has even started reaching the middle and upper classes of society 68 outside of haiti the u s governmentâ s termination of temporary protected status for haitians in the united states has threatened to return 50 000 people to haiti69 and put an end to remittances that support an estimated 250 000 family members in haiti 70 remittances from abroad makes up 25 of haitiâ s national income 71 the desperate economic situation further explains why the petrocaribe corruption scandal has triggered such a mass mobilization c impunity for human rights abuses president moã seâ s implication in human rights violations direct misuse of state institutions for his personal interest and inadequate responses to abuses by others have further eroded confidence in his leadership and have intensified the current crisis president moã se oversees a government responsible for grave human rights violations including extrajudicial killings violent evictions and police abuses the state sponsored violence has targeted the poor and vulnerable and has been used to suppress the opposition movement and consolidate power for president moã se abuses have largely been carried out with impunity and victims have been unable to obtain legal recourse in violation of their rights the moã se administration has responded to brutal rights violations with silence in haiti while vehemently rejecting concerns from abroad president moã se pushed out the unâ s chief officer in haiti in 2018 after she spoke out on corruption and more recently the administration responded publicly to a march 2019 letter from 104 members of the u s congress stating that it â categorically denies all allegations of human rights violations â 72 the following examples illustrate both the governmentâ s rights abuses and impunity la saline massacre on november 13 2018 in the days leading up to long planned nationwide protests armed gangs carried out a brutal government sanctioned massacre in la saline a longtime convening spot for anti government protests 73 assailants killed at least 71 people including women and children raped at least 11 women and looted more than 150 homes making this one of haitiâ s worst massacres since the fall of the duvalier dictatorship in 1986 74 the assailants allegedly went house to house with long guns and machetes pulled unarmed civilians into the alleys and killed them with single shots or machete blows 75 most bodies were burned or disposed in trash piles and fed to pigs 76 images of the aftermath circulated on social media and shook the nation following the massacre approximately 300 people fled la saline and at the time of writing dozens of families are still living in a makeshift camp across from the parliament without any government support 77 investigations by rights groups including the national human rights defense network rnddh concluded that the la saline massacre was perpetrated by gangs operating with the support and involvement of government forces 78 witnesses reported that perpetrators were transported to the areas in police vehicles and that some wore official police uniforms 79 la saline residents also implicated government officials in orchestrating the massacre claiming the attack was organized to retaliate against the neighborhoodâ s involvement in the anti government protests that had been planned for november 18 80 a galil automatic rifle used by a gang in the assault was traced to haitiâ s national palace 81 despite the scale and horror of the atrocities president moã se has not formally condemned the killings and victims have not been provided protection or support 82 a declaration signed by a diverse group of civil society groups calling for an independent investigation and protection and remedies for victims has gone unanswered 83 following a lengthy investigation the judicial police dcpj released a report in may that recommends the arrest of 70 people in connection with the massacre 84 the list includes two senior government officials joseph pierre richard duplan president moã seâ s representative for the west region that includes la saline and fednel monchã ry the director general of the interior ministry who are accused of supporting two gang leaders in the planning of the massacre 85 accounts differ as to how many arrests have been made in the case 86 minujusth is also conducting its own investigation but as of may 2019 it has not released any findings 87 in the meantime la saline and other poor neighborhoods that are centers of anti government organizing continue to suffer attacks by gangs associated with the government 88 on may 7 seven human rights organizations denounced a reported plan to assassinate rnddh executive director pierre esperance in retaliation for rnddhâ s work on the la saline massacre 89 use of police to repress protesters reports indicate that president moã se has attempted to directly and improperly control haitian national police hnp units human rights groups have criticized the widespread deployment of palace security units which are supposed to be restricted to the palace grounds and the presidentâ s vicinity 90 in the days preceding the october 17 2018 protests president moã se personally visited hnp stations around port au prince without top leadership present and reportedly handed out envelopes with cash to officers encouraging them to take action to quell the protests 91 meanwhile un investigations found the police responsible for 57 human rights violations during the october protests including three summary executions and 47 cases of excessive use of force 92 in the subsequent november 2018 protests the un recorded another six deaths and 21 injuries at the hands of police 93 human rights groups fear that the governmentâ s increasingly rapid revival of the notoriously brutal forces armees dâ haã ti fadh which was disbanded in 1995 after a long history of involvement in coups violent repression and drug trafficking is intended to provide the president with another tool to limit political dissent president moã se formally announced the re establishment of the fadh in november 2017 94 he appointed a high command in march 2018 comprised of majors or colonels in the former fadh 95 in january 2019 the army opened its training center and in april it graduated its first class of 250 soldiers 96 violent evictions in pã lerin 5 in july 2018 government actors illegally and violently evicted families living in the area adjacent to president moã seâ s residence 97 following a request from the director of the general directorate of taxes the head prosecutor in port au prince sent illegal instructions to the hnp west department director to drive inhabitants of pã lerin 5 away from the area by any means whatsoever 98 following this order in the presence of 50 to 60 police officers a tractor bearing the logo of the city hall of tabarre destroyed the homes of seven families 99 the demolition of some of the houses took place at night without any warning for the families inside the homes 100 twenty two people including 10 children were rendered homeless 101 the government originally marked 36 homes for demolition102 and only abandoned the destruction when neighbors exited their homes and protested 103 those families living in marked homes continue to live in fear not knowing if and when their homes will also be destroyed police also arrested one of the residents and his cousin during the demolition the two were imprisoned and released the next day in the middle of the night these arbitrary arrests and detentions without a warrant and in the absence of judicial proceedings amounted to further intimidation tactics against the residents of pã lerin 5 victimsâ representatives have filed complaints with the chief inspector of the hnp and the superior council of the judiciary 104 the head prosecutor who issued the destruction orders is a member of the superior council of the judiciary however making a fair process unlikely at the time of writing none of the complaints filed have been acted on by haitian authorities grand ravine massacre on november 13 2017 the haitian national police and minujusth carried out a joint anti gang raid in grand ravine an impoverished neighborhood of port au prince that ended in the summary execution of at least nine civilians on a school campus 105 the operation involved hundreds of police officers and was planned and executed jointly with minujusth to root out gang activity following months of increased violence 106 grand ravine is known as a gang controlled neighborhood of port au prince 107 according to reports the police sought to capture gang members hiding in a school when two police were shot 108 chaos ensued and civilians including teachers at the school who tried to calm police were beaten and shot point blank in the head 109 key government officials and institutions have avoided taking responsibility for the incident and no convictions have followed 110 the police inspector general completed investigations in 2017 and passed them on to an investigative judge who has the authority to issue arrest warrants and question witnesses 111 the port au prince police director alain auguste who ordered the operation was replaced 112 families of nine victims including those of the two 2 police officers received a one time payment of about 1 500 for funeral expenses 113 but over a year and a half later despite assurances that penal sanctions would follow police investigations 114 no judicial measures have been taken to hold those involved accountable 115 an independent journalist vladimir legagneur who was investigating the killings disappeared in grand ravine on march 14 2018 116 mr legagneur is presumed dead 117 following persistent calls for justice from international and local media groups authorities arrested several individuals in connection with the disappearance 118 the un has also evaded responsibility denying direct involvement in the massacre 119 the un spokeswoman sophie boutaud de la combe claimed that â the reported civilian death were not part of the planned operation but of a unilateral action conducted by some officers after the conclusion of the operation â 120 the international community including the un have failed to meaningfully support calls for accountability for moã se administration in january 2017 minujusth issued a statement urging an investigation into the grand ravine massacre and welcoming the assignment of an investigative judge to the petrocaribe case 121 the foreign minister responded by condemning the unâ s statements and in an attempt to demonstrate the unâ s lackluster efforts to tackle corruption human rights abuses and impunity in the country president moã se withdrew its ambassador to the un and summoned the secretary generalâ s special representative in haiti to explain her comments 122 there was no apparent international support for the secretary generalâ s special representative in haiti against this attack and she was promptly recalled and then replaced 123 the un has since largely refrained from speaking out against abuses iv root causes the root causes of the current mobilization extend beyond the current government to decades of domestic and foreign policies in haiti that have thwarted the ability of the impoverished majority to participate in democracy and enforce their basic human rights 124 haitians are taking to the streets because they have lost faith in state institutions and processes as viable vehicles for accountability and social change the movement is demanding fundamental change to the political and economic systems that result in extreme wealth for the few and extreme poverty and desperate living conditions and a denial of basic rights such as access to school healthcare and safe housing for the majority of haitians the current crisis is the result of failures of haitian institutions and government policies but the international communityâ including powerful governments with long term involvement in haiti international organizations and financial institutionsâ also bears responsibility for decades of involvement in haiti that has put superficial stability and the interest of powerful actors in haiti and abroad above investment in true democracy and rule of law that would honor the rights of the poor majority in haiti 125 a non democratic elections haitians are taking to the streets to demand systemic change because they have lost faith that another election alone can bring about a more representative government following the demise of 29 years of dictatorships under the duvaliers in 1986 haitians initially had high hopes in democracy126 but repeated electoral violence vote rigging disenfranchisement and foreign interventions have bred deep disillusionment 127 the united states and other countries have spent millions on building up haitiâ s electoral system but these investments have come with repeated meddling in election results 128 and support for flawed elections that benefitted international actorsâ haitian allies producing an electoral system that is weaker less trusted and more exclusionary 129 in 2000 when haitians voted enthusiasticallyâ turnout was 68 percentâ the results were overturned by the 2004 coup dâ ã tat organized by those who possess wealth and power in haiti the united states canada and france 130 more recently the 2010 2011 elections that brought michel martelly president moã seâ s predecessor and political patron into power were marred by fraud irregularities and the exclusion of haitiâ s largest party fanmi lavalas from participation 131 despite widespread protest from haitians that elections needed to be redone and done properly the united states and others repeatedly pushed for the process to move forward in the name of stability 132 as documented in u s diplomatic cables and by international and haitian officials who were involved in the electoral process u s secretary of state hillary clinton ultimately forced the electoral council by threatening to cancel u s visas to change the first round results to move third place candidate martelly into the runoff 133 president martellyâ s regime was itself marked by severe human rights violations and after years of unconstitutional delay the regime presided over elections with enough violence corruption and voter exclusion to dampen participation 134 president martellyâ s protã gã jovenel moã se won that election with only 20 of the electorate participating reflecting both government intimidation and haitiansâ reduced confidence in the ballot box as an avenue for social change 135 b absence of rule of law the lack of rule of law in haiti is another root cause of the current protest the haitian justice system suffers from pervasive corruption and chronic underinvestment resulting in systematic impunity for human rights violations 136 the governmentâ s lack of financial investment in the judicial sector makes fertile ground for bribery which is commonplace at every level of the judicial system 137 for example salaries for court officers including judges are notoriously low a recent report by rnddh found that annual salaries for judges in the courts of first instance averaged between 4 800 and 7 520 138 which almost requires judges to accept bribes if they are to live a modest middle class lifestyle allegations are rarely pursued since judicial agents are often complicit in acceptance of bribes and preferential treatment of the elite 139 the weak politicized judicial system has meant that courts have exercised no restraint on governmental corruption and grave human rights violations haitiâ s police force is also weak undertrained inexperienced and politicized resulting in abuses of authority lack of protection and weak investigation capacity in the face of rights violations there are approximately 15 000 people in the current police force which has never reached the level deemed necessary to provide public safety for the country 140 the hnp has developed relationships with gangs and does not have adequate structures for officer accountability when abuses occur 141 the police forceâ s limitations combined with a justice system that is unable to provide adequate deterrence to crime leaves haitians particularly those who are vulnerable and who live in poor neighborhoods run largely by gang members extremely vulnerable the international community has long articulated the importance of the rule of law in haiti and has invested billions of dollars in building up a stronger judicial system and the rule of law 142 over the past 25 years the un has regularly had peacekeeping and police missions in haiti to train the haitian police force and promote stability through rule of law while the missions have increased the number of trained police officers the unâ s overall limited success in promoting rule of law is partly attributable to its own implications in rights violations with impunity the un stabilization mission in haiti minustah which closed down in 2017 is implicated in a series of human rights violations including indiscriminate killing of civilians during a july 2005 raid in citã soleil 143 raping and sexually abusing civilians 144 and causing a devastating cholera epidemic that has killed over 10 000 people and infected more than 800 000 145 the un took more than five years to publicly admit a role in the outbreak despite numerous scientific studies establishing that cholera was introduced to haiti as a result of reckless disposal of human wastes from a minustah base 146 haitian civil society and international expertsâ including the unâ s own human rights expertsâ have repeatedly warned that a failure to submit to justice for cholera undermines the unâ s own credibility 147 the unâ s loss of credibility and resulting limited impact is demonstrated by minujusthâ s inability to call for accountability in the current crisis as discussed above since the missionâ s unwelcomed statement supporting the assignment of an investigative judge to the petrocaribe case and urging an investigation into the grand ravine massacre in early 2018 the un has largely refrained from directly speaking out in the face of abuses c deep seated poverty the deep rooted poverty in haiti is the result not only of corruption and economic mismanagement by president moã se and his predecessors but of centuries of haitian governments serving the interest of the elite 148 it is also the result of decisions made outside of haiti that have repeatedly devastated haitiâ s economy and thwarted development haiti won its independence in 1804 as the worldâ s only nation founded through a slave revolt and has paid a steep price for its provenance 149 in 1825 france illegally extorted well over todayâ s equivalent of 19 billion from haiti as compensation for its â propertyâ lost through emancipation 150 haiti s subsequent crippling debt took 122 years to repay and prompted the u s to invade haiti in 1915 151 the u s occupied haiti for 19 years during which it took financial control of the country and forced haiti to put 40 percent of its national income towards foreign debt repayment 152 the brutal occupation enforced a system of forced labor and murdered thousands of haitians who resisted the occupying forces 153 leaving a blueprint for future oppressive regimes more recently u s neoliberal trade policies towards haiti have had devastating impacts on the agricultural economy for example president bill clinton infamously forced haiti to reduce import tariffs on rice in the 1990s which resulted in u s subsidized rice flooding the markets and destroying the haitian rice industryâ a policy for which clinton eventually issued a public apology 154 v the way forward protest leaders and participantsâ primary demand is for president moã seâ s departure but they are also clear that the solution has to go deeper than a change in leadership to address the systemic problems and structural violence meanwhile the international community has urged elections as the way forward in response to the february 2019 protests that shut down the country the core group â composed of representatives from the un brazil canada france germany spain the european union the united states and the organization of american states â issued a statement urging that â change must come through the ballot boxâ 155 elections alone are unlikely to result in the kind of systemic change that haitians demand however should president moã se step down the haitian constitution provides that his resignation would trigger a caretaker government to hold prompt elections there is uncertainty in the law about the details however as the 1987 constitution was amended in 2012 under controversial circumstances one of the concerns is the fact that only the french version of the constitution was amended while the haitian creole version which is also an official version was not 156 as a result many lawyers in haiti believe that both versions control under the french version upon a presidential vacancy the government is led by the prime

organize elections in 45 90 days because of the lack of trust in the current administration civil society groups appear in agreement that if the president resigns a cour de cassation justice should be appointed as president in accordance with the creole version the current president of the court rene sylveste however was only appointed to the court on february 1 2019 by president moã se 158 as a result civil society has pushed for an alternate justice on the court to become president there is also broad civil society agreement that there should be an oversight body a conseil national du gouvernment with between 11 and 33 members to apply public pressure on the government to take measures that lead to fair elections and fundamental changes to haitiâ s unjust structures finally there appears to be a consensus that it would be impossible to organize fair elections within 90 or 120 days and that a longer period would be necessary to organize truly participatory elections beyond a

the dollar index should be trading at a higher level but it is not the dollar is the reserve currency of the world it is the foreign exchange instruments that central banks monetary authorities and governments all over the world hold the us dollar is also the benchmark pricing mechanism for almost all commodities which are global assets the dollar index which measures the us currency against the world s other leading foreign exchange instruments reached a peak in early 2017 at 103 815 on the active month futures contract a correction followed taking the greenback index to a low at 88 15 in february 2018 just thirteen months later since then the dollar index has been moving to the upside slowly making higher lows and higher highs reaching its most recent peak last month the dollar has a lot going for it these days and for those who do not trade futures or in the highly liquid over the counter currency market the invesco db us dollar index bullish fund nysearca uup and its bearish counterpart udn provide an alternative for market participants looking to position on the long or short side of the dollar index a new high in the dollar index in april after reaching a high at 97 705 on the nearby dollar index futures contract in mid december 2018 the index remained below that level until it finally reached a new peak in april source cqg as the daily chart highlights the dollar index rose to a higher high at 98 085 during the week of april 22 the ascent of the dollar against the other leading world currencies has been slow and steady in a sign that another new and higher high could be on the horizon in the near future the index was trading at the 97 775 level last friday which was just below the most recent peak moreover the dollar index put in a bullish key reversal trading pattern on the weekly chart last week the index fell to a low that was lower than the previous week and closed above the prior week s high the technical pattern could send the dollar to another higher high which would have consequences for commodities prices and markets across other asset classes the rise in the dollar should come as no surprise as fundamentals when it comes to interest rates support a higher greenback interest rate differentials support the dollar one of the most significant factors when it comes to the path of least resistance of a currency is the level of interest rates compared to other foreign exchange instruments the euro currency comprises 57 of the dollar index and the index also has exposure to the japanese yen short term interest rates in the euro and the yen remain in negative territory with the euro charging 40 basis points for holders of the currency meanwhile the short term yield on the us dollar or the fed funds rate stands at 2 25 2 50 making the yield differential between the us and european foreign exchange instruments which are both reserve currencies 2 65 2 90 the yield differential is a compelling factor that favors a higher dollar compared to the euro currency with short term rates on the yen also in negative territory the dollar provides a significant yield advantage compared to the japanese currency the bottom line is that capital grows for those that hold dollars by over 2 per annum while it shrinks for those who hold the euro or the yen trade issues with china push the dollar higher the recent escalation of the trade dispute between the us and china is inherently bullish for the dollar china has suffered economically under the weight of tariffs on their exports to the us which is the leading consumer market in the world the price of protectionism for china is higher than it is for the us the chinese have battled the economic slowdown by devaluing their currency the yuan and slashing domestic interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending and inhibit saving a lower yuan versus the dollar boosts the value of the dollar against not only the chinese currency by against other world foreign exchange instruments the us economy is healthy under the trump administration tax and regulatory reforms have ignited economic growth even though the fed hikes rates by four times in 2018 gdp growth remains robust and unemployment is at the lowest level since the 1960s as the labor market continues to tighten the latest data at the end of last week showed that housing starts increased to an annual rate of 1 24 million in april which was above consensus estimates at 1 21 million at the same time the philadelphia fed manufacturing index in may rose to a four month high at 16 6 after coming in at 8 5 in april the rise in interest rates last year and the trade dispute with china has not stopped economic growth in the us which continues to reflect the fiscal stimulus from changes to the corporate tax code and the regulatory environment which have supported business the only issue is the administration s dollar policy uup and udn fundamentals support a strong dollar and we could see a higher high in the dollar index as soon as this week last week s bullish reversal could be all the dollar index needs to push to a new level on the upside 2017 as the index is on a path towards the 100 level meanwhile past administrations in the us had followed a strong dollar policy but president trump and his treasury secretary steve mnuchin have made no secret of their desire for a weaker us currency as a strong dollar makes us exports less competitive in global markets moreover a weaker dollar is an effective tool in the ongoing trade dispute with the chinese when it comes to competition for exports around the globe it is possible that the us treasury will intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent the dollar from running away on the upside over the coming days and weeks given the most recent price action in the currency market the most direct route for a trade or investment position in the dollar on the long or short side of the market is via the highly liquid over the counter foreign exchange market or the futures contracts on currency pairs and the dollar index for those who do not venture into either of those arenas the invesco db us dollar index bullish fund and its bearish counterpart provide an alternative the fund summary for uup states the investment seeks to establish long positions in ice u s dollar index futures contracts with a view to tracking the changes whether positive or negative in the level of the deutsche bank long usd currency portfolio index excess return over time plus the excess if any of the sum of the fund s treasury income money market income and t bill etf income over the expenses of the fund the fund invests in futures contracts in an attempt to track its index the index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time whether positive or negative of long positions in dx contracts the most recent top holdings in uup include source yahoo finance uup holds dollar index futures contracts so it does an excellent job replicating the price performance in the futures market uup has net assets of 387 13 million and trades an average of just over 500 000 shares each day the inverse product udn has net assets of 33 05 million and trades around 30 000 shares each day the path of least resistance for the dollar remains higher and last week s technical action points to another higher high in the greenback the only thing standing in front of continued strength in the us currency is the government that prints the legal tender which is likely to stand in front of an explosive move in the interest of stability in the foreign exchange market and as a tool when it comes to trade
the rupee continued to fall to record lows on friday days after the government agreed in principle to a 6 billion loan from the international monetary fund imf the rupee which lost 3 6 per cent on thursday to close at 146 2 against the us dollar in the interbank market dropped further on friday selling at rs 149 50 in the interbank market and rs 150 in the open market dealers said the stock market also declined on friday with the benchmark kse 100 index shedding 804 5 points to close at 33 166 6 down 2 4 per cent the market opening at 33 971 remained friday s high whereas the benchmark kse 100 index hit a day s low at 33 006 points as many as 63 3 million shares worth rs2 7 billion of the benchmark index companies changed hands during the session the fall in rupee value reflects the imf s condition for a market based exchange rate mechanism which will see limited intervention by the central bank now said saad hashmi chief economist and research director at the topline securities in karachi while the exact conditions of a final imf deal are still unknown sunday s staff level accord which must still be approved by the fund s board in washington said a market determined exchange rate will help the financial sector this points to less support from the state bank of pakistan which at present underpins the rupee in a de facto managed float system late on thursday the sbp issued a statement saying the sharp fall in the rupee reflects demand and supply conditions in the foreign exchange market and will help in correcting the market imbalances adviser to prime minister on finance abdul hafeez shaikh said the other day that it is the sbp s monetary policy committee which is responsible for determining rupee dollar exchange rate keeping in view the foreign currency demand and supply situation of the country president forex association of pakistan malik bostan says the rupee is expected to depreciate by a further 15 to 20 percent against the dollar by december this year the sbp is expected to further tighten the monetary policy stance on may 20 by increasing policy rate by 50 100 basis points to curb aggregate demand and ensure microeconomic stability an equity analyst at iis securities said kse 100 index remained negative throughout the session on friday on further currency devaluation after thursday s dip and expected hike in policy rate in upcoming monetary policy announcement e ps fertilisers and commercial banks were major draggers of the index collectively shedding 406 19 points overall index closed at the lowest level of 33 166 62 after losing 804 50 points which is the lowest level since march 31 2016 maaz mulla an equity analyst expects bearish sentiment in the market to continue on the back of concerning economic indicators also potential redemptions in mutual funds are likely to cause further selling pressure according to a the topline securities advisory the fall in the index level is due to devaluation of rupee against dollar for last two working days expected hike in policy rate in the next monetary policy meeting on monday and selling pressure from mutual funds however the drop presents a political problem for the government which came to power last year promising to build a new social welfare system and vowing not to seek what would be pakistan s 13th bailout since the 1980s with the economy facing a sharp slowdown in growth the government is expected to raise taxes or impose heavy spending cuts to reduce its ballooning budget deficit at a time when household budgets are increasingly squeezed while many analysts see the rupee as overvalued and say the sbp has wasted billions defending it a weaker currency is likely to fuel inflation which is already over 8 with power and fuel prices hit especially hard the sbp which is due to announce its latest interest rate decision on monday said late on thursday that its foreign exchange reserves fell 138 million in the week ending may 10 to 8 846 billion less than needed to cover three months of imports

and brexit troubles see how retail traders are positioningaudusd eurusd s p 500along with the other fx majors indices goldandoilintraday using thedailyfx speculative positioning data on the sentiment page two trade war breakthroughs are overlooked for the united states china standoff trade wars were at the top of the headlines this past week which makes it the primary medium for speculative interests and it will likely retain that influence when liquidity returns monday while these global relationships are ultimately influential for the pressure they put on economic activity or financial stability further down the line speculative markets attempt to price known risks well before the impact is registered and it is this concern of fallout that continues to unsettle sentiment at such an inopportune time with the s p 500 anddowlosing traction just off of record highs what is interesting about the bias that held through the end of this past week is that the market could have seized on favorable developments in trade relationships if there were any latent feelings of optimism to exploit that fact that the encouraging signs were overlooked suggests there may be some skew to account for moving forward the improvement to the long standing dispute over trade was registered with a smaller skirmish in the market s radar and the avoidance of a much larger economic block being added to the already complicated environment the biggest relief this past week was the trump administration s confirmation that it would delay the decision on whether or not it will levy taxes on imported autos and auto parts as a means to answer a perceived national security risk that was the expected outcome owing to the risk it posed to the financial system but the unpredictable trump administration is no longer taken for granted as significant as that 6 months of policy freeze is it didn t heft enough strength to drive thedaxoreurohigher much less global risk trends the other tangible update on the day was the news that thewhite house would lift the import taxes on steel and aluminum for the canada and mexico in a bid to push the usmca deal through its own congress here again the response was extremely tepid with thecanadian dollarand mexican peso showing little in the way of assurance after the news chart ofusdcad daily in contrast to the progress made in the united states trade relationship with europe japan canada and mexico the pressure has not eased in its standoff with china in a week s time anticipation of a compromise and a course reversal inthe most expensive trade war in historyhas turned into an incredible escalation of tension with threats of far more following the us tariff hike on 200 billion in chinese goods 10 to 25 percent and china s retaliation on 60 billion in us imports there has been little assurance that talks were picking back up in fact unconfirmed reports suggested discussions had broke down friday news that seemed to exert considerable pain through the s p 500 s close friday though there are still three weeks until the us considers adding another 325 billion in chinese imports to the tariff list according to the president the mood has set the market s tone with chinese telecommunications company huawei added to the us entities list it will be very difficult for the two countries to negotiate in good faith monitoring risk trends from s p 500 to yields gold to usdcnh as we move into a new week of trading it is critical to keep track of the different measures of risk trends that reflect upon unique threats to the system the favorite measure remains the us equity indices these measures maintain a long term premium relative to virtually all other systemic risk measures global shares carry trade emerging markets junk assets yields and more the s p 500 was only 3 2 percent off its intraday record high through the close which seems a favorable signal but the context of the undying complacency from this measure dampens the speculative view looking to the scale of intraday reversals from the benchmark resulting in tails we find an unmistakable pressure against bullish progress furthermore the past two weeks opened with large bearish gaps lower each the largest in a decade if there were a third such large drop lower to start this next week there little chance that the market would miss the signal chart of s p 500 and opening gaps weekly in the meantime my assessment of market sentiment rests more heavily with measures that have far less connection to the complacent speculation that has kept purely financial assets like the us indices propped up global government bond yields for example incorporate not just the appetite of traders hungry for every basis point of yield and willing to hold for any capital gains but they also reflect growth potential as appoint of value it is therefore troubling to see the scale of divergence between the likes of the s p 500 and aggregate yield of the largest 10 year government bond yields gold is another multifaceted speculative measure rather than playing the role of a rote safe haven this commodity is prized when risk aversion comes with a material complication in confidence for financial stability and currency health if the metal is rising materially there is reason to be concerned chart of s p 500 and aggregate us german uk and japan 10 year treasury yield daily the most troubling risk oriented scenario that i am keeping an eye for the week ahead is a possible sustained advance in the usdcnh the dollar chinese yuan exchange rate chinese financial monitors exert careful control over the exchange rate preventing market runs that could trigger complications in market stability there is an unspoken but understood cap on theusdcnh exchange rate at 7 0000that the pboc has defended in the past likely in an effort to avoid accusations of exchange rate manipulation aimed at unfair trade advantage and to avoid the perception that the authorities are losing control over capital controls if this rate were to overtake that level there is no way reassuring alternative explanation for such a run and authorities would likely default to an explanation that it was a strategic decision rather than a troubling loss of influence which would drive trade wars further intervention is very likely as we hold near 7 0000 keep an eye on usdcnh as global investors weigh their confidence for the future chart of usdcnh and 2 week rate of change weekly eurgbp anticipation for eu parliamentary elections loonie late response dollar remains benefactor combing the economic docket over the coming week there are a host of noteworthy releases but true market movement will likely reside with only those few measures that can tap more systemic issues for

multi year lows the canadian dollar is another remarkable contrast in fundamental waves against unflappable price action usdcad has refused to clear its approximate 100 point range despite the trade war breakthrough that move is inevitable but when will it happen and can it establish any real follow through for scheduled event risk the biggest listing on my docket is the eu parliamentary election which runs from may 23rd to the 26th the outcome for this vote has enormous implications for the euro which has struggled against the news german growth has stalled and italy is pushing back against debt restrictions if nationalist parties gain greater traction in the polls anti eu and anti euro sentiment is likely to climb the sterling will also find itself tied to this event the government had to agree to participate in elections in order to draw the extension on the brexit negotiations that additional time was clearly necessary as we watched discussions breakdown between government and labour party this past week whether you like prime minister theresa may or not reports that she will lay out the time frame for her stepping downnext month only adds to the uncertainty we are dealing with chart of equally weightedpoundindex and consecutive candle moves daily as these majors deal with their own fundamental tides the most liquid currency may find itself at the mercy or taking advantage of its benchmark counterparts theus dollarhas defied its traditional ties to volatility as a safe haven currency and its carry trade status hasn t seen a positive correlation betweenusdand interest rate forecasts derived from fed funds futures as for data the strongest consumer sentiment data from the university of michigan in 15 years seemed to stoke little enthusiasm as the trade wars retain a special place of concern moving forward there is notable event risk ahead for the greenback fed s powell speaking may pmis for a gdp proxy and thefomcminutes yet this mix is unlikely to spur the currency to life the real capacity for the dollar to move will be through the contrast it draws from its major counterparts if the euro pound and yen all drop moving forward the usd will benefit if they lose traction it will be chop we discuss all of this and more in this weekend trading video if you want to download my manic crisis calendar you can find the updated filehere
the strategic objective is to integrate china into the world economy the liberal international solution was trade investment flows and cultural exchanges the rise of nationalism and china s own willingness to flaunt the international rules are defeating the strategy president trump may suggest that china would prefer to negotiate with his main democrat rival 18 months away from the election both pelosi and schumer s supported the hardline on china indicates a rare united national stance there are short run and longer term consequences most immediately volatility in the equities has risen which is associated with falling stock prices a month ago the vix was near 11 5 now now it is near 17 the msci s index for developed country equities fell 0 5 after shedding 2 4 the previous week it is the first back to back weekly decline this year the msci index of emerging market equities lost 3 6 after dropping 4 2 in the prior week it has given back nearly 3 4 of the gains in the first four months of the year bond yields also fell and in derivative markets futures forwards ois investors seemed to be pricing easier monetary policy the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures contract has fallen nearly 18 bp since trump s tweets than announced the end of tariff truce to about 2 02 the current effective average rate which is what the contract settles at is 2 38 this would seem to be consistent with one cut fully discounted and half of a second cut 50 chance too however with the effective funds rate is still above the interest the fed pays on reserves officials may want to take more action they may continue to cut the interest on reserves to push it lower though we still think a new facility to defend the top of the range as the fed does with the lower end is needed the point here if one allows if one assumes the fed is pushing the interest on reserves to the lower end of the target range then the market has nearly priced in a second cut this year investors are pricing in aggressive rate cuts by the reserve bank of australia which are seen beginning in a few weeks the market even appears to be pricing in an ecb rate cut by the end next year but it is not just policy rates it is also inflation expectations part of the falling inflation expectations is the belief that more trade frictions will cause slower growth however part of it may be the consequence of the breakdown in the liberal strategy for making room at the economic table to a giant economy in some ways it is like the uk leaving the eu there are orderly and disorderly ways it can happen china s sheer size and development orientation mean that it will have a powerful impact on the world economy the real threat that china poses and one that it would still present if it were market oriented democracy is similar to what rise of germany and the us did at the turn of the 20th century it is a huge deflationary thrust china s production capacity for a large number of goods far and away exceed its possible demand of course it brings new demand as well but the new supply is more deflationary than the increase in demand is inflationary supplanting the liberal strategy the trump administration is pursuing a containment strategy which is one of china s longstanding fears it campaigns against the belt road initiative and opposes china s import substitution strategy made in china 2025 with its own make america great again it hardwires into nafta 2 0 that canada and mexico cannot enter into trade agreements with china though apparently the us can it has been forcing chinese companies to divest of internet properties like grindr and patientslikeme the us is selling new fighter planes to taiwan which it recognizes as a province of china it demands that china honors its embargos against iran and north korea the number of chinese students coming to the us to study has fallen chinese direct investment in the us has slowed businesses on both sides are being guided to minimize trips and exposures the passage of a hong kong law will allow extradition to china which the us protested because it makes americans in hong kong more formally at the reach of chinese officials than before the tariffs will encourage many businesses to leave china but that does not mean that the us will be the primary beneficiary just like the bitcoin and other cyber currencies have a fork so can the internet the us ban buying huawei products and selling parts to it could have far reaching implications even if european governments don t go along with it it creates opportunities for huawei s competitors in the 5g space like nokia ericsson and cisco there will be us european protocols and chinese protocols more importantly is china will now have powerful incentives to do two things that will foster the fork first china is largely dependent on foreign semiconductors it will cease to be so since the end of the tariff truce the philadelphia semiconductor index sox has fallen nearly 9 after rallying around 50 from the lows of late last year second given the duopoly for mobile operating systems of us companies ois and android it is strategically necessary for china to introduce its own some reports suggest huawei is prepared to do so if android prevents its use the critical battle next week though is in the foreign exchange market chinese officials have in the past drawn a proverbial line in the sand at cny7 0 the lower end of the approved dollar range we thought was cny6 70 though it did fray it a bit earlier this year the dollar rose against the yuan in the three weeks before trump s tweets and has risen in the two weeks since the cny7 0 area held in late 2016 early 2017 and again at the end of last year and the start of this year the same generally holds for the offshore yuan cnh there are numerous policy levers that the pboc can pull to defend its pain threshold affecting the availability of liquidity as well as the price it can also squeeze cnh shorts in hong kong until now it appears that market forces including the broad strength of the dollar is responsible for the yuan s depreciation and the pboc is perceived to be trying to temper the decline if the cny7 0 level does not hold and the dollar rises through it it will be seen as the inability or more likely the unwillingness of china to mount a credible defense it would likely send ripples through the capital markets this would risk a vicious cycle of a weakening currency and falling stocks because this would distract from china s economic objectives we expect officials will defend it in a way that leaves no room for mistaking its desire meanwhile both the us and china reported disappointing april retail sales and industrial output figures in recent days china will provide additional stimulus the us will not minutes from the last fomc meeting will be released at mid week and will likely confirm that the bar for it to move as the market seems to think probably is rather high that said the economy has lost the momentum seen in q1 the atlanta fed tracker sees q2 gdp at 1 2 while the new york fed s model puts it at 1 8 to the extent that the tariffs are understood as a tax us policymakers will try to look through related price increases just like they would if for example the tax on gasoline was raised economists project that the trade war could shave 0 5 0 75 percentage points off us gdp officials and investors will also want to look past boeing s effect on durable goods orders and shipments which will likely be another headwind the main economic data point from japan next week will be the first look at q1 gdp the monthly reports suggest consumption and investment fell in the first part of the year the risk appears to be on the downside of the median forecast in the bloomberg survey for a 0 1 contraction economists have under appreciated the low prices and weaker growth in asia as a whole and japan in particular consider for example that before the weekend japan reported its march tertiary activities service sector index the bloomberg survey found a median forecast for a 0 1 gain instead it fell by 0 4 the dollar rose to a seven day high before the weekend near jpy110 20 this will likely help lift japanese shares at the start of the new week the nikkei dropped about 7 25 from the year s high in late april to the low early last week which was nearly half of the year s gain it is worth mentioning again that although the sovereign yield curve is negative out a decade the yield on japanese stock indices is high the dividend yield of the nikkei is almost 2 2 and the topix yield is 2 50 higher than the yield on us treasuries european corporations also have high dividend yields the german dax yields nearly 3 2 and france s cac returns 3 3 the ftse 250 pays is yielding almost the same as the cac while italy s ftse milan index has a dividend yield of 4 in comparison the us s p 500 yields a little less 2 europe s economy grew faster in q1 than the survey data suggested the survey data may play a bit of catch up the preliminary may pmi will be reported the manufacturing contraction is expected to ease while the service sector continues to recover the next result will likely be an uptick in the composite there is a reasonably good chance that the q2 composite pmi rises for the first quarterly increase three month average since the end of 2017 the european parliament election begins on may 23 and the results are expected on may 26 the center right and center left groupings people s party and socialist democrats are expected to remain the largest parties but could lose their combined majority in the face of right wing populism and nationalist parties often in the eu parliament elections smaller and more extreme national parties are better presented than in their own national elections farage s brexit party is expected to do particularly well but it has no formal representation in the uk parliament may is expected to lead the tory party into another thrashing but it will be the last one the prime minister is now expected to submit her withdrawal bill for the fourth and final time in early june and then step down the jockeying for position for her successor has already begun before the weekend the us announced that in exchange for stronger enforcement it was lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico while some deal had appeared to be in the works treasury secretary mnuchin explicitly denied that he was referring to ending the tariffs perhaps too we did not appreciate the linkage between the deterioration of trade relations with china and need to improve them elsewhere we suspect that the odds of the new nafta bill being enacted has increased from about 20 to 50 the canadian parliament has about a month to approve it before the summer recess and national election the biggest remaining hurdle is us congressional approval steel tariffs that had been double on turkey were cut back to 25 trump indicated there would be a 180 day delay before he decides whether to levy a 25 tariff on auto imports from europe and japan while the market responded favorably what the us is seeking is a voluntary export restriction which while acceptable under gatt and in violation of the wto rules also the us put new tariff 17 5 tariff on 2 bln mexican tomato imports and re started an old anti dumping probe australia s national election results will be known before the market s open on monday the markets may not have a strong reaction the prospect of a rate cut in a few weeks has helped drive the stock market to new highs since 2007 it has also been a weight alongside the china contagion on the currency which has fallen for five consecutive weeks

rami toren from green arava in israel view some of the maize plantation in a ten thousand hectares model farm of galana kulalu food security project which was officially launched by president uhuru kenyatta at the galana kulalu irrigation scheme july 09 2015 after being told the government had successfully issued a third eurobond kenyans might now want to shift their focus to the value of the projects that will have gobbled up sh685 billion in five years right from 2014 when kenya issued its debut sovereign bond the money raised from the mostly european and american investors has partly been used to refinance other maturing debts while the rest has been used for general budgetary expenditure experts reckon that refinancing offsetting one debt using another is not unusual even in corporate finance however it is prudent to replace an expensive debt with a cheaper one probably a short tenor debt with a long tenor debt or high interest loan with a low interest one treasury insists this is what it has been doing with its refinancing but its critics differ pointing to the shortening of tenors and the increase in the cost of borrowing last week the government raised 2 1 billion sh210 billion which was issued in two tranches of seven and 12 year maturity attracting interest of seven and eight per cent respectively most analysts agree that kenya got a favourable deal at a time when global investors are jittery following a trade spat between the united states and china moreover the country successfully sold the bond despite not having a stand by credit facility from the international monetary fund which expired in september last year leaving the country without an additional insurance in case of shock to the shilling if kenya had gone to the market a month before around that time when ghana and egypt issued their eurobonds it would have got a better deal says jibran qureishi the stanbic bank regional economist for east africa he adds that kenya could even have got a longer tenor note probably for 30 years although all financial experts we spoke to agreed that the terms for the 2019 sovereign bond were favourable they differed on whether the projects that have taken up the money raised from the international capital market will generate sufficient returns to repay interest that is increasing increased appetite for costly dollar denominated debts such as the eurobonds as well as financing offered by a group of lenders known as syndicated loans has dramatically pushed up kenya s interest payments with foreign investors pocketing a good chunk of the country s tax revenues in fact when kenya made its first interest payment on its debut sovereign bond in june 2015 total foreign interest that had hitherto been increasing at an average of 6 5 per cent suddenly jumped by a staggering 96 per cent as the country forked out sh29 3 billion to foreign creditors compared to a pay out of sh14 9 billion in the 2013 14 financial year it was the highest jump in 15 years henceforth interest payment on external debt would increase by an average of 51 per cent attracting the attention of the imf in kenya s debt sustainability analyses dsa the imf found that an increasing load of foreign interest payment was one of the factors that nudged the country to the edge of debt distress as it risked defaulting on its obligation the global lender thus reclassified kenya s risk of default from low to moderate with kenya joining 25 nations including congo republic burkina faso liberia sierra leone and togo in this category the higher level of debt together with rising reliance on non concessional borrowing have raised fiscal vulnerabilities and increased interest payments on public debt to nearly one fifth of revenue placing kenya in the top quartile among its peers the imf said in the report released in december 2018 asset generating economists say that while taking on expensive debt is not necessarily bad borrowers country or company have to ensure that they invest the money in asset generating projects such projects would significantly boost the country s productivity by for example increasing its yield of tea coffee pyrethrum and other export products improved productivity of the country s exports would translate to more foreign exchange earnings which kenya would use to comfortably repay its share of commercial loans as they fall due efforts to rebuild the country s tourism sector and diversify its exports would also go a long way in earning the country critical foreign currencies particularly us dollars which is the currency under which the three eurobonds have been denominated yet some analysts feel that some of the projects kenya has invested in will not have the desired knock on effect the money that kenya has borrowed has not gone into projects that generate revenue says deepak dave of riverside capital advisory while the multiplier effect of some of the projects might take long to felt there has been concern over the last few years about the mismatch between economic growth and revenue growth tax to gdp gross domestic product has been reducing says erick musau a senior research analyst at standard investment bank the world bank also noted that even though more goods and services have been traded very little of these economic activities have been taxed although it revenues grew by 13 3 per cent in nominal terms in 2016 17 tax revenues expanded by less than nominal gdp 14 9 per cent hence the tax to gdp ratio fell to 16 9 per cent of gdp its lowest level in a decade said the bank in its 16th edition of the kenya economic update the decline has been seen as a sign of a moribund private sector the main employer and taxpayer whose success is critical for kenya s efforts to repay its loans unfortunately a good chunk of households and firms have remained outside of the tax bracket as more than 80 per cent of the economy has remained informal you can t have 90 per cent of the economy being informal and expect to increase your revenue mr musau says mr dave insists that rather than pump money into mega projects such as the standard gauge railway money would have been put into micro infrastructure projects which connect to the real economy that touches more citizens a number of these projects have already been tainted by scandals from the sgr to dams there have been numerous reports of how borrowed cash is being misappropriated musau however says that despite the taint of corruption the scale of the projects being undertaken is substantial and will pay off at some point he says that unlike during president mwai kibaki s tenure when the only prominent mega project was the thika superhighway president uhuru kenyatta s government has overstretched itself in terms of the scale of projects the projects built across the country in the last five years span different sectors from energy roads ports dams to ict among others but they could be implemented better musau says mr qureishi says the government needs to enhance feasibility on the projects it is doing to ensure substantial return on the projects the national treasury has since come up with a public investment management framework to verify the projects for their quality and cost effectiveness without the framework noted the treasury there is a likelihood of ad hoc decisions on project funding the result is a bloated project portfolio unpredictable funding stalled projects and inflated costs contributing to the under execution of budgets and delayed translation of the investment in projected economic growth said treasury in the 2018 document stringent conditions treasury has also revamped the debt office and given state bodies stringent conditions on external financing as a means to ensuring there is value for the billions borrowed the national treasury s authority to sanction any new project in accomplishment of kenya s vision 2030 and the government s big four development agenda must be demand driven and priority to the kenyan people said treasury cabinet secretary henry rotich in a circular on seeking external funding this will ensure adherence to the principles of public participation as enshrined in the constitution of kenya to ensure sustainability of the projects realising that some state agencies kept holding money even as some projects stalled president kenyatta in june last year ordered a freeze on procurement of all new development projects until the ongoing ones had been completed it is a directive that national treasury insisted would continue being implemented in the upcoming financial year

u s review two steps back and one step forward retail sales stumbled again in april falling 0 2 core retail sales were flat and suggest the q2 s bounceback in consumer spending may not be as strong as previously thought output in the manufacturing sector fell 0 5 in april the industry was already struggling before the recent trade war escalation due to slower global growth and the stronger dollar housing starts increased 5 7 in april and point to residential investment growing in q2 for the first time in six quarters at least housing is looking better trade tensions were top of mind again this week with markets keeping a close eye on negotiations between the u s and china as well as the trump administration s decision to impose broad tariffs on auto related imports the decision was delayed six months consumer spending and business investment were already looking somewhat shaky before the most recent tumult however retail sales stumbled again in april falling 0 2 as expected weaker auto sales dragged down the headline but core sales were also flat we continue to expect consumer spending to strengthen in the second quarter after a paltry showing in q1 personal spending jumped 0 9 in march which puts outlays in a good spot to start the quarter continued strength in the labor market including a 16k drop in initial jobless claims this week should further underpin a rebound however april s underwhelming retail sales report suggests the pickup may be more modest than previously thought near term growth does not look to be getting much help from manufacturing and business investment either industrial production fell 0 5 in april a drop in utilities output offset an increase in mining the real sore spot in the report however was the 0 5 drop in manufacturing output consistent with softness at the retail level auto production fell 2 6 but just as weak was production of machinery an ominous sign for business investment output in the manufacturing sector has not risen since december and is down 1 6 since then in early may there were at least a few glimpses of factory activity beginning to turn around both the empire and philly fed surveys improved more than expected in may general sentiment was a bit better than the details when looking at each index on an ism weighted basis the headline for each survey is derived from a separate question on general business conditions one factor weighing both ism weighted fed indices however was a contraction in inventories given the massive build in the first quarter a reduction was inevitable and suggests orders remain strong enough to where production should firm up soon barring a further escalation in the trade war with tariffs upped at the tail end of the survey periods for the empire and philly fed indices may s improvement in general sentiment may be short lived the same may prove true for small businesses the nfib small business optimism index rose to a four month high in april but smaller firms have less bargaining power with suppliers and are therefore more susceptible to higher input costs owners had already begun reporting poor sales as a growing concern suggesting limited scope to pass on higher prices at least the recent pickup in the housing market remains on track housing starts rose 5 7 in april building permits also improved and do not look to have been quite as low as previously thought the pullback in mortgage rates lower material costs and improved builder sentiment should help to keep the rebound in residential construction intact u s outlook existing home sales tuesday sales of existing homes gave back some february s 11 2 surge and fell 4 9 during march sales declined in each of the four census regions last month however the national association of realtors noted that the pullback was most acute in higher priced markets adversely impacted by new limitations on state and local tax deductions brought on by the new tax law while resales have been running somewhat soft they are by no means weak and have averaged a 5 21 million unit pace in the first three months of the year demand has been comparatively stronger at more affordable price points where inventory is still relatively scarce overall we look for a sturdy gain in existing home sales during april mortgage rates remain low which has led to purchase applications steadily trending higher furthermore pending home sales which represent signed contracts and lead closings by a month or two rose 3 8 during march previous 5 21m wells fargo 5 37m consensus 5 35m new home sales thursday the broad improvement in buying conditions should keep new home sales on an upward trend over the next several months that said a repeat of last month s 4 5 surge in sales is unlikely we look for a modest drop in sales to a still solid 685 000 unit pace during april similar to resales new home sales have been strengthening at lower price points during march an estimated 50 of sales were priced below 300 000 which is up from around the 43 average during 2018 homebuilders have mostly responded in kind and shifted their focus toward constructing lower priced homes builders have also responded to rising inventories by offering price discounts to entice potential buyers off the sidelines as a result the median sales price fell 9 7 year over year to 302 700 in march the fifth consecutive drop by that measure easing home prices and lower mortgage rates should lay the groundwork for a modest pickup in new home sales over the next few months previous 692 000 wells fargo 685 000 consensus 677 000 durable goods orders friday durable goods orders rebounded in march rising 2 6 february s initial 1 6 drag was also revised higher to a more moderate 1 3 decline in recent months orders have been influenced by aircraft orders which tend to be highly volatile the commercial aircraft sector is likely to reprise its starring role in april s report the grounding of the boeing 737 max and subsequent negative headlines have led to net cancellations which will weigh heavily on april s outcome as aircraft orders account for roughly 10 of the total as a result we expect total orders fell 3 8 during april industrial production fell 0 5 during april and the machinery production component dropped 2 6 an indication that weakness in durable goods orders may extend beyond the aircraft sector excluding transportation we look for march s 0 4 gain to be followed by a 0 2 decline during april previous 2 6 wells fargo 3 8 consensus 2 0 month over month global review global trade relations

s mexico and canada are close to a deal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum global trade relations remain in focus following president trump s increase in tariffs on chinese exports relations between the major trading partners continue to stay in focus and impact global financial markets u s china trade tensions continue to dominate headlines with china officially announcing retaliation measures placing reciprocal tariffs on 60b of u s exports to china in response to china s tariffs the u s administration has escalated trade tensions even further with president trump recently signing an order designed to restrict major chinese corporations from accessing u s markets should the u s move forward with implementing these restrictions this would risk damaging relations with china even further and make finding common ground towards making a comprehensive trade deal more challenging president trump also suggested chinese authorities have a one month timeframe to agree on a trade deal or the remaining 300b in chinese exports could be subject to tariffs as well given the hardline approach by the united states chinese state media suggested trade negotiations may be on hold for now however president trump has indicated he will meet with chinese president xi at the upcoming g20 meeting in mid june to discuss trade relations we expect financial markets to remain volatile in the lead up to the g20 meeting with any further escalation likely to put additional pressure on the chinese renminbi while existing tariffs have not had a material impact on the chinese economy chinese economic data released this week underperformed expectations chinese industrial production in april increased 5 4 year over year missing consensus forecasts of 6 5 while retail sales rose only 7 2 year over year also softer than expectations for an increase of 8 6 china s weaker thanexpected economic activity data have renewed concerns that global gdp growth may be decelerating more quickly than previously forecasted should the united states move forward with 25 tariffs on all of china s exports we would expect a more pronounced impact on global gdp growth as well as china s domestic growth trajectory despite elevated trade tensions between the united states and china president trump provided some temporary optimism for global trade relations as he decided to delay the imposition of tariffs on autos and auto parts coming into the united states similar to the china deadline president trump has given the eu and japan 180 days to make a deal on how to limit the number of autos and auto parts being exported to the united states once again citing national security issues while mexico and canada are two of the larger exporters of autos and auto parts to the united states both countries would be protected under the new usmca trade agreement although yet to be ratified by each country s respective congress the u s administration provided renewed optimism for final ratification of the usmca as well media reports suggest that the united states mexico and canada are close to finalizing a deal which would remove existing tariffs on steel and aluminum should steel and aluminum tariffs be lifted the prospects for the usmca to be ratified would increase as tariffs have been a key point of contention to finalizing the usmca trade agreement global outlook argentina economic activity wednesday argentina s economy remains in recession following the country s currency crisis and extreme monetary tightening in 2018 while we expected the economy to remain fragile argentina s economy has not recovered the way we expected it to at this point the economic activity index widely used a proxy for tracking argentina s progress towards economic recovery contracted 4 8 year over year in february and has been contracting on a year over year basis since may 2018 the health of the economy will likely play an important role in argentina s presidential election later this year in a recent poll potential voters cited the health of the domestic economy as their primary concern with the economic activity index likely to contract again in march and with cpi inflation hitting a new high of 55 8 year over year in april the probability of market friendly mauricio macri being re elected is likely to continue to decline even further previous 4 8 year over year australia pmis wednesday australia s economy has been slowly deteriorating for some time now as the country is particularly exposed to china s decelerating economy as well as u s china trade tensions leading economic indicators suggest the economy will continue to slow although next week s manufacturing and services pmis may give markets an indication of just how pronounced the deceleration may be as of now both pmis remain in expansion territory but been trending lower since the end of 2018 given the underwhelming performance of the economy we believe the reserve bank of australia rba will look to ease monetary policy and cuts to its cash target rate this year markets have taken a similar view as well with implied policy rates pricing in two interest rate cuts from the rba over the next 12 months policy rate cuts could help stabilize the economy but any further escalation in u s china tariffs would likely weigh on the economy previous 50 9 manufacturing 50 1 services eurozone pmis thursday despite soft manufacturing and a relatively subdued services sector the eurozone economy grew at a 0 4 quarter over quarter pace in q1 however we believe it is too early to say the european economy has bottomed out and is on the path to recovery which should keep investors and ecb policymakers particularly focused on pmis for any further indications of how the economy is performing as of now the services sector remains in expansionary territory and despite expectations for a modest improvement the manufacturing pmi is likely to remain in contraction for the time being amid a backdrop of a fragile economy and subdued sentiment data we continue to believe ecb policymakers will remain on hold through the end of this year but may look to reduce accommodative monetary policy in 2020 if a sustained recovery starts to takes shape previous 47 9 manufacturing 52 8 services consensus 48 1 manufacturing 53 0 services point of view interest rate watch rates continue to move lower yields on u s treasury securities have generally been in retreat recently due to concerns over an escalating trade war not only has volatility in the stock market risen which has led to safe haven buying of treasury securities but market participants have inferred that the growth depressing effects of a trade war would lead the fed to cut rates the yield on the 2 year treasury security fell to a 15 month low this week and the yield on the 10 year treasury matched its low for 2019 top chart but lower government bond yields have not been confined solely to the united states the yield on the 10 year german government bond fell to its lowest level in nearly three years this week middle chart indeed yields on german government bonds are negative out through the 10 year maturity yields on many other european sovereign bonds fell to multi year lows this week as well as we have written previously we believe that the fed would look through any nearterm increase in inflation that would result from higher tariffs on u s imports and we agree with the market assessment that a trade war would bring forward expected fed rate cuts a month ago market pricing indicated that investors thought there was a 40 probability that the fed would cut rates by the end of the year that probability is nearly 80 today although we think that the odds of a fed rate cut by december are significantly lower than 70 we acknowledge that a full blown trade war should one occur would lead the fed to cut rates although the odds of fed easing have risen recently the u s dollar has generally strengthened recently as shown in the bottom chart the euro is approaching a two year low vis à vis the greenback although the odds of a fed rate cut have risen recently the probability of further easing by foreign central banks has also gone up for example the probability that the ecb would cut its deposit rate which currently stands at 0 40 was less than 10 a month ago that probability today it is up to about 25 restrictions on imported cars should they materialize would be especially onerous for the german economy credit market insights all quiet on the treasury front news this week from state run media that chinese officials were discussing large scale selling of u s treasurys gave rise to fresh fears that china will use its sizable holdings of u s government debt as another front of the trade war to retaliate over tariff escalations hard data released on wednesday revealed that china sold a net 20 4 billion of treasurys in march which was before the latest round of tariffs hikes but nevertheless its largest unloading in over two years china has now reduced its holdings for five of the past six months yet yields have fallen significantly over this period as domestic investors continue to be drawn to the risk return tradeoff of u s government debt while china is the largest foreign owner its 1 1 trillion of holdings is a fraction of the 22 trillion of treasurys outstanding any dramatic unloading of treasurys would also be partially selfdefeating a spike in yields would decrease the value of china s remaining portfolio of treasurys which represent perhaps the most viable option for its substantial foreign reserves in terms of liquidity and yield moreover selling would exert downward pressure on the dollar versus the yuan hindering the competitiveness of chinese exporters precisely at a time when they could use some relief in short rapid chinese selling of treasurys likely will not cause a significant spike in yields such a move would entail self inflicted damage for china while demand for u s government debt has been consistently robust and increasingly domestic topic of the week all trade wars are local beginning on june 1 china will raise tariffs on 60 billion dollars of u s goods to as high as 25 in retaliation for a similar u s tariff hike on 200 billion of chinese goods that took effect may 10 the s p 500 fell almost 2 5 on monday as the prospects of a prolonged and more pronounced trade war increased only around 7 of total u s exports head to china and on a value added basis exports to china account for less than 1 of the u s economy yet this masks the underlying trade exposures of various states some of which are much more susceptible to disruptions to trade with the world s second largest economy looking at exports to china as a percent of state gdp washington south carolina and oregon are the most exposed not surprising given that all are home to large port complexes and a bevy of advanced manufacturing firms texas leads on a dollar basis exporting 16 6 billion to china in 2018 followed by california and washington at 16 3 billion and 16 0 billion respectively only one other state south carolina exported more than 5 billion to china last year the methodology is worth noting here exports reflect the origin of movement which is where goods are consolidated agricultural products from inland states that are consolidated at a port are therefore counted in the exports for the port state the effect is to understate the export exposure of agriculturally focused states and overstate exposure for states with ports indeed farmers have been hit particularly hard by retaliatory chinese tariffs and plunging commodity prices pushing the trump administration to pledge as much as 20 billion in relief funds despite the low exposure on paper moreover the economic impact of trade extends well beyond the value of the goods in transit for example while manufactured goods produced and consolidated in ohio are counted in that state s gdp their transport and export from ports across the eastern seaboard support an array of logistics and distribution jobs in various other states industry level employment data in trade dependent regions can thus serve as a harbinger for the rest of the nation and provide clues to the extent of the trade war s effect on the broader economy
we waited too long to figure out if genes are patentable from the now it will only cause problems dept yesterday at the excellent tech policy summit i got to interview stanford professor and ip expert mark lemley on stage lemley has a new book out the patent crisis and how the courts can solve it it s a good read and i recommend it to everyone interested in what s happening with patents i don t agree with everything lemley says in the book but i think it is a much more thoughtful view than you hear coming from the two big industries fighting over patent reform patent reform has been unfairly set up as the tech industry vs the pharma industry and that totally misses the real problems with the system lemley believes that the problems can be fixed via the court system whereas i m not convinced but i do think that the current patent reform proposals miss the mark by a wide margin the interview was quite interesting and while most of it reviewed some of the big discussion points what s the problem where is the reform plan heading does it make sense to carve out exceptions such as for software patents my final question to him was about the lawsuit we wrote about yesterday concerning the patentability of genes lemley did a great job outlining the issues brought forth in the case but concluded by highlighting what i believe is the big problem with letting the courts sort things out he noted that while there had been legal battles over patented genes before they had always been between two biotech firms neither of which wanted to challenge the very idea of gene patents so instead the very concept of patenting genes has been left untested in the courts for twenty five years what s the result well an entire industry built up around it if we suddenly say that genes are unpatentable that will wreak havoc in that industry now that may be a good thing but it highlights the problem of leaving the question to the courts since no one challenged this for so long the disruption could have quite an impact earlier in the interview lemley quoted one of my favorite quotes about the patent system by economist fritz machlup who noted that if we had to do it all over again there appears to be no reason to actually create a patent system but since we already have one it doesn t make sense to get rid of it but that s a big part of the problem now that we already have patented genes and an entire industry built up over 25 years around it some will undoubtedly argue that it doesn t make sense to get rid of gene patents because of all the problems that would cause and thus we re left with a situation that has been highlighted in petra moser s research the patent system by default distorts the market by creating certain industries built up around those patents and makes it very difficult for more complete market forces to take effect filed under gene patents mark lemley patent reform patents companies myriad genetics
malaysia is right in recognising bri kota kinabalu malaysia and other asean countries have taken the correct strategic position to be engaged in the belt road initiative bri says malaysia maritime silk road research society advisor datuk yong teck lee he said the ongoing trade war between america and china is having an unprecedented major negative impact on the global economy advertisement economists and analysts he said are unanimous in their assessments that the trade war started by the us is hurting economies and ordinary people including that of the us the crude way that the us under the trump administration tore apart international agreements has shown to the rest of the world that american leadership is no longer reliable advertisement this unpredictability of the us in world leadership was mentioned by the prime minister malaysia as a reason for the not relying too much on american leadership it is therefore timely that the one belt one road policy initiative by china in 2013 at kazakhstan and jakarta has begun to bear fruits for the economies along the belt road regions advertisement there is no other multi national economic plan in sight that can stimulate the economies of so many countries said yong in a statement he said the formation of the aiib asian infrastructure investment bank a multilateral development bank under the belt road initiative is a practical and welcome mechanism to allow asian countries to invest in their own infrastructure and productive economy the aiib consists of 97 countries including most asian countries canada uk germany saudi arabia australia russia with a portfolio of close to usd 100 trillion in spite of the relentless onslaught of western media campaign against the belt road concept a closer look at the belt road initiative by the countries concerned have convinced these countries to stay with the belt road policy led by china the philippines for example even though it is a close ally of america trade and

that 93 per cent of the current national debt of rm924 9 billion has nothing to do with china or the belt road initiative indeed bank negara figures show that 55 5 per cent of malaysia s national debt

with the motive to turn it into a naval base in fact the newly elected sri lanka government not only found no improper elements in the construction and the financing package but that the port has been able to repay its loans from its container terminal business was reported that the loan for the port amounted to only 1 5pc of sri lanka s external debt ownership never changed hands from sri lanka to china the oft repeated criticism of belt road policy is that it is a debt trap disguised as a loan to ensnare poor countries the allegation is that china gives loans to poor countries to build infrastructure assets such as ports and railways when these countries cannot pay back the loan china will seize the assets this false narrative has been repeated so many times that some people have begun to fall for it what are infrastructure loans the worry is that government loans are a burden on future generations however infrastructure expenditure is capital expenditure it is an investment

shhh don t forward this posting to widows who placed a 100 000 in their savings account over a decade ago and who think they really have 100 000 of purchasing power stashed in their bank account or we might have a bank run on our hands oh the banks would close and even more severe limits on withdrawals would be invoked than are currently in place should a widespread run on the banks ever occur there is no way a run on the banks will ever be allowed to happen again like in the great depression when the stock market crashed in 1929 and anxious depositors withdrew their savings forcing banks to liquidate call in loans which led to many bank failures but let s not lose sight of the fact some banks failed and some savers lost money in the bank induced lending crisis of 2008 the fear of bank failures does not solely belong to eccentric conspiracy theorists by 2011 over 300 us banks had failed the banking system and fdic conducted a slow burn off of its small imprudent lending institutions leaving the bigger offenders alone it was a way for the big banks to swallow up the small one wonders if it was pre planned competition in banking free market banking is not something bankers embrace for example bankers use quasi governmental entities like frannie mae and freddie mac as dumping grounds for their bad loans and the public is never the wiser being told these agencies help make home loans more affordable the news media follows along too so the public is always in the dark end the fed ron paul best price 2 18 buy new 5 68 as of 09 55 utc details wall street has learned its lesson the public uses the stock market as its bellwether for the economy federal plunge protection teams large market infusions by pension plans and other manipulations including provision of near free money to the financial classes help ensure the stock market doesn t become humpty dumpty but then again that makes the stock market a false prop inflation is obfuscation low interest rates on savings drove people out of savings accounts to place their money at greater risk in the stock market in an often futile attempt to beat the rate of inflation said to be 2 0 by the nation s central bank the federal reserve but as economist john williams posting at shadowstats com notes the target inflation rate you read about in the news headlines is 2 0 but in actuality is 5 8 as of april 2019 and ready to move higher as trade tariffs on imports from china loom williams calculates the government gimmicked chained consumer price index price of commonly consumed goods stands at 1 8 but is actually 9 7 based upon older unmanipulated accounting practices back to that widow with the hundred grand let me get back to my illustration here a widow s bank book still says 100 000 a small rate of interest only about one half of 1 per year currently or about 3000 gained over the past decade 2008 2018 for a total of 103 000 a recent advertorial for online banks said bank depositors can earn 155 times more interest just by using a different kind of savings account meaning online banks that don t have buildings and large payrolls as overhead as an article at cnbc com stated most major banks offer an interest rate of 0 01 internet banks offer between 1 00 and 1 55 a 10 000 deposit will yield 155 after one year these are called high yield savings accounts now widows should run to their bank and electronically switch accounts right is a measly 55 difference enough to switch banks how much money do americans earn on their saved money according to available data about 4 trillion of americans money was stashed into savings accounts a decade ago 2009 and that amount grew to around 9 1 trillion a decade later by the end of 2018 see chart below but that chart is misleading the amount held in saving accounts grew from more savings accounts not from more interest earned it was during that time that investors took their money out of riskier investments and stashed them in banks albeit at a loss in yield in pursuit of safety as the federal deposit insurance company now insures savings accounts up to 250 000 here is how valuepenguin com says it u s savings deposits in december 2008 stood at 4 1 trillion having grown in volume but not value b sardi by 29 over the previous 5 years over the next 5 years total savings deposits grew by 74 reaching about 7 1 trillion in 2013 the increased pace of growth in savings deposits has barely slowed with the st louis federal reserve reporting a total of 9 2 trillion in american savings accounts for june 2018 according to shadowstats com due to the real rate of inflation not the target or estimated rate of inflation it would take an accumulated yield totaling 8 6 trillion today 2019 over ten years to equal the 4 trillion in savings accounts

banked money 5 year certificate of deposit cd was 12 0 even in the year 2000 a saver could earn 5 25 or 5250 year on 100 000 account to rescue savers today interest rates paid on savings would have to rise but so would the interest rate on home loans thus crashing the real estate market and would commensurately raise interest paid on the national debt as well but this would back the country into a corner financially where taxes would have to be raised unmercifully to pay hundreds of billions more dollars in interest on the national debt the federal reserve has led the economy into this box canyon economist martin armstrong says the us must cease borrowing money largely from foreigners to pay off the interest on the national debt for which tax payers get no benefit armstrong says the rate of inflation will not significantly rise out of control by just printing money rather than borrowing it this is why economist john williams has questioned whether the federal reserve has lived up to its mandate to keep interest rates low and employment high using the shadowstats com inflation calculator at 0 5 interest one half of 1 u s savers who aggregately had 4 0 trillion in the bank in 2010 would have only gained on a compound rate of interest 180 billion over 9 years 2010 2019 and would have lost 4 6 trillion in purchasing power savers are being lied to the federal deposit insurance co is not talking the federal reserve isn t saying a word even the president as much as he may want to help the little guy and bring jobs back from overseas dares not start a bank run david stockman is along with john williams one of the few economists who dares risk his neck to point out savers are being lied to in his epic rant entitled the central bank war on savers the big lie beneath stockman says 2016 a retired worker who managed to save 5 000 per year over a 40 year s lifetime of toil and sweat in a steel factory now earns in daily interest on a bank cd to wit a single cup of cappuccino yet the central bankers claim they have absolutely nothing to do with this flaming economic injustice that s right a return that amounts to one starbucks cappuccino per day on a 200 000 nest egg is purportedly not the result of massive central bank intrusion in financial markets and pegging interest rates at the zero bound it s owing to a global savings glut and low economic growth did you ever wonder how much cash is in circulation i ve often wondered how much money is in circulation in the u s you know ten twenty one hundred dollar bills nickels dimes quarters etc well in 2009 when the banking lending crisis was in full swing 888 3 billion of coins and federal reserve notes dollar bills of different denominations were in circulation that came to about 2922 04 per

apparently some of those silver backed us notes that were issued during the years john f kennedy was president is still in circulation along with dated currency that is no longer issued 0 2 billion and coins outstanding 47 2 billion that amounts to 5198 per capita of cash everybody was competing for up from 2922 04 a decade earlier of course diluting the money supply is another way of fanning the flames of inflation the currency in circulation grew by 195 from 2008 2018 while the population grew by less than one percent 0 92 from 304 1 million 2008 to 327 2 million 2018 so the u s treasury department flooded more cash money onto the streets there was just a lot more money in wallets and cash registers however more value or economic activity gross domestic product or gdp was not

enriching the fortunes of the financial classes here is the chart directly from the federal reserve itself changes in net worth households and nonprofit organizations the chart graphically depicts the

ngg earnings call for the period ending march 31 2019 national grid plc ngg 2 76 q1 2019 earnings call 4 15 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks aarti singhal director of investor relations welcome to our full year results presentation and a special welcome also to everybody who s watching this online as always we re going to start with safety there are no planned fire alarm tests this morning so if you hear an alarm we do need to leave the building through these doors and then out from reception and i would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement that s included in your packs and as always there will be a q a at the end of this presentation so with that i d like to hand over to john pettigrew john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so thank you aarti and good morning everyone i m joined this morning by andy agg our cfo and as usual nicola shaw and dean seavers are also here to assist with any questions at the end of the presentation so let me begin with the financial highlights from last year on an underlying basis that is excluding the impact of timing major storms and exceptional items operating profit of gbp3 4 billion was down 4 this reflects the expected reduction in u k gas transmission allowances as well as the impact of u s tax reform and slightly higher than anticipated costs underlying earnings per share was up 5 to 58 9 pence this was driven by a lower share count and good performance from our other businesses we also incurred some significant exceptional charges in the last year that are excluded from our underlying results and i ll expand on these shortly we achieved a group return on equity of 11 8 delivering ongoing sustainable returns for our shareholders we invested heavily in network safety reliability and modernization with our capex increasing to gbp4 5 billion driving asset growth of 7 2 and in accordance with our policy we proposed a final dividend of 31 26 pence taking the total dividend for the year to 47 34 pence this represents a 3 1 increase on last year in line with u k inflation so as you can see it s been a solid year of financial performance as you know our safety reliability and customer performance are key to our success during the year we continued our campaign to make safe working second nature for all our employees and contractors and as a result of our efforts we ve maintained an injury frequency rate of 0 1 which is comparable to world class safety performance we also maintained excellent reliability across our networks despite significant winter storms in the u s customer performance has also been a major priority and i m pleased that our customer satisfaction has increased for both our u k and our u s businesses now before i turn to the detail let me outline the strategic highlights for the year starting with capital investment as i just mentioned we had another strong year of organic growth investing gbp4 5 billion and delivering asset growth of 7 2 as i announced last november we exercised our option over our final stake in cadent with gbp2 billion of cash proceeds expected in june in addition we made good regulated progress in the u s with all of our distribution companies now operating under refreshed rates and we continued our regulatory engagement on riio t2 in the u k we also made good progress with our cost efficiency program in the u k taken action to remove cost to make us a more efficient and agile organization and we re also taking undertaking a similar exercise in the u s with regards to our interconnected developments they continued at pace with the commissioning of nemo and the decision to proceed with viking and we also completed on our fulham property site transferring it into the st william joint venture with the berkeley group so i m pleased with the significant progress and continued momentum that we ve made underpinned by strong organic growth so let me now look at the key achievements and developments across the group i ll start with operational performance in the u s we ve achieved a return on equity of 8 8 representing 93 of our allowed returns we had good performance in most of our operating companies however we incurred some higher costs as a result of additional compliance work in new york and restoration work following gas interruption in rhode island our u s business invested 3 5 billion in the year resulting in asset growth of 9 2 up 180 basis points on last year the focus of our investment s been to maintain the safety of our networks while also modernizing them providing better reliability and resilience in addition our new u s cost efficiency initiative is vital in ensuring we deliver our capital investment program as efficiently as possible this is in the context of a business that s more than doubled its capital investment in the last seven years in summary we re streamlining our operations we re simplifying our supply chain and we re rationalizing our property portfolio whilst early in the process this program should deliver cost savings of around 30 million this year and 50 million in 2021 i m also pleased to say that in january we reached a satisfactory agreement on union negotiations with members of our massachusetts gas workforce as a reminder we entered into contingency workforce plans in june which affected about 1 250 union members we did this to seek agreement on the terms and conditions in line with what we d already agreed with many other unions representing approximately 8 000 of our employees during the protracted labor disputes we had to bring in contractors and additional supervision in order to complete almost 65 000 jobs as a result of the contingency plans we incurred exceptional charge of gbp283 million while significant this reflects our commitment to safety and implementing the right contracts for the future and i m pleased that since january we also reached agreement with a further two unions on similar terms to those agreed in massachusetts i m now going to move on to our regulatory progress in the u s during the year we agreed new rates for rhode island and massachusetts gas this completed the full refresh of rates for all of our distribution businesses which is a significant milestone for us on rhode island we ve agreed a three year settlement from september 2018 which allows us a return on equity of 9 3 and an increase in our annual capex allowance to 214 million on massachusetts gas we were awarded an allowed return of 9 5 and annual capex allowance of 413 million this ensures that we can continue the vital pipeline replacement and other safety works that we re doing we re also seeking to support new york s we re also seeking to support new york s clean energy goals with the filing in november for smart meter infrastructure we ve requested 650 million to install over 2 3 million gas and electric meters between 2021 and 2024 and finally we submitted new rate filings for massachusetts electric in kedli and kedny and i ll provide more detail on these later i ll now turn to the u k but before i talk about the key developments in the year i want to quickly remind you about what we ve achieved over the first six years of riio since 2013 the majority of our capital investment has been focused on maintaining our existing networks while facilitating the rapid changes we re seeing in the way energy is generated some of our flagship projects have included the london power tunnels the rebuild of wimbledon substation and the aylesbury catalytic converter project and we ve delivered these with innovative solutions allowing cost efficiency to be shared with customers we ve also replaced over 1 000 kilometers of overhead lines and upgraded almost 700 circuit breakers while delivering critical asset health work across our gas network all of this added together means we ve invested gbp10 billion since the start of riio while generating almost gbp640 million of savings for customers this clearly demonstrates the benefits to all our stakeholders of our regulatory framework that incentivizes both efficient delivery and innovation i ll now move on to the key developments for the u k during the year where our transmission networks have continued to deliver with another gbp1 2 billion of investment this includes 2 projects that i m particularly proud of we completed the first new electricity overhead line in england and wales since in 16 years this canterbury to richborough connection is a 21 kilometer route that was built in only 15 months enabling the connection of the nemo interconnector and secondly our tunnel into the humber for our feeder 9 replacement project is now 75 complete and this represents the largest single investment in our gas infrastructure in a decade it will also be the world s longest tunnel pipeline river crossing i ll now focus on u k operational performance here we delivered another good year of returns with a return on equity of 12 4 within the range of 200 to 300 basis points of our performance that we ve committed to under riio t1 as i announced in november our cost efficiency program is well under way and this will make us more agile while strengthening our position ahead of riio t2 as a result we re on track to become a flatter and leaner organization with a simplified way of working and more efficient it and back office activities we ve incurred gbp136 million of restructuring costs for this and expect to deliver cost savings of gbp50 million this financial year and gbp100 million from 2021 in september ofgem reached the final decision on funding for certain projects which are subject to reopeners as we entered into riio t1 and as i said november we were pleased that ofgem allowed the necessary funding for physical and cyber security however we were disappointed not to get the full funding for our compressor works in addition we also reached another milestone on operation performance with the legal separation of the electricity system operator from the 1st of april 2019 and finally as you will have seen in the press recently both the nugen and the horizon nuclear projects have been canceled along with the proposed connection agreements with us under ifrs we ve recognized an exceptional charge of gbp137 million for the development cost however the regulatory arrangements we have in place have substantially mitigated the economic impact of these cancellations so let me now turn to national grid ventures where we continue to make significant progress on our interconnected portfolio the nemo project which is a gbp265 million investment and a 1 gigawatt 140 kilometer link with belgium was commissioned two months early and under budget progress on our new interconnector to france and norway which is ifa2 and nsl have continued on track the construction of the converter stations on ifa2 is going well and we ve now laid over 270 kilometers of the cable for our link to norway during the year we made final investment decisions of viking our interconnector to denmark and we already have all the planning approvals needed and we ll start construction early next year in march we also announced our proposed acquisition of geronimo energy on a joint venture with the washington state investment board and we expect to complete on this in june subject to the usual approvals this is our first meaningful step into renewable generation in the u s providing us with a pipeline of over 6 gigawatts of solar and wind projects at different stages of development on the joint venture we ll hold the renewable assets that are developed by geronimo i ll now turn to the property business and in particular the sale of the fulham gas works having completed significant infrastructure work including demolishing redundant gas holders we successfully transferred the 17 acre site to saint william the site will now be developed over the next decade and we ll recognize further profit on the land as well as our share of development profits as the apartments are sold and i m pleased that of the 1 850 apartments 650 of them will be affordable homes in the center of london so in summary i m pleased to report that we made good progress over the last year with high levels of organic growth across the group we delivered against our priorities to date and we re well set for the coming year more on this shortly but first let me hand over to andy to discuss the financial performance in more detail andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director thank you john and good morning everyone as we go through this morning s presentation you ll see we ve refreshed the slides and we re providing additional granularity on our performance measures turning to results at constant currency underlying operating profit was down 4 reflecting the expected return of avonmouth revenues the impact of u s tax reform partly offset by higher property profits and favorable u s legal settlements eps was up 5 reflecting a lower interest count sorry lower interest charge and tax rate as well as a reduced share count our good operational performance was reflected in the 11 8 return on equity and a 6 improvement in value added per share our asset base grew strongly by 7 2 reflecting higher capital investment and the benefit of tax reform in the u s the dividend of 47 34 pence per share is 3 higher in line with our policy let s look at the performance of each of our segments u k electricity transmission delivered another year of strong operational performance achieving a 13 7 return on equity this included totex outperformance of 230 basis points an improvement on the prior year our totex outperformance was due to continued focus on innovation and efficiency as well as the additional cyber and physical security allowances from september s reopener filings other incentive performance of 50 basis points was also higher than last year due to improved customer stakeholder reliability and system operator performance additional allowances contributed 70 basis points in line with last year underlying operating profit of gbp1 1 billion was up 4 largely due to higher net revenues this was partially offset by costs associated with eso separation higher depreciation and other costs capital investments of gbp925 million was lower than last year primarily due to lower load related spend these investments along with the inflation linked growth in the rav increased year end regulated asset value by 3 8 to gbp13 5 billion as john mentioned earlier we ve recognized a one off charge of gbp137 million associated with the nugen and horizon nuclear projects existing price control arrangements covered the substantial majority of these costs as you know we also recognized an exceptional charge relating to our u k efficiency program we re already seeing early benefits from this work and excluding the eso separation costs i mentioned earlier there are almost no cost increases in the underlying business moving now to u k gas transmission which delivered a return on equity of 9 5 slightly lower than last year this reflects the lower compressor allowances from the reopeners other incentive performance is strong as our network continues to benefit from our investment program operating profit was down primarily due to the expected return of avonmouth allowances controllable costs were slightly lower as we began to see the benefits of the u k cost efficiency program and depreciation decreased however these were more than offset by an increase in other costs relating to the non recurrence of one off provision releases last year capital investment was gbp308 million in line with last year and the regulated asset value grew by 3 3 to gbp6 2 billion turning now to our u s business where the return on equity was 8 8 93 of the allowed underlying operating profit decreased 10 to gbp1 6 billion at constant currency net revenues were up gbp99 million reflecting significant rate increases partially offset by tax reform and the impact of adopting ifrs 15 as you know the effect of tax reform reverses the net income level and is economically neutral for utilities over the longer term controllable costs increased due to the rhode island gas interruption and additional safety compliance work in new york depreciation increased due to growth in the rate base and other cost increases included higher minor storm activity additional decommissioning costs in new york and bad debt of the cost increases i ve mentioned around gbp80 million are not expected to recur next year we increased the investment in our u s networks to gbp2 7 billion or 3 5 billion this meant rate base grew by 9 to 22 9 billion assets outside rate base were 2 5 billion and these largely relate to capital work in progress finally as john mentioned we recognized an 88 million exceptional charge relating to our efficiency program in the context of fast growing business we expect to generate savings of 30 million in fy 20 and 50 million of annual savings from fy 21 onwards today i m pleased to provide additional u s gaap disclosure to better rate comparison with other u s utilities who report under this standard i ll start with a bridge between the ifrs performance i ve just discussed and u s gaap as you know ifrs accounting rules don t always fully reflect the regulatory performance of the u s business u s gaap tends to be a better measure of this performance for us the largest adjustments between ifrs and u s gaap are from the accounting treatment of the regulated recovery for environmental and storm costs under u s gaap these costs are deferred to the balance sheet until we receive the associated revenue whereas under ifrs costs are immediately expensed other adjustments include differences in treatment for items such as depreciation and asset decommissioning costs you can see on the slide how we go from ifrs profit this year to u s gaap profit the final item relates to levelization this is simply a regulatory mechanism to defer agreed regulatory revenues so that bill increases for customers can be phased in over time now let s look at how our u s business performs under u s gaap we already provide asset growth and return on equity numbers for each regulated business so you can track how our capital investments translate into asset growth and ultimately into returns for shareholders to supplement this from today we re reporting adjusted u s gaap earnings for the u s business this represents the achieved return on equity multiplied by the equity portion of the rate base capturing performance against rate plans and rate base growth for fy 19 adjusted u s capital earnings on rate base were 967 million assuming a 50 50 regulatory capital structure to aid comparisons of earnings of other u s utilities you would need to also take into account the 75 million of noncash interest on assets currently outside of rate base which would increase earnings to around 1 04 billion and as the group is geared at around 65 if we were to apply the group gearing to the u s business this would increase post tax interest costs by around 100 million let s turn to the recent performance of our adjusted u s gaap earnings over the last 2 years they ve increased by 12 5 per year on average this was driven by average asset growth of 8 plus the 60 basis points increase in our achieved return on equity since fy 17 looking ahead adjusted u s gaap earnings growth is supported by future rate base growth and the achieved return on equity which next year we expect will be at least 95 of the allowed return over the medium term we can expect adjusted u s gaap earnings to increase broadly in line with our rate based growth turning now to national grid ventures which contributed gbp316 million to the group this is an increase of 10 on last year mainly due to reduced business development costs metering grain lng and interconnected profits were broadly consistent with last year capital investment increased again to gbp444 million with the first of our 4 new interconnected projects nemo completing toward the end of the year as we said before we expect around gbp250 million of ebitda contribution from our new interconnectors from fy 25 onwards moving to our other activities where the total contribution to group profit was gbp124 million compared to a small net charge in the prior year this reflects the sale of the fulham site and the gbp95 million in legal settlements partially offset by a one off pension charge our venture capital business national grid partners increased its investments in innovative technology start ups which will provide benefits in the future to the core business financing costs decreased by 1 to gbp993 million despite an increase in average net debt this was primarily due to lower u k rpi the effective interest rate also decreased from 4 6 to 4 3 the underlying effective tax rate was 19 6 this is 420 basis points lower primarily as a result of a full year impact from u s tax reform underlying earnings increased to gbp2 billion and as you ve heard underlying earnings per share increased to 58 9p per share operating cash flow was gbp4 5 billion gbp238 million lower than last year higher underlying operating cash flows were more than offset by the cash cost of the exceptional charges we ve discussed earlier during the year we raised nearly gbp3 billion of new long term financing largely in the u s closing that debt was gbp26 5 billion with a gbp1 5 billion adverse movement in exchange rates and a further gbp2 billion underlying increase this was slightly below our expectations of gbp2 5 billion partly due to timing over recoveries in the u s helping to offset the cash impact of the exceptional items our credit metrics benefited from the over recoveries in the u s the rcf to debt ratio was 9 4 or 10 8 excluding exceptional items s p s ffo to debt metric was at 12 6 or 14 7 excluding exceptionals during the year we also reduced the level of the balance sheet hedged by our u s assets to around 80 this better aligns our debt portfolio with the currency mix of our retained cash flow as a result our u s dollar denominated currency balance stood at 21 billion down from 25 billion last year as we look ahead to next year we expect capital investment to increase close to gbp5 billion and to remain at around that level in fy 21 in our u s regulated business we continue to invest to update and to modernize our networks this is supported by our recent regulatory filings for massachusetts electric and downstate new york gas investment in the u k regulated business will increase primarily driven by asset health spend comprising around 2 3 of the capital program and by undergrounding of transmission lines in dorset in our national grid ventures and other activities segment we expect to see a significant increase in our interconnector capital spend together with the initial investments in geronimo energy as a result we expect continued high quality asset growth of around 7 in fy 20 and fy 21 our objective is to maintain an efficient balance sheet for our current rating this means regulated gearing in the mid 60 range we do this by maintaining a balance between cash generation and capital investments while delivering dividend growth as expected our regulated gearing at march 2019 was 66 which will reduce in june when we receive the final cadent sale proceeds with capital investments expected to rise to close to gbp5 billion in fy 20 we ll continue to fund the group through issuing new debt at attractive rates internally generated capital delivered through strong financial performance and additional capital from the scrip dividend option which was put in place to support the business during higher growth periods we therefore expect to continue to utilize the scrip dividend in fy 20 and fy 21 as a result we expect gearing to remain around the mid 60 level through to fy 21 value added was gbp2 1 billion or 61 20p per share this comprised the growth in group assets of gbp3 billion driven by increased capex cash dividends paid of gbp1 2 billion and this year s underlying growth in net debt of gbp2 1 billion finally in line with our dividend policy the board has recommended a final dividend of 31 26p per share bringing the proposed full year dividend to 47 34p i d now like to summarize our technical guidance for fy 20 and as ever you can find more details in our full year results statement overall we expect our combined u k regulated businesses to continue to deliver 200 to 300 basis points of outperformance including the benefits of the gbp50 million of efficiency savings in the u s returns are expected to increase to at least 95 of the allowed return benefiting from updated rates the nonrepeat of this year s cost headwinds as well as the cost efficiencies we expect to deliver national grid ventures and other activities will reflect the nonrecurrence of the significant fulham transaction and the legal settlements that benefited fy 19 we will see a first full year of nemo in operation and the first year of development profits in our property joint venture our interest charge will increase reflecting an increase in average net debt and the nonrepeat of one off gains and we expect a tax rate of around 21 in fy 20 net debt is expected to increase by around gbp1 billion including the benefit of the gbp2 billion of cadent proceeds expected in june and gbp0 4 billion increase from the impact of ifrs 16 so to summarize we have efficiently delivered on our gbp4 5 billion capital program we have maintained good returns performance and the balance sheet remains strong funding 7 asset growth in the near term and reflecting our continued commitment to our progressive dividend policy now john will take you through the priorities and outlook for the coming year john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so thank you andy so let me now turn to our longer term objectives and priorities for the year ahead i strongly believe that national grid has a critical role to play in enabling the energy transition to a low carbon future power and heat networks sit right at the heart of the energy system therefore it s our responsibility to continue to create value for our customers and society more broadly while anticipating and responding to their changing needs to deliver a service that meets those changing requirements we need to build and maintain world class networks that are safe reliable resilient and smart and while we re already investing in these areas today we recognize that we need to go further innovating evolving and developing new tools and systems we also recognize that we have a role to play in helping to drive the decarbonization of the economy this role includes enabling the connection of renewables ensuring we take on a whole system approach facilitating the growth in the electrification of transport and developing solutions to decarbonize heat by undertaking this role we will deliver stronger returns for our shareholders over the long term and it s with this in mind that i now turn to look at our priorities and outlook for the year ahead i ll start with the u s where we have three key focus areas firstly a continued focus on improving our customer experience secondly the efficient and safe delivery of our services and thirdly reaching fair and progressive regulatory settlements on customer experience we ve already invested significantly in digital solutions such as our customer e billing portal and we ll continue to invest this year working toward our longer term ambition of paperless billing for everyone on the terms of the efficient and safe delivery of our services we re making significant investments in our it systems for our gas business these systems will enable a more efficient management of our field force a more responsive service for our customers and further cost improvements on regulation we filed for new rates for massachusetts electric in november last year and for and for kedny and kedli this april our regulatory structure across the u s is to move rates to be more forward looking incentive based and multi year and this will allow us to plan our works in the most cost effective way by introducing more incentive opportunities regulation will drive more efficient outcomes which will benefit customers and drive higher returns for shareholders for massachusetts electric we submitted proposals to allow for up to a five year settlement this will give us good visibility in the funding of our investment plans and allow for annual inflationary cost increases offset by efficiency savings as part of this filing we ve also taken the opportunity to advance the state s carbonization goals this included a request for funding for over 17 000 electric vehicle charging points and the installation of a 14 megawatt battery storage system separately we re asking for return on equity of 10 5 this filing will support annual investment of 300 million an increase of 50 million on the existing rate plan and we expect to view the outcome for this filing in september for kedny and kedli we submitted a request for a combined annual capex allowance of 1 5 billion this is a 50 step up from our existing allowances this increase in capex has been driven by a number of factors including the need for increased pipeline replacement enhancements to pipeline safety improved system resilience and modernization of our lng facilities importantly the filing also includes proposals to support a low carbon energy future this includes developing a green gas tariff and projects to facilitate the increased use of renewable natural gas our full year proposal includes return on equity of 9 65 and we expect rates to come into effect from april 2020 i ll now turn to the u k outlook where we also have three focus areas firstly embedding the cost efficiency program secondly delivering our capital investment as efficiently as possible and thirdly continuing to help to shape the regulatory framework for the benefit of customers and all stakeholders starting with the cost efficiency program where this year we ll be going live with new it systems which will provide better data to improve decision making and simplify our processes further across the organization on capital investment our key priorities will include completing the tunneling for feeder 9 starting work on the second london power tunnel which will provide additional capacity and resilience to our networks across south london and initiating the works on the undergrounding of our power lines through dorset as part of our visual impact program with regards to the regulatory frameworks it s critical that we continue to enable the necessary the investments to maintain the excellence safety and reliability we ve all come to expect from our networks it s also important that we continue to ensure the rapid decarbonization of the u k energy system and encourage innovation to the benefit of all customers more specifically as you re aware ofgem s riio t2 sector specific consultation was published last december as you have seen in our response in march while the initial proposals are a step in the right direction we don t think they ll bring about the right changes for consumers for the long term we provided feedback on three areas of concern the level of allowed returns the outperformance wedge and the approach to incentivization as you know the overall financial package is key balancing both a fair return and appropriate cash flows taking a balanced approach to risk and correcting for the errors in the calculation that we see we believe the fair real rpi return on equity is 5 5 with regards to the process we expect ofgem to publish its decision on the consultation next week we ll be submitting our initial business plans in july for further stakeholder comments before sharing our final plans in december and we re continuing to work constructively with ofgem to seek a framework that puts customers at the center of this price control enables the ng networks of the future and allows for a fair return for our investors so staying with the regulatory matters let me now turn to hinkley as you know we ve already started the construction of the project in accordance with our contract with edf ofgem continue to develop the necessary license modifications to introduce the competition proxy model and as we set out previously we continue to believe this mechanism is not in the long term interest of customers we ll wait to see what the final modification to our license looks like later this summer before taking a decision on the appropriate next steps so finally turning to national grid ventures where the major focus will be the continued investment we re making in our european interconnectors we continue to see interconnectors as a very cost effective way of widening the sources of electricity for the u k as well as connecting to low carbon and renewable options in fact when the three interconnectors we have under construction are completed our total interconnected capacity will be 7 8 gigawatts and almost 90 of that will come from low carbon sources and by the end of this year we ll have made real progress in the completion of most of the construction works in ifa2 we re aiming to be halfway through the cabling on our norwegian link and on viking we ll have started the manufacture of the cable and the converter stations and with regards to geronimo the deal should close next month and we plan to complete the construction of the crocker wind farm in south dakota this autumn so having set out our priorities for the coming year i now want to focus on how these priorities continue to integrate and reflect our environmental and sustainability goals and we re making good progress here for example in u k electricity transmission in our trial project at sandwich in kent we were the first utility in the world to use low carbon emissions insulating gas at 400 000 volts on climate change we set ourselves ambitious decarbonization targets and i m proud to say that we ve already reduced our emissions by 68 and of course we ll be reviewing our existing target of 80 by 2050 following the recent recommendation from the committee on climate change to reach net 0 emissions by 2050 and on sustainability our business activities enable us to make significant contributions to a number of the un sustainability developing goals in particular the affordable and clean energy and climate action goals but we also want to contribute to others we ve taken action on life on land where we set ourselves a target to recognize and enhance the value of the natural environment of at least 50 of our sites we ve worked with multiple partners and community organizations across the u k to deliver enhancements to 38 sites so far this cover more than 400 hectares of land and consist a wide variety of habitats and species and we re also addressing good health and well being this commitment includes access for all our employees to help the well being services including mental health services such as counseling and psychological therapies we re also one of a small number of organizations that supports the government s inclusive economy partnership this has included us playing a key role in developing a framework that supports employers to voluntarily report on disability mental health and well being in the workplace this is a long term priority and we ll continue to update you on our future progress so as you can see we ve a large number of priorities across the group this year including continuing to focus on our customers embedding cost savings and efficiently delivering investment plans and as andy has outlined earlier based on our current investment plans we expect to see another step up this year to nearly gbp5 billion and this elevates the level of investments expected to continue into 2021 delivering many benefits for our customers in total our asset base is expected to grow strongly by around 7 in 1920 and 2021 and the vast majority of this critical investment is covered by existing regulatory arrangements and it s our responsibility to deliver that investment efficiently which in turn generates long term value for our shareholders so in summary as i mentioned power and heat networks sit at the heart of the energy system and we create value for our customers by delivering world class networks and driving decarbonization in the last year we ve invested gbp4 5 billion in an efficient and disciplined way delivering strong organic growth we made good progress on our strategic priorities helping to underpin our total return proposition and we ve delivered significant customer benefits so far we ve also taken positive steps in evolving our regulatory frameworks in the u s and contributed to the shape of riio t2 in the u k and all of these have been achieved while maintaining a strong balance sheet and a continued commitment to our progressive dividend policy now just before we move on to your questions i m pleased to announce that we ll be hosting an investor seminar on our u s business in september where dean and his leadership team will provide a deep dive into the business and our outlook for the future the event will take place in the 20th of september in london and on the 23rd of september in new york so thank you very much for your attention this morning andy dean nick and i will be happy to answer any of your questions questions and answers christopher robert laybutt jp morgan chase co analyst thank you very much chris laybutt jpmorgan two questions for me slide 20 andy could you please step through the bridge from the asset level gap to the 1 04 billion figure again just for my benefit and are we to assume that that figure is a pretty decent representation of your gaap earnings for the holdco so i guess that s question one and then question two in terms of the 65 gearing level given riio 2 brings with it some uncertainties is that still the right level for national grid and is the board and are you as a management team still comfortable with that level andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director thank you so on the first one so as i defined on slide 20 yes so yes so the what the chart is presenting is an addition to the u s gaap earnings of the rate base business which is the u s segment operating segment the additional 75 million that we ve called out there and added in the which is the accrued earnings and assets outside the rate base includes things at either the serveco or holdco level as well as some of the capital work in progress that hasn t yet gone into the rate base so it s trying to represent the overall earnings gaap earnings from the u s business the second piece on gearing i think we ve guided this morning through to balance sheet leverage through to fy 21 and set out again the key tools that we use to manage the balance sheet i think it s early when we think about what 21 onwards or 22 onwards might look like with riio 2 still working through the rate cases we filed in the u s working through what those will look like but we re confident today the leverage is in the right place we have the right tools and we re confident with where the balance sheet is jenny ping citigroup inc analyst hi it s jenny ping from citi just following on from chris question back to page 20 andy just to confirm the interest cost that you ve got there 457 million does that include the intercompany loan charges of the 1 7 billion that you ve got and what would that number look like with that intercompany loan and therefore impact on earnings andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director so what we ve tried doing there is effectively a notional regulatory interest charge so based on allowed cost of debt i mean a 50 assume 50 50 regulatory capital structure as with our u k opco is exactly how we fund and how we move cash around is a fungible part of how we manage our debt book jenny ping citigroup inc analyst so that would come in in the 100 million additional that you talked about if assuming a gearing of 65 andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director so the 100 million on the left is purely going from 50 50 to take gearing up to 65 the additional cost of that debt jenny ping citigroup inc analyst fine and also just on that have you can you give us the year end net debt number for the u s business with or without that 1 7 billion intercompany loan andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director i think we ll get back to how we think about gearing from a group level and then we have opportunities to raise debt both as an opco a holdco level u k and u s so what we tried to guide here is if you took group gearing and applied it to the u s level the actual level of gearing within our u s holdco will be slightly higher as you said there s intercompany debt involved in that we ve tried to give you what an external view of our u s business would look like jenny ping citigroup inc analyst and one last one big picture wise in terms of energy transition i just wondered what your latest thoughts are on your gas transmission networks in the u k specifically given that there is the push for decarbonization given the works have been done or started at least on hydrogen and what your thoughts are on that asset whether it should belong to the group longer term thanks john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director in terms of gas transmission i think everyone recognizes that gas has got an incredibly important role to play as part of decarbonization journey 80 of u k heat comes from natural gas and 40 of u k electricity generation comes from natural gas i think there s a lot of work to be done over the next few years in really understanding what s the optimal way to look to decarbonize the gas network we have a number of projects under way looking at one how much hydrogen could you inject into the network without having to require people to change their appliances we re also looking at whether the network can be converted to hydrogen for example in the long term and what s the interaction between hydrogen molecules and the steel networks that we ve got and we are also looking at opportunities around sort of how you inject more green gas into the network as well so there s a lot of work to be done i think over the next few years to find out what s the optimum route what is clear is the gas networks have a very an important role to play for many many years to come and you ll see in our draft business plans that we ll be submitting to ofgem quite soon that actually the levels of investment that are needed in the gas networks will continue for many years to come as well arjan zany credit suisse analyst thank you good morning arjan zany from credit suisse i had two questions please firstly with labour s policy to create a national energy agency would you consider splitting the business into two in the u k and the u s to protect the value in the u s and secondly would you also consider adopting measures in your labour documents such as being civil society members on board to reach labour s objectives without getting an asset expropriated john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director sure the second i didn t quite catch it arjan zany credit suisse analyst so would you consider adopting measures in the labour documents to reach labour s objectives without getting an asset expropriated john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director let me just talk about nationalization as it s the topic of the day to make sure people understand where we re coming from so our position very clearly is that we don t believe that the proposal the labour has set out are in the interest of consumers in the u k the key question i think to be asked is what s the problem that the state ownership is trying to solve and from our perspective when we look at the proposals it s not clear to us so the u k has one of the world s most reliable and safe networks as you know we re investing massively in the networks the national grid invested gbp10 billion over the last six years as i said this morning we re very conscious of the affordability agenda as well and we ve returned gbp640 million to customers over the first six years of riio t2 when you look at the decarbonization agenda there needs to be a recognition that actually there s a huge amount of progress that s already happened and national grid is the key enabler of that so last year 49 6 of all the generation in the u k came from zero carbon sources we all celebrated last week the week where there was first time we had generation without any coals first time since queen victoria was on the throne and national grid is investing in things like interconnectors as i said this morning which will be 90 clean energy there s still a huge amount to do but when we look at the labour proposals it s very clear that that will not either accelerate the decarbonization agenda in the u k nor will it result in lower cost for customers all there is it will be a huge distraction and it will be actually it will delay the decarbonization in the u k and potentially increase cost to customers so our position at the moment is to make sure that people understand that and we engage with labour on a regular basis and within the labour party there are people who have an ideology and to be blunt i m never going to convince and there are people actually who don t have the view that state ownership is the right route and we will continue to engage with them as we do more generally the general public so they understand the role that national grid is playing and actually where the u k economy is in terms of decarbonization which is we made great progress there s a long way to go and the committee on climate change has if anything said we need to accelerate to deliver that you want companies like national grid to be agile to be embracing new technology and to be innovative and to meet the needs of the changing needs of customers so that s the position we come from in terms of that in terms of splitting the company the board has a duty to consider valuation of the business and it does that as you d expect on a regular basis but we don t see splitting national grid as a response to what is currently a proposal by the labour party in terms of board more broadly actually national grid under section 172 its obligations always wants to ensure that it s got a broad set of inputs in terms of the key stakeholders and any decision that the board of national grid makes it s always considering the broad stakeholders whether it s customers whether it s regulators or other broader key stakeholders fraser andrew mclaren bofa merrill lynch analyst hey good morning it s fraser mclaren from bank of america merrill lynch just three questions for me please first of all can you elaborate on the issues that you ve had with the western link please where is the problem now and is there any liability for national grid or implications for the other links that you re working on the second question is about the gbp400 million increase in net debt by virtue of ifrs adoption to what extent does that put pressure on the actual credit metrics and then lastly the hinkley license mods are just moving back farther and farther why is that and what s the revised scale of time for making a decision on any appeal thank you john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director okay thank you why don t i do the first and the third and i ll give andy the second so in terms of western link i mean if we just step back so western link as a project is going to deliver significant benefits for customers going forward and when we ve begun through the finishing phase we ve seen when it s operating that it s going to deliver those benefits to customers it is an innovative project this is the longest deep sea cable in the world that s operating at 600 kv and inevitably when you re doing innovative projects you sometimes see teething problems it is clearly a frustration to us to have the latest fault it was a cable fault our contractors which are siemens and prysmian are working full tilt to get it resolved and we re hopeful actually that this fault will be fixed by around about the end of this month so that s where we are with it in terms of liabilities national grid has very robust contracts around western link so for late delivery there will be penalties to our contractors and we continue to engage with ofgem as you d expect on a regular basis to make sure they re understanding all the activities and all the things that we re doing to make sure we commission it as quickly as possible in terms of hinkley i agree it has slipped back our position is we re waiting to see the license from ofgem until we can see that license it s difficult for us to make a decision on how we move forward we re hopeful that we ll see it in the next couple of months we engage with ofgem on a regular basis and we re encouraging them to give us the final license so that we can make that decision but at the moment we re waiting to see when ofgem are going to do that andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director and on the ifrs 16 question lease accounting although that adds into our net debt position it s already taken account of in the credit metric calculations elsewhere so there ll be no overall impact on our credit metrics dominic charles nash barclays bank plc analyst hi it s dominic nash from barclays a couple of questions please in the u s so firstly what you re guiding for group asset growth at the high end at 7 can you just give a quick breakdown again what your medium term u s growth will be please and following on from that so it s like a 1b rather than a second question you say that you say that u s net income will be rising in line with asset growth going forward is that basically any way that can work is that you assume that your 9 roe is sustainable going forward on those maths my second question is on kedny kedli massive increase in potential earnings base there and capex on the rapex program there could you remind us what percentage of your network is going to get replaced in that four year period and so how many years of investment can we look forward to in that division please john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director okay so why don t i start with kedli and kedny and i ll come back to the first question 1a and 1b so with regards to kedli and kedny we ve been in significant dialogue with the new york state regulator as we prepared to put this filing in so as you know we ve come into the end of the three year filing where we re spending around about 1 billion a year i set out this morning some of the key drivers as to why we think that needs to increase importantly when we did the filing a few weeks ago the feedback from the regulator was it was as expected now the utilities in the u s have seen press releases from the regulator following a filing because they were surprised so i m quite pleased that at least it s in line with the expectations we now go through a very long process with kedli and kedny as you know it would be probably toward the end of this year if we get to a settlement before we get an outcome and that includes four months of discovery and q a what we tried to do in the filing as we always do now with rate filings in the u s is to create some optionality for the regulators so we re very clear about what the things that we believe must be done from a safety perspective and what things there is opportunity to do in either slightly longer or to defer depending what the impact is on customer bills we do have some opportunity i think in new york because with the tax reform in commodity prices there is some headroom to actually for to be able to take forward some of the policy agenda items in new york without having a significant impact on bills but at this level of rate filing it will impacting customer bills so we ll work through that what percentage i ll come back to you i can t remember what the percentage is what i would say is we re at the early stages of what effectively is the we call it lead from pipe replacement program in the u s a major replacement program is what you d call it in the u k if you remember that program we re at the very early stages so this will be a multiyear program how quickly we do it we will work with the regulator to make sure we get the balance right between doing what s right from a safety perspective recognizing the impact on customers i forgot what your first question was dominic charles nash barclays bank plc analyst basically the split between the u s and u k within that 7 asset growth and the implied does that they are very remain constant in the u s john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes so in terms of the u s this year we were at 3 5 billion the spend is on 9 2 we re expecting for the next couple of years for it to stay at that or slightly above that level so we re expecting continued strong growth well above 7 in the u s and that when you apply that to the group with pretty constant investment in the u k so we re expecting 1 2 billion 1 3 billion for the next couple years and with the interconnectors get you to the top end of our 7 range so in terms of returns we ve guided today so this year u s entered 93 of the allowed returns we re expecting to be above 95 next year james brand deutsche bank ag analyst james brand from deutsche bank three questions please the first is on u k investment and obviously the initial proposals from ofgem have been very tough in terms of the allowed rate of return which you ve obviously highlighted often when utilities are going through challenging regulatory settlements they often say that this could be a threat to investment and you re obviously thinking pretty carefully about what you might want to propose in investment given that you said you re going to be presenting your initial business plan in july so just wondering how you approach that do you try and scale back investment or do you pay it very straight and you work out exactly what needs to be done and the return budget maybe doesn t affect that decision that much second question is just on the u s it spend for the gas business i m just wondering whether all of that was recoverable under the regulatory assessment i e whether the investment there goes into the rav or not and then thirdly i think it was a year ago and it was andy bonfield that kind of suggested that there may be changes implemented around the dollar hedging that you have in place that you d already you try to hedge both the equity and the debt value in the u s by having a dollar debt so just wondering whether that ended up see with andy coming in whether there ended up being any changes around that or not whether there are any changes planned thanks john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so let me do the first then andy the third so in terms of the regulatory process in the u k and where we re at on returns and investment so i think that we in this room we ve been very clear in our response in march that we don t think a 3 return provides a fair balance between the risk and reward that we perceive in riio t2 and our response are set out very quickly where we think ofgem have made some errors in their calculation but also what s an appropriate return based on where current interest rates are and our perception of the relative risk of a transmission business relative to the market so we re setting that out where we re hopeful that the arguments that we ve made have been listened to and we ll see what ofgem says next 23rd of may when is that next thursday i think it is when the document comes out in terms of the investment profile i mean we re at a very early stage one of the things we were pleased about in terms of ofgem s proposal was this is a price control it s very much driven by the needs of customers and stakeholders so we re in quite intensive discussions with stakeholders about what are the needs of the or what are their needs going forward from us as a utility and as a network what will come out at the beginning of july is an early indication what our stakeholders are telling us and we re taking that requirement and converting it into what that might mean for capex we ve got a long process to go through that will run in parallel between getting the right return and the right overall financial package and making sure that we ve got the right investments to meet our obligations but also to support the decarbonization agenda so you ll see that evolve i think over the next six to nine months as we go forward in terms of the it spend the vast majority is actually recovered through the rate base we actually it s a huge investment right across our u s business to enable our gas workforce it s been needed for some time but we actually aligned the rollout of that investment to reflect the rate cases that we were doing so that we can maximize the recovery and make sure it s part of the rate base andrew andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director yes on the dollar hedge question actually and so you mentioned that at a speech last year so some work had started with andrew in my previous role as treasurer i mentioned this morning in the speech that we brought the overall level of dollar hedging down to around 80 of the total u s asset value that s slightly lower than it was previously it s about a 4 billion reduction in the mix of dollar debt in the portfolio and the rationale for that is effectively when we looked at it we the top up was to do with goodwill and if you look at the currency flows you don t get cash coming out of the goodwill balance so we brought the level of hedge down to reflect more of the rate base balance samuel james hugo arie ubs investment bank analyst hi thank you sam arie from ubs i had a follow up question on ofgem and the price control and then one apologies again on the nationalization topic but on ofgem so you ve mentioned your consultation response which was pretty directly worded and you think that ofgem has got their math wrong and i m just wondering can remind us what are your options if ofgem come back with no change can you appeal only sort of within the ofgem tribunal under your license condition or is this something that ends up in the court system john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so you re right we were very clear i d say in terms of our response to the consultation also i think we were very helpful and we ve had some feedback from ofgem staff that we were so not only did we say what we didn t like but we put forward some proposals and what we thought was sensible to get the right regulatory regime going forward and we continue to have constructive dialogue with ofgem this has still got a very long way to go so we re publishing effectively a draft business plan in july which will then be critiqued by the challenge group and stakeholder group we don t actually submit our business plan until december this year and then ultimately ofgem will make a decision until the end of 2020 in the event that the proposals and the final decision by ofgem are not acceptable then national grid as other networks has the option to refer it to the cma and in the energy sector you can refer the whole package or you can refer single items within the package so that is the sort of the route that would be followed in the event that we couldn t get a sensible outcome samuel james hugo arie ubs investment bank analyst okay very helpful and can i could i ask my follow up on the nationalization topic too so and i think you set out your views on that policy very clearly what i think was new in this week s document from the labour party was i suppose a confirmation in writing that although the nationalization price that they think about would be set in parliament it could include deductions relating to a whole list of other topics like the pension deficit asset sales the state of the assets in the business and so on i m sure you ve looked at this but can you comment at all on what you think the legal protections might be against that kind of approach john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes so as you d expect we look very carefully at the party s proposals and we ll go through we still don t believe it s the right thing to actually go to state ownership but the government has an obligation to pay fair value for the assets there s lots of debate and lots of narrative across the industry about how you define fair value but in the event that the labour party go forward and tries to pay less than fair value then there are several legal routes available including the european courts in terms of human rights and a whole host of other areas in terms of treaties so we understand the legal mechanisms that would have to be applied by our investors in the event that was to happen clearly we continue to focus on making sure that people understand that we don t think state ownership will solve the problems that labour has been setting out martin young investec inc analyst hi it s martin young from investec just one question continuing on the this nationalization debate if we take a step back a number of years when miliband came out with the idea for capping retail prices in the u k you can imagine it was such as best as a labour policy at the time skip forward a number of years parts of that we re picked up by different political parties and we ve ended up where we are today with the price cap on parts of the markets if you look at what labour here put out scrap out the bits that you think are a bit crazy on ideological grounds you can probably find bits in it that resonate with the public is there a clear risk that those are picked up by political parties of all colors and that going forward we have a considerably tighter regulatory settlement than we ve ever had before and quite clearly there are differences between what you feel is fair and what ofgem currently has on the table and you can probably say that some of the things that ofgem are trying to push through are indeed responding to some of the underlying points that have been picked up by various people out there so just wondered if you could give a few thoughts on how tight you feel regulation could land john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes i mean there s one thing we do agree with labour on which is the aspiration to decarbonize the economy the fundamental difference we have is the approach to achieve that which will minimize cost for customers and will do it in a sensible and timely way in terms of regulation i think we ve set out quite clearly what we believe is an appropriate regulatory framework to encourage and deliver the infrastructure investment that s going to be needed over the next five years it is quite clear from ofgem s document and actually we acknowledged this in our response that it is going to be a tighter price control than riio t1 what we keep emphasizing as we understand that but you also need to make sure that you get the balance right between risk and reward but as importantly i think is that you continue to incentivize companies to drive innovation and efficiency so you ll hear us talk all the time that it s important we get the overall package right and that s the focus for us make sure you get a sensible return and we ve set out our views on 5 5 but also that we do get incentivization to drive innovation and technology change and our concern with the current regulatory proposals is it tries to address many i think of the efficiencies that they saw in riio t1 but doesn t yet create a framework for riio t2 so i think it will be tighter it will require great performance to deliver the returns that we would want to deliver but as a company we re very confident about that when national grid has been incentivized in the past we ve been able to drive performance for the benefit of customers and for our investors so we ll continue on that line with our discussions with ofgem simon virley kpmg llp analyst simon virley kpmg john given the challenging regulatory and political environment in the u k to what extent you re looking for opportunities beyond the u k and the u s for future growth john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so as you saw today i think we look forward over the next couple of years we ve got a very strong growth opportunity to some extent right at the top of our range in the u s all regulated businesses are growing 9 plus so within our core businesses we ve got strong growth and we will continue to work with the regulators to deliver that outside of that we will look for opportunities which are in adjacent markets that allow us to use the capabilities and skills that we ve got and have got sort of regulatory characteristics in terms of their revenue streams so the most significant one we ve announced recently is geronimo energy so we do see large scale renewable generation as an opportunity for national grid it is in an adjacent market and allows us to use many of our capabilities and over the last three years we ve done some relatively modest investment in renewable large scale renewable generation in our geography and we see that as a useful platform so where there is opportunity and those investments pass the hurdle rates that we set then we will take that forward if you look at geronimo energy particularly they have developed about 400 megawatts a year over the last few years they successfully developed about 2 2 gigawatts and they ve got a pipeline of 6 gigawatts of solar and wind if we were to continue to develop it at that rate it would be an incremental investment of about 150 million per annum so not huge in the scheme of the group but an opportunity for us that we can take forward any other questions okay in which case i m going to say thank you for attending today i appreciate all your questions and we ll see you all very soon duration 75 minutes call participants aarti singhal director of investor relations john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director andrew j agg chief financial officer

china struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the united states on may 17 suggesting a resumption of talks between the world s two largest economies would be meaningless unless washington changed course the tough talk capped a week that saw beijing unveil fresh retaliatory tariffs us officials accuse china of backtracking on promises made during months of talks and the trump administration level a potentially crippling blow against one of china s biggest and most successful companies story continues below advertisement remove ad chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang asked about state media reports suggesting there would be no more trade negotiations said china always encouraged resolving disputes with the united states through dialogue and consultations but because of certain things the us side has done during the previous china us trade consultations we believe if there is meaning for these talks there must be a show of sincerity he told a daily news briefing cnbc citing sources said the trade talks had stalled and the next round of discussions was in flux the united states raised beijing s ire this week when it announced it was putting huawei technologies co ltd the world s biggest telecoms equipment maker on a blacklist that could make it extremely hard to do business with us companies the us commerce department may soon scale back restrictions on huawei by issuing a temporary general license to allow time for companies and people who have huawei equipment to maintain the reliability of their communications networks and equipment a department spokeswoman said the possible general license would not apply to new transactions the spokeswoman said and would last for 90 days story continues below advertisement remove ad story continues below advertisement remove ad china has yet to say whether or how it will retaliate although its state media is sounding an increasingly strident note the ruling communist party s people s daily published on friday a front page commentary that evoked the patriotic spirit of the country s past wars the trade war can t bring china down it will only harden us to grow stronger it said global stocks which rebounded this week on the prospect of another round of us china talks suffered a fresh bout of selling and china s yuan slid to its weakest against the us dollar in almost five months prices of us government debt were trading higher the increasingly acrimonious trade dispute has rattled investors who fear that the countries are careening dangerously down a track that will badly damage global supply lines and put the brakes on an already slowing world economy the south china morning post citing an unidentified source reported that a senior member of china s communist party said the trade war could reduce china s 2019 economic growth by 1 percentage point in the worst case scenario both sides might need some prodding but we ve had a very clear opportunity for one side or the other to say this isn t going to work and neither side did said derek scissors an expert on sino us economic relations at the american enterprise institute think tank who put the chance of a deal this year at over 50 50 auto tariffs us president donald trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first agenda aimed at rebalancing global trade has accused china of backing out of a deal earlier this month that would have ended the 10 month dispute earlier this month reuters reported china had backtracked on commitments to change its laws to resolve core us complaints about theft of intellectual property forced technology transfers and other practices trump punctuated two days of talks in washington last week with a decision to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent the negotiations ended in a stalemate on monday beijing said it would raise its tariffs on a revised list of 60 billion in us goods effective june 1 trump in turn said he is considering slapping tariffs on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports to the united states the us president also continues to dangle the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts a move that could be devastating for a number of us trading partners including japan and germany the white house said on friday that trump s decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by up to six months to allow more time for trade talks with the european union and japan trump faced a saturday deadline to make a decision it added however that the us president agreed with findings by the us commerce department that imported vehicles and parts can threaten us national security a designation likely to anger some us allies automakers have strongly opposed the tariffs saying they would hike prices and threaten thousands of us jobs there is also strong opposition in the us congress with many prominent members of trump s republican party rejecting the idea us senate minority leader chuck schumer a democrat praised the administration s decision to delay the auto tariffs positive step the pressure must be strong on china not on our allies who we should encourage to join us in confronting china schumer tweeted the united states and canada also announced on friday a deal to remove tariffs on canadian steel and aluminium in exchange for new curbs to keep dumped metals from china and other nations out of the us market the mexican president s office later said mexico had reached a similar deal with the united states the metals tariffs were an aggravation for the canadian and mexican governments and had been a major hurdle to enacting the us mexico canada agreement the deal that would replace the 25 year old north

director of investor relations welcome to our full year results presentation and a special welcome also to everybody who s watching this online as always we re going to start with safety there are no planned fire alarm tests this morning so if you hear an alarm we do need to leave the building through these doors and then out from reception and i would also like to draw your attention to the cautionary statement that s included in your packs and as always there will be a q a at the end of this presentation advertisement advertisement so with that i d like to hand over to john pettigrew john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so thank you aarti and good morning everyone i m joined this morning by andy agg our cfo and as usual nicola shaw and dean seavers are also here to assist with any questions at the end of the presentation so let me begin with the financial highlights from last year on an underlying basis that is excluding the impact of timing major storms and exceptional items operating profit of gbp3 4 billion was down 4 this reflects the expected reduction in u k gas transmission allowances as well as the impact of u s tax reform and slightly higher than anticipated costs advertisement advertisement underlying earnings per share was up 5 to 58 9 pence this was driven by a lower share count and good performance from our other businesses we also incurred some significant exceptional charges in the last year that are excluded from our underlying results and i ll expand on these shortly we achieved a group return on equity of 11 8 delivering ongoing sustainable returns for our shareholders we invested heavily in network safety reliability and modernization with our capex increasing to gbp4 5 billion driving asset growth of 7 2 and in accordance with our policy we proposed a final dividend of 31 26 pence taking the total dividend for the year to 47 34 pence this represents a 3 1 increase on last year in line with u k inflation so as you can see it s been a solid year of financial performance as you know our safety reliability and customer performance are key to our success during the year we continued our campaign to make safe working second nature for all our employees and contractors and as a result of our efforts we ve maintained an injury frequency rate of 0 1 which is comparable to world class safety performance we also maintained excellent reliability across our networks despite significant winter storms in the u s customer performance has also been a major priority and i m pleased that our customer satisfaction has increased for both our u k and our u s businesses now before i turn to the detail let me outline the strategic highlights for the year starting with capital investment as i just mentioned we had another strong year of organic growth investing gbp4 5 billion and delivering asset growth of 7 2 as i announced last november we exercised our option over our final stake in cadent with gbp2 billion of cash proceeds expected in june in addition we made good regulated progress in the u s with all of our distribution companies now operating under refreshed rates and we continued our regulatory engagement on riio t2 in the u k we also made good progress with our cost efficiency program in the u k taken action to remove cost to make us a more efficient and agile organization and we re also taking undertaking a similar exercise in the u s advertisement advertisement with regards to our interconnected developments they continued at pace with the commissioning of nemo and the decision to proceed with viking and we also completed on our fulham property site transferring it into the st william joint venture with the berkeley group so i m pleased with the significant progress and continued momentum that we ve made underpinned by strong organic growth so let me now look at the key achievements and developments across the group i ll start with operational performance in the u s we ve achieved a return on equity of 8 8 representing 93 of our allowed returns we had good performance in most of our operating companies however we incurred some higher costs as a result of additional compliance work in new york and restoration work following gas interruption in rhode island our u s business invested 3 5 billion in the year resulting in asset growth of 9 2 up 180 basis points on last year the focus of our investment s been to maintain the safety of our networks while also modernizing them providing better reliability and resilience in addition our new u s cost efficiency initiative is vital in ensuring we deliver our capital investment program as efficiently as possible this is in the context of a business that s more than doubled its capital investment in the last seven years in summary we re streamlining our operations we re simplifying our supply chain and we re rationalizing our property portfolio whilst early in the process this program should deliver cost savings of around 30 million this year and 50 million in 2021 i m also pleased to say that in january we reached a satisfactory agreement on union negotiations with members of our massachusetts gas workforce as a reminder we entered into contingency workforce plans in june which affected about 1 250 union members we did this to seek agreement on the terms and conditions in line with what we d already agreed with many other unions representing approximately 8 000 of our employees advertisement advertisement during the protracted labor disputes we had to bring in contractors and additional supervision in order to complete almost 65 000 jobs as a result of the contingency plans we incurred exceptional charge of gbp283 million while significant this reflects our commitment to safety and implementing the right contracts for the future and i m pleased that since january we also reached agreement with a further two unions on similar terms to those agreed in massachusetts i m now going to move on to our regulatory progress in the u s during the year we agreed new rates for rhode island and massachusetts gas this completed the full refresh of rates for all of our distribution businesses which is a significant milestone for us on rhode island we ve agreed a three year settlement from september 2018 which allows us a return on equity of 9 3 and an increase in our annual capex allowance to 214 million on massachusetts gas we were awarded an allowed return of 9 5 and annual capex allowance of 413 million this ensures that we can continue the vital pipeline replacement and other safety works that we re doing we re also seeking to support new york s we re also seeking to support new york s clean energy goals with the filing in november for smart meter infrastructure we ve requested 650 million to install over 2 3 million gas and electric meters between 2021 and 2024 and finally we submitted new rate filings for massachusetts electric in kedli and kedny and i ll provide more detail on these later advertisement advertisement i ll now turn to the u k but before i talk about the key developments in the year i want to quickly remind you about what we ve achieved over the first six years of riio since 2013 the majority of our capital investment has been focused on maintaining our existing networks while facilitating the rapid changes we re seeing in the way energy is generated some of our flagship projects have included the london power tunnels the rebuild of wimbledon substation and the aylesbury catalytic converter project and we ve delivered these with innovative solutions allowing cost efficiency to be shared with customers we ve also replaced over 1 000 kilometers of overhead lines and upgraded almost 700 circuit breakers while delivering critical asset health work across our gas network all of this added together means we ve invested gbp10 billion since the start of riio while generating almost gbp640 million of savings for customers this clearly demonstrates the benefits to all our stakeholders of our regulatory framework that incentivizes both efficient delivery and innovation i ll now move on to the key developments for the u k during the year where our transmission networks have continued to deliver with another gbp1 2 billion of investment this includes 2 projects that i m particularly proud of we completed the first new electricity overhead line in england and wales since in 16 years this canterbury to richborough connection is a 21 kilometer route that was built in only 15 months enabling the connection of the nemo interconnector and secondly our tunnel into the humber for our feeder 9 replacement project is now 75 complete and this represents the largest single investment in our gas infrastructure in a decade it will also be the world s longest tunnel pipeline river crossing i ll now focus on u k operational performance here we delivered another good year of returns with a return on equity of 12 4 within the range of 200 to 300 basis points of our performance that we ve committed to under riio t1 as i announced in november our cost efficiency program is well under way and this will make us more agile while strengthening our position ahead of riio t2 as a result we re on track to become a flatter and leaner organization with a simplified way of working and more efficient it and back office activities we ve incurred gbp136 million of restructuring costs for this and expect to deliver cost savings of gbp50 million this financial year and gbp100 million from 2021 in september ofgem reached the final decision on funding for certain projects which are subject to reopeners as we entered into riio t1 and as i said november we were pleased that ofgem allowed the necessary funding for physical and cyber security however we were disappointed not to get the full funding for our compressor works in addition we also reached another milestone on operation performance with the legal separation of the electricity system operator from the 1st of april 2019 advertisement advertisement and finally as you will have seen in the press recently both the nugen and the horizon nuclear projects have been canceled along with the proposed connection agreements with us under ifrs we ve recognized an exceptional charge of gbp137 million for the development cost however the regulatory arrangements we have in place have substantially mitigated the economic impact of these cancellations so let me now turn to national grid ventures where we continue to make significant progress on our interconnected portfolio the nemo project which is a gbp265 million investment and a 1 gigawatt 140 kilometer link with belgium was commissioned two months early and under budget progress on our new interconnector to france and norway which is ifa2 and nsl have continued on track the construction of the converter stations on ifa2 is going well and we ve now laid over 270 kilometers of the cable for our link to norway during the year we made final investment decisions of viking our interconnector to denmark and we already have all the planning approvals needed and we ll start construction early next year in march we also announced our proposed acquisition of geronimo energy on a joint venture with the washington state investment board and we expect to complete on this in june subject to the usual approvals this is our first meaningful step into renewable generation in the u s providing us with a pipeline of over 6 gigawatts of solar and wind projects at different stages of development on the joint venture we ll hold the renewable assets that are developed by geronimo advertisement advertisement i ll now turn to the property business and in particular the sale of the fulham gas works having completed significant infrastructure work including demolishing redundant gas holders we successfully transferred the 17 acre site to saint william the site will now be developed over the next decade and we ll recognize further profit on the land as well as our share of development profits as the apartments are sold and i m pleased that of the 1 850 apartments 650 of them will be affordable homes in the center of london so in summary i m pleased to report that we made good progress over the last year with high levels of organic growth across the group we delivered against our priorities to date and we re well set for the coming year more on this shortly but first let me hand over to andy to discuss the financial performance in more detail andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director thank you john and good morning everyone as we go through this morning s presentation you ll see we ve refreshed the slides and we re providing additional granularity on our performance measures advertisement advertisement turning to results at constant currency underlying operating profit was down 4 reflecting the expected return of avonmouth revenues the impact of u s tax reform partly offset by higher property profits and favorable u s legal settlements eps was up 5 reflecting a lower interest count sorry lower interest charge and tax rate as well as a reduced share count our good operational performance was reflected in the 11 8 return on equity and a 6 improvement in value added per share our asset base grew strongly by 7 2 reflecting higher capital investment and the benefit of tax reform in the u s the dividend of 47 34 pence per share is 3 higher in line with our policy let s look at the performance of each of our segments u k electricity transmission delivered another year of strong operational performance achieving a 13 7 return on equity this included totex outperformance of 230 basis points an improvement on the prior year our totex outperformance was due to continued focus on innovation and efficiency as well as the additional cyber and physical security allowances from september s reopener filings other incentive performance of 50 basis points was also higher than last year due to improved customer stakeholder reliability and system operator performance additional allowances contributed 70 basis points in line with last year underlying operating profit of gbp1 1 billion was up 4 largely due to higher net revenues this was partially offset by costs associated with eso separation higher depreciation and other costs capital investments of gbp925 million was lower than last year primarily due to lower load related spend these investments along with the inflation linked growth in the rav increased year end regulated asset value by 3 8 to gbp13 5 billion advertisement advertisement as john mentioned earlier we ve recognized a one off charge of gbp137 million associated with the nugen and horizon nuclear projects existing price control arrangements covered the substantial majority of these costs as you know we also recognized an exceptional charge relating to our u k efficiency program we re already seeing early benefits from this work and excluding the eso separation costs i mentioned earlier there are almost no cost increases in the underlying business moving now to u k gas transmission which delivered a return on equity of 9 5 slightly lower than last year this reflects the lower compressor allowances from the reopeners other incentive performance is strong as our network continues to benefit from our investment program operating profit was down primarily due to the expected return of avonmouth allowances controllable costs were slightly lower as we began to see the benefits of the u k cost efficiency program and depreciation decreased however these were more than offset by an increase in other costs relating to the non recurrence of one off provision releases last year capital investment was gbp308 million in line with last year and the regulated asset value grew by 3 3 to gbp6 2 billion turning now to our u s business where the return on equity was 8 8 93 of the allowed underlying operating profit decreased 10 to gbp1 6 billion at constant currency net revenues were up gbp99 million reflecting significant rate increases partially offset by tax reform and the impact of adopting ifrs 15 as you know the effect of tax reform reverses the net income level and is economically neutral for utilities over the longer term controllable costs increased due to the rhode island gas interruption and additional safety compliance work in new york depreciation increased due to growth in the rate base and other cost increases included higher minor storm activity additional decommissioning costs in new york and bad debt of the cost increases i ve mentioned around gbp80 million are not expected to recur next year we increased the investment in our u s networks to gbp2 7 billion or 3 5 billion this meant rate base grew by 9 to 22 9 billion assets outside rate base were 2 5 billion and these largely relate to capital work in progress finally as john mentioned we recognized an 88 million exceptional charge relating to our efficiency program in the context of fast growing business we expect to generate savings of 30 million in fy 20 and 50 million of annual savings from fy 21 onwards today i m pleased to provide additional u s gaap disclosure to better rate comparison with other u s utilities who report under this standard i ll start with a bridge between the ifrs performance i ve just discussed and u s gaap as you know ifrs accounting rules don t always fully reflect the regulatory performance of the u s business u s gaap tends to be a better measure of this performance for us the largest adjustments between ifrs and u s gaap are from the accounting treatment of the regulated recovery for environmental and storm costs under u s gaap these costs are deferred to the balance sheet until we receive the associated revenue whereas under ifrs costs are immediately expensed other adjustments include differences in treatment for items such as depreciation and asset decommissioning costs you can see on the slide how we go from ifrs profit this year to u s gaap profit the final item relates to levelization this is simply a regulatory mechanism to defer agreed regulatory revenues so that bill increases for customers can be phased in over time now let s look at how our u s business performs under u s gaap we already provide asset growth and return on equity numbers for each regulated business so you can track how our capital investments translate into asset growth and ultimately into returns for shareholders to supplement this from today we re reporting adjusted u s gaap earnings for the u s business this represents the achieved return on equity multiplied by the equity portion of the rate base capturing performance against rate plans and rate base growth for fy 19 adjusted u s capital earnings on rate base were 967 million assuming a 50 50 regulatory capital structure to aid comparisons of earnings of other u s utilities you would need to also take into account the 75 million of noncash interest on assets currently outside of rate base which would increase earnings to around 1 04 billion and as the group is geared at around 65 if we were to apply the group gearing to the u s business this would increase post tax interest costs by around 100 million let s turn to the recent performance of our adjusted u s gaap earnings over the last 2 years they ve increased by 12 5 per year on average this was driven by average asset growth of 8 plus the 60 basis points increase in our achieved return on equity since fy 17 looking ahead adjusted u s gaap earnings growth is supported by future rate base growth and the achieved return on equity which next year we expect will be at least 95 of the allowed return over the medium term we can expect adjusted u s gaap earnings to increase broadly in line with our rate based growth turning now to national grid ventures which contributed gbp316 million to the group this is an increase of 10 on last year mainly due to reduced business development costs metering grain lng and interconnected profits were broadly consistent with last year capital investment increased again to gbp444 million with the first of our 4 new interconnected projects nemo completing toward the end of the year as we said before we expect around gbp250 million of ebitda contribution from our new interconnectors from fy 25 onwards moving to our other activities where the total contribution to group profit was gbp124 million compared to a small net charge in the prior year this reflects the sale of the fulham site and the gbp95 million in legal settlements partially offset by a one off pension charge our venture capital business national grid partners increased its investments in innovative technology start ups which will provide benefits in the future to the core business financing costs decreased by 1 to gbp993 million despite an increase in average net debt this was primarily due to lower u k rpi the effective interest rate also decreased from 4 6 to 4 3 the underlying effective tax rate was 19 6 this is 420 basis points lower primarily as a result of a full year impact from u s tax reform underlying earnings increased to gbp2 billion and as you ve heard underlying earnings per share increased to 58 9p per share operating cash flow was gbp4 5 billion gbp238 million lower than last year higher underlying operating cash flows were more than offset by the cash cost of the exceptional charges we ve discussed earlier during the year we raised nearly gbp3 billion of new long term financing largely in the u s closing that debt was gbp26 5 billion with a gbp1 5 billion adverse movement in exchange rates and a further gbp2 billion underlying increase this was slightly below our expectations of gbp2 5 billion partly due to timing over recoveries in the u s helping to offset the cash impact of the exceptional items our credit metrics benefited from the over recoveries in the u s the rcf to debt ratio was 9 4 or 10 8 excluding exceptional items s p s ffo to debt metric was at 12 6 or 14 7 excluding exceptionals during the year we also reduced the level of the balance sheet hedged by our u s assets to around 80 this better aligns our debt portfolio with the currency mix of our retained cash flow as a result our u s dollar denominated currency balance stood at 21 billion down from 25 billion last year as we look ahead to next year we expect capital investment to increase close to gbp5 billion and to remain at around that level in fy 21 in our u s regulated business we continue to invest to update and to modernize our networks this is supported by our recent regulatory filings for massachusetts electric and downstate new york gas investment in the u k regulated business will increase primarily driven by asset health spend comprising around 2 3 of the capital program and by undergrounding of transmission lines in dorset in our national grid ventures and other activities segment we expect to see a significant increase in our interconnector capital spend together with the initial investments in geronimo energy as a result we expect continued high quality asset growth of around 7 in fy 20 and fy 21 our objective is to maintain an efficient balance sheet for our current rating this means regulated gearing in the mid 60 range we do this by maintaining a balance between cash generation and capital investments while delivering dividend growth as expected our regulated gearing at march 2019 was 66 which will reduce in june when we receive the final cadent sale proceeds with capital investments expected to rise to close to gbp5 billion in fy 20 we ll continue to fund the group through issuing new debt at attractive rates internally generated capital delivered through strong financial performance and additional capital from the scrip dividend option which was put in place to support the business during higher growth periods we therefore expect to continue to utilize the scrip dividend in fy 20 and fy 21 as a result we expect gearing to remain around the mid 60 level through to fy 21 value added was gbp2 1 billion or 61 20p per share this comprised the growth in group assets of gbp3 billion driven by increased capex cash dividends paid of gbp1 2 billion and this year s underlying growth in net debt of gbp2 1 billion finally in line with our dividend policy the board has recommended a final dividend of 31 26p per share bringing the proposed full year dividend to 47 34p i d now like to summarize our technical guidance for fy 20 and as ever you can find more details in our full year results statement overall we expect our combined u k regulated businesses to continue to deliver 200 to 300 basis points of outperformance including the benefits of the gbp50 million of efficiency savings in the u s returns are expected to increase to at least 95 of the allowed return benefiting from updated rates the nonrepeat of this year s cost headwinds as well as the cost efficiencies we expect to deliver national grid ventures and other activities will reflect the nonrecurrence of the significant fulham transaction and the legal settlements that benefited fy 19 we will see a first full year of nemo in operation and the first year of development profits in our property joint venture our interest charge will increase reflecting an increase in average net debt and the nonrepeat of one off gains and we expect a tax rate of around 21 in fy 20 net debt is expected to increase by around gbp1 billion including the benefit of the gbp2 billion of cadent proceeds expected in june and gbp0 4 billion increase from the impact of ifrs 16 so to summarize we have efficiently delivered on our gbp4 5 billion capital program we have maintained good returns performance and the balance sheet remains strong funding 7 asset growth in the near term and reflecting our continued commitment to our progressive dividend policy now john will take you through the priorities and outlook for the coming year john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so thank you andy so let me now turn to our longer term objectives and priorities for the year ahead i strongly believe that national grid has a critical role to play in enabling the energy transition to a low carbon future power and heat networks sit right at the heart of the energy system therefore it s our responsibility to continue to create value for our customers and society more broadly while anticipating and responding to their changing needs to deliver a service that meets those changing requirements we need to build and maintain world class networks that are safe reliable resilient and smart and while we re already investing in these areas today we recognize that we need to go further innovating evolving and developing new tools and systems we also recognize that we have a role to play in helping to drive the decarbonization of the economy this role includes enabling the connection of renewables ensuring we take on a whole system approach facilitating the growth in the electrification of transport and developing solutions to decarbonize heat by undertaking this role we will deliver stronger returns for our shareholders over the long term and it s with this in mind that i now turn to look at our priorities and outlook for the year ahead i ll start with the u s where we have three key focus areas firstly a continued focus on improving our customer experience secondly the efficient and safe delivery of our services and thirdly reaching fair and progressive regulatory settlements on customer experience we ve already invested significantly in digital solutions such as our customer e billing portal and we ll continue to invest this year working toward our longer term ambition of paperless billing for everyone on the terms of the efficient and safe delivery of our services we re making significant investments in our it systems for our gas business these systems will enable a more efficient management of our field force a more responsive service for our customers and further cost improvements on regulation we filed for new rates for massachusetts electric in november last year and for and for kedny and kedli this april our regulatory structure across the u s is to move rates to be more forward looking incentive based and multi year and this will allow us to plan our works in the most cost effective way by introducing more incentive opportunities regulation will drive more efficient outcomes which will benefit customers and drive higher returns for shareholders for massachusetts electric we submitted proposals to allow for up to a five year settlement this will give us good visibility in the funding of our investment plans and allow for annual inflationary cost increases offset by efficiency savings as part of this filing we ve also taken the opportunity to advance the state s carbonization goals this included a request for funding for over 17 000 electric vehicle charging points and the installation of a 14 megawatt battery storage system separately we re asking for return on equity of 10 5 this filing will support annual investment of 300 million an increase of 50 million on the existing rate plan and we expect to view the outcome for this filing in september for kedny and kedli we submitted a request for a combined annual capex allowance of 1 5 billion this is a 50 step up from our existing allowances this increase in capex has been driven by a number of factors including the need for increased pipeline replacement enhancements to pipeline safety improved system resilience and modernization of our lng facilities importantly the filing also includes proposals to support a low carbon energy future this includes developing a green gas tariff and projects to facilitate the increased use of renewable natural gas our full year proposal includes return on equity of 9 65 and we expect rates to come into effect from april 2020 i ll now turn to the u k outlook where we also have three focus areas firstly embedding the cost efficiency program secondly delivering our capital investment as efficiently as possible and thirdly continuing to help to shape the regulatory framework for the benefit of customers and all stakeholders starting with the cost efficiency program where this year we ll be going live with new it systems which will provide better data to improve decision making and simplify our processes further across the organization on capital investment our key priorities will include completing the tunneling for feeder 9 starting work on the second london power tunnel which will provide additional capacity and resilience to our networks across south london and initiating the works on the undergrounding of our power lines through dorset as part of our visual impact program with regards to the regulatory frameworks it s critical that we continue to enable the necessary the investments to maintain the excellence safety and reliability we ve all come to expect from our networks it s also important that we continue to ensure the rapid decarbonization of the u k energy system and encourage innovation to the benefit of all customers more specifically as you re aware ofgem s riio t2 sector specific consultation was published last december as you have seen in our response in march while the initial proposals are a step in the right direction we don t think they ll bring about the right changes for consumers for the long term we provided feedback on three areas of concern the level of allowed returns the outperformance wedge and the approach to incentivization as you know the overall financial package is key balancing both a fair return and appropriate cash flows taking a balanced approach to risk and correcting for the errors in the calculation that we see we believe the fair real rpi return on equity is 5 5 with regards to the process we expect ofgem to publish its decision on the consultation next week we ll be submitting our initial business plans in july for further stakeholder comments before sharing our final plans in december and we re continuing to work constructively with ofgem to seek a framework that puts customers at the center of this price control enables the ng networks of the future and allows for a fair return for our investors so staying with the regulatory matters let me now turn to hinkley as you know we ve already started the construction of the project in accordance with our contract with edf ofgem continue to develop the necessary license modifications to introduce the competition proxy model and as we set out previously we continue to believe this mechanism is not in the long term interest of customers we ll wait to see what the final modification to our license looks like later this summer before taking a decision on the appropriate next steps so finally turning to national grid ventures where the major focus will be the continued investment we re making in our european interconnectors we continue to see interconnectors as a very cost effective way of widening the sources of electricity for the u k as well as connecting to low carbon and renewable options in fact when the three interconnectors we have under construction are completed our total interconnected capacity will be 7 8 gigawatts and almost 90 of that will come from low carbon sources and by the end of this year we ll have made real progress in the completion of most of the construction works in ifa2 we re aiming to be halfway through the cabling on our norwegian link and on viking we ll have started the manufacture of the cable and the converter stations and with regards to geronimo the deal should close next month and we plan to complete the construction of the crocker wind farm in south dakota this autumn so having set out our priorities for the coming year i now want to focus on how these priorities continue to integrate and reflect our environmental and sustainability goals and we re making good progress here for example in u k electricity transmission in our trial project at sandwich in kent we were the first utility in the world to use low carbon emissions insulating gas at 400 000 volts on climate change we set ourselves ambitious decarbonization targets and i m proud to say that we ve already reduced our emissions by 68 and of course we ll be reviewing our existing target of 80 by 2050 following the recent recommendation from the committee on climate change to reach net 0 emissions by 2050 and on sustainability our business activities enable us to make significant contributions to a number of the un sustainability developing goals in particular the affordable and clean energy and climate action goals but we also want to contribute to others we ve taken action on life on land where we set ourselves a target to recognize and enhance the value of the natural environment of at least 50 of our sites we ve worked with multiple partners and community organizations across the u k to deliver enhancements to 38 sites so far this cover more than 400 hectares of land and consist a wide variety of habitats and species and we re also addressing good health and well being this commitment includes access for all our employees to help the well being services including mental health services such as counseling and psychological therapies we re also one of a small number of organizations that supports the government s inclusive economy partnership this has included us playing a key role in developing a framework that supports employers to voluntarily report on disability mental health and well being in the workplace this is a long term priority and we ll continue to update you on our future progress so as you can see we ve a large number of priorities across the group this year including continuing to focus on our customers embedding cost savings and efficiently delivering investment plans and as andy has outlined earlier based on our current investment plans we expect to see another step up this year to nearly gbp5 billion and this elevates the level of investments expected to continue into 2021 delivering many benefits for our customers in total our asset base is expected to grow strongly by around 7 in 1920 and 2021 and the vast majority of this critical investment is covered by existing regulatory arrangements and it s our responsibility to deliver that investment efficiently which in turn generates long term value for our shareholders so in summary as i mentioned power and heat networks sit at the heart of the energy system and we create value for our customers by delivering world class networks and driving decarbonization in the last year we ve invested gbp4 5 billion in an efficient and disciplined way delivering strong organic growth we made good progress on our strategic priorities helping to underpin our total return proposition and we ve delivered significant customer benefits so far we ve also taken positive steps in evolving our regulatory frameworks in the u s and contributed to the shape of riio t2 in the u k and all of these have been achieved while maintaining a strong balance sheet and a continued commitment to our progressive dividend policy now just before we move on to your questions i m pleased to announce that we ll be hosting an investor seminar on our u s business in september where dean and his leadership team will provide a deep dive into the business and our outlook for the future the event will take place in the 20th of september in london and on the 23rd of september in new york so thank you very much for your attention this morning andy dean nick and i will be happy to answer any of your questions questions and answers christopher robert laybutt jp morgan chase co analyst thank you very much chris laybutt jpmorgan two questions for me slide 20 andy could you please step through the bridge from the asset level gap to the 1 04 billion figure again just for my benefit and are we to assume that that figure is a pretty decent representation of your gaap earnings for the holdco so i guess that s question one and then question two in terms of the 65 gearing level given riio 2 brings with it some uncertainties is that still the right level for national grid and is the board and are you as a management team still comfortable with that level andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director thank you so on the first one so as i defined on slide 20 yes so yes so the what the chart is presenting is an addition to the u s gaap earnings of the rate base business which is the u s segment operating segment the additional 75 million that we ve called out there and added in the which is the accrued earnings and assets outside the rate base includes things at either the serveco or holdco level as well as some of the capital work in progress that hasn t yet gone into the rate base so it s trying to represent the overall earnings gaap earnings from the u s business the second piece on gearing i think we ve guided this morning through to balance sheet leverage through to fy 21 and set out again the key tools that we use to manage the balance sheet i think it s early when we think about what 21 onwards or 22 onwards might look like with riio 2 still working through the rate cases we filed in the u s working through what those will look like but we re confident today the leverage is in the right place we have the right tools and we re confident with where the balance sheet is jenny ping citigroup inc analyst hi it s jenny ping from citi just following on from chris question back to page 20 andy just to confirm the interest cost that you ve got there 457 million does that include the intercompany loan charges of the 1 7 billion that you ve got and what would that number look like with that intercompany loan and therefore impact on earnings andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director so what we ve tried doing there is effectively a notional regulatory interest charge so based on allowed cost of debt i mean a 50 assume 50 50 regulatory capital structure as with our u k opco is exactly how we fund and how we move cash around is a fungible part of how we manage our debt book jenny ping citigroup inc analyst so that would come in in the 100 million additional that you talked about if assuming a gearing of 65 andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director so the 100 million on the left is purely going from 50 50 to take gearing up to 65 the additional cost of that debt jenny ping citigroup inc analyst fine and also just on that have you can you give us the year end net debt number for the u s business with or without that 1 7 billion intercompany loan andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director i think we ll get back to how we think about gearing from a group level and then we have opportunities to raise debt both as an opco a holdco level u k and u s so what we tried to guide here is if you took group gearing and applied it to the u s level the actual level of gearing within our u s holdco will be slightly higher as you said there s intercompany debt involved in that we ve tried to give you what an external view of our u s business would look like jenny ping citigroup inc analyst and one last one big picture wise in terms of energy transition i just wondered what your latest thoughts are on your gas transmission networks in the u k specifically given that there is the push for decarbonization given the works have been done or started at least on hydrogen and what your thoughts are on that asset whether it should belong to the group longer term thanks john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director in terms of gas transmission i think everyone recognizes that gas has got an incredibly important role to play as part of decarbonization journey 80 of u k heat comes from natural gas and 40 of u k electricity generation comes from natural gas i think there s a lot of work to be done over the next few years in really understanding what s the optimal way to look to decarbonize the gas network we have a number of projects under way looking at one how much hydrogen could you inject into the network without having to require people to change their appliances we re also looking at whether the network can be converted to hydrogen for example in the long term and what s the interaction between hydrogen molecules and the steel networks that we ve got and we are also looking at opportunities around sort of how you inject more green gas into the network as well so there s a lot of work to be done i think over the next few years to find out what s the optimum route what is clear is the gas networks have a very an important role to play for many many years to come and you ll see in our draft business plans that we ll be submitting to ofgem quite soon that actually the levels of investment that are needed in the gas networks will continue for many years to come as well arjan zany credit suisse analyst thank you good morning arjan zany from credit suisse i had two questions please firstly with labour s policy to create a national energy agency would you consider splitting the business into two in the u k and the u s to protect the value in the u s and secondly would you also consider adopting measures in your labour documents such as being civil society members on board to reach labour s objectives without getting an asset expropriated john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director sure the second i didn t quite catch it arjan zany credit suisse analyst so would you consider adopting measures in the labour documents to reach labour s objectives without getting an asset expropriated john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director let me just talk about nationalization as it s the topic of the day to make sure people understand where we re coming from so our position very clearly is that we don t believe that the proposal the labour has set out are in the interest of consumers in the u k the key question i think to be asked is what s the problem that the state ownership is trying to solve and from our perspective when we look at the proposals it s not clear to us so the u k has one of the world s most reliable and safe networks as you know we re investing massively in the networks the national grid invested gbp10 billion over the last six years as i said this morning we re very conscious of the affordability agenda as well and we ve returned gbp640 million to customers over the first six years of riio t2 when you look at the decarbonization agenda there needs to be a recognition that actually there s a huge amount of progress that s already happened and national grid is the key enabler of that so last year 49 6 of all the generation in the u k came from zero carbon sources we all celebrated last week the week where there was first time we had generation without any coals first time since queen victoria was on the throne and national grid is investing in things like interconnectors as i said this morning which will be 90 clean energy there s still a huge amount to do but when we look at the labour proposals it s very clear that that will not either accelerate the decarbonization agenda in the u k nor will it result in lower cost for customers all there is it will be a huge distraction and it will be actually it will delay the decarbonization in the u k and potentially increase cost to customers so our position at the moment is to make sure that people understand that and we engage with labour on a regular basis and within the labour party there are people who have an ideology and to be blunt i m never going to convince and there are people actually who don t have the view that state ownership is the right route and we will continue to engage with them as we do more generally the general public so they understand the role that national grid is playing and actually where the u k economy is in terms of decarbonization which is we made great progress there s a long way to go and the committee on climate change has if anything said we need to accelerate to deliver that you want companies like national grid to be agile to be embracing new technology and to be innovative and to meet the needs of the changing needs of customers so that s the position we come from in terms of that in terms of splitting the company the board has a duty to consider valuation of the business and it does that as you d expect on a regular basis but we don t see splitting national grid as a response to what is currently a proposal by the labour party in terms of board more broadly actually national grid under section 172 its obligations always wants to ensure that it s got a broad set of inputs in terms of the key stakeholders and any decision that the board of national grid makes it s always considering the broad stakeholders whether it s customers whether it s regulators or other broader key stakeholders fraser andrew mclaren bofa merrill lynch analyst hey good morning it s fraser mclaren from bank of america merrill lynch just three questions for me please first of all can you elaborate on the issues that you ve had with the western link please where is the problem now and is there any liability for national grid or implications for the other links that you re working on the second question is about the gbp400 million increase in net debt by virtue of ifrs adoption to what extent does that put pressure on the actual credit metrics and then lastly the hinkley license mods are just moving back farther and farther why is that and what s the revised scale of time for making a decision on any appeal thank you john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director okay thank you why don t i do the first and the third and i ll give andy the second so in terms of western link i mean if we just step back so western link as a project is going to deliver significant benefits for customers going forward and when we ve begun through the finishing phase we ve seen when it s operating that it s going to deliver those benefits to customers it is an innovative project this is the longest deep sea cable in the world that s operating at 600 kv and inevitably when you re doing innovative projects you sometimes see teething problems it is clearly a frustration to us to have the latest fault it was a cable fault our contractors which are siemens and prysmian are working full tilt to get it resolved and we re hopeful actually that this fault will be fixed by around about the end of this month so that s where we are with it in terms of liabilities national grid has very robust contracts around western link so for late delivery there will be penalties to our contractors and we continue to engage with ofgem as you d expect on a regular basis to make sure they re understanding all the activities and all the things that we re doing to make sure we commission it as quickly as possible in terms of hinkley i agree it has slipped back our position is we re waiting to see the license from ofgem until we can see that license it s difficult for us to make a decision on how we move forward we re hopeful that we ll see it in the next couple of months we engage with ofgem on a regular basis and we re encouraging them to give us the final license so that we can make that decision but at the moment we re waiting to see when ofgem are going to do that andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director and on the ifrs 16 question lease accounting although that adds into our net debt position it s already taken account of in the credit metric calculations elsewhere so there ll be no overall impact on our credit metrics dominic charles nash barclays bank plc analyst hi it s dominic nash from barclays a couple of questions please in the u s so firstly what you re guiding for group asset growth at the high end at 7 can you just give a quick breakdown again what your medium term u s growth will be please and following on from that so it s like a 1b rather than a second question you say that you say that u s net income will be rising in line with asset growth going forward is that basically any way that can work is that you assume that your 9 roe is sustainable going forward on those maths my second question is on kedny kedli massive increase in potential earnings base there and capex on the rapex program there could you remind us what percentage of your network is going to get replaced in that four year period and so how many years of investment can we look forward to in that division please john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director okay so why don t i start with kedli and kedny and i ll come back to the first question 1a and 1b so with regards to kedli and kedny we ve been in significant dialogue with the new york state regulator as we prepared to put this filing in so as you know we ve come into the end of the three year filing where we re spending around about 1 billion a year i set out this morning some of the key drivers as to why we think that needs to increase importantly when we did the filing a few weeks ago the feedback from the regulator was it was as expected now the utilities in the u s have seen press releases from the regulator following a filing because they were surprised so i m quite pleased that at least it s in line with the expectations we now go through a very long process with kedli and kedny as you know it would be probably toward the end of this year if we get to a settlement before we get an outcome and that includes four months of discovery and q a what we tried to do in the filing as we always do now with rate filings in the u s is to create some optionality for the regulators so we re very clear about what the things that we believe must be done from a safety perspective and what things there is opportunity to do in either slightly longer or to defer depending what the impact is on customer bills we do have some opportunity i think in new york because with the tax reform in commodity prices there is some headroom to actually for to be able to take forward some of the policy agenda items in new york without having a significant impact on bills but at this level of rate filing it will impacting customer bills so we ll work through that what percentage i ll come back to you i can t remember what the percentage is what i would say is we re at the early stages of what effectively is the we call it lead from pipe replacement program in the u s a major replacement program is what you d call it in the u k if you remember that program we re at the very early stages so this will be a multiyear program how quickly we do it we will work with the regulator to make sure we get the balance right between doing what s right from a safety perspective recognizing the impact on customers i forgot what your first question was dominic charles nash barclays bank plc analyst basically the split between the u s and u k within that 7 asset growth and the implied does that they are very remain constant in the u s john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes so in terms of the u s this year we were at 3 5 billion the spend is on 9 2 we re expecting for the next couple of years for it to stay at that or slightly above that level so we re expecting continued strong growth well above 7 in the u s and that when you apply that to the group with pretty constant investment in the u k so we re expecting 1 2 billion 1 3 billion for the next couple years and with the interconnectors get you to the top end of our 7 range so in terms of returns we ve guided today so this year u s entered 93 of the allowed returns we re expecting to be above 95 next year james brand deutsche bank ag analyst james brand from deutsche bank three questions please the first is on u k investment and obviously the initial proposals from ofgem have been very tough in terms of the allowed rate of return which you ve obviously highlighted often when utilities are going through challenging regulatory settlements they often say that this could be a threat to investment and you re obviously thinking pretty carefully about what you might want to propose in investment given that you said you re going to be presenting your initial business plan in july so just wondering how you approach that do you try and scale back investment or do you pay it very straight and you work out exactly what needs to be done and the return budget maybe doesn t affect that decision that much second question is just on the u s it spend for the gas business i m just wondering whether all of that was recoverable under the regulatory assessment i e whether the investment there goes into the rav or not and then thirdly i think it was a year ago and it was andy bonfield that kind of suggested that there may be changes implemented around the dollar hedging that you have in place that you d already you try to hedge both the equity and the debt value in the u s by having a dollar debt so just wondering whether that ended up see with andy coming in whether there ended up being any changes around that or not whether there are any changes planned thanks john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so let me do the first then andy the third so in terms of the regulatory process in the u k and where we re at on returns and investment so i think that we in this room we ve been very clear in our response in march that we don t think a 3 return provides a fair balance between the risk and reward that we perceive in riio t2 and our response are set out very quickly where we think ofgem have made some errors in their calculation but also what s an appropriate return based on where current interest rates are and our perception of the relative risk of a transmission business relative to the market so we re setting that out where we re hopeful that the arguments that we ve made have been listened to and we ll see what ofgem says next 23rd of may when is that next thursday i think it is when the document comes out in terms of the investment profile i mean we re at a very early stage one of the things we were pleased about in terms of ofgem s proposal was this is a price control it s very much driven by the needs of customers and stakeholders so we re in quite intensive discussions with stakeholders about what are the needs of the or what are their needs going forward from us as a utility and as a network what will come out at the beginning of july is an early indication what our stakeholders are telling us and we re taking that requirement and converting it into what that might mean for capex we ve got a long process to go through that will run in parallel between getting the right return and the right overall financial package and making sure that we ve got the right investments to meet our obligations but also to support the decarbonization agenda so you ll see that evolve i think over the next six to nine months as we go forward in terms of the it spend the vast majority is actually recovered through the rate base we actually it s a huge investment right across our u s business to enable our gas workforce it s been needed for some time but we actually aligned the rollout of that investment to reflect the rate cases that we were doing so that we can maximize the recovery and make sure it s part of the rate base andrew andrew j agg chief financial officer executive director yes on the dollar hedge question actually and so you mentioned that at a speech last year so some work had started with andrew in my previous role as treasurer i mentioned this morning in the speech that we brought the overall level of dollar hedging down to around 80 of the total u s asset value that s slightly lower than it was previously it s about a 4 billion reduction in the mix of dollar debt in the portfolio and the rationale for that is effectively when we looked at it we the top up was to do with goodwill and if you look at the currency flows you don t get cash coming out of the goodwill balance so we brought the level of hedge down to reflect more of the rate base balance samuel james hugo arie ubs investment bank analyst hi thank you sam arie from ubs i had a follow up question on ofgem and the price control and then one apologies again on the nationalization topic but on ofgem so you ve mentioned your consultation response which was pretty directly worded and you think that ofgem has got their math wrong and i m just wondering can remind us what are your options if ofgem come back with no change can you appeal only sort of within the ofgem tribunal under your license condition or is this something that ends up in the court system john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so you re right we were very clear i d say in terms of our response to the consultation also i think we were very helpful and we ve had some feedback from ofgem staff that we were so not only did we say what we didn t like but we put forward some proposals and what we thought was sensible to get the right regulatory regime going forward and we continue to have constructive dialogue with ofgem this has still got a very long way to go so we re publishing effectively a draft business plan in july which will then be critiqued by the challenge group and stakeholder group we don t actually submit our business plan until december this year and then ultimately ofgem will make a decision until the end of 2020 in the event that the proposals and the final decision by ofgem are not acceptable then national grid as other networks has the option to refer it to the cma and in the energy sector you can refer the whole package or you can refer single items within the package so that is the sort of the route that would be followed in the event that we couldn t get a sensible outcome samuel james hugo arie ubs investment bank analyst okay very helpful and can i could i ask my follow up on the nationalization topic too so and i think you set out your views on that policy very clearly what i think was new in this week s document from the labour party was i suppose a confirmation in writing that although the nationalization price that they think about would be set in parliament it could include deductions relating to a whole list of other topics like the pension deficit asset sales the state of the assets in the business and so on i m sure you ve looked at this but can you comment at all on what you think the legal protections might be against that kind of approach john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes so as you d expect we look very carefully at the party s proposals and we ll go through we still don t believe it s the right thing to actually go to state ownership but the government has an obligation to pay fair value for the assets there s lots of debate and lots of narrative across the industry about how you define fair value but in the event that the labour party go forward and tries to pay less than fair value then there are several legal routes available including the european courts in terms of human rights and a whole host of other areas in terms of treaties so we understand the legal mechanisms that would have to be applied by our investors in the event that was to happen clearly we continue to focus on making sure that people understand that we don t think state ownership will solve the problems that labour has been setting out martin young investec inc analyst hi it s martin young from investec just one question continuing on the this nationalization debate if we take a step back a number of years when miliband came out with the idea for capping retail prices in the u k you can imagine it was such as best as a labour policy at the time skip forward a number of years parts of that we re picked up by different political parties and we ve ended up where we are today with the price cap on parts of the markets if you look at what labour here put out scrap out the bits that you think are a bit crazy on ideological grounds you can probably find bits in it that resonate with the public is there a clear risk that those are picked up by political parties of all colors and that going forward we have a considerably tighter regulatory settlement than we ve ever had before and quite clearly there are differences between what you feel is fair and what ofgem currently has on the table and you can probably say that some of the things that ofgem are trying to push through are indeed responding to some of the underlying points that have been picked up by various people out there so just wondered if you could give a few thoughts on how tight you feel regulation could land john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director yes i mean there s one thing we do agree with labour on which is the aspiration to decarbonize the economy the fundamental difference we have is the approach to achieve that which will minimize cost for customers and will do it in a sensible and timely way in terms of regulation i think we ve set out quite clearly what we believe is an appropriate regulatory framework to encourage and deliver the infrastructure investment that s going to be needed over the next five years it is quite clear from ofgem s document and actually we acknowledged this in our response that it is going to be a tighter price control than riio t1 what we keep emphasizing as we understand that but you also need to make sure that you get the balance right between risk and reward but as importantly i think is that you continue to incentivize companies to drive innovation and efficiency so you ll hear us talk all the time that it s important we get the overall package right and that s the focus for us make sure you get a sensible return and we ve set out our views on 5 5 but also that we do get incentivization to drive innovation and technology change and our concern with the current regulatory proposals is it tries to address many i think of the efficiencies that they saw in riio t1 but doesn t yet create a framework for riio t2 so i think it will be tighter it will require great performance to deliver the returns that we would want to deliver but as a company we re very confident about that when national grid has been incentivized in the past we ve been able to drive performance for the benefit of customers and for our investors so we ll continue on that line with our discussions with ofgem simon virley kpmg llp analyst simon virley kpmg john given the challenging regulatory and political environment in the u k to what extent you re looking for opportunities beyond the u k and the u s for future growth john pettigrew chief executive officer executive director so as you saw today i think we look forward over the next couple of years we ve got a very strong growth opportunity to some extent right at the top of our range in the u s all regulated businesses are growing 9 plus so within our core businesses we ve got strong growth and we will continue to work with the regulators to deliver that outside of that we will look for opportunities which are in adjacent markets that allow us to use the capabilities and skills that we ve got and have got sort of regulatory characteristics in terms of their revenue streams so the most significant one we ve announced recently is geronimo energy so we do see large scale renewable generation as an opportunity for national grid it is in an adjacent market and allows us to use many of our capabilities and over the last three years we ve done some relatively modest investment in renewable large scale renewable generation in our geography and we see that as a useful platform so where there is opportunity and those investments pass the hurdle rates that we set then we will take that forward if you look at geronimo energy particularly they have developed about 400 megawatts a year over the last few years they successfully developed about 2 2 gigawatts and they ve got a pipeline of 6 gigawatts of solar and wind if we were to continue to develop it at that rate it would be an incremental investment of about 150 million per annum so not huge in the scheme of the group but an opportunity for us that we can take forward any other questions okay in which case i m going to say thank you for attending today i appreciate all your questions and we ll see you all very soon duration 75 minutes call

washington beijing reuters china struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the united states yesterday suggesting a resumption of talks between the world s two largest economies would be meaningless unless washington changed course the tough talk capped a week that saw beijing unveil fresh retaliatory tariffs u s officials accuse china of backtracking on promises made during months of talks and the trump administration level a potentially crippling blow against one of china s biggest and most successful companies chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang asked about state media reports suggesting there would be no more trade negotiations said china always encouraged resolving disputes with the united states through dialogue and consultations but because of certain things the u s side has done during the previous china u s trade consultations we believe if there is meaning for these talks there must be a show of sincerity he told a daily news briefing cnbc citing sources said the trade talks had stalled and the next round of discussions was in flux the united states raised beijing s ire this week when it announced it was putting huawei technologies co ltd the world s biggest telecoms equipment maker on a blacklist that could make it extremely hard to do business with u s companies the u s commerce department may soon scale back restrictions on huawei by issuing a temporary general license to allow time for companies and people who have huawei equipment to maintain reliability of their communications networks and equipment a department spokeswoman said the possible general license would not apply to new transactions the spokeswoman said and would last for 90 days china has yet to say whether or how it will retaliate although its state media is sounding an increasingly strident note the ruling communist party s people s daily published on friday a front page commentary that evoked the patriotic spirit of the country s past wars the trade war can t bring china down it will only harden us to grow stronger it said global stocks which rebounded this week on the prospect of another round of u s china talks suffered a fresh bout of selling and china s yuan slid to its weakest against the u s dollar in almost five months prices of u s government debt were trading higher the increasingly acrimonious trade dispute has rattled investors who fear that the countries are careening dangerously down a track that will badly damage global supply lines and put the brakes on an already slowing world economy the south china morning post citing an unidentified source reported that a senior member of china s communist party said the trade war could reduce china s 2019 economic growth by 1 percentage point in the worst case scenario both sides might need some prodding but we ve had a very clear opportunity for one side or the other to say this isn t going to work and neither side did said derek scissors an expert on sino u s economic relations at the american enterprise institute think tank who put the chance of a deal this year at over 50 50 u s president donald trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first

washington last week with a decision to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent the negotiations ended in a stalemate on monday beijing said it would raise its tariffs on a revised list of 60 billion in u s goods effective june 1 trump in turn said he is considering slapping tariffs on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports to the united states the u s president also continues to dangle the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 on imported cars and parts a move that could be devastating for a number of u s trading partners including japan and germany the white house said on friday that trump s decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by up to six months to allow more time for trade talks with the european union and japan trump faced a saturday deadline to make a decision it added however that the u s president agreed with findings by the u s commerce department that imported vehicles and parts can threaten u s national security a designation likely to anger some u s allies automakers have strongly opposed the tariffs saying they would hike prices and threaten thousands of u s jobs there is also strong opposition in the u s congress with many prominent members of trump s republican party rejecting the idea u s senate minority leader chuck schumer a democrat praised the administration s decision to delay the auto tariffs positive step the pressure must be strong on china not on our allies who we should encourage to join us in confronting china schumer tweeted the united states and canada also announced on friday a deal to remove tariffs on canadian steel and aluminum in exchange for new curbs to keep dumped metals from china and other nations out of the u s market the mexican president s office later said mexico had reached a similar deal with the united states the metals tariffs were an aggravation for the canadian and mexican governments and had been a major hurdle to enacting the u s mexico canada

every year the vast majority of ghana s natural wealth is stolen the country is among the largest exporters of gold in the world yet according to a study by the bank of ghana less than 1 7 percent of global returns from its gold make their way back to the ghanaian government this means that the remaining 98 3percent is managed by outside entities mainly multinational corporations who keep the lion s share of the profits in other words of the us 5 2 billion of gold produced from 1990 to 2002 the government received only us 87 3 million in corporate income taxes and royalty payments the dominant discourse propagated by institutions like the international monetary fund imf that control the levers of global finance blames the bad governance of local officials for the consequences of this plunder citing corruption scandals as the main reason for a lack of resources however the discourse around bad governance the idea that corrupt local officials are to blame for endemic poverty low health indicators education and other measures of national well being focuses on what happens with the 1 7 percent of the returns that ghana receives sarah bracking points out that the company would argue that the market value of output is not synonymous with their surplus or profits as working capital wages depreciation of machines and so forth must be paid from this however the figures do act as a good illustration of the low returns to the sovereign owners of sub soil resources as a proportion of their final market value which in africa can be estimated as typically in the region of between three and five percent but which in this case is lower about 1 7 per cent holding officials accountable for their use of public funds should be a given but what about the remaining 98 3 percent of the returns generated by ghana s gold exports individuals are blamed fingers angrily pointed at corrupt governments while the nations they govern are robbed blind by transnational corporations it is these corporations working with institutions like the imf and the world bank that define the terms of this conversation these international lenders bury borrowing countries with steep interest rates and terms that grant lending institutions the power to determine and approve national policies national leaders of countries that fall into the debt trap are forced to forfeit the right to create their own policies for access to loans these leaders are then blamed for the consequences of policies and terms crafted by lending institutions a key form of neocolonialism they are also blamed for the vestiges of hundreds of years of colonialism that came before in some cases it is true that national leaders are involved in corruption scandals in others corruption scandals are fabricated relying on a deeply embedded narrative and lack of faith in national leadership in the global south despite a lack of evidence seen recently in brazil with the imprisonment of leading presidential candidate lula da silva even in cases where the corruption of local governments does exist the amount of money pilfered pales in comparison to the wealth extracted by transnational corporations in other words robber barons are blaming petty thieves for the consequences of their large scale robbery schemes according to the united nations conference on trade and development unctad multinational corporations offshore tax hubs result in an estimated us 100 billion in annual tax revenue losses for developing countries vijay prashad of tricontinental institute for social research calls this phenomenon tax strikes or the idea that those who hold capital who are the masters of property have been essentially on strike against regimes of taxation they use their vast wealth to either hide their money or change tax laws to offer them increasing protections rather than using this money for the social good to invest in public services infrastructure health or education they use it to increase their own wealth often by inflat the stock market and various asset bubbles comparatively during a 2013 keynote address world bank president jim yong kim cited that corruption in the form of bribery and theft by government officials costs developing countries between us 20 billion and us 40 billion each year in other words by a rough calculation the amount that corrupt government officials cost developing countries is anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than half of the amount that these nations lose in offshore tax havens the real power then remains in the hands of multinational corporations which not only make off with vast sums of wealth belonging to the darker nations but also continue to exercise control over nations in the global south where they use access to finance as a lever to impose policies that benefit themselves at the expense of the people who live there when local leaders are deemed too much of a threat to multinational corporations interests they are quickly deposed through coups as we saw in haiti 2004 and honduras 2009 or destabilization campaigns as we see in venezuela today kwame nkrumah a leader in ghana s independence struggle and the country s first president referred to this process as neocolonialism the essence of neo colonialism is that the state which is subject to it is in theory independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty in reality its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside nkrumah wrote in his book neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism through organizations like the imf and world bank former colonialists would strive for the general objective to achieve colonialism in fact while preaching independence fifty four years after nkrumah wrote neo colonialism the last stage of imperialism 1965 and 62 years after ghana s independence from great britain 1957 nkrumah s assessment remains as clear and relevant as ever the preferred words of imperialism have shifted but the underlying structure remains the same a system where an illusion of freedom obscures the power relations and where monopoly capital in the form of transnational corporations and lending institutions exercises control over the country s economic and political reality the narrative of today s neocolonialists blames bad governance as the obstacle to a better future in which ghanaians benefit from their vast mineral wealth as gyekye tanoh of the third world network africa points out in his recent interview with tricontinental institute for social research according to this trope the corruption of local governments is to blame however this narrative leaves out of the picture the pillage of natural resources and exploitation of labor by colonizers great britain in the case of ghana not only were the systems to process crude forms of minerals such as oil and gold not developed by colonizers but the country s reliance on foreign capital to buy and process these resources has kept the country in a position similar to its colonial status pre 1957 as nkrumah predicted where transnational corporations rather than the state of great britain keep the vast majority of revenues produced from ghanaian gold and other resources tanoh explains he entire system that was set in place since the 1980s to force countries to rely upon raw material exports and to become dependent on foreign buyers is what leaves countries like ghana with such a minuscule amount of the wealth taken from ghana s land good governance is not going to solve this unless good governance refers as well to the deep structural dynamics pointing a proverbial finger at those responsible for the distribution of 1 7 percent of wealth generated and framing them as the main culprits of corruption poverty and underdevelopment is not just reckless and irresponsible it is part of a systemic narrative that deflects attention away from the real thieves the multinational corporations that preside over the 98 3 percent of the remaining wealth it is intellectually dishonest to ignore the broader historical context that is responsible for the low returns of ghanaian gold to ghanaian citizens true bad governance is the appropriation of 98 3 percent of wealth produced by ghanaian resources that lines the coffers of transnational corporations instead of being returned to benefit the ghanaian people of the ten top multinational firms that operate on the african continent only one vale of brazil is located in the global south of the remaining nine three are united states corporations three are canadian two are australian and one is british all are private transnational corporations in other words the gold that is extracted from ghanaian soil like the natural wealth extracted from across the african continent and global south is immediately handed over to multinational corporations almost entirely based in and controlled by the global north or at best by the national elite to be processed refined and distributed death rape and preventable illnesses that plague those who work in or live near the mines are rampant in the area where these companies operate as illustrated by tricontinental institute for social research s latest briefing though ghana won its independence in 1957 the vestiges of colonialism and underdevelopment did not magically leave with it under colonialist rule resources were extracted from former colonies like ghana to sustain the wealth of their colonizers wealth produced from gold further enhanced by enslaved or bonded labor quickly left the country promoting development in england while leaving ghana void of the infrastructure to develop or refine its own resources and leaving its people without access to basic services to accept the narrative on bad governance is to forfeit what fidel castro called the battle of ideas it is to let the powerful transnational corporations and the web of institutions that protects their interests from the imf to corporatized non profits and mainstream media define the terms of the conversation on development sovereignty and the lives of the people who inhabit the resource rich land it is to forfeit the control of ghanaian resources to transnational corporations the very thieves of the majority of the country s wealth under the false pretext that they are incapable of managing it themselves to quote gyekye the language of good governance implies that it is only the aberrant behaviours of the public officials that should be seen as corruption yet of course the lack of resources available to accountable public institutions makes it impossible to create or sustain meaningful domestic anti corruption mechanisms it is intellectually dishonest to blame local leaders as the main culprits for bad governance conveniently leaving multinational corporations out of the picture it is the vestiges of colonialism and its continued neocolonialist forms that deprive the ghanaian people of the right to process develop and manage their natural wealth and to be the drivers of their own policies in other words their right to national sovereignty it is transnational corporations the stand ins of yesterday s british empire often aided by an enthusiastic national bourgeoisie that have robbed the ghanaian people of sovereignty over their resources

history has never really been on the side of the federal labor party on the six previous occasions that labor came to power it found itself in the eye of a global storm the entry dates to office underline both the burden and the bad luck 1914 1929 1940 1972 1983 and 2007 that covers both world wars and the four biggest crises of modern capitalism the great depression the oil shock stagflation and the global financial crisis it is one of the most striking things about our political system the australian people shift to labor in times of national peril and in most cases quickly come to regret that choice three of those economic crises erupted within the opening year of the new government cruelling the prime ministerships of james scullin gough whitlam and kevin rudd all three lost their jobs within three years of a barnstorming election victory scullin s government split and was forced to an early election which it lost in a landslide whitlam s government was dismissed by the governor general while rudd was sacked by his own party only bob hawke s government in 1983 had the benefit of knowing the enemy on arrival the economy was already in deep recession and his ministry had witnessed the chaos of the whitlam era and were determined not to repeat that history so if bill shorten does lead labor back into government the question of what could go wrong will occur soon enough it is the follow up question that will decide whether his government rises to the challenge like hawke s what did shorten and his frontbench learn from the rudd experience

forest owners received on average approximately nz 2 per jasm3 less for export logs in may than they did in april the decrease in at wharf gate awg prices for logs was higher in the lower value log grades and was not consistent across all export log buyers cfr sale prices for logs which had dropped over the previous two months stabilised in may but the recent renewing of the trade war between the us and china means the market is again showing some signs of nervousness the recent sudden depreciation of the chinese yuan cny against the united states dollar usd is the biggest concern for log exporters to china as it reduces the buying power of the chinese log buyers for the first time in a while virtually all mills report good log supply the domestic market for logs has continued the very stable yet unspectacular start to 2019 most mills expect domestic demand for sawn timber to reduce over the winter months there are high stocks of sawn timber in most asian markets due to the drop in the awg log prices the pf olsen log price index for may decreased 1 to 130 the index is currently 1 above the two year average 4 above the three year average and 12 higher than the five year average domestic log market log supply and pricing prices for domestic log sales in may are mostly unchanged from april some mills report an over supply of pruned logs in the central north island and nelson increased salvaged volumes from the burnt areas structural mills report the financials are hard to stack up for the burnt wood as they can t send the chip to mdf and ironically the drying of the timber is uneven while prices for pruned logs in the central north island have remained relatively unchanged log prices in the south island have decreased many mills report they are now being offered more logs from suppliers due to uncertainty in the export markets sawn timber domestic demand mills describe demand as flat demand for structural grade logs is expected to drop off through the winter months industrial demand is regional as well as seasonal the demand for industrial grade logs has been average at best and is now reducing in some regions sawn timber export demand the australian sawn timber market is very soft the new product developments that had occurred last year have evaporated and demand for core products mainly outdoor rather than structural products has softened a bit as well most mills expect this downturn to be more than short term as market indicators have not been great while the european clearwood market remains strong the prices for the lower grade cut of log col and cuttings grades etc are not as strong there are high stocks of sawn timber in china and this is putting pressure on prices there is uncertainty in the china market with the impact of the tariffs and manufacturers do not want to carry much stock which is understandable sawn timber markets in other areas like vietnam are also now facing price pressure as volume is diverted these lower grades arise from the production of clear boards and it is the average basket price for all grades that determines the profitability of new zealand sawmills it is a similar story from the mills producing structural grade timber who make money from the structural grade sawn timber but struggle with the lower grade arising products export log markets china total softwood log stocks across china are now around 4 1 million m3 so are relatively unchanged from last month daily uplift from the ports has reduced from the record 90 000 m3 per day levels of last month this month the daily usage has bounced between 75 90 000 m3 per day construction activity usually slows in the hotter summer months that are upcoming in china courtesy pacific forest products pfp the cfr sale prices for pine logs in china which had dropped over the previous two months has stabilised for may sales and a grade and is now in the 134 136 usd per jasm3 range the confidence in the construction industry is mixed with the slowest economic growth in china in decades the south american logs of which there are about 6 7 vessels per month currently have an a grade sale price of about 118 usd per jasm3 the quality and usage is vastly inferior to pine logs from new zealand while these exporters have experienced a slight drop in freight rates from south america to china the returns are not favourable but most exporters want to maintain their position in the supply chain while looking for price increases in the future the renewed trade war between the us and china will likely mean even less log volume and particularly southern yellow pine arriving into china from the us the current inventory of european logs from the storm and beetle damaged area is estimated at about 400 000m3 by china forestry group infrastructure limitations in europe has restricted the volume that can be exported to china and the cfr price is also quite supressed with spruce in the 110 115 eur per m3 this equates to approximately 123 129 usd so is heavily discounted india in the port of kandla the supply of new zealand pine logs remains relatively low and demand is currently exceeding supply one of the large new zealand log sellers managed to sell part of a vessel at 156 per jasm3 for a grade in april however there has since been a price correction in response to falling cfr prices in china and the current cfr price for a grade logs is between 147 149 usd per jasm3 the market is abuzz with the first ever vessel of logs from uruguay which is headed to india in may it is marketed at 149 usd per jasm3 for a grade the biggest mystery around the vessel is fumigation it is suggested that the penalty on arrival in india fumigation cost of us 12 per m3 has been agreed to be paid by the exporter the vessel is expected to load about 34 000 m3 of 5 8m 3 8m china lengths which suggests that in case of a significant problem the vessel may be diverted to a chinese port since the pine from uruguay is younger and primarily composed of taeda and ellioti it would have a significant impact on imports of southern yellow pine and south african pine to india most market commentators think this supply will not significantly impact the new zealand pine supply one of the challenges of uruguay shipment is lack of credible scaling and grading the average log diameters are also small around 20 25 cm which is not ideal for the indian market the kandla sawn timber market for pine in lieu of tight supply has moved up to rs 511 cft the log buyers in tuticorin have now formed a unified group and are actively soliciting a vessel for early june shipment from new zealand the sawn timber price has firmed up to rs 521 cft shipping logs from new zealand to india is around 33 36 usd per jasm3 and expected to remain at these levels exchange rates the new zealand dollar nzd has weakened against the united states dollar usd and this has partially buffered new zealand forest owners from the falling cfr log prices in china this is being countered by the weakening of the chinese yuan cny against the usd which is reducing the buying power of the chinese log buyers how the nzd and the cny fare against the usd over the next couple of months will have a significant impact on awg prices at new zealand ports nzd usd cny usd ocean freight ocean freight rates from new zealand to china dropped about 1 usd per jasm3 over the last month the baltic handysize index has steadily dropped throughout april and into may most log exporters expect freight rates to drop slightly over the next few months source

deal deal deals they re the main themes in the markets last week the cross party brexit talks in uk collapsed and a high profile brexiteer is tipped to lead the brexit process after current prime minister steps down tensions between us and china escalated further a trade deal is now rather out of sight not even a next meeting while the decision on auto tariffs was postponed us did confirm auto imports as national security threats major exporters like eu and japan will have six months to make a deal with the us or we ll see us led trade wars escalating further nevertheless the better news was that a deal was agreed between us canada and mexico to eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs in the currency markets sterling ended as the worst performing one on brexit uncertainties and probably increasing chance of a no deal one australian and new zealand dollars were the weakest ones on risk aversion and poor economic performance in china swiss franc dollar and yen were the strongest ones on risk aversion and falling global treasury yields also it should be noted that chinese yuan tumbled sharply with usd cnh eyeing the important psychological level of 7 0 us canada and mexico steel tariffs and usmca some good news first in a joint announcement us canada and mexico said a deal was reached to remove section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and related retaliatory tariffs under the agreement aggressive monitoring and a mechanism will be set up to prevent surges in imports of steel and aluminum us may re impose the section 232 tariffs if surges occur and retaliation by canada and mexico would then be limited to steel and aluminum products only with the most important hurdle cleared the three countries could see the usmca ratified by respective parliament rather quickly us eu and japan auto tariffs it s true that trump annonced to delay decisions on auto tariffs by 180 days but the most important point of the announcement is that auto imports are delcared as threat to national security of us their rationale is that the countries defense and military superiority depend on the competitiveness and r d of its automobile industry competitiveness of us owned auto companies waned in the past decades with domestic market share dropped from 67 in 1985 to 22 in 2017 also global market share dropped fom 36 in 1995 to 12 in 2017 defense purchases alone are not sufficient to support r d in key automotive technologies ann they claimed that domestic conditions of competition must be improved by reducing imports later trump also repeated his accusation of eu as treating the us worse than china they re just smaller nevermind that there was no explanation on how eu is worse comparing to china s ip theft forced technolgy transfer or unfair competition with state owned enterprises still the message is clear a delay is only a delay auto tariffs threats remain there and eu s retaliations are ready probably japan too of course until deals are made us and china full blown trade war on the us side the latest round of 25 ofon us 200b of tariffs took effect on may 10 already public comments on new tariffs on usd 300b in chinese products essentially all remaining started with hearing scheduled on june 17 us also announced double assault on china s telecom giant huawei firstly the u s commerce department is adding huawei and 70 affiliates to its entity list that bans them from buying us technologies without government approval secondly trump signed an executive order banning us companies from using telecom equipment made by companies deemed to pose a national security risk simply speaking the decision was to prevent american technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine u s national security or foreign policy interests on china s side retaliation of new round of us tarrifs were announced effective june 1 it s widely reported that china is not keen to resume negotiations unless three core issues are resolved they include elimination of all tariffs upon an agreemnt amount on additional purchases as part of the deal the the balance of the text of the deal itself china saw the requests regarding legislations as intrusion of its soverignity and dignity china side negotiations haven t broken down trump said he s going to mee xi soon but at this point there is no scheduled meeting between the two delegations announced and it s even unsure if anything would be done before g20 summit in japan in june cross party brexit talks collapsed in uk the cross party brexit talks in uk collapsed after opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn declared that talks ad gone as far as they can due to increasing weakness and instability of the conservative government he also declared that labour will oppose may s brexit deal when it returns to the parliament early june prime minister theresa may promised to agree to a timetable for stepping down after another vote for the brexit withdrawal agreement on june 3 regardless of the result boris johnson a high profile brexiteer whoe prefers no deal brexit to the current deal is currently the favorite among party members to replace may market pricing in 73 4 chance of fed rate cut by december before going into some charts we d like to point out that according to fed fund futures markets are now pricing in 73 4 chance of a fed cut by december fomc meeting that s higher than around 63 5 a week ago and way higher than around 40 chance a month ago dxy on track to extend medium term up trend but dollar index actually ended higher even though markets are increase bets on fed cut upside momentum in dxy hasn t been too convincing nevertheless strong support from 55 day ema was a bullish sign from medium term point of view outlook stays bullish with 95 74 support firmly intact dxy is on track to 78 6 retracement of 103 82 to 88 25 at 100 48 bearish view in dow still holds after late rebound stocks apparently received little support from fed cut speculations dow dropped to as low as 25568 06 last week then recovered though upside was limited by flat 55 day ema so far and more downside is still expected to 38 2 retracement of 21712 53 to 26695 96 at 24792 28 at least we re still seeing fall from 26696 96 as the third leg of consolidation pattern from 26951 81 sustained break of 24792 28 will affirm our bearish view meanwhile the main risks to this view is the lack of confirmation from s p 500 and nasdaq so far but have indeed rebounded to close above 55 emas it will probably take a while for the three indices to sort themselves out 10 year yield on track to break 2 356 low development in 10 year yield provide missing piece that could tie everything together tnx dropped to as low as 2 361 before closing at 2 393 some support was seen above 2 356 low but there is no loss of downside momentum yet we d expect further decline through 2 356 to 50 retracement of 1 336 to 3 248 at 2 292 at least we d actually expect further fall through this 2 292 to 61 8 retracement at 2 066 which is close to 2 0 handle with 3 month yield at 2 389 the 3 month 10 year yield curve should eventaully inverts persistently unless fed cuts interest rates that would be inline with sharp slowdown in the us economy ahead even withou recession stocks selling should finally pickup momentum to align with such development in such case there will be spillover to other economies in particular emerging markets which could be affected by china too and global risk aversion will help lift dollar we ll see if that s how things develop in the months ahead gbp usd weekly outlook gbp usd s decline accelerated to as low as 1 2714 last week the development confirmed completion of corrective rebound from 1 2391 at 1 3381 larger decline from 1 4376 might be resuming initial bias stays on the downside this week for retesting 1 2391 low first break will target 61 8 projection of 1 4376 to 1 2391 from 1 3381 at 1 2154 next on the upside on the upside above 1 2795 minor resistance will turn intraday bias neutral for consolidation first before staging another decline in the bigger picture current development suggests that medium term decline from 1 4376 2018 high is not completed and is possibly ready to resume decisive break of 1 2391 would target a test on 1 1946 long term bottom 2016 low for now we don t expect a firm break there yet hence focus will be on bottoming signal as it approaches 1 1946 in any case medium term outlook will stay bearish as long as 1 3381 resistance holds in case of rebound in the longer term picture consolidative pattern from 1 1946 2016 low could still extend with another rising leg but after all decisive break of 38 2 retracement of 2 1161 2007 high to 1 1946 at 1 5466 is needed to indicate long term reversal otherwise an eventual downside breakout will remain in favor
i often hear people talk about their difficulties in finding a meaningful job or keeping up with increasing healthcare housing and education costs these concerns along with rising income inequality and a shrinking middle class are provoking anger for many trade and immigration have become convenient villains but that narrative is wrong let me tell you why income inequality which is partly a reflection of the growing gap between lower and higher skilled workers has risen steadily in the united states since the 1970s in fact the economic gap between the rich and poor is higher here than other advanced economies according to the pew research center this has resulted in a shrinking middle class that no longer represents the majority of americans what s gone wrong american free market capitalism has generated the greatest economic growth the world has ever seen but it has not benefited all of us equally but in an effort to improve economic outcomes for all americans it s essential to continually improve our system of free market capitalism not move toward a more socialist like model that empowers left leaning politicians to make decisions that should be made by the market it s just as important not to accept oversimplified solutions to complex problems presented by far right or far left leaning populist leaders unfortunately support for the far right and left is growing and has contributed to greater polarization in the united states this is further dividing americans and making it more difficult for congress to compromise to pass necessary legislation advertisement this polarization trend isn t just an american problem a recent report published by the organization for economic co operation and development a global policy forum indicates that over the past 30 years middle class households worldwide have experienced dismal or no income growth this has fueled perceptions that the current socio economic system is unfair and has led to greater support for extreme left and right ideologies and politicians that embrace them but that s not all stated by the pew research center across 27 countries surveyed 51 percent are dissatisfied with the way their democracy is functioning compared with 45 percent who are satisfied it s time to take a deep breath and not buy into emotionally appealing solutions from populist leaders who often scapegoat trade and immigration as the causes of america s problems in doing so keep the following points in mind first problems associated with rising income inequality a shrinking middle class and the inability to find meaningful work has much to do with lower and middle skilled jobs being eliminated by automation and the increasing demand for higher skilled workers moving forward 14 percent of existing jobs could disappear as a result of automation in the next 15 to 20 years plus another 32 percent are likely to change radically as individual tasks are automated says a recent report by the oecd other organizations say nearly half of existing jobs could vanish mostly affecting lower to middle skilled workers to adapt a well educated labor force should be a top national priority equal to the effort that put a man on the moon importantly students need the ability to pay for technical or university level educations without incurring unreasonable debt and employees of all ages need to engage in life long learning history reveals that after fast emerging technologies destroy jobs more new ones are created although we don t know what the new jobs will be we do know they will require highly skilled workers secondly don t scapegoat trade advertisement automation not trade accounted for more than 85 percent of u s job losses in manufacturing from 2000 through 2010 according to the center for business and economic research at ball state university although trade has contributed to some job losses it has provided far greater benefits today nearly half of all u s exports are sold to our 20 free trade agreement partners which only represent 6 percent of world consumers to boost job creating exports to the rest of the world we need more not fewer free trade agreements thirdly immigrants don t steal american jobs they help fill them immigrants help fill vacant american jobs at all skill levels but the worker shortage is getting worse according to korn ferry the u s skilled worker deficit could result in 1 75 trillion in lost revenue annually for american companies by 2030 in light of this legal immigration should be expanded not reduced furthermore american colleges and universities attract the best and brightest students the world has to offer however after graduation we send them home to compete against us allowing more foreign graduates to remain here to support our companies or start new ones would benefit our economy immigrants also add to america s population and consumer base germany and japan for example have negative population growth rates this puts downward pressure on their economic prospects the united states has problems but trade and immigration aren t to blame for them americans as well as others around the world need to look past the simplified and often emotionally charged solutions presented by far right and far left leaning populists or our problems will only get worse

washington ap president donald trump spoke this past week as if he s unaware that drug prices have gone up and tariffs came before him his boast that the u s never collected a dime on goods from china until he imposed them marked a series of statements misrepresenting how trade works as the two countries escalated their dispute with new and retaliatory taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a look at some recent rhetoric trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china ___ trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china ___ trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries ___ russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings ___ drug prices trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks monday at white house dinner the facts that s an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated friday before trump s latest claim and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications an analysis of brand name drug

sara megan walsh swalsh theledger com lakeland the nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis and lakeland is not an exception brenda petty moore said she was shocked when she was forced to confront the reality of the city s apartment rental market last year she and her brother charles moore were given an eviction notice forcing them to move out of swan cove apartments last may after a leaky roof caused significant mold issues the notice kicked off a frustrating hunt for an affordable two bedroom apartment priced at 950 a month or less it took more than four months to find a relatively reasonable place to move to and rent petty moore said it s a bad situation in lakeland i couldn t believe it but as i talked to more people i discovered it is a common problem the city is experiencing a shortage of quality affordable housing for its residents because of several market issues and the city has little to no influence over many of those forces mayor bill mutz admitted we don t have control he said key factors include a shortage of housing supply skyrocketing development costs and a growing population according to a study produced for the city by lakeland based kimley horn associates during the past two years in the study a household was considered affordable if the total cost of rent or mortgage payments taxes utility fees and insurance made up no more than 30 of the household s gross income there are national challenges and there are these local challenges senior project manager william roll of kimley horn associates said the national challenges are orders of magnitude bigger than the local challenges wages vs rent in lakeland and across the country workers wages have not kept pace with increasing land and construction costs theresa maio the city s planning and housing manager calculated an employee needs to earn a minimum wage of 17 90 an hour to afford a one bedroom apartment or make at least 22 10 for a two bedroom apartment in lakeland assuming a 40 hour work week however the median income is only 39 706 per year or a little more than 19 an hour for petty moore her search for an apartment was complicated because she was semi retired out of work and recovering from a hip replacement surgery her brother is employed full time by sykes enterprises but the rental rates of 1 100 to 1 300 a month would have financially stressed their budget i had to ask when did lakeland reach that point of asking so much for a two bedroom one bathroom apartment petty moore said i was not expecting those inflated prices the cost of renting an apartment is rapidly rising nationwide the city s study found the total number of housing units priced at 800 a month shrank by 2 while there was a 97 increase in apartments rented for 2 000 or more a month in 2017 petty moore who is a senior citizen like 52 7 of the city s households said she considered moving into a senior housing development to find a lower priced apartment or condominium however she said many restricted communities already have a waiting list of a year or more lack of affordability we built 64 apartments in wauchula and it filled up the day that we got the sticker of occupancy said gene strickland a real estate broker for developers and former lakeland city manager it had a list from here to the parking lot of people waiting it was pathetic strickland worked with fort lauderdale based green mills group on aida palms a 96 unit north lakeland affordable housing complex that opened in july 2017 the complex was fully leased upon its grand opening they never even saw the apartments they were getting said amanda steuwe community manager for aida palms steuwe said the complex had a waiting list of more than 800 individuals seeking to rent a unit and each day it continues to increase since 2017 she d only had a handful of people move out and a few evictions we have a 100 renewal rate she said there are 27 complexes offering more than 3 200 affordable apartments for rent in polk county to low income families and seniors in 2018 these units were 98 2 occupied according to data compiled by the florida housing finance corp a nonprofit created by the state legislature roughly 35 years ago to help provide affordable housing opportunities for residents the organization estimates more than 9 700 additional apartments are needed to provide adequate housing for the county s low income residents we don t do market studies anymore the day we finish construction it s filled strickland said aida palms is the only apartment complex of five units or more to be completed within the city since 2016 the city doesn t track apartment buildings of less than five units mutz has said he hopes to see 500 new units built by 2023 the proposed 305 unit mirrorton development by the tampa based framework group is awaiting its final permits from the city the 80 unit east parker street development proposed by green mills could help the city meet its goal if construction moves forward making the leap renter to owner another factor compounding issues in the apartment rental market is florida s record low homeownership rate it s estimated only 64 1 of residents owned their homes in 2017 slightly above the national average but still down from the state s 66 3 average during the past 34 years according to figures released by the state in september apartments now capture more revenue than they ever have and homeownership is at the lowest level in 50 years affordability is at the heart of that said bob adams owner and president of highland homes the lakeland based builder with more than 40 years experience said he has seen first time buyers squeezed out of the market because of increasing home prices and the federal government gradually increasing interest rates jeff bagwell one of the founders of the keystone challenge fund said while home costs are a factor it s more a matter of financially burdened renters being able to save a few dollars and cents the biggest issue with low and moderate income people is down payment assistance and closing costs he said they are used to paying rent they can pay 800 a month rent bagwell said he meets an increasing number of individuals financially buried under student debt people come in here all the time with 20 30 or 40 000 in student loans and i ask did you get your degree he said they tell me no bagwell said potential homeowners who are trapped with a large monthly student loan payment and spending up to 50 of their income on rent often rely on federal or state assistance to help bridge the gap housing a priority the keystone challenge fund receives money indirectly from the state filtered through polk county and the city of lakeland to offer low to moderate income families with down payment assistance and closing costs the funds come from the state housing initiatives partnership program the keystone challenge fund and lakeland s community redevelopment agency are out of assistance funds for the current fiscal year and its future ship funding is still being calculated maio said lakeland is slated to receive funding from the u s department of housing and urban development of 935 111 in community block development grants down 4 4 from 2018 that can be used for property acquisition housing rehabilitation or to benefit a public service in addition the city will receive 362 966 in home investment partnership program funds down 13 from last year to offer aid to low income households through down payment assistance or rehabilitation the city held a public meeting may 13 to solicit input from residents on how these federal funds would be best spent the state s doc stamp tax raised more than 335 million for the sadowski trust fund but lawmakers approved only about 200 million will be used for affordable housing as was the fund s original intent half of the state funding has been set aside to help hurricane michael victims with another 8 million solely for workforce housing in jacksonville the remaining cities and counties across florida including lakeland have to figure out how to split the remaining 77 million fairly maio said it is unclear exactly how much lakeland will receive but she hopes it will be a slight increase from roughly 150 000 in 2018 if there s no funding that hurts my entry level buyers they can t save up the down payment bagwell said if i can t put them into entry level houses they are staying in apartments longer which of course causes a crunch priced out it s not that there aren t homes being built in lakeland in 2018 the city issued more than 400 permits for construction of single family homes according to jason wiley lakeland s business development manager wiley said that s more than double the city s yearly average despite this construction there s a shortage of houses for sale on the market sending the average sale price higher in january 2019 approximately 300 homes were sold according to wiley out of approximately 900 that are on the market that s enough to meet three months of demand by comparison he said there were approximately 1 800 houses on the market five years ago what is a concern is the lack of inventory he said there s not many opportunities we are in a very competitive sellers market buyers are seeing fewer choices and the demand has caused the average price of a lakeland home to rise above 200 000 it s a number we haven t seen before wiley said lakeland s options mayor mutz said he recognizes that lakeland s study states the city has little to no direct control over many of the factors controlling housing affordability one of its first recommendations was for the city to conduct a study and reassess its impact fees or a charge to developers for improvements the city needs to make to roadways sidewalks or other structures due to the new construction tom wodrich the city s chief planner for community and economic development said the city already reviews its impact fees every five years and a study is currently underway the commission unanimously decided at its may 7 planning meeting to commit 250 000 each year starting in fiscal year 2020 to help address the city s housing issues everyone says affordable housing is something we should do but you have to build a plan around it mutz said looking within maio said lakeland community redevelopment agency has whittled a list of more than 700 properties down to a group of 116 parcels totaling 40 acres that could be suitable for housing projects the majority of the 116 properties are less than 1 acre in size each according to maio and zoned for single family housing we hear a lot of criticism around the community about how much land the city owns and we re sitting on this stock commissioner scott franklin said i really hope we can set some aggressive goals to get this property off our roll and into constructive uses maio said city staff believes some of the sites could be combined into larger plots that may be attractive to developers she said it provides an opportunity to create housing for what s called the missing middle like townhouses that provide an incremental step between moving from multi family apartments to a larger single family lot maio presented a draft concept for olive street townhouses that proposes eight 1 500 square foot townhomes be built side by side to provide transitional missing middle housing lakeland commissioners have not yet decided how the 250 000 they agreed to set aside each year to address housing affordability will be spent maio suggested the city could set it up as a revolving loan fund or offer some type of affordable housing incentive the city will hold a june 28 workshop on its affordable housing policies and goals for the 2020 fiscal year we do everything else well mutz said we bring in new companies but if we don t bring places for people who are in the workforce to live then we haven t finished our job sara

by john ward looked at with a jaundiced eye western nations and power blocs are no longer pluralist we do not have legislative oppositions any more that look to the future only establishments inviting in power greedy alt states while ignoring those who pay for them to do so we have nothing beyond extra parliamentary resistance such is far better than nothing but only social change grounded citizen centric parties and leaders can succeed in one day taking back power from the corporatocracies emerging everywhere the slog highlights some of the obstacles in the way of getting there today s essay is a uk euro american event that focuses on the growing role of various alt for alternative states and ideologies in our daily lives and probable futures i dislike the term deep state because such élites are now above ground and obvious and i think surveillance state is far too narrow there are several alt states at work ranging from surveillance military and energy via financial neoliberal big business media and bureaucratic interests superimposed upon these states within the state are several ideologies that share one thing with the alt states an unquenchable lust for power in the name of the people which in reality cares not a fig about any people beyond their people these i would name and frequently shame in these columns as violent socialist collectivism monetary economic theory radical islam plus its camp followers free trade globalist mercantilism hardline knee jerk feminism and political correctism be they alts or isms and of course they overlap there are also two traits that go hand in hand with knowing better ruthless intolerance of alternative speech writing and thought and complete contempt for the devolved enablement of directly accountable democracy the job of every opposition party in a politically plural culture is two fold to point out faults in government strategy objectives and priorities while proposing practical alternatives and to oppose any action by government in general they perceive to be a threat to the liberal as in tolerant democratic state in the us which i know well in the uk where i was brought up in the eu where i live in india which i like in russia china and much of africa and south america there is either no opposition at all or one that obsesses purely about political direction while ignoring obvious instances of alt states and ideologies undermining the true democratic process i apologise if that was something of a mouthful but would beg to illustrate the observation by reference to infamous history after john fitzgerald kennedy was elected to the white house in late 1959 and before he was sworn in the outgoing republican president dwight d eisenhower sat the young senator down in a bug free room and warned him about the mic military industrial complex the forerunner of today s alt states as a clear and present threat to free speech democracy grateful for the warning jfk already knew some of this his first two years in office however in dealing with racism cuba the pentagon the mafia and texan oilmen opened his eyes to the sheer size of the problem so during the last year of his life kennedy and his disciples worked not just on sound economic management and a tough anti ussr foreign policy but also on being the opposition to alt statism organised crime militarily mendacious intelligence overseas adventurism cia régime change and the texan hard right security oil wealth nexus there is now little doubt that had he survived to run for a second term jfk would ve dumped vice president lyndon baynes johnson a texan hawk to send a clear message to the enemy he told fbi boss j edgar hoover that he would scatter the cia to the four winds ten days before going to dallas in november 1963 he made a major speech syndicated across american radio to express his total opposition to fighting communism by restricting american liberty the night before his assassination he told his press secretary pierre salinger the thing we have to get in vietnam after 64 is the f k out like other real democrats like fd roosevelt and harry truman jack kennedy was opposed to the unelected status quo that threatened the bill of rights we shall never know for sure who organised his assassination but it is increasingly clear that one or more of the alt states cooperated in ensuring that the hit in dealey plaza dallas texas succeeded those he opposed also knew how to send a message fifty six years on only a handful of political leaders and party big beasts are doing or trying to do the culturo constitutional things kennedy believed to be non negotiable donald trump shows signs of doing so but the alt states usually both surround and outwit him viktor orban has succeeded on a small scale in revolutionising hungarian politics and resisting the blandishments of the european commission assembly and central bank while the italian government continues to play hardball against brussels austerity ideologues and remains a vocal critic of the euro currency what are the official opposition parties doing in the us britain france the european parliament and other centres of potentially contrarian thought the short and clinically accurate answer is navel gazing collaboration the us democrats buy into the ideological authoritarianism and accept all the alt states as if they were as american as hamburgers and apple pie they use state apparatus illegally to try and remove the democratically elected trump moan continuously about electoral fraud in which they themselves are massively implicated and toy with washed up dinosaurs like joe biden aside from elizabeth warren and her desire to root and branch reform the banking system we simply do not hear any doubts expressed in contemporary us politics about the rogue power of the state department the pentagon texan oil barons radical islam middle eastern neocon foreign policy the fbi the cia or indeed anything in britain where a silent but rapid corporatist pc media bureauratic mi6 alt states putsch has developed around superbloc fan theresa may and her chancellor neither the labour nor liberal democrat parties oppose any of the obviously unhealthy and often unconstitutional behaviour of may her attorney general and the twin whitehall eunato fanatics robbins and sedwill the reason for this is simple they approve of it and want it to remain in place should they ever come to power and gleefully begin to use it for their own ideological ends and they gladly comply with the stark naked rape of sovereign brexit for they are all bloc heads who believe sovereignty nationalism and the concept of popular will to be naively 20th century as most of their socio economic views were promulgated in the 18th and 19th centuries this is perhaps not surprising it is unquestionably galling and pernicious but does it represent in any way an act of opposition of course it doesn t it reflects only blind admiration for big federalist process at the expense of personal responsibility and creative fulfilment two years ago france or rather a barely democratic minority of the french people elected emmanuel macron president macron is a dictatorial product of the ecole national d administration enarc a former senior director at rothschild and a man who used establishment media and banking money to convince useful idiots that he was the centrist who would get la france en marche political opposition to his privatisation stealth taxes social cuts and overwhelmingly blairite virtue signalling has been minimal only the still strong regional press here has expressed doubts about him the big cities business banking and legislative houses have offered little or no effective opposition to his anti union deregulation anti citizen and illiberal use of social force there is no meaningful legislative plurality in the us britain and france all the opposition pressure is extra legislature that is in the latin sense of outside the congress parliament and the national assembly we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in the us it comes from the dogged determination of those various communities forgotten by the alt states main street rural america white trash america salute the flag america traditionalist old america and most bitterly anti pc banking and obscenely rich america where everything is rigged against the perspiring body of real america donald trump perpetrated a reverse takeover of the republican party the us congressional gop played a role in his election that was to say the least of it baffled and grudging at best the uk s attack on censorious ideology and élite bloc head corruption has come overwhelmingly from one man an early member of ukip and now the undisputed boss of tbp the brexit party nigel farage in his case the private and state media have done everything in their power to smear and snear the legislature parties have treated him as an infectious threat to their duopoly which he undoubtedly is and the left both inside and outside parliament have been outrageously biased in their increasingly laughable attempts to position him as variously misogynist racist fascist megalomanic and autocratic only the last of those has any behavioural evidence to support it by comparison their own leader corbyn s party purges are akin to josef stalin on steroids the french resistance passed an allo allo qu est ce qui se passe ici judgement verdict on their new president soon nicknamed macronapoleon fairly swiftly but it wasn t from the assembly it wasn t even from the the trade union movement it came from the gilets jaunes an avowedly anti political and economic ideology movement that has no national deputies and flatly rejects the idea of ever having any because it recognises that the system is rotten and increasingly works only for the wonks and the rich the gjs yellow vests have gone the suffragette route of civil disobedience with a specific focus on tax as a means of pauperising lower middle agrarian and working class france ask any group of them what they are primarily against and they say l injustice fiscale tax injustice it has hit a severely raw nerve in moyen classe france that encompasses anyone using petrol paying autoroute tolls and watching in dismay as the rural domestic land tax continues to sky rocket they continue to disrupt cities starve the government of tax income and embarrass macron at every turn without trying to elect a single deputy they have forced him to cut petrol taxes and call a national debate on social justice his televised conclusions about le grand débat were found puerile by a staggering 63 of viewers already he has the air of a one term president but yet again the so called major ps and ump republicain parties have been largely sidelined for the first time in nearly ninety years neither mainstream organisation made it to the presidential second round we are just a week away as i write from what are going to be the most anti establishment eurosceptic eu elections in the union s history my take at this juncture is so far so good but it s nowhere near enough although it would be comforting to think otherwise none of trump farage the gilets jaunes disruptive elements in an eu talking shop or a tricky oil and water italian eurosceptic coalition are viable long term weapons in the global attempt by personal destiny control pdc units to defeat 3 repressive power bloc élites they may just be the end of the beginning of the liberty backlash but expect an immediate counterattack probably based on carefully staged security emergencies by the alt states to provide suitable excuses for yet further reductions in free speech the recent soros backed schools push to create a sense of child killer climate emergency is already being used to purge our universities of co2 sceptics and the furiously illiberal campaign by labour deputy leader tom watson to crush any criticism of multicultural shortcomings or islamic agitprop in britain was truly breathtaking he has lost a lot of weight recently but watson seems to have achieved it by shedding large numbers of marbles en route trump may have captured the gop but he shows no sign of controlling the real power brokers farage remains a single issue bombast whose broader views on the need to restore social justice and constitutional probity are at best sketchy and at worst wrong yellow vests saying what they don t like is no substitute for a radical reform plan and the brussels bourbons are implacably opposed to democratic reform for the simple reason they don t like democracy period sooner rather than later the eu is going to go bang following a combination of banking and member state crises too late the fluffy dupes will grasp that fake data has been more disastrous than any piece of fake news the same people at whom this blog is aimed will remain a minority of thinkers aware of just how geopolitically and socially dangerous the medium term is likely to become every substantial nation state in the first world is now split down the middle between status quo élites offering counterfeit change and extra legislative movements determined to offer the real thing that could so easily degrade into tsars losing out to bolsheviks and kaisers making way for nazis political language has been so mangled inverted and manipulated over the last four decades in the west whatever spurious ideologies of either left or right were put forward would quickly give way to the reality of bigger north koreas and vietnams where the power cult of personality is almost always the outcome we must see these new ground level playing fields as catalysts and not expect them to bring about the alt states cataclysm in one 90 minute cup tie fiscal financial and economic chaos will in and of itself have a far greater potential to destroy élites already weakened by pdc history shows us unfortunately that anarchy leads quickly to autocracy that s why the search for robust long term creative solutions based on social anthropology and sound empirically proven ecology ideas must start without delay cometh the hour cometh nobody just yet i m off to watch the cup final i wish one and all a restful and thoughtful weekend
the united states as the wealthiest country in history should have the best education system in the world today in a highly competitive global economy if we are going to have the kind of standard of living that the people of this country deserve we need to have the best educated workforce but let me be very honest with you and tell you that sadly that is not the case today our nation used to lead the world in the percentage of young americans with college degrees we were number one today we are number 11 behind countries like south korea japan canada ireland the united kingdom and australia and that is not acceptable and here is the simple truth 40 or 50 years ago in california and vermont virtually any place in america if you received a high school degree the odds were pretty good that you would be able to get a decent paying job raise a family buy a house buy a car all on one income that was the world 40 or 50 years ago but that is not the world we live in today the world has changed the global economy has changed technology has changed and education has changed over the past decade states all over america have made savage cuts to education while at the same time providing massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people and largest corporations in america our kids and our students are too important to cut back on education especially when those cuts reduce educational opportunities for underserved students students of color low income students lgbtq students and students with disabilities among the 35 countries that are members of the organization for economic cooperation and development the u s ranked 30th in math and 19th in science reading scores for our students are not much better the u s ranked 24th when compared to other highly industrialized countries such as singapore canada and germany and due to re segregation of our k 12 schools if you are a student of color chances are your math science and reading scores are even lower persistent disparities in achievement among underserved students means that we must do more to make sure that every student in the country gets a high quality education regardless of how much income his or her family makes if our public schools are struggling then we cannot possibly expect our students to be prepared for success in postsecondary education in the twenty first century a free public education system that goes from kindergarten through high school is no longer good enough if we are to succeed as a nation public colleges and universities must be tuition free higher education should be a right for all not a privilege for the few that means we have got to make public colleges and universities tuition free and we must substantially reduce student debt each and every year hundreds of thousands of bright and qualified young people do not get a higher education for one reason and one reason alone their family lacks the income that is unfair to those families and it is it is unfair to the future of this country instead of pursuing their dreams of being an environmentalist a teacher a social worker or an artist too many americans end up taking higher paying jobs on wall street or as accountants or as corporate managers simply to pay back their student loans we need environmentalists we need people to take care of the poor we need health care providers to choose to work in community health centers we need good teachers each and every american must be able to get the education they need to match their skills and fulfill their dreams in fulfilling those dreams we must make teaching a highly attractive profession again teachers have one of the toughest and most demanding jobs in america teachers have been the leaders in the fight to improve public schools reduce class sizes and provide every student with books computers and safe high quality schools what encourages me and gives me so much hope about the future is that teachers across the country are standing up and saying enough is enough the wealthiest people in america cannot have it all while public schools all over america are falling apart over the past year tens of thousands of teachers across the country have gone on strike to demand greater investment in public education the wave of teacher strikes throughout the country provides an historic opportunity to make the investments we desperately need to make our public education system the best in the industrialized world not one of the poorest bernie s education plan addresses the serious crisis in our education system by reducing racial and economic segregation in our public school system attracting the best and the brightest educational professionals to teach in our classrooms and reestablishing a positive learning environment for students in our k 12 schools this plan calls for a transformative investment in our children our teachers and our schools and a fundamental re thinking of the unjust and inequitable funding of our public education system 1 combating racial discrimination and school segregation 65 years after brown v board of education many u s schools remain unacceptably segregated some 300 school districts are currently under desegregation orders and the supreme court has curtailed the government s power to address them under betsy devos the department of education office of civil rights has outrageously scaled back civil rights investigations and dismissed hundreds of them in short order in america today only 20 percent of public school teachers are nonwhite and with minority students comprising a majority in our public schools the gap is growing research shows that students of color who have at least one teacher of color by third grade are more likely to graduate from high school and enroll in college nationwide about 7 percent of public school teachers are black due to implicit racial bias black students even in preschool are nearly four times as likely to be suspended as whites putting them at greater risk of falling behind and getting caught up in the juvenile justice system black students and students with disabilities are more likely to be subjected to exclusionary discipline measures than their same age peers when a child is pushed out of school they lose instructional time and are more likely to become involved with the juvenile and adult justice systems we must end the school to prison pipeline as president bernie sanders will build on the strength in diversity act to increase not cut federal funding for community driven strategies to desegregate schools to increase not cut federal funding for community driven strategies to desegregate schools triple title i funding to ensure at risk schools get the funding they need and end funding penalties for schools that attempt to desegregate execute and enforce desegregation orders and appoint federal judges who will enforce the 1964 civil rights act in school systems in school systems address disciplinary practices in schools that disproportionately affect black and brown children establish a dedicated fund to create and expand teacher training programs at hbcus minority serving institutions msis and tribal colleges and universities to increase educator diversity fully fund the department of education s office of civil rights and remove current protocols that allow for arbitrary dismissal of complaints fund school transportation to help integration ending the absurd prohibitions in place increase funding for public magnet schools to 1 billion annually to help integrate our schools increase access to english as a second language instruction 2 end the unaccountable profit motive of charter schools recognizing the problems in a one size fits all model of education teachers unions and parent activists established alternative experimental charter schools to better serve kids struggling within the traditional system but few charter schools have lived up to their promise instead billionaires like devos and the waltons together with private equity and hedge fund executives have bankrolled their expansion and poured tens of millions into school board and other local elections with the hope of privatizing public schools charter schools are led by unaccountable private bodies and their growth has drained funding from the public school system moreover the proliferation of charter schools has disproportionately affected communities of color 17 percent of charter schools are 99 percent minority compared to 4 percent of traditional public schools this has led the naacp the nea aft and others to criticize the charter movement for intensifying racial segregation the damage to communities caused by unregulated charter school growth must be stopped and reversed as president bernie sanders will fight to ban for profit charter schools and support the naacp s moratorium on public funds for charter school expansion until a national audit has been completed to determine the impact of charter growth in each state that means halting the use of public funds to underwrite new charter schools we do not need two schools systems we need to invest in our public schools system that said existing charter schools must be made accountable by mandating that charter schools comply with the same oversight requirements as public schools mandating that at least half of all charter school boards are teachers and parents disclosing student attrition rates non public funding sources financial interests and other relevant data matching employment practices at charters with neighboring district schools including standards set by collective bargaining agreements and restrictions on exorbitant ceo pay supporting the efforts of charter school teachers to unionize and bringing charter schools to the negotiating table 3 equitable funding for public schools in america today most school districts are funded out of local property tax revenue resulting in unconscionable inequalities the federal government by conditioning funding on standardized test scores has worsened the disparities between school districts and among states since school districts are funded out of local property taxes less is invested in the education of children from low income families compared with their more affluent peers in america the quality of a child s education should not and cannot depend on their zip code as president bernie sanders will fight to equitably fund our schools he will rethink the link between property taxes and education funding establish a national per pupil spending floor eliminate barriers to college readiness exams by ensuring states cover fees for the act sat and other college preparatory exams for all students triple title i funding to ensure at risk schools get the funding they need and end funding penalties for schools that attempt to desegregate provide schools with the resources needed to shrink class sizes provide 5 billion annually for career and technical education to give our students the skills they need to thrive once they graduate ensure schools in rural communities indigenous communities puerto rico and other u s territories receive equitable funding give schools the funding needed to support arts foreign language and music education to provide all students with important learning opportunities 4 strengthen the individuals with disabilities education act idea over 40 years ago the federal government made a promise to school districts around the country to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education it is an understatement to point out that the federal government has not come close to keeping this promise special education is an expensive proposition and because of inadequate federal funding property taxes around the country are increasing while kids with disabilities are not getting the attention they deserve the idea helps about 6 5 millionchildren with disabilities but because of a chronic lack of funding there is a shortage of special education teachers and physical and speech therapists and the turnover rate among them is incredibly high as president bernie sanders will provide mandatory funding to ensure that the federal government provides at least 50 percent of the funding for special education guarantee children with disabilities an equal right to high quality education by enforcing the americans with disabilities act increase educational opportunities for persons with disabilities including an expansion in career and technical education opportunities to prepare students for good paying community employment address the shortage in special education teacher recruitment training opportunities workload and pay for special education teachers triple title i funding to ensure students with disabilities are able to get quality education regardless of the zip code they live in 5 give teachers a much deserved raise and empower them to teach the historic teacher strikes of the past few years has brought national attention to the fact that teachers are paid totally inadequate wages as a result of low pay and other inequities 20 percent of teachers now leave the profession within five years a 40 percent increase from the historical average this high rate of turnover is more pronounced in low income communities of color as president bernie sanders will fight to significantly increase teacher pay by working with states to set a starting salary for teachers at no less than 60 000 tied to cost of living years of service and other qualifications and allowing states to go beyond that floor based on geographic cost of living end racial and gender disparities in teacher pay ensure professional development for all teachers including continuing education and mentorship programs protect and expand collective bargaining rights and teacher tenure triple the above the line tax deduction for educator expenses and index it to inflation to reimburse teachers for the nearly 500 on average they spend on out of pocket classroom expenses each year create a grant program to provide teachers with funds explicitly meant for classroom materials empower teachers to provide a teacher supported curriculum that gives students the best possible education 6 expand after school summer education programs it is well known that summer and afterschool programs prevent summer slide and help kids learn grow and avoid risky behaviors research shows that quality afterschool summer programs give students the academic social and professional skills they need to succeed students who regularly attend after school programs have better attendance grades and behavior in school better peer relations and emotional adjustment and lower incidence of drug use violence and unintended pregnancy numerous studies have shown that these benefits make afterschool programs a positive return on investment saving taxpayer dollars over time after school summer programs also alleviate a major burden on working families these programs work for children families and communities disgracefully the trump administration has proposed eliminating 2 billion in funding for after school and summer learning programs which would devastate some 1 7 million children and families we should expand the number of programs in order to meet the need for every child now in an after school program two more are waiting to get in bernie has a better idea as president he will spend 5 billion annually to substantially expand access to summer and after school programs teen centers and tutoring 7 universal school meals in america today one in every six kids goes hungry instead of addressing this crisis students with lunch debt are sometimes denied meals have debt collectors sent after their families and are even denied their diplomas unacceptable it is not a radical idea that no child in this country should go hungry we must ensure that all students have access to healthy school meals as president bernie sanders will fight to provide year round free universal school meals breakfast lunch and snacks through our school meals programs and offer incentives for sourcing food from local sources expand summer ebt across the country to ensure no student goes hungry during the summer 8 sustainable community schools our public schools can and should be more than just places where children learn they can be community centers that build the health and well being of students we must act to transform our education system into a high quality public good that connects education health and social services to young people a strong investment in sustainable community school programs can help us achieve that president trump has proposed eliminating funding for community school programs we have a better idea as president bernie sanders will fight to provide 5 billion in annual funding for sustainable community schools to provide a holistic full service approach to learning and the wellbeing of our young people our schools are a public good by transforming them into sustainable community schools we can provide health and support services including dental care mental health care and substance abuse prevention community and youth organizing community goods and services such as job training classes art spaces ged and esl classes 9 school infrastructure schools across urban and rural america are crumbling a 2014 study found that at least 53 percent of the nation s schools need immediate repair at least 2 3 million students mostly in rural communities attend schools without high speed internet access teachers are paid starvation wages and schools across underserved urban and rural parts of our country are crumbling stories abound about heating systems giving out in the winter ceilings leaking during storms and mold accumulating in plain sight that is unacceptable and has got to change sanders will fully close the gap in school infrastructure funding to renovate modernize and green the nation s schools 10 make schools a safe and inclusive place for all our schools must be safe for all students period it is disgusting that our children must face the terrifying reality of being at risk of being killed in their own schools and that school districts must resort to measures like this to try to keep kids safe we must ensure lgbtq students can attend school without fear of bullying and work to substantially reduce suicides
u s highlights equity markets rebounded this week as the u s administration delayed its decision on auto tariffs for six months housing starts and retail sales data for april support the narrative of healthy domestic spending this quarter that said externally oriented industries appear to be getting caught in the downdraft of weak foreign demand formerly resilient u s manufacturing activity has softened this year in line with global developments canadian highlights canada s housing market showed further signs of stabilization in april with home sales rising 3 6 still the market is highly fragmented between east and west activity is weak and relatively oversupplied in markets west of ontario but strong and relatively tight in ontario and eastward the bank of canada released its annual financial system review this week outlining its assessment of vulnerabilities to financial stability little surprise the level of household debt topped the list however with slowing credit growth and tighter mortgage lending conditions this vulnerability was characterized as moderating relative to previous years inflation ticked up to 2 0 in april as energy prices advanced core inflation measures on the other hand ticked down and on average are running just below the bank of canada s target u s domestic resilience but weakness abroad taking a toll u s equity markets managed to shrug off much of last week s losses after rumors earlier this week confirmed by the white house this morning that the u s administration would delay a decision on auto tariffs for six months however this somewhat renewed sense of optimism in equities was not shared by the bond market u s treasury yields hit lows last seen in late 2017 just prior to fiscal stimulus being announced moreover markets are raising their bets that the fed s next move will likely be a rate cut rather than a rate hike unease about u s economic performance is building for good reason economic growth is set to moderate this year after a blowout stimulus fueled 2018 foreign demand remains weaker than last year while geopolitical risks and trade policy uncertainty appear to be on the rise moreover high frequency indicators are beginning to diverge domestic demand remains resilient but externally oriented industries are combatting stronger headwinds data for retail sales and housing starts for april support the view that the domestic economy remains healthy although retail sales pulled back in april this came after a very strong march some payback was to be expected even with the decline the strength in march alongside continued income gains supports a very healthy 3 quarterly annualized rate of expansion in consumer spending in the second quarter chart 1 housing starts on the other hand surprised to the upside after december s dip housing starts appear to have regained stronger footing but activity has been choppy through april home builder sentiment is improving as well reaching a 7 month high in may moderating home price growth combined with lower mortgage rates rising wage growth and decades low vacancy rates should support more homebuilding in the months to come all told the data this week remains consistent with our forecast for the u s economy to expand at a 2 annualized pace this quarter largely on the back of a more confident consumer that said signs continue to build that this may be as good as things get for the rest of this year cracks are beginning to appear in what was previously a very resilient manufacturing sector industrial production contracted 0 5 in april the third contraction monthly contraction this year this mirrors the declining pace of output reported in the ism manufacturing survey chart 2 softer auto sales are partly to blame as motor vehicle assemblies have fallen 12 8 since december s peak although manufacturing is a relatively small share of the u s economy about 11 its performance is still considered a harbinger of the direction of the u s economy largely due to its sensitivity to changes in foreign demand on that front there are some signs that the global economy is gradually improving however escalating trade and geopolitical risks threaten to derail this nascent recovery canada housing market stabilizing debt risks still elevated global equity markets had a raucous week as china announced countermeasures in response to increased u s tariffs canada was pulled along for the ride but despite declines early in the week it looks to have managed to scrape by with a modest gain as the week came to a close in terms of economic data the key release this week was data on home sales new listings and prices signs of a stabilization in housing demand continued in april canadian home sales rose 3 6 accelerating from an upwardly revised 2 3 reading in march sales were up across most provinces with only manitoba seeing a pullback the canadian housing story remains one of stark divergence between markets in western canada and those in the east there are two sub threads here first weakness in energy producing provinces is not confined to housing fortunately major markets in saskatchewan and alberta saw solid sales gains in home sales in april evidence perhaps of underlying economic improvement that has also been echoed in recent jobs reports still these markets remain over supplied with sales to new listings ratios generally in buyers market territory chart 1 in vancouver the story is not about economic weakness the b c economy has been one of canada s fastest growing and seemingly immune to the slowdown in this important sector instead the cumulative impact of higher mortgage rates measures to stem foreign demand at the provincial level and tighter mortgage lending standards at the national level have combined to pull the chair out from under home sales in april sales in greater vancouver hit a new cycle low the sales to new listings ratio is deep in buyer s market territory suggesting yet further price declines on the horizon in central and eastern canada the story is one of either stability following past adjustments or of outright strength sales were up again in the greater toronto area in april raising the sales to new listings ratio further into balanced market territory in markets in the province s east such as ottawa sales are close to record highs and well into seller s market territory contributing to healthy price gains the same is true in quebec where both sales and prices are up and with tight markets look to remain so the performance of the housing market is of central concern to the bank of canada which noted these divergences in its financial system review fsr released this week overall the bank judges imbalances in housing markets to have moderated but remain a source of vulnerability the bank s number one vulnerability is the intrinsically related one of elevated household debt this risk too is seen as moderating reflecting a slowdown in household credit growth and reduction in the share of new mortgage debt going to highly indebted households chart 2 still given its potential to exacerbate an economic downturn this is one the bank of canada will watch closely canada upcoming key economic releases canadian retail sales march release date may 22 2019 previous 0 8 ex auto 0 6 td forecast 1 4 ex auto 1 3 consensus 1 2 ex auto 1 0 td looks for retail sales to build on recent gains with a 1 4 advance in march reflecting broad strength in household goods consumption gasoline stations and motor vehicle sales should lead the move with the former benefitting from a 10 m m increase in the price at the pump this will allow the ex autos measure to come in near the headline print at 1 3 although sales should see more modest gains 0 8 when excluding gasoline as well core retail sales rose by 0 4 in february for their first increase since september and we expect this performance to continue into march on the heels of a sharp increase in consumer goods imports and strong labour market data real retail sales should underperform the headline print owing to the sharp increase in gasoline prices although we still expect to see an increase of roughly 0 8 m m this is consistent with a flat print on q1 after soft data in january and february although stronger retail volumes will provide a solid handoff to q2
the escalating u s china trade war is threatening to upend the global economy s much anticipated rebound and could even throw its decade long expansion into doubt if the conflict spirals out of control fears that companies will shelve investment consumers will cut spending and stocks will slide have been revived after president donald trump and xi jinping s fragile trade truce was shattered with both sides slapping fresh tariffs on the other s goods reflecting the worries stocks fell this past week and two year u s treasury yields dropped to the lowest since february 2018 world growth already has slowed and further weakness would reinforce the reluctance at the federal reserve and fellow central banks to raise interest rates and perhaps even force them into fresh stimulus morgan stanley which still expects a u s china deal is warning of a global recession growth below 2 5 percent by 2020 if the two sides remain at odds just as tentative signs appeared that a recovery is taking hold trade tensions have re emerged as a credible and significant threat to the business cycle chetan ahya chief economist at the bank said in a report he highlighted a serious impact on corporate confidence from the tariff slug fest reasons for concern were evident wednesday with china reporting that industrial output retail sales and investment all slowed in april by more than economists forecast in the united states retail sales unexpectedly declined in april while factory production fell for the third time in four months although germany s economy emerged from stagnation to grow by 0 4 percent in the first quarter the outlook remains fragile amid a manufacturing slump that will be challenged anew by the trade war investor confidence in europe s largest economy unexpectedly weakened this month for the first time since october such softness even before the conflict between the united states and china reached new lows reinforces the concerns warnings about the fallout from protectionism already were behind the international monetary fund s april forecast for global growth this year to be the weakest since the financial crisis the organization for economic cooperation and development s composite leading indicator designed to anticipate turning points six to nine months before they happen fell for a 12th straight month in march hitting its lowest level since 2009 in a new study bloomberg economics calculated about 1 percent of global economic activity is at stake in goods and services traded between the two countries almost 4 percent of chinese output is exported to the united states and any hit to its manufacturers would reverberate through regional supply chains with taiwan and south korea among those at risk u s shipments to china are more limited though 5 1 percent of its agricultural production heads there as does 3 3 percent of its manufactured goods higher tariffs would mean lower margins for producers and higher prices for consumers and in turn reduced demand this would create widespread disruption along the supply chain bloomberg economist maeva cousin said to be sure many economists are still betting that the united states and china eventually will strike a deal perhaps at the group of 20 summit at the end of june when trump and xi are expected to meet but they acknowledge that they ve been surprised by the latest flare up in tensions and say the odds of a breakdown have risen a trade war would compound an existing softening in global growth and add to a mix of issues such as a cooling technology boom and weaker demand for cars particularly in china for companies it means visibility about the broader global backdrop is low u s chipmaker giant intel is taking a more cautious view of the year and italian drinks maker davide campari milano this month noted the uncertain geopolitical and macro economic environment the world economy has been in a significant slowdown for a period said james bevan chief investment officer at ccla investment management people just have to wake up and look at the trade data for central banks the darkening outlook likely will propel them deeper into dovish territory after the fed led the way in indicating it will keep rates on hold for a while in a worst case scenario in which tensions persist for another three months and more tariffs are imposed morgan stanley s economists reckon china would ease fiscal policy by the equivalent of 0 5 percentage point of gross domestic product and try to boost credit growth as for the federal reserve it would cut its benchmark by an initial 50 basis points they said if the tariff battle escalates it s going to be a fairly meaningful drag on the global economy and threaten the life of the expansion said

this might suggest clouds could be gathering over countries excessively reliant on external borrowing or foreign trade for example the ongoing economic recessions in argentina and turkey started with crises in their respective national currencies last summer both countries had significant public and private debt in us dollars and when us interest rates went up argentine an turkish economies went down us chinese trade tensions are threatening to repeat that scenario in other more sustainable em countries we continue to see the near term risks for em as tilted to the downside and the risk of additional tariffs being implemented is rising a team of morgan stanley experts led by james lord said in a note however some experts believe the majority of emerging markets will remain stable until and unless the us china tensions escalate into a full fledged trade war that scenario appears to be unlikely as of yet and economists believe the ongoing low key war of attrition won t take a huge toll of em countries the latest escalation in trade war tensions between the us and china is merely a negotiating tactic to extract concessions ahead of a deal jane brauer and lucas martin of bank of america merrill lynch said we think em spreads will not widen much more while markets wait for the outcome of the negotiations for their part goldman experts say some emerging markets still have lucrative investment opportunities in sectors not affected by the us china dispute still rife uncertainty surrounding the future of trade between the world s two largest economies is weighing on investor sentiments worldwide some market participants believe there could be more volatility to come while many developing nations are lacking sources of growth if cut off foreign borrowing and investment going forward
since 2016 there have been a number of global events that created and are still creating quite a bit of turmoil not least among investors from unrest in the levant region trade tensions between the us and china brexit the effects of climate change on the migration of people and food insecurity global events have meant that wealth and investment decisions are seeing some interesting trends particularly when it comes to how some asset classes are performing in comparison with others and for that class of movers and shakers in the world who invest in a range of assets in an effort to generate greater wealth there have been some changes to the breadth of the investment landscape traditionally stocks bonds commodities and property have been common modes of wealth creation but these assets have exhibited some uncertainty for a number of years now despite a period of pronounced peaks and troughs the world is coming to the end of one of the longest bull markets in modern history from the bottom of the financial crisis that began in 2008 until the present according to the wall street journal what this ongoing cycle of wide spread productivity and market favourability means is that there has been an increase in the number of people able to generate wealth knight frank s 2019 wealth report says that the global uhnwi ultra high net worth individuals population is forecast to rise by 22 per cent over the next five years meaning an extra 43 000 people will be worth more than 30m by 2023 and meanwhile those that already meet a healthy threshold can continue to expect their wealth to increase in the years ahead the global wealth shift according to jll s 2019 city momentum index the majority of economic growth taking place globally is concentrated in asia and africa and not in europe and the americas in fact according to the report which covers 131 major established and emerging business hubs across the globe the world s top 20 most dynamic cities are in india china vietnam kenya thailand and the philippines in 2018 the world s most powerful company was not apple or google s parent company alphabet but saudi aramco and a handful of the world s largest companies are concentrated in asia such as south korea s samsung japan s toyota and a number of chinese owned entities growth spreading on an east west divide has increased the purchasing power of many and is also inevitably constraining or stagnating growth in parts of the developed world poignantly jaron lanier an american philosopher and computer scientist notes in his latest book who owns the future if network technology is supposed to be so good for everyone why has the developed world suffered so much just as the technology has become widespread western nations have had a long trajectory of industrialisation and innovation that is now sustaining itself and it is yet to be seen how emerging markets that are booming today will be sustained in the long term nonetheless globalisation has allowed for many advancements in technology and connectedness in more parts of the world thus creating hundreds of thousands more people who are purchasing fine art classic cars designer goods and property with all of this wealth and a plethora of investment options it is vital for people to secure their wealth and generate more of it a number of emerging markets have generally implemented some controls to avoid large amounts of capital flight but places like dubai have benefited greatly from the proximity of a number of wealthy individuals with the impetus to protect their capital from their respective governments china has been one such country that has implemented capital controls in recent years in order to avoid further depreciation of the yuan on the opposite end of the spectrum is india where there has been a 144 per cent increase in outbound remittances the appeal of prime property when it comes to different asset classes certain commodities can often outperform other more traditional classes such as equities or fixed incomes fine art gold and cars for instance are typically harbours for when the markets are in a bearish cycle another asset class that is often looked at when markets are tough is property more specifically prime property in 2018 david godchaux ceo of core savills noted that prime property in dubai was 40 per cent less expensive than prime property in singapore and 50 per cent less expensive than that in paris and moscow citing 2017 transaction data from the dubai land department only 3 per cent of transactions that year were for properties in the prime category in another article titled how many square feet could 1 million get you dubai vs the world s top cities i highlight that dubai was one of the top three most affordable cities when it came to prime property despite dubai s property prices declining by 20 per cent in 2018 according to data property finder data research has found that demand for prime property has been buoyant from april 2017 to date the average transaction price for villas on the palm jumeirah is dhs15 525 000 with an overall decline of 20 per cent in the past two years while a 20 per cent decrease is in line with the overall market trend for property in dubai transactional volume and sales volume for prime property in particular has increased by 44 per cent for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the last quarter of 2018 according to transaction data from the dubai land department this trend could be attributed to the government s recent changes to visa policies whereby an investor who invests at least dhs10m in real estate could obtain a 10 year residency visa as well as visas for a spouse and children residency visas for five years are also an option for those who invest dhs5m in a property citizen by investment or cip s as they are better known or golden visas in other countries exist to attract capital from parts of the world that are troubled or where the movement of capital is otherwise restricted or dampened by the state examples include china vietnam and parts of the middle east the schemes help to generate revenue for the state while granting a safe haven or travel access to those who need it it is important to note that there are two sides to this coin as capital from large parts of the east flows into dubai property there is quite a bit of capital from the gcc region going out according to knight frank wealth intelligence in 2019 a total of 6 2bn was invested in property located in london 3 3bn uk regional 1bn europe 1 3bn and the us 600m leading the pack were uae investors with 2 8bn while that is not to say that some of the same investors are not investing locally as many are the ongoing generation and protection of wealth requires multiple facets as the us federal reserve board has indicated staving off any further hikes in interest rates in 2019 and even signaled toward lowering rates inflation of the us dollar will decrease as about a third of investors are looking at property as one of their main vehicles for investment this year and with the purchasing power of the us dollar increasing many markets around the world can expect investments in property to swell carla maria issa is senior research analyst at property finder
washington president donald trump spoke this past week as if he s unaware that drug prices have gone up and tariffs came before him his boast that the u s never collected a dime on goods from china until he imposed them marked a series of statements misrepresenting how trade works as the two countries escalated their dispute with new and retaliatory taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a look at some recent rhetoric trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings drug prices trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks monday at white house dinner the facts that s an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated friday before trump s latest claim and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press showed 2 712 price increases in the first half of january compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year however the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier an analysis by altarum a nonprofit research and consulting firm found that in 2018 spending on prescription drugs was one of the main factors behind a 4 5 increase in u s health spending spending on prescription drugs grew much faster than in 2017 according to the study economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum said he expects drug prices will continue to creep up i would be quite surprised if by july the annual rate doesn t return to a more normal 2 4 growth said hughes cromwick jobs trump we have the most people working today than at any time in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts true but not surprising the record workforce is driven by population growth a more relevant measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still far below record highs according to labor department data 60 6 percent of people in the united states 16 years and older were working in april that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 trump we have the biggest tax cut bill in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the

president barack obama s renewal of them a decade later
zimbabwe s finance minister mthuli ncube who is under fire even from zimbabwe african national union patriotic front legislators because of the continuing economic crisis in the country says zimbabwe is doing well in its economic reform agenda he told zimpapers television network that the country had made a lot of progress since in unveiled its transitional stabilisation programme in october last year if you look at our record on fiscal consolidation we have eliminated the deficit so tick that box we have achieved that if you look at the progress that we have made on the state enterprises agenda and earlier we were talking about the progress regarding csc regarding zupco and we have moved on to zesa and gmb de bundling dealing with governance issues and allied timbers he said so that s a lot of progress as i speak now if you look at the institutional agenda basically the posa bill is before parliament now and we have also reported on the freedom of information bill which will repeal aippa once it is approved by parliament again we have made a lot of progress on that so what i mean judging us in six months is that we will walk the talk on our economic reform agenda the cold storage company has secured a partner boulstead beef of the united kingdom which has promised to invest us 130 million over the next five years zimbabwe has also signed agreements to procure 800 buses to boost its public transport system under zupco on the burning issue of inflation ncube said i have always maintained that inflation will remain high until october this year and it is a technical phenomenon because we have changed the base of inflation and then by year end it will then come down so for example this time next year it should be much lower than what it is by the way i welcome what the retailers have done which is self regulating in terms of increasing prices and that s what it should be there is no justification for prices to go up the way they are doing and the retailers using the parallel rate to determine the prices that is bad economics that s bad finance and that is not how it is done if you produce a good locally what will work out is the import component within that and it is never a 100 percent so it can t be that whenever the exchange rate rises you raise your prices so the move by retailers shows that we are beginning to engage again in a constructive dialogue and that is most welcome ncube told parliament on wednesday that zimbabweans must stop thinking in united states dollar terms by pegging prices on the us dollar and then converting to the local rtgs dollar i urge members to use that as their accounting currency shall we go back to comparing our salaries to the pound that we used to use during udi shall we go back to comparing our salaries to other currencies that we have used in the past he said let us move on and we have a currency right now and let us use that as our accounting currency in our arguments it will help our arguments and negotiations if our employees are able to argue their case on the bases of the current currency arrangement and as well as the current levels of inflation 121 views
the trade war between the world s two largest economies the united states and china poses more risks than opportunities to the nigerian economy femi asu writes nigeria africa s top oil producer like many other economies is not immune to the impact of the escalating trade battle between the us and china with both countries levying tariffs on each other s imports in december last year both countries agreed to a truce after months of hostilities and began to talk but negotiations toward resolving the us china trade war stalled last week the us imposed fresh tariffs last friday on imports from china as the trump administration raised tariffs to 25 per cent from 10 per cent on chinese imports that are worth about 200bn a year the trade war escalated sharply on monday as china hit back with five per cent to 10 per cent duties on another 60bn worth of u s goods a development that sparked the biggest fall in us stock prices since january the international monetary fund in its assessment of the global economy in october last year warned that the trade war risked making the world a poorer and more dangerous place saying a full blown trade war between the two countries would put a significant dent in economic recovery the financial times reported on may 9 that growth in global commerce had slowed sharply since the us china trade dispute escalated in mid 2018 and an array of economic indicators suggested that the year long row was having an increasing effect on the global economy the director general lagos chamber of commerce and industry mr muda yusuf told our correspondent on thursday that the trade war would have several implications for nigeria he said the first implication will be the implication for the global economy the us and china are the two biggest economies in the world so if they are having issues with respect to trade it will affect the global economy it will slow down growth and when we have a slowdown in growth it will invariably affect commodity prices so we are likely to see a drop in crude oil price and it will affect nigeria because we are heavily dependent on oil yusuf however said the second implication would be opportunities created by the trade battle he said if we had the right kind of environment this kind of trade war will create opportunities for companies that want to move out of china to other locations many companies in china are there to export to the us particularly and other countries so if being in china will create a problem for access to the us market some of them will be forced to relocate so if we have the right kind of environment and given the agoa african growth and opportunity act opportunity that we have which we have not tapped into it is an opportunity for us to attract investors to come to nigeria and through nigeria export the agoa is a us trade act that provides duty free market access to the us for qualifying products produced in designated sub saharan african beneficiary countries this trade war has weakened the chinese currency vis à vis the us dollar and when chinese currency weakens it makes it cheaper for those of us who are importing from china to import the chinese exports are likely to be cheaper because a major market window us for them has been affected and that has affected their currency yusuf added the managing director and chief executive officer financial derivatives company limited mr bismarck rewane said i don t think there is a real trade war i think it is just brinkmanship for nigeria about 21 per cent of our trade is from china and only about nine per cent of our trade is from the us so our share of their trade is so insignificant compared to the total value we should be concerned about how as a country we are going to be more competitive as we go along according to rewane a global trade war is followed normally by a currency war he said china will now manipulate its currency to a lower value so that their exports become cheaper and if they do that they will undercut products from other countries and that will lead to a global slowdown which could lead to a recession so a trade war if not arrested initially and it will be arrested then it will lead to a currency war and a currency war will also affect nigeria there is a risk if things go out of control we could end up in a global recession not a global financial crisis in which we are also going to suffer as commodity prices will come down a former director general west african institute of financial and economic management prof akpan ekpo said once the tariffs on both countries begin to have effects it may slow growth in the us and that will slow global growth rate and once the global growth rate slows down or is sluggish it will affect nigeria s growth performance the us and china are the two largest economies in the world once they are at loggerheads their intentions and actions lead to a slowdown in global growth and it will affect most countries since we are import dependent and we export mainly oil it will also affect nigeria the professor of economics and public policy university of uyo stressed the need for the nigeria economy to be diversified so that we can also export other commodities apart from crude oil he said once china loses trade with the us it will now look to african countries to make up especially for the consumer goods and that is when nigeria will be affected so they may decide to move those goods to nigeria but of very low quality so we have to be very vigilant and ensure that the goods that come from china into nigeria are of high quality of course we are not doing that now carmen ling the global head of the internationalisation of the chinese currency at standard chartered bank in china said in october last year that china might boost imports from african countries in its quest for new sources of commodities in the wake of a trade war with the us he was quoted by reuters as saying trade links between the asian economic powerhouse and african nations had been growing robustly in recent years ling cautioned that there would be no winners from the trade war in the short term but added some african nations could gain in the long term we believe that countries like kenya and nigeria will benefit because china will look to import more from africa some agricultural products from kenya some oil products from nigeria trade flow patterns will change because china will need to look for new trade partners she added the managing director imf christine lagarde said last month that the global economy had lost further momentum since january adding that growth had been slowing largely because of trade tensions and financial tightening last year this is a delicate moment that requires us to handle with care this means that we must not only avoid policy missteps but also be sure to take the right policy steps a trade war initiated by the united states would do serious damage to the global economy as protectionist actions escalate experts at ihs market said in a recent report china has faced opposition to some of its global ambitions mainly in the west but especially in the us where there has been suspicion of chinese technology among others us president donald trump has complained about china s trading practices since before he took office in 2016 the us launched an investigation into chinese trade policies in 2017 and imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of chinese products last year and beijing retaliated in kind copyright punch

atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time but the risk of a technical recession two straight quarters of contraction was low we are already at the bottom casarin noted we could potentially see a double dip but that would have to be triggered by a domestic crisis such as failure to pass the pension reform bill uphill battle bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there s a longer stretch to be run to revamp the economy thomaz favaro of control risks consultancy told afp i think the risk of further declines is very much real atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls

private securities increased 345 or 7 3 billion pesos in 1q19 differences in quoted prices of gold and foreign currency including investment in derivative financing totaled a 250 million pesos gain during the first quarter 2019 banco macro s strategy was to sell u s dollars in the spot market and invest the result in pesos in leliqs while at the same time hedging the fx position with investment

compared to the fourth quarter of last year and 238 or 8 1 billion pesos higher on a yearly basis with interest expense interest on the profits decreased 1 or 57 million pesos quarter on quarter

increased 53 as of march 2019 the efficiency ratio reached 28 6 improving from the 39 7 posted in 4q18 and 35 2 posted in 1q18 this was the result of a 1 increase in expenses and a 28 increase in net interest income net fee income and other operating income as a whole in 1q19 banco macro continues to be the most efficient bank in argentina if we exclude prisma s sale effect the efficiency ratio would have been 31 6 in first quarter 19 in first quarter 19 banco macro s effective income tax rate was 30 1 compared to 31 in 4q18 the statutory tax rate was cut in the latest tax reform bill and as of january 2019 it stands at 30 in terms of loan growth the bank s financing to the private sector grew 1 quarter on quarter 21 year on year it is important to mention that banco macro s market share over private sector loans as of march 2019 reached 7 7 on the funding side total deposits grew 15 quarter on quarter and 82 year on year private sector deposits grew 12 quarter on quarter and 80 compared to the first quarter of last year while private sector deposits increased 46 quarter on quarter and 104 year on year as of march 2019 banco macro s transactional accounts represented

and a tier 1 ratio of 20 6 if we were to consider the upcoming cash dividend payment of 6 4 billion pesos with the current integrated capital the regulatory capital ratio would be 25 3 and the tier 1 ratio would be 18 2 the bank s aim is to make the best use of this excess capital the bank s liquidity remains more than appropriate liquid assets to total deposits ratio reached 66 overall we have accounted for another positive quarter we continue to show a solid financial position asset quality remains under control and closely monitored we keep on working to improve our efficiency standards and we keep on working our deposit base at this time we would like to take the questions you may have questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your touchtone phone if you d like to withdraw that question please press 2 one moment please for the first question and our first question comes from gabriel nobrega with citi please go ahead gabriel nobrega citi analyst hi everyone and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions i wanted to maybe understand a little bit further why you have decided to fully write off the exposure you had through molca as we have heard from some of your peers that there are ongoing discussions with this company it is still operating with around 20 factories and some of your peers even mentioned that there could be a possible 50 of reversals so i m just trying to understand why you have already wrote it off if there could be this possibility of reversals down the road and i ll make a second question afterwards jorge scarinci chief financial officer good morning gabriel this is jorge scarinci speaking this was a decision of the credit committee approved by the board to make the write off of molino cañuelas it is true that the company is still working it is also true that we think that we are going to recover a part of this i don t know how to quantify but yes in the future we are positive on this brand but as of credit policy both the credit committee the senior credit committee and the board decided to write it off it s an internal policy gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right and if you just allow me a follow up here could you just remind us what was your direct exposure to this company jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes the direct exposure was approximately 390 million pesos gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right perfect i have a second question it s also on asset quality it got to my attention that during the quarter your npl ratios for the retail portfolio deteriorated around 40 bps i understand that that should have a significant portion of your loans in this portfolio as on payroll loans and if i m not mistaken out of this and around 50 are coming from the public sector so could you just maybe give us more color on what happened here what should we be looking for through 2019 and also if we have reached the peak from npl ratios thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer it is true what you are commenting here 93 of our personal loans are tied to payrolls therefore you have a 7 on the open market so this is the portion that is not performing really well on the credit card business we have approximately 64 of the credit card portfolio tied to the payrolls therefore 36 is on the open market and also here this is a portion that is not performing well and it is affecting the consumer non performing portfolio going forward it is going to be very tight and hand in hand with the economy track here honestly it s not very easy for us to predict what would happen with the economy in 2019 because interest rates continue to be high the central banks continue to discuss monetary policy and for sure real gdp is going to be down more than 1 1 5 so we think that when you look at some statistics that we are reaching the bottom of the economic activity in terms of annual comparisons so we would get according to data we are in the worst part of the economic cycle reaching this point but it is not very easy to assure this with 100 of assurance so we think that in terms of npls going forward we are going to be around the 2 2 1 we are not forecasting for the moment major deterioration here in this ratio again this is going to be in hand with what s happening with the economy either losing in the interest rates after or in the second half that it is going to be as a consequence of if monthly inflation goes down not very easy but we think that according to what we are seeing that we are going to maintain this around 2 2 1 of npls going forward gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right jorge that s very clear thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome gabriel operator and our next question comes from alonso garcia with credit suisse please go ahead alonso garcia credit suisse analyst good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding volume growth can you update us on your volume growth expectations for this year probably for next year when do you think if any when do you think credit demand could start picking up what will be the main constraints or drivers for that to happen during the remainder of the year thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hey alonso well you ve had the chance to see not only in banco macro i think but also in the other argentine banks press releases quarter on quarter loan growth has been very sluggish because the economy is really bad and interest rates are really high so it is not very easy to forecast volume growth for this year also the consensus has been increasing inflation target for this year from high 20s to high 30s through to 40 so i would say that this year we might see some real decrease in terms of loan growth therefore we should be growing nominally before inflation so these numbers should be ranging around 30 for this year nominal growth for loans of course for next year it is tougher will depend on the economy and inflation so if having what the economic consensus is forecasting for next year as interest rates should be going down sharply also inflation cooling down we expect that there s going to be a pick up in loan demand and therefore we could be seeing some positive real loan growth next year but again this is kind of a monthly basis movie that can change depending on the monthly inflation that we are having in 2019 also take into consideration that we are in a year where we are going to have presidential elections in october so you have many different variables that could affect the economy in 2019 and 2020 as a summary i would say that this year negative real growth next year positive real growth in loans that is with the scenarios that we are working with alonso garcia credit suisse analyst sure thank you and just a brief follow up do you see any particular segment performing better than the rest of the portfolio do you see both commercial and consumer performing rather similarly jorge scarinci chief financial officer no what we are seeing is that from a nominal point of view we are maintaining our consumer loan portfolio the commercial loan portfolio is slightly decreasing going forward depending on the salary increases that might happen in the economy we could see some pick up in consumption i would say that commercial portfolio will continue in a working capital phase maybe next year we could see a bit more of investment depending on the economic horizon and the landscape but not that big difference between the 2 portfolios alonso garcia credit suisse analyst understood thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from carlos gomez with hsbc please go ahead carlos gomez hsbc analyst yes thank you going back to the loan growth i was distraught by the fact that you have had no loan growth whatsoever in pesos in the last year in fact it s minus 2 should we see that as you being more conservative of the system and is this something that you expect to continue going forward second i have a technical question the capital gain that you have experienced with prisma is it already in your capital ratios or that is still to come thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi carlos how are you on your first question i would say that the strategy of the bank is at this time not to look at market share it s to look at asset quality and of course profitability so if we have to lose some points of market share no problem we want to keep asset quality the best as we can and of course profitability as high as we can again that s why we are forecasting some negative real growth this year in lending and we are focused on maintaining a lot of controls in asset quality and a lot of controls in profitability tough times here if we are going to have a negative performance there well that s the case we are going to have positive performance in other ranges of the balance but the board is very committed to asset quality and profitability at this time so that s what we are following here second question nom the revaluation is not in the capital ratios yet carlos gomez hsbc analyst sorry the sale not the revaluation is in the capital ratios or one is and the other is not how does it work jorge scarinci chief financial officer sorry can you repeat that carlos please carlos gomez hsbc analyst sure you have the sale of 51 of which 60 you record now and then you have the revaluation of 49 that you still retain of the company do either of those 2 parts get reflected in the capital ratios or it has not been reflected yet for either of them jorge scarinci chief financial officer we re going to see the impact of the revaluation next quarter carlos gomez hsbc analyst but the gain already came this quarter jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes carlos gomez hsbc analyst all right thank you can you give us the guidance i mean the impact that we should see from this valuation jorge scarinci chief financial officer not for the moment i do not have a precise number so i do not want to give you a number that would change in the next quarter so i prefer not to give you a number now carlos gomez hsbc analyst thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome carlos operator once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask the question please press 1 and our next question comes from nicolas riva with bank of america please go ahead nicolas riva bank of america analyst thank you so much jorge for taking my question i have an open ended question it s not about the numbers of the quarter so this year we have elections in argentina and the two leading candidates are macri and cristina we don t know if cristina is going to run but we know how cristina s government intervening the banking system they put caps on interest rates they put closing terms on interest rates and term deposits so my question is how do you think a cristina kirchner government would impact the banking sector specifically how are you prepared for that scenario thanks jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi nicolas it s not an easy question first of all we don t know if cristina is going to be a candidate we have to wait until june 22nd to see if she s going to be a candidate second if she s a candidate according to the latest polls that we are seeing she will be losing in the 2nd round third how could cristina be in the 3rd mandate of argentina it s like we are the 4th derivative of the presidential s attitude toward the banking sector so we should be doing a lot a lot of the positions here so i don t know how to answer that question honestly it s very or has a low probability to have an assurance here honestly i don t know i don t know what to say because you need to have an you need to step a lot of barriers before and then i think that only she knows the answer to that question so it s impossible for me to know it so i m sorry but it s tough to answer that nicolas riva bank of america analyst but jorge at least is it fair to say that during the last few years of this administration even though inflation was very high and interest rates were high as well banks managed to do quite well really given the short term duration of the loan portfolio so probably the theory of consolidation of the banking system will get delayed but i believe based on the experience from current years in government the banks managed to do reasonably well within that is that fair to say jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes banks at the time we have a i would say good performance in terms of earnings valuations were not that good but in terms of what happened between 2003 and 2015 i would say that the system improved a lot in terms of liquidity solvency capitalization also concentration so yes nicolas riva bank of america analyst thanks jorge jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from yuri fernandes with j p morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you gentlemen i have actually 2 questions the first one is about the margins how should we think these with the changing interest on assets mix should we expect margins to keep slightly decreasing how are you seeing this my second question is regarding the recent credit card regulation in argentina i know you are somewhat less exposed than some peers how decreasing the payments the settlement dates from 19 days to 10 days may impact your earnings going on thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi yuri how are you i would say that margins will remain stable with this level of interest rates in a slightly climbing scenario in the case of banco macro we should see some expansion margins but level not that much so i would assume for this year stability in the margins not to be changed here in terms of your second question in terms of the impact that we have in credit cards i would assume that in terms of the impact on bottom lines around between 2 7 and 3 impact on bottom lines on the new regulation credit cards this expansion with banco macro not doing anything in terms of to offset this impact for sure that we are going to do or to take some measures here maybe to review some promotions so the net effect is going to be lower than that but ceteris paribus i would say 2 7 to 3 impact to the bottom line yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst very clear thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome operator and there are no further questions at this time so this will conclude the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back

politics ap fact check trump s miscues on trade and drug prices in this may 14 2019 photo russian president vladimir putin right and u s secretary of state mike pompeo shake hands prior to their talks in the black sea resort city of sochi southern russia ap photo pavel golovkin pool the associated press washington ap president donald trump spoke this past week as if he s unaware that drug prices have gone up and tariffs came before him his boast that the u s never collected a dime on goods from china until he imposed them marked a series of statements misrepresenting how trade works as the two countries escalated their dispute with new and retaliatory taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a look at some recent rhetoric advertisement trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan advertisement that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china ___ trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china ___ trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister advertisement the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries ___ russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion advertisement the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings ___ drug prices trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks monday at white house dinner the facts that s an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated friday before trump s latest claim and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications advertisement an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press showed 2 712 price increases in the first half of january compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year however the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier an analysis by altarum a nonprofit research and consulting firm found that in 2018 spending on prescription drugs was one of the main factors behind a 4 5 increase in u s health spending spending on prescription drugs grew much faster than in 2017 according to the study economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum said he expects drug prices will continue to creep up i would be quite surprised if by july the annual rate doesn t return to a more normal 2 4 growth said hughes cromwick ___ jobs trump we have the most people working today than at any time in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts true but not surprising the record workforce is driven by population growth a more relevant measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still far below record highs according to labor department data 60 6 percent of people in the united states 16 years and older were working in april that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 ___ trump we have the biggest tax cut bill in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday advertisement the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and president barack obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ associated press writers christopher rugaber and ricardo alonso zaldivar contributed to this report ___ find ap fact checks at follow apfactcheck on

many emerging market economies might not have the same magnetic appeal they once had for investors tarnished by economic volatility and concerns about stability but for david rubenstein co founder and co executive chairman of the carlyle group now is the perfect time to plow money into ventures in the countries that make up this group right now i am putting a lot of my own personal money into emerging markets because i think that s where the greatest reward is likely to be in the next couple of years as the cycle turns he said during a keynote address at a global private equity conference in washington d c if everybody was rushing into the emerging markets now i would be nervous but they are not therefore i think there is greater opportunity he said rubenstein invests through his family office which he set up after stepping down as chief executive officer of carlyle at the end of 2017 there s no doubt that the emerging markets are recognized as having greater growth prospects rubenstein said however right now the bloom is off the rose because the emerging markets have not done as well in the last couple of years money is pulling away from the emerging markets and people are nervous about investing in emerging markets that is the best time to invest in emerging markets he declared rubenstein argued the worst has passed when it comes to issues negatively affecting the appeal of emerging market economies such as commodity price declines corruption and a lack of transparency as well as the dearth of viable deals speaking during an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the same event kamran anwar ss c globeop s managing director of private equity services agreed that the biggest issue the private equity industry faces when it comes to investing in emerging market economies is around governance such as board independence compliance and the quality of internal risk controls good recordkeeping to name a few issues a good example is the abraaj group a dubai based private equity group that at its height had 14 billion in assets under management before collapsing in 2018 under a 1 1 billion debt load and accusations of misappropriating investor funds anwar believes such major economic and governance crises create a jumpstart mechanism for industry reforms and can serve as catalysts for change he said emerging market companies are better governed today than they were a few years ago as they compete for global capital they are better able to respond to global demands around transparency anwar echoed rubenstein s bullish view on the outlook for emerging market investments noting that uncertainty has been synonymous with emerging market economies as exemplified by crises in the nineties in argentina and brazil oil price volatility in the middle east and the continued tensions between india and pakistan this in turn has led to a better understanding of identifying analyzing and quantifying risk that is the best time to invest in emerging markets david rubenstein carlyle group co founder the ability of investors to navigate constantly changing political dynamics and events in these countries is time tested he said and private equity firms now have more experience today when it comes to allocating capital uncertainty in emerging market counties leads to the greatest amount of opportunity such as below market valuations anwar said adding that those who are experienced enough can navigate these challenges at the right risk premium uncertainty in any environment leads to opportunities and the advantage goes to managers who are able to identify hidden gems at attractive valuations anwar said high growth dynamics in emerging markets large and young populations as well as several instances of path breaking innovation all create an attractive investment opportunity set he cited at safari telecom in kenya as an example of disintermediating banks in the money transfer processes anwar added that given growth patterns and latent demand from young consumer oriented populations emerging markets are well positioned to become larger economically than many oecd organization for economic cooperation and development countries within our lifetime rubenstein delivered his remarks at the emerging market private equity association s empea global private equity conference this month empea highlighted the central role being played by family offices in particular who are increasingly attracted to emerging markets this is fueled by a greater willingness to take risks he said as they do not have the same level of fiduciary responsibilities placed on managers of entities such as pension and sovereign wealth funds looking ahead while historically the rates of return on investing in emerging market economies have not exceeded the yields on investments in developed countries rubenstein said he believes that in time the return on capital allocated to emerging market ventures will outpace developed markets this will be due to less competition better access to financing improved accounting standards and the countries themselves will become more sophisticated rubenstein noted that only 17 percent of the money invested in private equity funds is allocated to emerging market ventures even though their home countries are responsible for 55 percent of global economic activity including china and india eventually their large contribution to global economic growth will translate to a more representative share of private capital being invested so he expects to see a lot more money flowing to countries in africa latin america the middle east and southeast asia relative to what it is today one area that is unlikely to witness a major influx of investment is the middle east ss c s anwar said noting countries in the region are not usually major magnets for private equity funds for example in the arab gulf countries that make up the gulf cooperation council the dominant role of oil production a largescale machine intensive industry has left their smes sector too small and informal to be an attractive proposition for outside investors on the other hand there are some regional champions in logistics retail food processing and packaging which have received interest from private equity firms anwar believes impact investing in this region may be an alternative track we are also seeing some governments provide attractive incentives to attract impact investing tools expertise and capital he said and while the enormous pools of capital held by endowments family offices and sovereign wealth funds etc mean there are many limited partners to be found in the region the health of most economies in the region remains closely tied to the oil market a drop in the price means reduced revenues and governments dipping into their reserves to maintain high levels of domestic spending reducing the amount available for investment the response of countries like saudi arabia to the arab spring underlined how much gcc economies rely on social welfare largesse to keep their citizenry happy it remains to be seen what effect the ongoing war in yemen and potential military conflict which could suck in gulf arab nations would have on the availability of surplus capital from these countries for investing anwar said
atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone

the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there

it s worth pointing out that rumors of its demise are greatly exaggerated for instance it was only last fall that a global tipping point was reached meaning that half the world is now middle class or wealthier according to researchers at the brookings institution how did that happen by bringing increasing levels of market forces to bear around the planet especially in the developing world china is nobody s idea of a pure capitalist economy but it has clearly moved in that general direction over the past several decades as u2 s bono who has spent a great deal of time and energy trying to help the developing world will tell you commerce entrepreneurial capitalism takes more people out of poverty than aid of course we know that to be sure the legendary frontman is no anarcho capitalist telling a crowd at davos this year that while capitalism has taken more people out of poverty than any other ism it is a wild beast that if not tamed can chew up a lot of people along the way in europe and north america concerns about the death of capitalism stem mostly from flat or slow economic growth for basically all of the 21st century that the rest of the world is catching up to us probably doesn t make anyone feel better either but even in the united states apparent reductions in the middle class are explained in part by households bumping up into higher income categories and it turns out that when economists control for household size and use an accurate measure of inflation the story of stagnating wages was mostly wrong indeed as michael r strain writes median household income grew by 43 between 1990 and 2015 the last year for which data is available households in the bottom 20 saw their incomes increase by 62 it s also true that contrary to the conventional wisdom the rich did not capture all the new wealth created over the past several decades as russ roberts has shown when you track actual individuals across time the richest people in 1980 actually ended up poorer on average in 2014 like the top 20 the top 1 in 1980 were also poorer on average 34 years later in 2014 so maybe capitalism is still delivering the goods by and large and by goods i mean general broad based increases in living standards yes even for millennials and gen z except for beer right jonathan tepper author of the myth of capitalism argues that the essence of capitalism is competition which is flatter than beto o rourke s new haircut writing at bloomberg tepper avers competition is the essence of capitalism yet it is dying rising market power by dominant firms has created less competition lower investment in the real economy lower productivity less economic dynamism with fewer startups higher prices for dominant firms lower wages and more wealth inequality in industry after industry can only purchase from local monopolies or oligopolies that can tacitly collude the u s now has many industries with only three or four competitors controlling entire markets since the early 1980s market concentration has increased severely among the evidence he marshals is the fact that two corporations control 90 percent of the beer americans drink tepper s numbers seem a bit high according to the latest edition of beer marketer s insights a trade publication anheuser busch inbev controls 41 percent of the market millercoors owns another 24 percent and since 2017 more than 9 percent of the market volume has shifted from large brewers and importers to smaller brewers and importers but let s grant tepper his large point two mega players dominate the market for beer how has that been working out for beer drinkers pretty damn well actually go back to say 1990 when the microbrewery revolution was barely a thing and i started graduate school at suny buffalo my friends and i would drive across the peace bridge to canada specifically to drink molson and labatt s because it was so much better than american beer such a thought is inconceivable now given the proliferation of choices available to today s beer drinkers some of that choice comes from anheuser busch millercoors and other big brewers and much of it comes from small scrappy startups but the point is that the number of firms in an industry doesn t dictate the amount of choice that consumers have check out the illustration to the side here from a tweet by the new york times david leonhardt it shows increased concentration in various sectors but has there been a concomitant reduction in either consumer choice or quality of service think of mattresses one of the products listed has it ever been easier or more cost effective to shop for a mattress including ones based on whole new technologies tepper opens his bloomberg piece by recounting the 2017 beating that dr david dao took on a united airlines flight he implies that airlines can treat their customers anyway they want because the american skies have gone from an open market with many competing airlines to a cozy oligopoly with four major airlines yet that incident was shocking precisely because it was so rare drawing any implications from it is ridiculous over the past decade the on time performance of airlines has effectively stayed the same which suggests that airlines are still competing for customers so has the safety record for domestic carriers airlines have gotten better at maximizing the number of passengers per flight which might make flying less comfortable but they ve also passed on savings to customers the average airfare has been lower because airlines have been putting their capacity to better use note researchers at the st louis federal reserve bank monopolists tend not to be so generous none of this is to say the status quo is perfect or that it shouldn t be challenged in many parts of the economy corporations works in cahoots with the government to rig markets lord knows this is happening big time in the tech and social media sectors as we speak donald trump s trade war with china points to more problems we always need more creative destruction than we re getting at any point in time but to focus on the number of firms in a sector rather than what is being offered to consumers is to make a very basic analytical error and one that opens up space not for the best elements of laissez faire but the worst forms of a strangulated future enjoy a chill classic reason video from 2009 it s called beer an american revolution how microbreweries promote choice

many emerging market economies might not have the same magnetic appeal they once had for investors tarnished by economic volatility and concerns about stability but for david rubenstein co founder and co executive chairman of the carlyle group now is the perfect time to plow money into ventures in the countries that make up this group right now i am putting a lot of my own personal money into emerging markets because i think that s where the greatest reward is likely to be in the next couple of years as the cycle turns he said during a keynote address at a global private equity conference in washington d c if everybody was rushing into the emerging markets now i would be nervous but they are not therefore i think there is greater opportunity he said rubenstein invests through his family office which he set up after stepping down as chief executive officer of carlyle at the end of 2017 there s no doubt that the emerging markets are recognized as having greater growth prospects rubenstein said however right now the bloom is off the rose because the emerging markets have not done as well in the last couple of years money is pulling away from the emerging markets and people are nervous about investing in emerging markets that is the best time to invest in emerging markets he declared rubenstein argued the worst has passed when it comes to issues negatively affecting the appeal of emerging market economies such as commodity price declines corruption and a lack of transparency as well as the dearth of viable deals speaking during an exclusive interview on the sidelines of the same event kamran anwar ss c globeop s managing director of private equity services agreed that the biggest issue the private equity industry faces when it comes to investing in emerging market economies is around governance such as board independence compliance and the quality of internal risk controls good recordkeeping to name a few issues a good example is the abraaj group a dubai based private equity group that at its height had 14 billion in assets under management before collapsing in 2018 under a 1 1 billion debt load and accusations of misappropriating investor funds story continues anwar believes such major economic and governance crises create a jumpstart mechanism for industry reforms and can serve as catalysts for change he said emerging market companies are better governed today than they were a few years ago as they compete for global capital they are better able to respond to global demands around transparency anwar echoed rubenstein s bullish view on the outlook for emerging market investments noting that uncertainty has been synonymous with emerging market economies as exemplified by crises in the nineties in argentina and brazil oil price volatility in the middle east and the continued tensions between india and pakistan this in turn has led to a better understanding of identifying analyzing and quantifying risk that is the best time to invest in emerging markets david rubenstein carlyle group co founder the ability of investors to navigate constantly changing political dynamics and events in these countries is time tested he said and private equity firms now have more experience today when it comes to allocating capital uncertainty in emerging market counties leads to the greatest amount of opportunity such as below market valuations anwar said adding that those who are experienced enough can navigate these challenges at the right risk premium uncertainty in any environment leads to opportunities and the advantage goes to managers who are able to identify hidden gems at attractive valuations anwar said high growth dynamics in emerging markets large and young populations as well as several instances of path breaking innovation all create an attractive investment opportunity set he cited at safari telecom in kenya as an example of disintermediating banks in the money transfer processes anwar added that given growth patterns and latent demand from young consumer oriented populations emerging markets are well positioned to become larger economically than many oecd organization for economic cooperation and development countries within our lifetime rubenstein delivered his remarks at the emerging market private equity association s empea global private equity conference this month empea highlighted the central role being played by family offices in particular who are increasingly attracted to emerging markets this is fueled by a greater willingness to take risks he said as they do not have the same level of fiduciary responsibilities placed on managers of entities such as pension and sovereign wealth funds looking ahead while historically the rates of return on investing in emerging market economies have not exceeded the yields on investments in developed countries rubenstein said he believes that in time the return on capital allocated to emerging market ventures will outpace developed markets this will be due to less competition better access to financing improved accounting standards and the countries themselves will become more sophisticated rubenstein noted that only 17 percent of the money invested in private equity funds is allocated to emerging market ventures even though their home countries are responsible for 55 percent of global economic activity including china and india eventually their large contribution to global economic growth will translate to a more representative share of private capital being invested so he expects to see a lot more money flowing to countries in africa latin america the middle east and southeast asia relative to what it is today one area that is unlikely to witness a major influx of investment is the middle east ss c s anwar said noting countries in the region are not usually major magnets for private equity funds for example in the arab gulf countries that make up the gulf cooperation council the dominant role of oil production a largescale machine intensive industry has left their smes sector too small and informal to be an attractive proposition for outside investors on the other hand there are some regional champions in logistics retail food processing and packaging which have received interest from private equity firms anwar believes impact investing in this region may be an alternative track we are also seeing some governments provide attractive incentives to attract impact investing tools expertise and capital he said and while the enormous pools of capital held by endowments family offices and sovereign wealth funds etc mean there are many limited partners to be found in the region the health of most economies in the region remains closely tied to the oil market a drop in the price means reduced revenues and governments dipping into their reserves to maintain high levels of domestic spending reducing the amount available for investment the response of countries like saudi arabia to the arab spring underlined how much gcc economies rely on social welfare largesse to keep their citizenry happy it remains to be seen what effect the ongoing war in yemen and a potential military conflict between iran and the u s which could suck in gulf arab nations would have on the availability of surplus capital from these countries for investing anwar said the post carlyle co founder sees emerging markets yielding the greatest reward in the coming years appeared first on emerging market views
by david lawder and steve scherer washington ottawa reuters the united states struck deals on friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico the three governments said removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new north american trade pact the separate agreements which will not impose u s quotas on canadian and mexican metals shipments will also eliminate mexican and canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of u s products including pork beef and bourbon the united states and canada said their agreement will be implemented by sunday afternoon and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from china and other countries from entering the u s market via canada president donald trump had imposed the global section 232 tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum in march 2018 on national security grounds invoking a 1962 cold war era trade law both canada and mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the united states and challenged the tariffs before the world trade organization this is just pure good news for canadians canadian prime minister justin trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at stelco holdings inc s steel mill in hamilton ontario stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news while top u s steelmaker nucor nyse fell 3 1 percent and u s steel corp which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs fell 1 2 percent spokesmen for u s steel and nucor which had advocated for maintaining strong tariff protections could not be reached for comment trade deal vote the metals tariffs were a major irritant for canada and mexico and had caused them to halt progress toward ratification the new u s mexico canada agreement the trilateral trade deal to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement u s lawmakers with constituents suffering from canadian and mexican retaliation including senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley also said they would not consider a usmca vote with the tariffs in place after the deal grassley tweeted thank u mr president for really helping the farmers of iowa w this important step in usmca w lifting metal tariffs realdonaldtrump just proved he can deliver on negotiations china ought to take note start dealing in good faith take pres trump seriously trudeau said canada would now work with the united states on the timing of usmca ratification and said he was optimistic canada would be be able to move forward well in the coming weeks u s vice president mike pence said he would meet with trudeau in ottawa on may 30 to discuss advancing ratification several u s democrats applauded removal of the tariffs but said usmca was not yet ready for their support when it comes to the new agreement house democrats continue to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor environment enforcement and access to affordable medicines provisions those issues still need to be remedied said house ways and means committee chairman richard neal neal added that the deal does not address global steel overcapacity and criticized trump s handling of trade negotiations with china which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks trump speaking to realtors in washington called the pact a fantastic deal for our country and said congress would hopefully approve the usmca quickly then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is jesus seade mexico s deputy foreign minister for north america said the deal measurably increases the probability the usmca will be approved before the u s congress summer break in august some u s lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020 presidential campaign activity transshipments surges trump s metals tariffs have been largely aimed at keeping excess production from china out of the u s market and the deal includes a new monitoring mechanism aimed at preventing steel and aluminum from china and other countries from being transshipped through canada and mexico to the united states but the u s trade representative s office also said the deal allows it to reimpose tariffs in the event of surges in imports of specific steel products if tariffs are reimposed retaliation would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors carmakers which have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher u s costs due to the tariffs praised the deal and said it brought usmca passage a big step closer while many automakers already source the vast majority of their steel and aluminum domestically tariffs drive those prices up which decreases investment and harms auto workers and ultimately consumers said the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing most major brands including general motors co nyse toyota motor corp volkswagen de ag and others the national pork producers council which says retaliatory tariffs have cost its members 12 per animal or a total of 1 5 billion also expressed relief at the end of a trade dispute that has placed enormous financial strain on american pork producers

on the lighter side throughout the week wage growth and employment numbers released on tuesday weighed on the pound wages grew by just 3 2 in march easing from a 3 5 rise in february claimant counts

april leading to the unemployment rate rising from 5 1 to 5 2 with the rba s focus on labor market conditions the weaker numbers coupled with sentiment towards the u s china trade war did the damage ahead of the federal elections that take place today for the kiwi dollar there were no stats until the end of the week a slide in both producer input and output prices in the 1st quarter weighed at

rio de janeiro afp advertising read more atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time but the risk of a technical recession two straight quarters of contraction was low we are already at the bottom casarin noted we could potentially see a double dip but that would have to be triggered by a domestic crisis such as failure to pass the pension reform bill uphill battle bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there s a longer stretch to be run to revamp the economy thomaz favaro of control risks consultancy told afp i think the risk of further declines is very much real 2019 afp
in this may 14 2019 photo russian president vladimir putin right and u s secretary of state mike pompeo shake hands prior to their talks in the black sea resort city of sochi southern russia ap photo pavel golovkin pool the associated press washington ap president donald trump spoke this past week as if he s unaware that drug prices have gone up and tariffs came before him his boast that the u s never collected a dime on goods from china until he imposed them marked a series of statements misrepresenting how trade works as the two countries escalated their dispute with new and retaliatory taxes on each other s products meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a look at some recent rhetoric trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china ___ trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china ___ trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks monday with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries ___ russia investigation putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings ___ drug prices trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks monday at white house dinner the facts that s an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated friday before trump s latest claim and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press showed 2 712 price increases in the first half of january compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year however the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier an analysis by altarum a nonprofit research and consulting firm found that in 2018 spending on prescription drugs was one of the main factors behind a 4 5 increase in u s health spending spending on prescription drugs grew much faster than in 2017 according to the study economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum said he expects drug prices will continue to creep up i would be quite surprised if by july the annual rate doesn t return to a more normal 2 4 growth said hughes cromwick ___ jobs trump we have the most people working today than at any time in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts true but not surprising the record workforce is driven by population growth a more relevant measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still far below record highs according to labor department data 60 6 percent of people in the united states 16 years and older were working in april that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 ___ trump we have the biggest tax cut bill in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant

with core retail sales rising by just 0 1 month on month forecasts were for a 0 7 increase industrial production also slipped unexpectedly falling by 0 5 to reverse a 0 2 rise in march in spite of the

positive footing april building permit and housing starts were on the rise in april with the weekly initial jobless claims figures also impressing story continues of greater significance however were may s philly fed manufacturing index and consumer sentiment numbers the philly fed manufacturing index jumped from 8 5 to 16 6 in may with the michigan consumer sentiment index surging from 97 2 to 102 4 outside of the numbers primary focus through the week remained on the u s china trade war u s president trump upped the ante late in the week blacklisting huawei in the week the move led to beijing shifting stance on a willingness to resolve the ongoing trade dispute following the tariff hike on chinese goods in the previous week china rolled out tariffs on u s goods last week the move came in spite of trump s warning to beijing not to retaliate in the equity markets the u s majors ended the week in the red again the nasdaq ended the week down 1 27 while the s p500 and dow fell by 0 76 and 0 69 respectively negative sentiment towards trade ultimately weighed with the losses coming in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid week out of the uk economic data was on the lighter side throughout the week wage growth and employment numbers released on tuesday weighed on the pound wages grew by just 3 2 in march easing from a 3 5 rise in february claimant counts also weighed rising from 22 600 to 24 700 in april on the positive the unemployment rate fell from 3 9 to 3 8 in march through the april claimant count numbers offset any upbeat sentiment towards march number while the data was on the negative a 2 11 slide in the pound through the week to 1 2724 resulted from political events in the week early on in the week eu election polls showed that farage and the brexit party had knocked both the tories and the labour party off of their perches to front run into next week s eu elections theresa may and jeremy corbyn failed to deliver an agreement by the end of the week leading to more brexit uncertainty to wrap the week up theresa may also had to give an end date to her position as pm to the 1922 committee with farage looking to rock the uk political cradle talk of boris johnson waiting in the wings for the top job didn t do the pound too many favors the slide in the pound provided much needed support to the ftse100 which ended the week up 2 02 the upside in the week came in spite of the escalation in the ongoing u s china trade war out of the eurozone the stats were mixed through the week key stats included german 1st quarter gdp numbers and germany and the eurozone s economic sentiment and eurozone industrial production figures while germany s zew current conditions index improved in may the more influential economic sentiment index slid from 3 1 to 2 1 weighing on the eur adding to the downside was a slide in the eurozone s zew economic sentiment index and fall in industrial production the economic sentiment index fell from 4 5 to 1 6 with industrial production falling by 0 5 in march while a recovery in the german economy was good news it wasn t spectacular with the economy growing by just 0 6 year on year in the 4th quarter the economy had grown by 0 9 of less influence through the week were eurozone 1st quarter gdp and trade data in spite of a widening in the eurozone s trade surplus finalized april inflation figures also had little impact on the eur the eurozone s annual core rate of inflation came in at 1 3 which was well below the ecb target the eur ended the week down 0 67 to 1 1158 the weekly loss dragging the eur into the red for the current month in the equity markets the majors found strong support with the cac ending the week up 2 08 the dax and eurostoxx600 also made gains rising by 1 49 and by 1 16 respectively support came from the u s plan to delay a rollout of tariffs on eu autos for 6 months and the u s majors and a softer eur the upside was capped however with the majors seeing red on friday weighed by the ongoing u s china trade war elsewhere it was a rough week for the aussie and kiwi dollars the aussie dollar slid by 1 91 with the kiwi dollar ending the week down 1 18 for the aussie dollar the stats were skewed to the negative while business confidence saw a slight improvement in april employment and consumer sentiment numbers weighed wages grew by 0 5 in the 1st quarter coming up short of a forecasted 0 6 rise consumer sentiment rose by just 0 6 following a 1 9 increase in april wrapping up a bad week was a 6 300 fall in full employment in april leading to the unemployment rate rising from 5 1 to 5 2 with the rba s focus on labor market conditions the weaker numbers coupled with sentiment towards the u s china trade war did the damage ahead of the federal elections that take place today for the kiwi dollar there were no stats until the end of the week a slide in both producer input and output prices in the 1st quarter weighed at the end of the week adding to the downside was the april business pmi while the actual pmi rose from 51 9 to 53 sub index numbers were less impressive new orders and employment conditions weakened with the u s china trade war thrown in the question will be whether the rbnz will need to cut rates for a 2nd time in the coming months for the loonie the stats were skewed to the negative april inflation figures

consumer price index rose by 0 4 consumer prices had risen by 0 7 in march march manufacturing sales figures failed to give the loonie a boost on thursday sales increased by 2 1 which was far better than a forecasted 1 5 increase while the stats were skewed to the negative news of the u s canada and mexico reaching a deal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum limited the downside for the loonie on the week the loonie ended the week down 0 31 at c 1 3458 against the greenback for the japanese yen the japanese yen slipped to 110 levels to end the week down 0 12 at 110 08 losses came despite a shift in sentiment towards the u s china trade talks and lack of progress on brexit a jump in the michigan consumer sentiment figure on friday suggests strong support for trump policy which ultimately left the yen in the red out of china stats through the week included april fixed asset investment industrial production and retail sales figures all the numbers were on the weaker side with industrial

modern monetary theory mmt a seemingly new approach to economic policy has become a hot topic gaining support from leading us progressives such as presidential candidate bernie sanders and democratic representative alexandria ocasio cortez but mmt enthusiasts should heed lessons learned in latin america where policies based on similar ideas inevitably ended in economic catastrophe according to mmt s supporters the us federal reserve should print large amounts of money to finance massive public infrastructure projects along with a job guarantee program aimed at ensuring full employment a major increase in public sector debt mmt backers claim does not represent a danger for a country that can borrow in its own currency as the united states can this unconventional view has been criticized by keynesians and monetarists alike many respected academic economists including paul krugman kenneth rogoff and larry summers say that mmt makes little sense in response mmt supporters argue that the theory s critics do not fully understand how a modern monetary economy works according to influential mmt advocates such as stephanie kelton governments in countries with their own national currency such as the us do not face hard budget constraints because they can simply print more money to finance higher expenditures assessing the merits of mmt is difficult for two reasons for starters its supporters have not provided a unified detailed description of how the model is meant to work as krugman recently wrote mmt backers tend to be unclear about what exactly their differences with conventional views are and also have a strong habit of dismissing out of hand any attempt to make sense of what they re saying in addition mmt supporters have offered hardly any inkling of how the policy might function in practice especially in the medium and long term yet the approach is not unprecedented mmt or some version of it has been tried in several latin american countries including chile argentina brazil ecuador nicaragua peru and venezuela all had their own currency at the time moreover their governments almost all of which were populist relied on arguments similar to those used by today s mmt supporters to justify huge increases in public expenditure financed by the central bank and all of these experiments led to runaway inflation huge currency devaluations and precipitous declines in real wages four episodes in particular are instructive chile under president salvador allende s socialist regime from 1970 to 1973 peru during president alan garcía s first administration 1985 1990 argentina under presidents néstor kirchner and cristina fernández de kirchner from 2003 to 2015 and venezuela since 1999 under presidents hugo chávez and nicolás maduro in all four cases a similar pattern emerged after the authorities created money to finance very large fiscal deficits an economic boom immediately followed wages increased helped by substantial minimum wage hikes and unemployment declined soon however bottlenecks appeared and prices skyrocketed in some cases at hyperinflationary rates inflation reached 500 in chile in 1973 some 7 000 in peru in 1990 and is expected to be almost ten million percent in venezuela this year in argentina meanwhile inflation was more subdued but still very high averaging 40 in 2015 the authorities responded by imposing price and wage controls and stiff protectionist policies but the controls did not work and output and employment eventually collapsed worse still in three of these four countries inflation adjusted wages fell sharply during the mmt type experiment in the periods in question real wages declined by 39 in chile 41 in peru and by more than 50 in venezuela hurting the poor and the middle class in each case the central bank was controlled by politicians with predictable results in chile the money supply grew by 360 in 1973 alone helping to finance a budget deficit equivalent to an astonishing 24 of gdp in peru in 1989 money growth was 7 000 and the fiscal deficit exceeded 10 of gdp in argentina in 2015 the deficit was 6 of gdp with the annual rate of money creation surpassing 40 and venezuela currently has a deficit of 32 of gdp with the money supply estimated to be growing at an annual rate of more than 1 000 as inflation increased in these countries people greatly reduced their holdings of domestic money but because governments required taxes to be paid in local currency it did not completely disappear instead the speed at which money changed hands what economists call velocity of circulation increased dramatically no one wanted to be holding paper money that lost 20 or more of its value every month when the demand for money collapses the effects of money growth on inflation are amplified and a vicious circle develops one serious consequence is that the currency depreciates rapidly in international markets mmt supporters conveniently ignore the simple fact that demand for local money declines drastically when its value tumbles yet this is perhaps one of the theory s biggest weaknesses and one that makes it extremely risky for any country to implement the experience of latin america should serve as a clear warning for today s mmt enthusiasts in a variety of countries and at very different times fiscal expansions that were financed by printing money resulted in an uncontrollable loss of economic stability economic policy ideas are often as dangerous in practice as they are flawed in theory mmt may be a case in point sebastián edwards is professor

over the recent trading sessions many commodities prices have slipped after trade negotiations between the us and china hit a roadblock the slow pace of talks and claims that the chinese negotiators backtracked on parts of a deal where the us thought they had an agreement led to new tariffs 25 tariffs on friday may 10 china retaliated a few days later on may 13 while both sides have said that talks will continue the next significant event on the trade front is the potential for a meeting and discussion between presidents trump and xi at the g20 meeting in osaka japan at the end of june commodities are on the front lines when it comes to global trade and we have seen increased volatility in metals agricultural commodities and industrial products as optimism over the potential for a trade deal turned to pessimism however the price of crude oil has remained above the 60 per barrel on the nearby nymex futures contract and over 70 on active month brent futures which have outperformed the wti crude oil price crude oil edged a bit lower but the price recovered as there is a lot more at stake in the oil market than the trade dispute between the us and china the vanguard energy index fund nysearca vde is a highly liquid product that holds many of the leading companies involved in all aspects of the oil business iran is the leading issue these days there are differing views on the current situation between the us and iran when the trump administration walked away from the iran nuclear nonproliferation agreement and announced new sanctions last year one school of thought said that it was a dangerous move that ramped up the tension in the middle east most european countries the russians china and even many people in the us favored remaining within the 2015 agreement negotiated by the obama administration together with other nations around the world on the other side of the argument the trump administration walked from the deal because they argued it gave away too much for too little and iran was violating the agreement israel saudi arabia and their allies in the middle east and many people in the us support a much stricter policy towards the theocracy in teheran and their chants of death to america and death to israel meanwhile all agree that last year s decision raised the political temperature in the middle east when the trump administration issues exemptions for eight nations that purchase iranian crude oil last november it delayed any retaliation by teheran when the us leader refused to extend those exemptions in april the temperature rose to a higher level over the past week attempts to sabotage four oil tankers off the coast of the uae and a drone attack on a saudi oil pipeline are signs of retaliation back in 2018 the leadership in teheran told the world that any attempt to stop them from selling their petroleum around the world would cause them to take action to prevent other exporters in the middle east from exporting their oil the narrow strait of hormuz is a passageway between the persian gulf and the gulf of oman through which 20 of the world s seaborne crude oil travels each day source google maps as the chart shows the logistical petroleum chokepoint borders on iran oil from iraq kuwait saudi arabia bahrain qatar and the uae slows through the strait of hormuz each day on its way to consumers around the world the strait is likely to become a flashpoint if a military conflict between the us and iran breaks out the us dispatched the uss abraham lincoln to the region the us considers all members of the iranian revolutionary guard as terrorists while iran branded all us military personnel in the middle east the same the rising potential for hostilities that could impact oil production refining or logistical routes in the middle east will keep a bid under the price of the energy commodity nearby nymex crude oil was trading at just under the 63 per barrel level at the end of last week with july brent futures around 72 per barrel while many other commodity prices have moved lower because of the escalation of the trade dispute between the us and china crude oil is not far off its recent highs at 66 60 per barrel on wti and 75 59 on the brent benchmark iran is the leading issue impacting the price of oil at this time the us wants the price lower for political reasons president trump has made no secret that he wants the price of oil to move lower on many occasions the us leader has sent messages to saudi arabia and other allies in opec that they should increase their production because the price of oil is too high while the us is now the world s leading oil producing nation with over 12 million barrels per day of output and the us oil industry benefits from higher prices increasing prices could fuel inflationary pressures which would lead the fed to resume hiking short term interest rates choking off economic growth the trump administration has been highly critical of the fed and rate hikes and the price of oil is one of many ingredients when it comes to inflation moreover with his reelection campaign just starting rising gasoline prices in the us will weigh on economic growth and consumer confidence which will work against the incumbent in 2020 additionally more production from saudi arabia and other us allies in the middle east will take power away from iran when it comes to world supplies and the political impact of sanctions as there is opposition to the about face in policy last year therefore the us wants oil lower for political and for economic reasons at this time and the president may get his way as opec will be meeting in late june russian influence in the middle east is a function of its position in opec the oil ministers of opec will gather in vienna austria at their biannual meeting to discuss the future of the cartel s production policy in response to the falling price of oil during the final quarter of 2018 opec agreed to cut production by 1 2 million barrels per day at their last meeting since the price of oil has appreciated significantly from the december 2018 low which took the price of nymex futures to a low at 42 36 per barrel and nearby brent futures to just under 50 per barrel it is likely that the members of opec will either reduce the production cuts or eliminate them at their upcoming meeting with president trump in the saudi s ear they will likely support more output over the second half of 2019 two members venezuela and libya are political and economic basket cases and their petroleum output continues to suffer iran is also a member but sanctions and the cancelation of exemptions have shut them down and put maximum economic pressure on the theocracy and when it comes to opec they continue to be involved in a proxy war with the saudis which could increase in intensity because of the saudi s relationship with the us and the trump administration the saudis us and russians are the triad of power in the oil market as the three countries all produce over 10 million barrels of the energy commodity each day which leads the world in 2016 when the price of oil fell to under 30 per barrel russia acted as a mediator for opec and engineered a production policy that lifted prices since then the russians have been the most powerful non member of the cartel at the most recent meeting late last year russia settled the dispute over the amount of the output cut at the 1 2 million barrel per day level at the upcoming meeting russia is likely to continue to play a leadership role when it comes to oil policy russia s sphere of influence in the middle east has been rising the alliance between russia and iran in syria complicates matters when it comes to the current sanctions at the same time vladimir putin has been involved in strategic issues in the region even with iran s arch enemies the saudis and israel russia s influence in the middle east has grown as the nation s position in opec has risen at the same time vladimir putin has positioned his country as a mediator in the region which comes with lots of power and influence in the middle east saudi arabia s role has declined but it is still one of the three leading producers saudi arabian influence in the middle east took a hit last october when the royal family faced condemnation over the murder of jamal khashoggi in turkey at the hands of saudi security forces crown prince mohammed bin salman the heir to the saudi throne suffered more than a little public relations problem over the killing of a critic who was a saudi national and a correspondent for the washington post while the us russia and saudi arabia are the three leading oil producing nations in the world the saudis have taken a step back when it comes to power and influence after past year s events therefore with russian control over opec and us influence over the saudis presidents trump and putin are currently the most influential forces when it comes to the international petroleum markets president trump put the us in the position via friendlier energy policy for oil production via tax and regulatory reforms vladimir putin s increased position in opec and the middle east at large has cemented his status saudi arabia has been relegated to the sidelines because of the rise of russia and the us and the fact that the royal family shot itself in the foot late last year china is the demand side of the equation the politics of the supply side of the oil market is a complex jigsaw puzzle on the demand side as marc rich once said crude oil is the blood that flows through the veins of the world with over 18 of the world s population within its borders china is the most significant factor when it comes to the demand side of the equation for crude oil china was one of the countries exempt from us sanctions for six months last november but the end of the exemption means that china has a choice to make when it comes to buying oil from iran given the escalation of the trade dispute with the us this month china may defy the us and continue to purchase oil from the iranians at the same time the protectionist tariffs and retaliation have weighed on the chinese economy which caused the demand for crude oil to decline in the asian nation a trade deal between the us and china would like cause demand to rise while a continuation of the dispute would continue to decline in chinese demand for the energy commodity the politics of crude oil is a complex equation when it comes to supply and demand the earnings of companies involved in the production exploration refining and in servicing the oil industry rise and fall with the price of petroleum the vanguard energy index fund holds shares in many of the leading oil related companies the most recent top holdings include source yahoo finance vde has net assets of 4 21 billion which is lower than the xle but it has a lower expense ratio of 0 10 compared to the 0 13 charged by the xle vde has a dividend yield of 2 98 the price of wti crude oil fell from 76 90 to 42 36 in q4 2018 a decline of 44 9 since the low the energy commodity appreciated to around the 62 76 per barrel level last friday an increase of 48 2 source barchart in q4 2018 vde dropped from 108 55 per share to 71 70 or 33 9 vde was trading at 85 86 last friday 19 7 above its late 2018 bottom vde should follow the price of crude oil over the coming weeks and months the most significant issue facing the oil market these days is the brewing situation between iran and the us in the middle east which should increase price volatility for the energy commodity in the current environment the odds of a price spike to the upside have increased because of the potential for hostilities that could impact production refining or logistical routes in the region that is home to over 50 of the world s crude oil reserves
aud usd update the australian to us dollar exchange rate rallied strongly on the weekly open following the surprise re election of the australian conservative government with aud last seen at 0 69254 up 0 86 while the domestic economy leaves much to be desired the continuation of conservative government versus the expected centre left labour indicated by early pre election polls is expected to sit well with investors despite the challenges facing the aussie economy there s a sense of security with the continuation of the current government said senior currency strategist yukio ishizuki at daiwa securities adding the risk that the economy will experience a big drop has decreased considerably as a result the aussie acting as a proxy for chinese sentiment also found support from the decision by china s central bank to intervene if necessary to maintain the chinese yuan s stability within a balanced range despite the surprise win the outlook for the aud remains on the bearish side given a struggling economy an expansive policy would be helpful but the timeline remains uncertain we expect the aud to struggle in the coming months wrote danske bank senior analyst aila mihr data wise it s

cocktail of external and domestic headwinds fuelling a negative aussie versus usd outlook already down around 2 3 versus its us counterpart in may thus far portfolio managers and analysts at nomura holdings the queensland investment corporation qic and amp capital were all advocating short positions on the aussie with further downside forecast aussie to greenback to fall to mid 60s as cocktail of risks weigh for the short term things are looking quite bearish on the aussie said janu chan senior economist at st george bank adding the environment of uncertainty around trade is unhelpful and i see it falling to perhaps below 68 us cents in the short term on trade while risk appetite staged a partial recovery earlier in the week news flow ahead of the weekend shed doubt on whether a us china trade deal would be forthcoming or not with cross pacific verbal sparring continuing if there is no real concrete action by the united states it will be meaningless for you to come and talk said the chinese ruling party s official newspaper referring to us treasury secretary steven mnuchin s intended travel to beijing to continue talks adding it is better to suspend the consultation completely

consumer and business sentiment and subsequently the aud according to a note to clients written by nomura strategist andrew ticehurst resurgent usd safe haven appeal has bolstered the greenback at the expense of the aussie while the latest au market statistics which saw the unemployment rate unexpectedly jump to 5 2 prompted investors to revise up their expectations for rba rate cuts ahead the main reason for the weaker australian dollar was a stronger us dollar said commonwealth bank currency strategist joseph capurso adding however yesterday s australian april labour force report may have had some dampening impact also we anticipate downward pressure will remain on australian dollar as the chances the rba cuts interest rates continue to firm as it stands market pricing is currently indicative of 50bps of rate cuts before the year is out which would lower the currently historic low key policy rate from 1 50 to 1 00 however some analysts felt the two cuts implied by market pricing to be overdone as long as the labor market holds up the central bank will be willing to delay cutting rates so the risks to the rba path are skewed to the upside of current expectations said head of market analysis at monex ranko berich adding we maintain our view that aud usd will trade at 0 69 by the end of 2019 slightly higher than the current level for now focus is split between the overarching global issue of us china trade with the aussie in particular vulnerable to any escalations of tension while on eye will be on domestic politics over the weekend with a labour party win and the anticipation of subsequent political turmoil also representing a source of potential downside risk

menafn afp atrophying growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 percent and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummelled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this jackson told afp this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 percent from 2 2 percent that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 percent according to the latest central bank survey some even saw that estimate as optimistic marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time but the risk of a technical recession two straight quarters of contraction was low we are already at the bottom casarin noted we could potentially see a double dip but that would have to be triggered by a domestic crisis such as failure to pass the pension reform bill uphill battle bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy there was excessive optimism going on with bolsonaro s victory and now they are just more realistic said casarin it is pretty clear that he is struggling as president to make congress do what he wants one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 percent of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base it does not bode well for his reforms the economy or the markets there s a longer stretch to be run to revamp the economy thomaz favaro of control risks consultancy told afp i think the risk of further declines is very much real
trump punctuated two days of talks in washington last week with a decision to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 per cent from 10 per cent china struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the united states on friday suggesting a resumption of talks between the world s two largest economies would be meaningless unless washington changed course the tough talk capped a week that saw beijing unveil fresh retaliatory tariffs us officials accuse china of backtracking on promises made during months of talks and the trump administration level a potentially crippling blow against one of china s biggest and most successful companies chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang asked about state media reports suggesting there would be no more trade negotiations said china always encouraged resolving disputes with the united states through dialogue and consultations but because of certain things the us side has done during the previous china us trade consultations we believe if there is meaning for these talks there must be a show of sincerity he told a daily news briefing cnbc citing sources said the trade talks had stalled and the next round of discussions was in flux the united states raised beijing s ire this week when it announced it was putting huawei technologies co ltd the world s biggest telecoms equipment maker on a blacklist that could make it extremely hard to do business with us companies the us commerce department may soon scale back restrictions on huawei by issuing a temporary general license to allow time for companies and people who have huawei equipment to maintain reliability of their communications networks and equipment a department spokeswoman said the possible general license would not apply to new transactions the spokeswoman said and would last for 90 days china has yet to say whether or how it will retaliate although its state media is sounding an increasingly strident note the ruling communist party s people s daily published on friday a front page commentary that evoked the patriotic spirit of the country s past wars the trade war can t bring china down it will only harden us to grow stronger it said global stocks which rebounded this week on the prospect of another round of us china talks suffered a fresh bout of selling and china s yuan slid to its weakest against the us dollar in almost five months prices of us government debt were trading higher the increasingly acrimonious trade dispute has rattled investors who fear that the countries are careening dangerously down a track that will badly damage global supply lines and put the brakes on an already slowing world economy the south china morning post citing an unidentified source reported that a senior member of china s communist party said the trade war could reduce china s 2019 economic growth by 1 percentage point in the worst case scenario both sides might need some prodding but we ve had a very clear opportunity for one side or the other to say this isn t going to work and neither side did said derek scissors an expert on sino u s economic relations at the american enterprise institute think tank who put the chance of a deal this year at over 50 50 us president donald trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first agenda aimed at rebalancing global trade has accused china of backing out of a deal earlier this month that would have ended the 10 month dispute earlier this month reuters reported china had backtracked on commitments to change its laws to resolve core us complaints about theft of intellectual property forced technology transfers and other practices trump punctuated two days of talks in washington last week with a decision to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 per cent from 10 per cent the negotiations ended in a stalemate on monday beijing said it would raise its tariffs on a revised list of 60 billion in us goods effective june 1 trump in turn said he is considering slapping tariffs on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports to the united states the us president also continues to dangle the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 on imported cars and parts a move that could be devastating for a number of us trading partners including japan and germany the white house said on friday that trump s decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by up to six months to allow more time for trade talks with the european union and japan trump faced a saturday deadline to make a decision it added however that the us president agreed with findings by the us commerce department that imported vehicles and parts can threaten us national security a designation likely to anger some us allies automakers have strongly opposed the tariffs saying they would hike prices and threaten thousands of us jobs there is also strong opposition in the us congress with many prominent members of trump s republican party rejecting the idea us senate

brazilian economy flirting with economy we are at the bottom of the well says minister guedes 18th saturday may 2019 09 57 utc full article the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well the bovespa index closed below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais feeble growth forecasts and waning confidence in president jair bolsonaro sent brazil s stocks and currency to their lowest level of the year this week as analysts warned of further falls since touching a record 100 000 points in mid march the bovespa has fallen 10 and wiped out gains made since far right bolsonaro took power on january 1 on a promise to revive latin america s biggest economy the benchmark index closed just below 90 000 on friday while brazil s currency traded at its lowest level against the dollar in eight months breaking through four reais the sharp declines have been fanned by uncertainty over us china trade talks that has pummeled stocks and currencies in emerging markets which are perceived as riskier bets but the external headwinds have been compounded by concerns over brazil s feeble economy which has struggled to grow since emerging from the devastating 2015 2016 recession said william jackson of london based capital economics there was a lot of hope when bolsonaro came to power that the economy would turnaround but we have seen no evidence of this this week s massive nationwide protests over education spending freezes money laundering accusations against bolsonaro s eldest son and the slow pace of economic reforms were adding to the general malaise the economy is really flirting with recession jackson added the bleak outlook was underscored by economy minister paulo guedes who warned this week that brazil was at the bottom of the well as he slashed the government s forecast for 2019 economic growth to 1 5 from 2 2 that was followed by central bank chief roberto campos neto who flagged a likely contraction in the economy in the first quarter following a slowdown at the end of 2018 market analysts have pared their full year growth forecasts 11 weeks in a row and now expect the economy to expand by an anemic 1 45 according to the latest central bank survey marcos casarin of oxford economics warned brazil appeared headed for around one percent growth for the third year in a row brazil has never had such a slow recovery said casarin attributing lackluster activity to post recession deleveraging by the brazilian government businesses and consumers which has sapped spending borrowing and investment in the country everyone had to pay back debt at the same time bolsonaro has done little to help boost optimism among investors or voters the pro market reform agenda that helped get the former army captain elected in october has stalled as he struggles to push his signature policy an ambitious overhaul of the pension system that he says will bankrupt brazil if not passed through congress there are fears the proposal could be significantly watered down by the time it is approved probably later this year eroding any positive impact on the economy one of the challenges for bolsonaro is that his ultraconservative social liberal party only holds around 10 of the 513 seats in the lower house of congress that means he is relying on ad hoc alliances with lawmakers in various parties who are part of his evangelical pro agribusiness pro gun base

included a 1 9 billion pesos positive results related to the sale of 51 stake that macro had in prisma and the mark to market of the 49 remaining stake excluding prisma s sale result recurring roe and roa in the first quarter 19 would have been 37 2 and 6 3 respectively net operating income from first quarter 19 was 19 1 billion pesos increasing 18 or 2 9 billion pesos quarter over quarter and 78

private securities increased 345 or 7 3 billion pesos in 1q19 differences in quoted prices of gold and foreign currency including investment in derivative financing totaled a 250 million pesos gain during the first quarter 2019 banco macro s strategy was to sell u s dollars in the spot market and invest the result in pesos in leliqs while at the same time hedging the fx position with investment in derivatives this strategy proved to be highly successful and profitable during the quarter in first quarter of 2019 interest expenses totaled 11 5 billion pesos 1 or 62 million pesos decreased compared to the fourth quarter of last year and 238 or 8 1 billion pesos higher on a yearly basis with interest expense interest on the profits decreased 1 or 57 million pesos quarter on quarter

pesos in 1q19 interest on deposits represented 92 of the bank s financial expenses as of 1q19 the bank s net interest margin including fx was 17 2 higher than the 14 9 posted in 4q18 and the 15 4

liabilities at fair value through profit or loss totaled 2 billion pesos increasing 442 or 1 6 billion pesos compared with 4q18 the positive result was driven by the market to market of the remaining 49 stake that macro has in prisma in the quarter other operating income increased 2 5 billion pesos other income stands out with a 2 3 billion pesos increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year related to the sale of the 51 stake that we had in prisma on a yearly basis other operating income increased 423 or 2 5 billion pesos in 1q19 banco macro s personnel and administrative totaled 5

increased 53 as of march 2019 the efficiency ratio reached 28 6 improving from the 39 7 posted in 4q18 and 35 2 posted in 1q18 this was the result of a 1 increase in expenses and a 28 increase in net interest income net fee income and other operating income as a whole in 1q19 banco macro continues to be the most efficient bank in argentina if we exclude prisma s sale effect the efficiency ratio would have been 31 6 in first quarter 19 in first quarter 19 banco macro s effective income tax rate was 30 1 compared to 31 in 4q18 the statutory tax rate was cut in the latest tax reform bill and as of january 2019 it stands at 30 in terms of loan growth the bank s financing to the private sector grew 1 quarter on quarter 21 year on year it is important to mention that banco macro s market share over private sector loans as of march 2019 reached 7 7 on the funding side total deposits grew 15 quarter on quarter and 82 year on year private sector deposits grew 12 quarter on quarter and 80 compared to the first quarter of last year while private sector deposits increased 46 quarter on quarter and 104 year on year as of march 2019 banco macro s transactional accounts represented

reached 2 03 and the coverage ratio reached 119 23 in terms of capitalization banco macro accounted an excess of capital 52 1 billion pesos which represented a total regulatory capital ratio of 27 7 and a tier 1 ratio of 20 6 if we were to consider the upcoming cash dividend payment of 6 4 billion pesos with the current integrated capital the regulatory capital ratio would be 25 3 and the tier 1 ratio would be 18 2 the bank s aim is to make the best use of this excess capital the bank s liquidity remains more than appropriate liquid assets to total deposits ratio reached 66 overall we have accounted for another positive quarter we continue to show a solid financial position asset quality remains under control and closely monitored we keep on working to improve our efficiency standards and we keep on working our deposit base at this time we would like to take the questions you may have questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your touchtone phone if you d like to withdraw that question please press 2 one moment please for the first question and our first question comes from gabriel nobrega with citi please go ahead gabriel nobrega citi analyst hi everyone and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions i wanted to maybe understand a little bit further why you have decided to fully write off the exposure you had through molca as we have heard from some of your peers that there are ongoing discussions with this company it is still operating with around 20 factories and some of your peers even mentioned that there could be a possible 50 of reversals so i m just trying to understand why you have already wrote it off if there could be this possibility of reversals down the road and i ll make a second question afterwards jorge scarinci chief financial officer good morning gabriel this is jorge scarinci speaking this was a decision of the credit committee approved by the board to make the write off of molino cañuelas it is true that the company is still working it is also true that we think that we are going to recover a part of this i don t know how to quantify but yes in the future we are positive on this brand but as of credit policy both the credit committee the senior credit committee and the board decided to write it off it s an internal policy gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right and if you just allow me a follow up here could you just remind us what was your direct exposure to this company jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes the direct exposure was approximately 390 million pesos gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right perfect i have a second question it s also on asset quality it got to my attention that during the quarter your npl ratios for the retail portfolio deteriorated around 40 bps i understand that that should have a significant portion of your loans in this portfolio as on payroll loans and if i m not mistaken out of this and around 50 are coming from the public sector so could you just maybe give us more color on what happened here what should we be looking for through 2019 and also if we have reached the peak from npl ratios thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer it is true what you are commenting here 93 of our personal loans are tied to payrolls therefore you have a 7 on the open market so this is the portion that is not performing really well on the credit card business we have approximately 64 of the credit card portfolio tied to the payrolls therefore 36 is on the open market and also here this is a portion that is not performing well and it is affecting the consumer non performing portfolio going forward it is going to be very tight and hand in hand with the economy track here honestly it s not very easy for us to predict what would happen with the economy in 2019 because interest rates continue to be high the central banks continue to discuss monetary policy and for sure real gdp is going to be down more than 1 1 5 so we think that when you look at some statistics that we are reaching the bottom of the economic activity in terms of annual comparisons so we would get according to data we are in the worst part of the economic cycle reaching this point but it is not very easy to assure this with 100 of assurance so we think that in terms of npls going forward we are going to be around the 2 2 1 we are not forecasting for the moment major deterioration here in this ratio again this is going to be in hand with what s happening with the economy either losing in the interest rates after or in the second half that it is going to be as a consequence of if monthly inflation goes down not very easy but we think that according to what we are seeing that we are going to maintain this around 2 2 1 of npls going forward gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right jorge that s very clear thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome gabriel operator and our next question comes from alonso garcia with credit suisse please go ahead alonso garcia credit suisse analyst good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding volume growth can you update us on your volume growth expectations for this year probably for next year when do you think if any when do you think credit demand could start picking up what will be the main constraints or drivers for that to happen during the remainder of the year thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hey alonso well you ve had the chance to see not only in banco macro i think but also in the other argentine banks press releases quarter on quarter loan growth has been very sluggish because the economy is really bad and interest rates are really high so it is not very easy to forecast volume growth for this year also the consensus has been increasing inflation target for this year from high 20s to high 30s through to 40 so i would say that this year we might see some real decrease in terms of loan growth therefore we should be growing nominally before inflation so these numbers should be ranging around 30 for this year nominal growth for loans of course for next year it is tougher will depend on the economy and inflation so if having what the economic consensus is forecasting for next year as interest rates should be going down sharply also inflation cooling down we expect that there s going to be a pick up in loan demand and therefore we could be seeing some positive real loan growth next year but again this is kind of a monthly basis movie that can change depending on the monthly inflation that we are having in 2019 also take into consideration that we are in a year where we are going to have presidential elections in october so you have many different variables that could affect the economy in 2019 and 2020 as a summary i would say that this year negative real growth next year positive real growth in loans that is with the scenarios that we are working with alonso garcia credit suisse analyst sure thank you and just a brief follow up do you see any particular segment performing better than the rest of the portfolio do you see both commercial and consumer performing rather similarly jorge scarinci chief financial officer no what we are seeing is that from a nominal point of view we are maintaining our consumer loan portfolio the commercial loan portfolio is slightly decreasing going forward depending on the salary increases that might happen in the economy we could see some pick up in consumption i would say that commercial portfolio will continue in a working capital phase maybe next year we could see a bit more of investment depending on the economic horizon and the landscape but not that big difference between the 2 portfolios alonso garcia credit suisse analyst understood thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from carlos gomez with hsbc please go ahead carlos gomez hsbc analyst yes thank you going back to the loan growth i was distraught by the fact that you have had no loan growth whatsoever in pesos in the last year in fact it s minus 2 should we see that as you being more conservative of the system and is this something that you expect to continue going forward second i have a technical question the capital gain that you have experienced with prisma is it already in your capital ratios or that is still to come thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi carlos how are you on your first question i would say that the strategy of the bank is at this time not to look at market share it s to look at asset quality and of course profitability so if we have to lose some points of market share no problem we want to keep asset quality the best as we can and of course profitability as high as we can again that s why we are forecasting some negative real growth this year in lending and we are focused on maintaining a lot of controls in asset quality and a lot of controls in profitability tough times here if we are going to have a negative performance there well that s the case we are going to have positive performance in other ranges of the balance but the board is very committed to asset quality and profitability at this time so that s what we are following here second question nom the revaluation is not in the capital ratios yet carlos gomez hsbc analyst sorry the sale not the revaluation is in the capital ratios or one is and the other is not how does it work jorge scarinci chief financial officer sorry can you repeat that carlos please carlos gomez hsbc analyst sure you have the sale of 51 of which 60 you record now and then you have the revaluation of 49 that you still retain of the company do either of those 2 parts get reflected in the capital ratios or it has not been reflected yet for either of them jorge scarinci chief financial officer we re going to see the impact of the revaluation next quarter carlos gomez hsbc analyst but the gain already came this quarter jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes carlos gomez hsbc analyst all right thank you can you give us the guidance i mean the impact that we should see from this valuation jorge scarinci chief financial officer not for the moment i do not have a precise number so i do not want to give you a number that would change in the next quarter so i prefer not to give you a number now carlos gomez hsbc analyst thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome carlos operator once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask the question please press 1 and our next question comes from nicolas riva with bank of america please go ahead nicolas riva bank of america analyst thank you so much jorge for taking my question i have an open ended question it s not about the numbers of the quarter so this year we have elections in argentina and the two leading candidates are macri and cristina we don t know if cristina is going to run but we know how cristina s government intervening the banking system they put caps on interest rates they put closing terms on interest rates and term deposits so my question is how do you think a cristina kirchner government would impact the banking sector specifically how are you prepared for that scenario thanks jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi nicolas it s not an easy question first of all we don t know if cristina is going to be a candidate we have to wait until june 22nd to see if she s going to be a candidate second if she s a candidate according to the latest polls that we are seeing she will be losing in the 2nd round third how could cristina be in the 3rd mandate of argentina it s like we are the 4th derivative of the presidential s attitude toward the banking sector so we should be doing a lot a lot of the positions here so i don t know how to answer that question honestly it s very or has a low probability to have an assurance here honestly i don t know i don t know what to say because you need to have an you need to step a lot of barriers before and then i think that only she knows the answer to that question so it s impossible for me to know it so i m sorry but it s tough to answer that nicolas riva bank of america analyst but jorge at least is it fair to say that during the last few years of this administration even though inflation was very high and interest rates were high as well banks managed to do quite well really given the short term duration of the loan portfolio so probably the theory of consolidation of the banking system will get delayed but i believe based on the experience from current years in government the banks managed to do reasonably well within that is that fair to say jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes banks at the time we have a i would say good performance in terms of earnings valuations were not that good but in terms of what happened between 2003 and 2015 i would say that the system improved a lot in terms of liquidity solvency capitalization also concentration so yes nicolas riva bank of america analyst thanks jorge jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from yuri fernandes with j p morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you gentlemen i have actually 2 questions the first one is about the margins how should we think these with the changing interest on assets mix should we expect margins to keep slightly decreasing how are you seeing this my second question is regarding the recent credit card regulation in argentina i know you are somewhat less exposed than some peers how decreasing the payments the settlement dates from 19 days to 10 days may impact your earnings going on thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi yuri how are you i would say that margins will remain stable with this level of interest rates in a slightly climbing scenario in the case of banco macro we should see some expansion margins but level not that much so i would assume for this year stability in the margins not to be changed here in terms of your second question in terms of the impact that we have in credit cards i would assume that in terms of the impact on bottom lines around between 2 7 and 3 impact on bottom lines on the new regulation credit cards this expansion with banco macro not doing anything in terms of to offset this impact for sure that we are going to do or to take some measures here maybe to review some promotions so the net effect is going to be lower than that but ceteris paribus i would say 2 7 to 3 impact to the bottom line yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst very clear thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome operator and there are no further questions at this time so this will conclude the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr nicolas torres for any closing remarks nicolas torres investor relations thank you all for your interest in banco macro we appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you again good day operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 27 minutes call participants nicolas torres investor relations jorge

forecasted 0 2 rise with core retail sales rising by just 0 1 month on month forecasts were for a 0 7 increase industrial production also slipped unexpectedly falling by 0 5 to reverse a 0 2 rise in march in spite of the softer numbers support for the dollar came from a jump in the ny empire state manufacturing index the index rose from 10 10 to 17 80 in may stats through the 2nd half of the week were on a more positive footing april building permit and housing starts were on the rise in april with the weekly initial jobless claims figures also impressing of greater significance however were may s philly fed manufacturing index and consumer sentiment numbers the philly fed manufacturing index jumped from 8 5 to 16 6 in may with the michigan consumer sentiment index surging from 97 2 to 102 4 outside of the numbers primary focus through the week remained on the u s china trade war u s president trump upped the ante late in the week blacklisting huawei in the week the move led to beijing shifting stance on a willingness to resolve the ongoing trade dispute following the tariff hike on chinese goods in the previous week china rolled out tariffs on u s goods last week the move came in spite of trump s warning to beijing not to retaliate in the equity markets the u s majors ended the week in the red again the nasdaq ended the week down 1 27 while the s p500 and dow fell by 0 76 and 0 69 respectively negative sentiment towards trade ultimately weighed with the losses coming in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid week out of the uk economic data was on the lighter side throughout the week wage growth and employment numbers released on tuesday weighed on the pound wages grew by just 3 2 in march easing from a 3 5 rise in february claimant counts also weighed rising from 22 600 to 24 700 in april on the positive the unemployment rate fell from 3 9 to 3 8 in march through the april claimant count numbers offset any upbeat sentiment towards march number while the data was on the negative a 2 11 slide in the pound through the week to 1 2724 resulted from political events in the week early on in the week eu election polls showed that farage and the brexit party had knocked both the tories and the labour party off of their perches to front run into next week s eu elections theresa may and jeremy corbyn failed to deliver an agreement by the end of the week leading to more brexit uncertainty to wrap the week up theresa may also had to give an end date to her position as pm to the 1922 committee with farage looking to rock the uk political cradle talk of boris johnson waiting in the wings for the top job didn t do the pound too many favors the slide in the pound provided much needed support to the ftse100 which ended the week up 2 02 the upside in the week came in spite of the escalation in the ongoing u s china trade war out of the eurozone the stats were mixed through the week key stats included german 1st quarter gdp numbers and germany and the eurozone s economic sentiment and eurozone industrial production figures while germany s zew current conditions index improved in may the more influential economic sentiment index slid from 3 1 to 2 1 weighing on the eur adding to the downside was a slide in the eurozone s zew economic sentiment index and fall in industrial production the economic sentiment index fell from 4 5 to 1 6 with industrial production falling by 0 5 in march while a recovery in the german economy was good news it wasn t spectacular with the economy growing by just 0 6 year on year in the 4th quarter the economy had grown by 0 9 of less influence through the week were eurozone 1st quarter gdp and trade data in spite of a widening in the eurozone s trade surplus finalized april inflation figures also had little impact on the eur the eurozone s annual core rate of inflation came in at 1 3 which was well below the ecb target the eur ended the week down 0 67 to 1 1158 the weekly loss dragging the eur into the red for the current month in the equity markets the majors found strong support with the cac ending the week up 2 08 the dax and eurostoxx600 also made gains rising by 1 49 and by 1 16 respectively support came from the u s plan to delay a rollout of tariffs on eu autos for 6 months and the u s majors and a softer eur the upside was capped however with the majors seeing red on friday weighed by the ongoing u s china trade war elsewhere it was a rough week for the aussie and kiwi dollars the aussie dollar slid by 1 91 with the kiwi dollar ending the week down 1 18 for the aussie dollar the stats were skewed to the negative while business confidence saw a slight improvement in april employment and consumer sentiment numbers weighed wages grew by 0 5 in the 1st quarter coming up short of a forecasted 0 6 rise consumer sentiment rose by just 0 6 following a 1 9 increase in april wrapping up a bad week was a 6 300 fall in full employment in april leading to the unemployment rate rising from 5 1 to 5 2 with the rba s focus on labor market conditions the weaker numbers coupled with sentiment towards the u s china trade war did the damage ahead of the federal elections that take place today for the kiwi dollar there were no stats until the end of the week a slide in both producer input and output prices in the 1st quarter weighed at the end of the week adding to the downside was the april business pmi while the actual pmi rose from 51 9 to 53 sub index numbers were less impressive new orders and employment conditions weakened with the u s china trade war thrown in the question will be whether the rbnz will need to cut rates for a 2nd time in the coming months for the loonie the stats were skewed to the negative april inflation figures disappointed on wednesday the annual core rate of inflation came in at 1 5 which was softer than 1 6 in march and a forecasted 1 8 core consumer prices failed to budge month on month while the consumer price index rose by 0 4 consumer prices had risen by 0 7 in march march manufacturing sales figures failed to give the loonie a boost on thursday sales increased by 2 1 which was far better than a forecasted 1 5 increase while the stats were skewed to the negative news of the u s canada and mexico reaching a deal to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum limited the downside for the loonie on the week the loonie ended the week down 0 31 at c 1 3458 against the greenback for the japanese yen the japanese yen slipped to 110 levels to end the week down 0 12 at 110 08 losses came despite a shift in sentiment towards the u s china trade talks and lack of progress on brexit a jump in the michigan consumer sentiment figure on friday suggests strong support for trump policy which ultimately left the yen in the red out of china stats through the week included april fixed asset investment industrial production and retail sales figures all the numbers were on the weaker side with industrial production rising by just 5 4 year on year production had risen by 8 5 year on year in march with the latest blacklisting of huawei beijing announced support measures as the extended trade war begins

menafn the costa rica news this country has a little less than 5 million inhabitants but that has not prevented costa rica from being at the forefront of innovation in latin america aside from being known as exporters of coffee and bananas ticos evolved towards the manufacture of microchips in the 1990s then towards the export of services and advanced technology by taking advantage of the talent of an educated and bilingual population but that is just one of the many reasons that have allowed the central american country to follow a path very different from that of neighbors such as nicaragua el salvador or honduras that companies like microsoft intel hewlett packard google amazon are in costa rica is thanks to the high educational level of the population as well as social and political stability pedro beirute general manager of the promoter of foreign trade of costa rica procomer the central american country has also favored its geographic location and good connectivity with the rest of the latin american economies and especially with the united states and those advantages together with a commercial opening that began 3 decades ago have made it a magnet for the great technological multinationals and in the most innovative country in latin america after chile according to the global innovation index gii 2019 but not everything is perfect this rapid economic transformation has occurred in a country that still has 20 poverty and 12 unemployment and to its problems of infrastructure and bureaucracy there is a galloping fiscal deficit of 6 of the gross domestic product which has put the government of carlos alvarado to cut public spending and collect more taxes through tax reform in the midst of these challenges however the country continues to embark on its plan to attract more direct foreign investment encourage the creation of new technology companies and export value added products a rocket to mars in 39 days one of the symbols of costa rican innovation is the laboratory ad astra rocket that costa rica has the scientist franklin chang one of the first latin american astronauts who traveled to space in addition to creating hydrogen technologies to reduce transport pollution one of chang s flagship projects is a revolutionary invention to take a rocket to mars in 39 days using a plasma engine also ticos are proud to have put the 1st central american satellite in space in 2018 developed by scientists from the costa rican technological institute with the goal of decarbonizing its economy by 2050 which means eliminating the use of fossil fuels the country has also opted for biotechnology to develop renewable energy and its scientists are working on innovations to realize the dream of becoming a green country we have the talent we just need more companies assures cyndi torres a professor at the university of costa rica dedicated to research on sustainable development for now costa rica has been the scene of multiple inventions as the only humanoid robot in latin america that has smooth control hands for handling tasks and although many of the innovations are focused on computer development to improve the efficiency of companies the list of inventions is long some of them are treatments for cancer of the pancreas liver and ovaries blood products medicines made from human blood insect based foods such as crackers shakes and cricket bars teeth created from cow bones and other dental biomaterials development of software to improve the electrical systems of the country or to digitally manage the information systems in hospitals genetic improvement of species antivenom serum to survive snakes bites digital applications for companies and development of artificial intelligence generation of electricity and heat from coffee waste and although they are less visible costa rica has made progress in the development of systems that make the production processes of the business process organization bpo companies more efficient a small experimental laboratory since the late 1990s the country took decisive action to get foreign companies settled in their free zones this is how the us intel the world s largest producer of microprocessors opened a factory that became responsible for 20 of national exports in the late 1990s until in 2014 it closed to move to asia where the costs of production are cheaper back however he left a research laboratory that employs highly skilled labor known as intel s megalab they took the production line but left the added value to export knowledge beirute emphasizes like intel there are about 100 companies dedicated to generating products derived from the so called life sciences with applications in medical technology agriculture food or the pharmaceutical industry in fact one of the symbols of successful start ups is establishment labs the first costa rican company to trade its shares in the nasdaq its focus is the export of medical devices such as for example breast implants that incorporate a chip inside and are sold in about 70 countries and that is precisely one of the great bets of costa rica the export of medical devices such as valves for the heart instruments for examinations and other products used in hospitals despite recent developments the history of innovation began many years ago we have innovated since the army was abolished 70 years ago and those resources were invested in education says luis jiménez director of the university agency for entrepreneurship management of the university of costa rica jimenez says that the country has one of the 3 largest medical equipment development centers in the world and highlights how the public sector through universities has led an investment in technological innovation costa rica is a small laboratory for the rest of the world concludes jiménez diversified economy costa rica has been expanding its commercial opening for decades it has signed about 50 free trade agreements invests 8 of gdp in education and since it does not spend resources in the armed forces it has more money to invest in research and development its exports represent around 35 of gdp a level that leaves them in a very good position compared to other developed countries the travel industry tourism education and health occupies first place in sales abroad followed by business services and products in the field of information technology and telecommunications according to procomer data and if all the products of medical devices are grouped the sector as a whole exceeds the export of pineapple and electronic components with 28 of the total exported from the country innovation in the midst of poverty innovation has given us a comparative advantage over other countries and although we do not have a channel like panama we have managed to take off comments costa rican journalist esteban mata in conversation with bbc mundo however he warns that poverty continues to be alarming and that there is a setback in the economic situation that can have effects on innovative advances to the partial cut in the financing of university credits other social problems are added like the increase of the violent deaths a phenomenon that also plays against the development of new businesses it is sold to costa rica as a paradise but in reality it is not mata adds the technological giants and local small businesses some of the large foreign companies have established their latin american headquarters in costa rica while others have brought to the country operations in the area of services such as customer service accounting finance technological support and human resources management many are technological multinationals that operate in free zones have high productivity and pay their employees very well highlights bbc mundo galileo solís senior specialist in competitiveness technology and innovation of the inter american development bank idb but as if it were a parallel reality 95 of companies in costa rica live in another world most of them are small or medium sized local companies with low productivity explains solís
by david lawder and steve scherer washington ottawa reuters the united states struck deals on friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico the three governments said removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new north american trade pact the separate agreements which will not impose u s quotas on canadian and mexican metals shipments will also eliminate mexican and canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of u s products including pork beef and bourbon the united states and canada said their agreement will be implemented by sunday afternoon and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from china and other countries from entering the u s market via canada president donald trump had imposed the global section 232 tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum in march 2018 on national security grounds invoking a 1962 cold war era trade law both canada and mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the united states and challenged the tariffs before the world trade organization this is just pure good news for canadians canadian prime minister justin trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at stelco holdings inc s steel mill in hamilton ontario stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news while top u s steelmaker nucor fell 3 1 percent and u s steel corp which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs fell 1 2 percent spokesmen for u s steel and nucor which had advocated for

as the campaign in the 2020 presidential race heats up so do the promises with each new candidate vying for who can offer voters the most goodies but goodies don t come cheap many of the promises being thrown around could prove quite expensive to implement the implications for the economy should be obvious experts in fiscal policy can t help pondering some important questions should the federal government create additional fiat currency to directly finance government spending and then issue government bonds or raise taxes if this newly created currency begins to stoke inflation should congress enable the treasury to unilaterally change tax policy to prevent inflation stemming from this spending largesse and to manage the business cycle can politicians actually be entrusted to allow the unpopular decisions spending reductions or tax increases required to prevent potentially disastrous inflationary consequences of fiat currency expansion should the trillions of dollars of government debt be viewed as public asset as something we as the public merely owe ourselves for proponents of modern monetary theory the answer to all of the above is yes this defiance of economic and political reality rivals the absurdity of the flat earth society s rejection of geographic reality the fact is fiat currency represents value it doesn t create value an increase in the supply of fiat currency without a corresponding decrease in the scarcity of resources leads to the price of those resources increasing i e inflation the federal reserve printing presses cannot magically transform digital bytes into sparkling treasure alchemy makes for great fiction but dismal public policy the absolute value of every existing unit of currency declines harming consumers and investors such government induced inflation also siphons wealth from the holdings of savers to the federal government as the real worth of accumulated savings declines in ages past kings and emperors required commercial transactions be conducted using coinage from the sovereign mint in order to enrich the crown without resorting to outright taxation the mint would debase coinage by diluting gold and silver with cheaper metals such as bronze and copper economic and political mayhem often followed churning out paper and digital fiat currency is far easier than the metal debasement of yesteryear the results become disastrous even more quickly look at venezuela s current 80 000 annual inflation the destruction of the german mark in world war ii zimbabwe s 1 730 annual inflation in 2007 or argentina s 1 100 annual inflation in the 1980s in fact from 1980 2005 two dozen nations experienced bouts of hyperinflation of at least 1 000 over a one year period rudyard kipling s warning of false economics prophets stated it well e were promised abundance for all by robbing selected peter to pay for collective paul but though we had plenty of money there was nothing our money could buy as economist henry hazlitt explained unbalances reduces and misdirects production it leads to unemployment and to malemployment regardless of the demonstrable harm governments struggle to deny themselves the attainment of temporary political gain through manipulation of the money supply here in the united states our own central bank has pursued a nearly constant albeit less grossly negligent inflationary course over the past century the most recent episodes of distortionary activity include multitrillion dollar purchases of government debt and mortgage securities to prevent this newly created money from flooding the economy and stoking inflation the federal reserve began paying banks to hold excess reserves in the fed s digital vault banks obliged although this prevented massive inflation the monetary experimentation resulted in relatively less funds available to other sectors likely contributing to the historically slow recovery following the great recession to their credit modern monetary theorists acknowledge the inflation risk of newly created fiat currency funding government spending but even if their proposals to issue government debt and hike taxes successfully staved off inflation the bottom line remains as government gobbles up more of the economy less wealth is left in the hands of the populace there is no free lunch we will pay either through the visible burden of direct taxation the hidden tax of inflation or higher borrowing costs as the government competes with businesses for available capital such realities might not make for a great stump speech but facing them squarely now can save us a lot of headaches down the road

working to improve our efficiency standards and we keep on working our deposit base advertisement advertisement at this time we would like to take the questions you may have questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session if you d like to ask a question please press 1 on your touchtone phone if you d like to withdraw that question please press 2 one moment please for the first question and our first question comes from gabriel nobrega with citi please go ahead gabriel nobrega citi analyst hi everyone and thank you for the opportunity to ask questions i wanted to maybe understand a little bit further why you have decided to fully write off the exposure you had through molca as we have heard from some of your peers that there are ongoing discussions with this company it is still operating with around 20 factories and some of your peers even mentioned that there could be a possible 50 of reversals so i m just trying to understand why you have already wrote it off if there could be this possibility of reversals down the road and i ll make a second question afterwards advertisement advertisement jorge scarinci chief financial officer good morning gabriel this is jorge scarinci speaking this was a decision of the credit committee approved by the board to make the write off of molino cañuelas it is true that the company is still working it is also true that we think that we are going to recover a part of this i don t know how to quantify but yes in the future we are positive on this brand but as of credit policy both the credit committee the senior credit committee and the board decided to write it off it s an internal policy gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right and if you just allow me a follow up here could you just remind us what was your direct exposure to this company advertisement advertisement jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes the direct exposure was approximately 390 million pesos gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right perfect i have a second question it s also on asset quality it got to my attention that during the quarter your npl ratios for the retail portfolio deteriorated around 40 bps i understand that that should have a significant portion of your loans in this portfolio as on payroll loans and if i m not mistaken out of this and around 50 are coming from the public sector so could you just maybe give us more color on what happened here what should we be looking for through 2019 and also if we have reached the peak from npl ratios thank you advertisement advertisement jorge scarinci chief financial officer it is true what you are commenting here 93 of our personal loans are tied to payrolls therefore you have a 7 on the open market so this is the portion that is not performing really well on the credit card business we have approximately 64 of the credit card portfolio tied to the payrolls therefore 36 is on the open market and also here this is a portion that is not performing well and it is affecting the consumer non performing portfolio going forward it is going to be very tight and hand in hand with the economy track here honestly it s not very easy for us to predict what would happen with the economy in 2019 because interest rates continue to be high the central banks continue to discuss monetary policy and for sure real gdp is going to be down more than 1 1 5 so we think that when you look at some statistics that we are reaching the bottom of the economic activity in terms of annual comparisons so we would get according to data we are in the worst part of the economic cycle reaching this point but it is not very easy to assure this with 100 of assurance so we think that in terms of npls going forward we are going to be around the 2 2 1 we are not forecasting for the moment major deterioration here in this ratio again this is going to be in hand with what s happening with the economy either losing in the interest rates after or in the second half that it is going to be as a consequence of if monthly inflation goes down not very easy but we think that according to what we are seeing that we are going to maintain this around 2 2 1 of npls going forward gabriel nobrega citi analyst all right jorge that s very clear thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome gabriel operator and our next question comes from alonso garcia with credit suisse please go ahead alonso garcia credit suisse analyst good morning thank you for taking my question my question is regarding volume growth can you update us on your volume growth expectations for this year probably for next year when do you think if any when do you think credit demand could start picking up what will be the main constraints or drivers for that to happen during the remainder of the year thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hey alonso well you ve had the chance to see not only in banco macro i think but also in the other argentine banks press releases quarter on quarter loan growth has been very sluggish because the economy is really bad and interest rates are really high so it is not very easy to forecast volume growth for this year also the consensus has been increasing inflation target for this year from high 20s to high 30s through to 40 so i would say that this year we might see some real decrease in terms of loan growth therefore we should be growing nominally before inflation so these numbers should be ranging around 30 for this year nominal growth for loans of course for next year it is tougher will depend on the economy and inflation so if having what the economic consensus is forecasting for next year as interest rates should be going down sharply also inflation cooling down we expect that there s going to be a pick up in loan demand and therefore we could be seeing some positive real loan growth next year but again this is kind of a monthly basis movie that can change depending on the monthly inflation that we are having in 2019 also take into consideration that we are in a year where we are going to have presidential elections in october so you have many different variables that could affect the economy in 2019 and 2020 as a summary i would say that this year negative real growth next year positive real growth in loans that is with the scenarios that we are working with alonso garcia credit suisse analyst sure thank you and just a brief follow up do you see any particular segment performing better than the rest of the portfolio do you see both commercial and consumer performing rather similarly jorge scarinci chief financial officer no what we are seeing is that from a nominal point of view we are maintaining our consumer loan portfolio the commercial loan portfolio is slightly decreasing going forward depending on the salary increases that might happen in the economy we could see some pick up in consumption i would say that commercial portfolio will continue in a working capital phase maybe next year we could see a bit more of investment depending on the economic horizon and the landscape but not that big difference between the 2 portfolios alonso garcia credit suisse analyst understood thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from carlos gomez with hsbc please go ahead carlos gomez hsbc analyst yes thank you going back to the loan growth i was distraught by the fact that you have had no loan growth whatsoever in pesos in the last year in fact it s minus 2 should we see that as you being more conservative of the system and is this something that you expect to continue going forward second i have a technical question the capital gain that you have experienced with prisma is it already in your capital ratios or that is still to come thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi carlos how are you on your first question i would say that the strategy of the bank is at this time not to look at market share it s to look at asset quality and of course profitability so if we have to lose some points of market share no problem we want to keep asset quality the best as we can and of course profitability as high as we can again that s why we are forecasting some negative real growth this year in lending and we are focused on maintaining a lot of controls in asset quality and a lot of controls in profitability tough times here if we are going to have a negative performance there well that s the case we are going to have positive performance in other ranges of the balance but the board is very committed to asset quality and profitability at this time so that s what we are following here second question nom the revaluation is not in the capital ratios yet carlos gomez hsbc analyst sorry the sale not the revaluation is in the capital ratios or one is and the other is not how does it work jorge scarinci chief financial officer sorry can you repeat that carlos please carlos gomez hsbc analyst sure you have the sale of 51 of which 60 you record now and then you have the revaluation of 49 that you still retain of the company do either of those 2 parts get reflected in the capital ratios or it has not been reflected yet for either of them jorge scarinci chief financial officer we re going to see the impact of the revaluation next quarter carlos gomez hsbc analyst but the gain already came this quarter jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes carlos gomez hsbc analyst all right thank you can you give us the guidance i mean the impact that we should see from this valuation jorge scarinci chief financial officer not for the moment i do not have a precise number so i do not want to give you a number that would change in the next quarter so i prefer not to give you a number now carlos gomez hsbc analyst thank you so much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome carlos operator once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask the question please press 1 and our next question comes from nicolas riva with bank of america please go ahead nicolas riva bank of america analyst thank you so much jorge for taking my question i have an open ended question it s not about the numbers of the quarter so this year we have elections in argentina and the two leading candidates are macri and cristina we don t know if cristina is going to run but we know how cristina s government intervening the banking system they put caps on interest rates they put closing terms on interest rates and term deposits so my question is how do you think a cristina kirchner government would impact the banking sector specifically how are you prepared for that scenario thanks jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi nicolas it s not an easy question first of all we don t know if cristina is going to be a candidate we have to wait until june 22nd to see if she s going to be a candidate second if she s a candidate according to the latest polls that we are seeing she will be losing in the 2nd round third how could cristina be in the 3rd mandate of argentina it s like we are the 4th derivative of the presidential s attitude toward the banking sector so we should be doing a lot a lot of the positions here so i don t know how to answer that question honestly it s very or has a low probability to have an assurance here honestly i don t know i don t know what to say because you need to have an you need to step a lot of barriers before and then i think that only she knows the answer to that question so it s impossible for me to know it so i m sorry but it s tough to answer that nicolas riva bank of america analyst but jorge at least is it fair to say that during the last few years of this administration even though inflation was very high and interest rates were high as well banks managed to do quite well really given the short term duration of the loan portfolio so probably the theory of consolidation of the banking system will get delayed but i believe based on the experience from current years in government the banks managed to do reasonably well within that is that fair to say jorge scarinci chief financial officer yes banks at the time we have a i would say good performance in terms of earnings valuations were not that good but in terms of what happened between 2003 and 2015 i would say that the system improved a lot in terms of liquidity solvency capitalization also concentration so yes nicolas riva bank of america analyst thanks jorge jorge scarinci chief financial officer you re welcome operator and our next question comes from yuri fernandes with j p morgan please go ahead yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst thank you gentlemen i have actually 2 questions the first one is about the margins how should we think these with the changing interest on assets mix should we expect margins to keep slightly decreasing how are you seeing this my second question is regarding the recent credit card regulation in argentina i know you are somewhat less exposed than some peers how decreasing the payments the settlement dates from 19 days to 10 days may impact your earnings going on thank you jorge scarinci chief financial officer hi yuri how are you i would say that margins will remain stable with this level of interest rates in a slightly climbing scenario in the case of banco macro we should see some expansion margins but level not that much so i would assume for this year stability in the margins not to be changed here in terms of your second question in terms of the impact that we have in credit cards i would assume that in terms of the impact on bottom lines around between 2 7 and 3 impact on bottom lines on the new regulation credit cards this expansion with banco macro not doing anything in terms of to offset this impact for sure that we are going to do or to take some measures here maybe to review some promotions so the net effect is going to be lower than that but ceteris paribus i would say 2 7 to 3 impact to the bottom line yuri fernandes j p morgan analyst very clear thank you very much jorge scarinci chief financial officer you are welcome operator and there are no further questions at this time so this will conclude the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr nicolas torres for any closing remarks nicolas torres investor relations thank you all for your interest in banco macro we appreciate your time and look forward to speaking with you again good day operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today s presentation you may now disconnect duration 27 minutes call participants nicolas torres investor relations jorge

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by david lawder and steve scherer washington ottawa reuters the united states struck deals on friday to lift tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from canada and mexico the three governments said removing a major obstacle to legislative approval of a new north american trade pact the separate agreements which will not impose u s quotas on canadian and mexican metals shipments will also eliminate mexican and canadian retaliatory tariffs on a broad range of u s products including pork beef and bourbon related stories the united states and canada said their agreement will be implemented by sunday afternoon and includes new curbs aimed at preventing dumped steel and aluminum from china and other countries from entering the u s market via canada president donald trump had imposed the global section 232 tariffs of 25 on steel and 10 on aluminum in march 2018 on national security grounds invoking a 1962 cold war era trade law both canada and mexico argued for 14 months that their metals industries posed no security threat as their economies are integrated with the united states and challenged the tariffs before the world trade organization this is just pure good news for canadians canadian prime minister justin trudeau told reporters after announcing the deal to workers at stelco holdings inc s steel mill in hamilton ontario stelco shares soared 11 percent on the news while top u s steelmaker nucor fell 3 1 percent and u s steel corp which had seen massive profit improvement because of the tariffs fell 1 2 percent spokesmen for u s steel and nucor which had advocated for maintaining strong tariff protections could not be reached for comment trade deal vote the metals tariffs were a major irritant for canada and mexico and had caused them to halt progress toward ratification the new u s mexico canada agreement the trilateral trade deal to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement u s lawmakers with constituents suffering from canadian and mexican retaliation including senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley also said they would not consider a usmca vote with the tariffs in place after the deal grassley tweeted thank u mr president for really helping the farmers of iowa w this important step in usmca w lifting metal tariffs realdonaldtrump just proved he can deliver on negotiations china ought to take note start dealing in good faith take pres trump seriously trudeau said canada would now work with the united states on the timing of usmca ratification and said he was optimistic canada would be be able to move forward well in the coming weeks u s vice president mike pence said he would meet with trudeau in ottawa on may 30 to discuss advancing ratification several u s democrats applauded removal of the tariffs but said usmca was not yet ready for their support when it comes to the new agreement house democrats continue to have a number of substantial concerns related to labor environment enforcement and access to affordable medicines provisions those issues still need to be remedied said house ways and means committee chairman richard neal neal added that the deal does not address global steel overcapacity and criticized trump s handling of trade negotiations with china which deteriorated significantly in the last two weeks trump speaking to realtors in washington called the pact a fantastic deal for our country and said congress would hopefully approve the usmca quickly then the great farmers and manufacturers and steel plants will make our economy even more successful than it already is jesus seade mexico s deputy foreign minister for north america said the deal measurably increases the probability the usmca will be approved before the u s congress summer break in august some u s lawmakers say passage would become more difficult after the recess due to budget battles expected in the fall and increased 2020 presidential campaign activity transshipments surges trump s metals tariffs have been largely aimed at keeping excess production from china out of the u s market and the deal includes a new monitoring mechanism aimed at preventing steel and aluminum from china and other countries from being transshipped through canada and mexico to the united states but the u s trade representative s office also said the deal allows it to reimpose tariffs in the event of surges in imports of specific steel products if tariffs are reimposed retaliation would be limited to the steel and aluminum sectors carmakers which have announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher u s costs due to the tariffs praised the deal and said it brought usmca passage a big step closer while many automakers already source the vast majority of their steel and aluminum domestically tariffs drive those prices up which decreases investment and harms auto workers and ultimately consumers said the alliance of automobile manufacturers a trade group representing most major brands including general motors co toyota motor corp volkswagen ag and others the national pork producers council which says retaliatory tariffs have cost its members 12 per animal or a total of 1 5 billion also expressed relief at the end of a trade dispute that has placed enormous financial strain on american pork producers additional reporting by david shepardson andrea shalal and doina chiacu in washington and anthony esposito and stefanie eschenbacher in mexico city writing by david
