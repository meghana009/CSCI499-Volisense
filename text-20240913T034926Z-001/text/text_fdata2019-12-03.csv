there is one question on everyone s mind is there still a way out of the current crisis or are we going to fall into an abyss with an intense deterioration of all economic indicators that could lead to dire consequences a summary of the current economic situation will help us analyze its sustainability then we can try to find a way out of the crisis with the least damage to the economy the protests accelerated what was already a deteriorating economic and financial environment the protests on the street accentuated panic among the population with the resignation of prime minister saad hariri being the cherry on the top when banks opened following 14 days of closure people rushed to withdraw and or transfer their deposits into dollars or outside the country banks were obliged to adopt further restrictions in order to maintain financial stability for the longest possible time no banking system in the world could survive an unchecked rush on banks when depositors place their money in a lebanese bank the bank in turn uses these funds to loan to other customers or to buy government bonds or certificates of deposit from banque du liban bdl lebanon s central bank such uses are standard practice world over and so long as depositors are content to keep their money in bank and do not en masse try to withdraw their deposits the banking system remains stable and functional in lebanon the liquidity issues of banks were also exacerbated as the banking system had already lost part of its foreign assets starting in 2011 with the balance of payments bop in the red for more than eight years moreover the bop deficit had accelerated during the past two years the current economic and financial situation can only be transitory as its downfall has been accelerated by the protests making the economic and financial situation unsustainable the restrictive measures adopted by banks will make it less likely for capital to flow into the economy as investors will become worry about the risk of being unable to withdraw money from the system it will therefore become more and more difficult to attract money and the economy will have to rely on its own existing stock of foreign assets to finance its imports of goods and services imports will decline as a result yet will continue to constitute the major drain on foreign assets another source draining deposits is cash withdrawals from banks people are withdrawing as much cash as they can in both currencies lebanese lira and us dollars to counter the restrictive policies of banks then being unable to transfer cash outside the country this money is kept in safe boxes at homes estimates based on the balance sheets of bdl find that the amount of cash withdrawn from banks in october and november has amounted to more than 2 5 billion taking a longer view successive governments since 1990 were never able to restore investors confidence level to where it was before the war started the dollarization rate never went below 50 percent and most of the time interest rates on lira were much higher than on dollars during the episodes of shocks like in 1995 interest rates went up to 38 percent while in 2005 2006 2008 and more recently the price of credit default swaps cds these are an insurance against the risk of default of the lebanese government increased to more than 2400 basis points meaning that there is a greater risk of default theoretically the five years cds should be equal to the difference between five years lebanese eurobonds and five years us bonds which has crossed 1000 basis points as demonstrations continue the restrictive policies of banks will remain in place and the repercussions of both on economic growth are substantial analysis of various sources including the purchasing managers index finds that companies turnovers fell by more than 50 percent in october depending on the sector the impact in november is anticipated to be larger than the previous month as banks froze their facilities for individuals as well as for companies and reduced credit cards limits consumption and imports are de facto declining and traders are feeling the heat the result is an economic recession combined with a liquidity drought that is unsustainable beyond the short term either a government is formed and the country is put on the right track of reforms or the restrictive policies will increase and the parallel exchange market will see a larger depreciation of the lebanese lira the cash economy will flourish as depositors will avoid putting money at banks so the million dollar question remains if a government is formed is there a way out without a haircut on deposits a restructuring of government debt and devaluation the most urgent issue is to restore investors confidence in order to be able to levy the restrictive measures of commercial banks and for capital to start flowing in again a way out can be found without a haircut on deposits and devaluation but a restructuring of government debt at the least the debt in lebanese lira is preferable in order to reduce the burden on public finances the first step before getting into any future economic plan is to form a government this government has to be formed quickly and according to the lebanese constitution it has to get the support of the majority of parliamentarians beyond parliamentary approval the government has to gain the confidence of people on the streets but most importantly it has to get international recognition as trustworthy and cooperative debating the composition of the new government is like debating the sex of angels be it technocratic techno political or purely political the most important thing besides being approved by the international community is for the government to be coherent to have an economic and financial plan for the upcoming three to four years and to be responsible for its actions in order to be productive and immediately start to tackle the current economic and financial crisis if a government with international support is formed then resolving the current economic woes will become easier an inflow of deposits from the gcc governments of 7 billion to 10 billion as deposits at bdl will also be very vital to support confidence as bdl will then be able to pump dollars in the market and banks will relax capital controls in few months time of course this will be conditional on the new government adopting an ambitious yet credible comprehensive economic reforms plan for the upcoming three to four years as capital controls will be maintained in the near term the banking system has to move into reducing interest rates in order to limit the increase in its foreign currency exposure a drastic reduction in interest rates is advisable on both dollar and lira deposits the interest rate differential will have to decline to a quarter or half a percentage point as it is the case in economies with pegged currencies this step will lead to a reduction in the cost of funds for banks especially in dollars at a time where capital inflows have been reduced to negligent levels banks will then move to reduce interests on corporate debt and start to provide loans again to businesses bdl has already issued a circular ordering the banks to increase their capital by 20 percent by mid 2020 many analysts are arguing the fact that this may not be enough as the scenarios they are considering require a haircut on deposits this alternative scenario is based on restoring the confidence in the banking sector and the economy at large which will make this recapitalization enough for the current period any recapitalization that goes beyond this level will necessitate a better environment in order for banks to be able to attract investors in order to accelerate the recovery process it would be advisable for the new government reach an agreement with the international monetary fund imf as soon as possible the importance of an imf program is that it will act as a catalyst for capital inflows the imf will agree with the government on three years extended fund facility eff that will consist of an economic program agreed with the government including a timeline with quarterly evaluation by the imf it will also entail a package that could go up to few billion dollars with quarterly disbursements if the review by the imf mission is positive on the implementation of the reform program once the imf gives a green light for the disbursement international donors will do the same hence the imf will act as a leverage to attract capital from abroad if the imf program will disburse 3 billion over three years it is expected that this money will attract more than 10 billion over the same period it is important to note that citizens will need to sacrifice in the short term while gradually getting better public services over the medium term having covered the pressing issues of the current situation let us then look more specifically at the economic reality that lebanon finds itself in and the measures that need to be undertaken in the immediate and the long term to put the country on a path toward recovery i economic reality over the past few years lebanon has been facing increasingly challenging economic and financial conditions on the back of contradicting policies and paralyzed governments with reforms eternally remaining in the pipeline economic growth has been very low averaging close to null over the past three years including the current year with macroeconomic vulnerabilities rapidly increasing as capital inflows dried up and lebanon continued to rely on a consumption and import driven growth model in particular fiscal policies and projections were unrealistic especially with the boost in wages and salaries of government employees before the 2018 elections and the increase in taxes that hit the private sector in an already weak economic growth environment this has led to a surge in the fy 2018 fiscal deficit to 11 percent of gdp pushing public debt to 151 percent of gdp this fiscal policy in addition to the structural composition of the economy fueled the current account deficit to 18 to 20 percent of gdp last year this time without capital inflows that used to close the gap in the past lackluster progress in structural reforms continued to hamper investment and allowed inefficient public enterprises to linger and a large informal economy to expand the government s slow reaction and or wrong policies adopted to face the systemic imbalances led to increased macroeconomic deterioration while some adjustment policies were adopted since the start of 2018 these fell short of the comprehensive reforms needed to ensure macroeconomic stability despite some monetary policy tightening the external sector imbalances kept on deteriorating similarly fiscal deficit in the first half of 2019 remained significant despite its decline compared to the previous year however arrears were accumulated toward three main counterparts namely private hospitals contractors and social security finally the government did not agree on any tariff increases in the power sector which may have helped reducing quasi fiscal losses sizable financing from the banking sector especially bdl at advantageous rates provided critical financing relief but also deferred the urgency to tackle the underlying problems on the back of weakening confidence economic activity has slowed considerably and the country has started to enter stagflation high frequency indicators including the purchasing managers index cement deliveries construction permits real estate transactions and motor vehicle sales have continued to deteriorate confirming a marked slowdown in economic activity in addition public investment and construction have contracted due to cuts in government development spending growth is estimated to have declined to 0 6 percent in 2018 and will go into negative territories this year following the eruption of demonstrations on october 17 real gdp growth is expected to register at negative 2 percent as lost confidence led to capital controls which in turn hurt traders activity and increased non performing loans at banks consumer inflation has decelerated markedly to 2 77 percent by august 2019 compared to 6 29 percent during the same period last year it is expected to substantially increase in the last quarter of the year as the appearance of a parallel exchange market where the dollar is being traded in a large range from ll1 700 ll2 300 1 has led to a jump in consumer prices of imported goods government has tried to contain the fiscal imbalances during 2019 but it has accumulated arrears the 2019 budget was approved by parliament in july of the same year which left just five months to implement the new budget with the embedded tax measures during the first seven months of the year fiscal deficit had declined by 21 7 percent year on year to reach 2 4 billion with the primary balance registering a surplus of 577 million or 1 percent of gdp nonetheless this primary surplus masks an underlying unrecorded spending as government has accumulated arrears of at least 1 percent of gdp in the first seven months of the year due to recent events the overall fiscal deficit is expected to widen to 8 5 percent of gdp against a budget target of 7 6 percent in fy 2019 as revenues will remain constant despite the increase in taxes approved in the budget and expenditures will decline by 6 percent compared to 2018 the weakness of the external position has widened in recent months although the trade deficit has narrowed marginally by august 2019 to 20 percent of gdp down from 20 6 percent during the same period last year the trade deficit would have been narrower at 16 5 percent of gdp in 2019 if it was not for the imports of mineral products that have increased by more than 64 percent to reach 4 7 billion largely on the back of edl fuel imports the current account is expected to have remained in a deficit of 18 to 20 percent of gdp the balance of payments has recorded a deficit of 4 5 billion in the first nine months of the year compared to a deficit of 1 3 billion during the same period last year the bop deficit is expected to reach 8 billion by the end of 2019 for the following reasons we estimate that 500 million of debt related payments will go to foreign holders of lebanese debt in the last three months of the year bdl has to pay around 1 9 billion of debt related payments in foreign currencies including lebanese eurobonds maturing at the end of november eurobonds coupons and principal payments on bilateral and multilateral loans an additional 2 5 billion to 3 billion of outflows from the banking system is expected as a result of bdl providing the necessary amount of dollars for imports of wheat food fuel and medicine for the last three months of 2019 the transfers abroad that took place before the eruption of the protests and the ongoing cash withdrawals from banks ii pillars of reform the government should aim at restoring confidence through economic sustainability and balanced growth the strategy should be founded on three pillars 1 macroeconomic stabilization along with poverty reduction this includes large reduction of the fiscal deficit over the coming three and a half years from the second half of 2020 till the end of 2023 through an effort to mobilize revenue that will generate 3 4 percentage points of gdp in gross additional tax revenue by end 2023 it will be 1 2 percent on a net basis due to the privatization of telecoms in 2021 and a strategy for cost recovery in electricité du liban edl monetary policy that will continue to aim at preserving the exchange rate peg for the moment as it is an anchor for confidence and the negative impact from floating the lira outweighs its positive impact on competitiveness and on the reduction of the current account deficit monetary policy that will try to reach an inflation objective of 4 percent or less in order to help in shoring up confidence and increasing social and development spending to protect the most vulnerable 2 structural reforms with improved transparency and governance to strengthen public enterprises and institutions and to foster higher economic growth this will include improving public financial management through better collection and better control of tax evasion to achieve more fiscal discipline and greater budgetary transparency reforming edl and the tariff structure to ensure a balanced budget for the energy sector and better services modernizing and corporatizing all the enterprises owned by the government in order to prepare them for privatization strengthening anti corruption agencies such as the central inspection authority and the court of audit and improving the regulatory framework of investment and job creation 3 adequate new financing from the international community to support lebanon if such a program is adopted the government will be able to catalyze new external financing from governments and multilateral institutions which will help closing the financing gap and allow reforms to work iii macroeconomic framework in the near term economic activity is expected to remain subdued and 2019 will register a recession of 1 5 percent to 2 5 percent the high level of interest rates together with fiscal consolidation will constrain credit growth incomes and domestic demand in 2019 and the first half of 2020 a gradual increase in confidence as well as in public investment spending will offset some of the impact on the economy while targeted increases in social assistance will help offset most of the impact on the most vulnerable over the medium term real gdp growth is projected by blominvest to improve gradually to stand between 4 and 5 percent assuming reforms are being implemented at a steady pace as stabilization takes hold cedre projects will start to move along with higher private sector investment foreign direct investment fdi will also increase and credit to the private sector will spur domestic demand when the economy improves substantially the pegged exchange rate will have to move into a crawling peg as it was the case between 1994 and 1998 in line with economic fundamentals the latter along with structural reforms will increase the competitiveness of lebanese goods and services and will provide an additional boost to domestic production not only through expenditure switching but also through exports inflation is expected to increase in the short term and it already has due to the capital controls that are in place obliging companies to use the parallel market in order to get foreign currency for their imports inflation is expected to hit 5 to 6 percent by end 2019 and more than 10 percent in the first half of 2020 however an appropriate monetary policy in addition to confidence restoration will be able to bring inflation down to around 3 to 4 percent in the medium term the fiscal deficit is expected to decline in line with the adoption of several revenue expenditures and financing measures the deficit will go below 3 percent of gdp in two years time as the authorities broad based tax policy and administrative reforms take hold these measures will place general government debt on a declining path reaching 120 percent of gdp by fy 2024 after peaking at 155 percent of gdp in fy 2020 the current account deficit is expected to widen after narrowing to less than 10 percent of gdp on a year on year basis in the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 initially import demand will be contained by the capital control measures but then imports will increase again driven by more capital inflows and higher demand at the same time structural reforms should help a gradual export recovery underpinned by competitiveness gains from better infrastructure and new investment increasing remittances and fdi flows as well as multilateral and bilateral creditor financing will provide financing in the coming years iv fiscal policies the fiscal program should focus on putting the debt on a sustainable path by diminishing fiscal deficit on the back of strengthening revenue collection efforts and lowering spending while creating space to support social and development spending given lebanon s low tax ratio the fiscal program should be centered on administration reforms to increase revenue through better collection policies and well targeted increases in taxes while providing better services to citizens in order to raise the tax to gdp ratio by 3 to 4 percentage points by end 2023 however total revenue to gdp will end 2023 at 21 7 percent as privatization of the telecom companies will reduce short term income for the government in tandem with the privatization of telecoms government revenues will have to be increased in order to keep their ratio to gdp constant as there is around 1 7 percentage points of gdp that will be lost due to privatization expenditures will remain under control and as a result the primary surplus will increase from an estimated 0 3 percent of gdp in 2019 to 3 2 percent of gdp in 2023 the overall fiscal deficit will decrease from a projected 8 5 percent of gdp in 2019 to zero percent of gdp in 2023 moreover the government should stop accumulating any kind of arrears old arrears should be paid through the issuance of government treasury bills to concerned parties and new budgets will have to include better spending management and forecasting in order to avoid the accumulation of future arrears being able to increase government revenues to gdp ratio throughout the next four years is a great achievement for lebanon as tax evasion is large in lebanon it is not an automatic thing to assume an increase in tax revenues that match the increase in nominal gdp especially during high growth period coupled with an increase in gdp deflator a lot of collection effort is needed with some tax measures in order to have an increase in tax revenues that outperform the increase in nominal gdp the fy budget 2020 approved by the government and sent to parliament includes a 0 6 percent deficit without any tax adjustment however this low deficit is a one off due to the contribution of mainly bdl and to much lesser extent commercial banks through the provision of financing at 1 percent to the government the budgets for future years should include fiscal measures and a drastic reduction in edl deficit the most important issue is that the primary budget balance will turn into positive territories from 2021 onward if the government adopts the measures outlined in this paper an adjustment to the current version of 2020 budget has to be made the budget for 2020 comprises an increase in social safety nets spending the program for poverty reduction in coordination with the world bank has been expanded to include more families in need when the government starts the implementation of more fiscal measures an adjustment toward an increase should be considered for the most vulnerable in order to alleviate the impact of a restrictive fiscal policy a sustained effort over several years should be put in place aiming at revamping tax policy and tax administration with low tax compliance in lebanon tax evasion reaches around 2 5 percent of gdp and an estimated 30 percent of the gdp value is in the informal economy in addition to uncollected bills in the energy sector the potential improvement in tax revenues is huge and could reach 4 percentage points of gdp tax policy and tax administration measures should center on broadening the tax base while maintaining a low tax rate aiming to ensure progressiveness of the tax system tax policy reforms will help improve government revenues substantially in the near term measures include removing exemptions and preferential treatment to reduce distortions in the tax system and broaden the tax base these include the removal of vat exemptions except for basic foodstuffs a measure that will significantly improve revenues it is also important to put a floor on gasoline prices as these prices are the lowest when compared to similar non oil producing emerging markets in addition other tax policy measures include further strengthening taxation on real estate especially on high value properties and empty apartments increasing the taxes on the infringements on maritime properties and ensuring equivalent taxation of all sources of income in order to reduce the rentier behavior by investors tax administration reforms will strengthen tax collection ability over the medium term legal penalties for noncompliance should be increased but at the same time an american based way of settlement should be provided to companies companies should be able to negotiate with the higher judicial council to reduce the penalties rather than bribing the tax comptroller and banking secrecy has to be lifted on all employees at the ministry of finance measures to install e government at the ministry of finance should be accelerated a lot of work has already been done finally the government should stop granting further tax amnesties v public debt restructuring public debt restructuring is essential if lebanon wants to get out of the vicious cycle of debt and deficit and put the debt to gdp ratio on a sustainable path however it should not include a haircut on the principal of the debt restructuring the debt does not mean a haircut on the debt as it will de facto lead to a haircut on deposits even if it is the one held by the central bank only the idea of bdl writing off its holding of government debt in order to substantially reduce the stock of debt bdl holds close to 38 billion of treasury bills and eurobonds is not a viable option any decline of this magnitude in bdl assets will have to lead to a decline in its liabilities meaning a haircut on banks deposits at bdl which will result in banks having to do a haircut on their customers deposits restructuring of government debt has to entail lengthening the maturity of government debt while drastically reducing interest rates on the debt for the coming three years of course this decline will hit the banking system profits for the upcoming few years however it is the least painful compared to any other measure that will help getting out of the current crisis in our scenario we considered a decline in the effective interest rate on government debt to 1 percent in 2020 2 percent in 2021 and 3 percent in 2022 and 2023 interest rates will go back to market rate starting 2024 this decline in debt service will help the government reduce total deficit at a time when tax measures and expenditure tightening will help boosting the primary surplus in our scenario public debt to gdp ratio will decline from 154 7 percent at end 2019 to 113 7 percent at end 2023 vi social safety nets the social safety nets program put in place since 2007 is a good one and should be expanded with the help of the world bank to cover more families as unemployment has increased drastically following the syrian refugees crisis lebanon lags well behind peers and other emerging markets in poverty reduction and especially in inclusive growth with those living below the poverty line estimated at 33 percent of the population in 2018 programs targeting poor people in beirut and its suburbs should be put in place in addition to boosting agriculture and agroindustry in the rural areas to reduce the extreme poverty there and reduce urbanization the poverty reduction strategy should be aimed at reducing inequality and supporting the economic empowerment of women the ministry of social affairs is the responsible entity for coordinating social policies and will have to work with the ministry of agriculture the ministry of industry and international stakeholders to implement a comprehensive social policy the latter will have to include conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs creating cooperatives in rural areas encouraging farmers to join these cooperatives and providing technical assistance to these cooperatives as it will help increasing the negotiation power of farmers see box below on rural development if the government adopts tax measures other than the ones mentioned above it will have to boost its social assistance program by providing a one off disbursement of ll300 000 to the most vulnerable in order to protect them from the impact of tax policies if covering 40 000 families the projected cost would be 120 million strengthening financial inclusion by launching an initiative to reach the goal of having one bank account for every woman and boosting girls educational enrollment by providing grants to families enrolling their girls in schools as well as for boys from the most vulnerable parts of society and guarantee their participation in the labor force afterward conditional cash transfers as well as unconditional cash transfers are an effective way of reducing poverty out of 142 countries that distribute cash transfers according to a report compiled by the world bank 70 percent are implementing unconditional cash transfers and 40 percent went with conditional payments whereby recipients must fulfill certain criteria in order to get paid these criteria comprise among other things children s school attendance up to date vaccinations and regular visits to healthcare centers by pregnant women vi structural reforms structural reforms are essential in any government program to spur investment and job creation and reach balanced growth and human capital development the government will have to instill a policy to strengthen governance and transparency and an improved business environment in order for lebanon to realize its full economic potential lebanon ranked 143 out of 190 countries in the international finance corporation s doing business indicator for 2019 with lebanon s best ranking on the property registration sub indicator at 110 the major weaknesses are lengthy procedures in all sub indices and a major weakness in the implementation of the rule of law to enforce contracts the government has recently introduced a major overhaul to the code of commerce which constitutes a good step forward but not enough in the current circumstances in order to tackle the structural problems of the country it is important to analyze the size shape and responsibilities that we want the government to provide without having an ideological background on the type of government and society and it should not be taken as a taboo it is important to lessen the lebanese government s role to the maximum the issue is that we have to accept that we are living in a third world country and in these types of countries the rule of law and government management of public enterprises do encompass major inefficiencies due to political interference and impediments linked to cronyism if we were living in a scandinavian country or in france i would vote for a welfare state because the government is efficient and is providing its citizens with all the needed services at a very high quality by imposing high tax rates on their income moving from a third world country to a first world country does not happen overnight singapore had an benevolent dictator and it took the country 30 years to climb up the ladder when understanding the fact that fighting corruption and restoring the efficiency of the public sector is not an easy task we can accept to streamline the government and give the private sector a more important role while ensuring the right regulatory framework this is the ideal solution for lebanon in the current circumstances until we reach our target to become a developed country areas for structural reforms i energy sector the government has already prepared an ambitious plan to reform the energy sector aimed at addressing inefficiencies and eliminating losses in edl but this plan should be accelerated and a regulatory authority should be appointed as soon as possible structural weaknesses in the energy sector have remained unaddressed since 1993 and they include but are not limited to pricing policies technical and non technical losses and supply and demand management if the government delivers the improvements needed it can make lebanon s energy sector an engine of growth rather than a burden on the economy tariffs are below the production costs which are exorbitant as edl is using fuel to produce electricity hence indicating implicit subsidies provided by the government the latter has already started to address these shortcomings through the electricity plan that was set in motion with the help of the world bank structural milestones in the electricity plan should be put in a schedule with monthly updates to the public and to the council of ministers the plan has to include the steps to implement on different fronts in order to get to a 24 24 electricity by end 2020 or mid 2021 at the latest while having a profitable company edl should enter into a public private partnership in order to improve its management by bringing in a strategic investor on a revenue sharing basis the government should adopt a policy that protects to a certain degree low income households from an increase in energy prices the increase in tariffs for households consuming up to 200 kwh month has to be minimal if any compared to the increase for higher tranches manufacturing industries should also benefit from low tariffs to reduce their input costs in order to encourage exports the use of gas for producing electricity in the near future by using floating storage and regasification units fsrus will help solve this problem by reducing the cost of producing electricity edl will be able to reach its targets through a lower increase in tariffs ii education the lebanese government is spending large amounts of money on education without being able to provide its citizens with adequate quality the number of teachers in public schools is high and reaching alarming levels without providing the right quality of education to students overall pupil to teacher ratio stood at 7 1 in lebanon s public schools for lebanese students while it is at 21 1 in the private sector based on estimates by blominvest and the center for educational research and development public schooling embraces weak quality control and frail teaching that need to be reformed urgently restructuring the existing public schools is fundamental as many are non efficient and only increase education costs the repetition rates are much higher at public schools than in private schools and dropout rates are also important especially at the primary level lebanon needs to go for a twinning with a developed country like finland in order to put in place a model school however the government will continue to finance public schools as the country has failed to create a high educational level at public schools the government can turn to the best educational system in the world these days namely the finnish system a model school managed by the finnish or any other developed country system with excellent public education has to be shaped and all other public schools have to be benchmarked against this school if public schools are not capable of matching the level of this model school then the finnish will be given the opportunity to manage all the other public schools in this case the government will be paying for public education but it will be providing its citizens with an upgraded service that the users will surely appreciate last but not least the education system should be overhauled to fit the needs of the labor market education should start to be more focused on the knowledge economy and vocational education a partnership should start to emerge between the lebanese public education institutions and the stakeholders in the different lebanese sectors in order to cater the education toward the needs of the economy iii health on the health front the country will also have to turn to the private sector to manage public hospitals it has already been found that appointing boards to public hospitals was not enough to ensure a better performance especially given that most of the time the financing is not adequate treating public hospitals the same way the government is paying private hospitals is the only solution to improve public health services the government should provide the management of the public hospital to foreign entities from the developed world as public private partnerships with key performance indicators put in place to measure the performance of these entities turning to the private sector for management will help the government get out of the current high cost low quality of public hospitals healthcare expenditure reached 4 39 billion in 2018 representing 7 6 percent of lebanon s gdp in addition per capita spending on health was calculated at 640 high by regional standards government healthcare expenditure constituted 51 percent of the total or 4 1 percent of 2019 gdp with the private sector holding the remaining 49 percent share the market is forecast to grow by 4 5 percent in 2019 reaching 4 59 billion by 2023 spending on healthcare is expected to reach a value of 5 90 billion experiencing a local currency compound annual growth rate cagr of 6 1 percent in us dollar terms iv telecommunications the main issue in telecommunication sector is to set a medium term goal in order to put lebanon on the map of major advanced economies in the sector the goal will be to rank among the top three countries in the world having the fastest broadband fiber optics internet connection what is more important than having this connection is to widen it to cover the whole country and especially the rural areas it is important to reduce the cost of starting a business related to the knowledge economy by not having to incur the costs of implementing the business in beirut providing the right infrastructure for the skilled lebanese labor should be a top priority for the government the telecommunication sector still has a long way to go as the poor infrastructure of the sector keeps on hindering the quality and speed of internet connections even though fiber optics is already installed in big cities but not yet operational lebanon actually relies on copper cables to have access to the internet however these cables have limited capacity in terms of data transfer and speed based on the latest data released by akamai a global provider of content delivery network services the average connection speed in lebanon stood at 1 8 mbps in q2 2016 compared to 4 0 mbps in egypt and 4 3 mbps in jordan south korea topped the list with an average connection speed of 27 0 mbps and was trailed by japan 17 2 mbps and the united states 15 3 mbps it was also noticeable that while the global average connection speed grew by a yearly 14 percent in q2 2016 lebanon s slipped by 0 8 percent over the same period another major issue faced by the ict sector in lebanon is the lack of competitiveness due to the government s tight control over the sector despite the sequential declines in communication prices since 2014 the fact that both telecom companies alfa and touch are publicly owned entities operated by private companies for the benefit of the government creates a sort of duopoly agreement between the two companies according to world bank sources limited competition in telecommunications and broadband is stifling growth of the sector the fixed line and broadband market sees the dominant position of ogero while the mobile sector unlike most countries in the world is under the control of the government besides inhibiting growth and innovation government control is keeping tariffs high and limiting product differentiation according to arab advisors group lebanon ranked 17th in 2015 out of 19 arab countries in the cellular competition intensity index v fighting corruption and improving competition anti corruption has to be strengthened a coordination committee between the different institutions dealing with anti corruption has to be put in place all government employees and employees in government related institutions have to lift banking secrecy on their accounts in lebanon and abroad auditing of these accounts has to be performed by the committee and related agencies currently there is a competition law but there is no enforcement of the law especially on politically backed oligopolistic sectors a competition authority has to be created and will coordinate with the regulatory authorities in different sectors the lebanese industrial or agroindustrial private sector has to be protected against unlawful competition this competition is harming the local productive sector through under invoicing of imports especially from turkey and china besides these countries the government may also provide protection for domestic producers against competition from other countries however a different approach to customs has to be adopted both ministries of industry and economy have to identify the domestic sectors that should be given some protection and will have to look into the details of which domestic products are being at risk in order to take the right decision a case in point for showing the right way of protecting domestic products will be the wine industry the protection of domestic wine should not entail increasing custom duties by an ad hoc percentage on all imported wine rather it should put a minimum tax of 10 dollars on any imported bottle of wine as price of lebanese wine in lebanon varies between 5 and 50 dollars per bottle it is the low cost of imported wine that is causing the most harm to domestic wines a percentage increase of the customs duties on imported wine will not serve the purpose a minimum charge in this case is the solution this scenario is applicable to all cheap imported liquors the judicial system has to become independent the government has to pass a law to provide independence to the judicial system the supreme judicial council has to be elected by the judges at the same time banking secrecy has to be lifted on judges in order to be able to fight corruption in the judicial body vi privatization the government has to initiate the privatization process of the telecom companies the higher council for privatization and ppp hcp will have to coordinate with the telecom regulatory authority tra which has to be appointed as soon as possible in order to prepare for the privatization of the two telecom companies the best privatization strategy will have to bring in both citizens and strategic investors along with the government it will serve three purposes to develop capital markets to give ordinary people a stake in the company to be privatized and to ensure better management and higher future profits by bringing in a strategic investor this strategy is based on the fact that the government will do an initial public offering ipo for a certain percentage of the company open to the public people will get a share of the profits while the strategic investor and the government will divide the remaining share the government will continue to collect the taxes on the sector and will keep a share in the company however it will be a minority share saying that the government should not privatize companies that are providing large profits to the treasury is not an accurate statement the privatization of the telecom companies will help reduce government debt by more than 6 billion in one shot in our scenario the privatization of the two mobile companies will take place in 2021 in addition to the fact that it will enhance the management and will reduce political interference services will improve and prices may decline while key performance indicators will be set for the companies to implement government strategy mentioned above in the telecom sector vii other structural reforms the other structural reforms that the government will have to undertake are summarized below and will entail improving the management of public enterprises by strengthening their governance transparency and efficiency in order to prepare these entities to get in a partnership with the private sector increasing transparency in all public enterprises or semi independent public institutions there should be an external audit for all the institutions that were not previously under the umbrella of the court of audit even those that have to be liquidated council of the south council for reconstruction and development the displaced funds casino du liban middle east airlines electricité du liban etc all public enterprises that will remain in the hands of the government and will not be privatized will have to go under the supervision of the court of audit provide a better legal framework for public enterprises to simplify the process of privatization the authorities will have to present to parliament the necessary laws in one year s time that will modernize and clearly define the role of the government as owner regulator and shareholder of these public enterprises issue implementation decrees for passed laws there are a large number of laws approved by parliament for which the government has not yet issued implementation decrees some of these laws have been passed by parliament years ago and yet implementation decrees have not been issued rendering them inapplicable this includes laws such as the trade law and the government must set a time frame that will not exceed six months in order to issue the implementation decrees for all approved laws improve the business environment trading across borders has to be improved while fighting corruption modernizing the processes for imports and exports related activities is crucial to shorten the time needed and to reduce bribery and tax evasion this will include reducing custom related processing time and reducing hours to prepare import export documents in order to be in line with one stop customs portal promoted by the un enforcing contracts time has to be shortened currently the rule of law is not well enforced and when it is the time needed is 720 days the amount recuperated is 31 percent of the claimed value and the judicial processes remain archaic most of the time procedures to start a business must be streamlined the government should move forward in simplifying procedures by adopting e registration and streamlining the required documentation as it needs currently 15 days eight procedures and costs 42 percent of income per capita to start a business the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author s and do not necessarily reflect the editorial views of executive magazine
rupee firms up 2 paisa against dollar in interbank business rupee firms up 2 paisa against dollar in interbank yesterday the local currency recovered by 20 paisa against the greenback 03 december 2019 10 38 am karachi dunya news the pakistani rupee on tuesday further appreciated against the u s dollar in the interbank market by two paisa and hit rs155 25 yesterday the local currency recovered by 20 paisa against the greenback importantly moody s investors service moody s has affirmed pakistan s local and foreign currency long term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings at b3 and changed the outlook to stable from negative according to a report issued by the bond credit rating business of moody s corporation the change in outlook to stable is driven by moody s expectations that the balance of payments dynamics will continue to improve supported by policy adjustments and currency flexibility it further stated such developments reduce external vulnerability risks although foreign exchange reserve buffers remain low and will take time to rebuild moreover while fiscal strength has weakened with higher debt levels largely as a result of currency depreciation ongoing fiscal reforms including through the country s international monetary fund imf programme will mitigate risks related to debt sustainability and government liquidity the rating affirmation reflects pakistan s relatively large economy and robust long term growth potential coupled with ongoing institutional enhancements that raise policy credibility and effectiveness albeit from a low starting point these credit strengths are balanced against structural constraints to economic and export competitiveness the government s low revenue generation capacity that weakens debt affordability fiscal strength that will remain weak over the foreseeable future as well as political and still material external vulnerability risks it added moody s has affirmed the b3 foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for the second pakistan int l sukuk co ltd and the third pakistan international sukuk co ltd the associated payment obligations are in moody s view direct obligations of the government of pakistan pakistan s ba3 local currency bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged the b2 foreign currency bond ceiling and the caa1 foreign currency deposit ceiling are also unchanged the short term foreign currency bond and deposit ceilings remain unchanged at not prime these ceilings act as a cap on the ratings that can be assigned to the obligations of other entities domiciled in the country it further mentioned the report further outlined that narrowing current account deficits in combination with enhancements to the policy framework including currency flexibility lower external vulnerability risks in pakistan however foreign exchange reserve adequacy will take time to rebuild moody s expects pakistan s current account deficit cad to continue narrowing in the current and next fiscal year ending june of each year averaging around 2 2 of gdp from more than 6 in fiscal 2018 the year ending june 2018 and around 5 in fiscal 2019 moody s expects policy enhancements including strengthened central bank independence and the commitment to currency flexibility to support the reduction in external vulnerability risks in particular the government is planning to introduce a new state bank of pakistan sbp act to forbid central bank financing of government debt and clarify sbp s primary objective of price stability the imf programme which commenced in july 2019 targets higher foreign exchange reserve levels and has unlocked significant external funding from multilateral partners including the asian development bank and the world bank nevertheless unless the government can effectively mobilise private sector resources foreign exchange reserves are unlikely to increase substantially from current levels earlier the world bank group had forecasted pakistan s economic growth to slow down for the next two years as it continues to face another macroeconomic crisis due to massive twin deficits and low foreign reserves besides several analysts had expressed fear that the intense ongoing trade war between the united states and china would result in fluctuation of the u s dollar in the local market and the value of the pakistani rupee would stabilise depending on the measures taken by the government with appropriate economic policies currency traders were of the view that the increasing inflows of remittance have supported the local rupee in the market until june this year the rupee was observed to cumulatively depreciate against the greenback which in turn had resulted in increased prices of goods and hardships for the general public the sbp has let the rupee depreciate significantly in the inter bank market after finalising an agreement with the imf for a loan programme on may 12 the imf asked pakistan to end state control of the rupee and let the currency move freely to find its equilibrium against the us dollar on the other hand the world bank group has also supported the idea of leaving the rupee free from state control in an attempt to give much needed boost to exports and fix a faltering economy after the imf lent the first tranche of 991 4 million to pakistan the local currency had depreciated massively the stringent conditions on which the global moneylender has formally approved the bailout package of 6 billion for pakistan seemed to have exerted more pressure on the local currency the gradual drop in the rupee had come due to high demand for the dollar against thin supply as the country continued to make aggressive international payments to partially pay off huge foreign debt and for imports economists were of the view that effective measures must be implemented on the priority basis to recover the state from the balance of payment deficit
in 2018 latin america experienced a combination of domestic and external challenges that led to an uptick in defaults among companies rated by s p global ratings credit conditions became less accommodative for the region as trade tensions continued interest rate hikes in the u s and commodity price trends weighed on investors decisions and as political challenges a perennial risk seemed to ramp up while some of these challenges have subsided this year conditions are likely to remain volatile over the next few years financing conditions have grown more accommodative through looser central bank policies and guidance but this has been counterbalanced by the expectation of weaker economic growth which has guided central bank policy in the first place increasing investors selectivity and growing aversion to risk assets the effect on financing costs has posed a key risk for credit deterioration so far in 2019 in the region corporate defaults in latin america doubled to six in 2018 from three in 2017 making up 7 of the 82 defaults globally three of the six defaults in the region were from brazil the sovereign was downgraded in early 2018 due to slower than expected progress in putting in place meaningful legislation to correct structural fiscal slippage and rising debt levels see brazil long term ratings lowered to bb on less timely and effective policymaking outlook is stable jan 11 2018 all six latin american defaults in 2018 were due to missed interest or principal payments by debt amount the default of the brazil based engineering and construction company odebrecht engenharia e construcao s a on nov 26 2018 was the largest corporate default in latin america at about 4 1 billion of rated debt outstanding at the time of default s p global ratings downgraded the issuer to d following the company s announcement that odebrecht finance ltd would not make the 11 5 million interest payment related to its 2025 notes see odebrecht engenharia e construcao s a downgraded to d from cc on missed interest payments nov 26 2018 so far in 2019 four companies have defaulted in latin america as of sept 30 2019 the 12 month trailing speculative grade default rate for the latin america region remains relatively low at 1 23 compared to 1 93 at this point last year and 2 29 globally however the region s tally of weakest links defined as issuers rated b or lower with negative outlooks or ratings on creditwatch with negative implications has increased year over year to 28 11 of the global total from 10 only 5 see weakest links reach a 10 year high oct 17 2019 default rates among weakest links have been eight times higher than default rates in the broader speculative grade segment rated bb or lower over the past decade so the higher number of weakest links signals a broad expectation for increasing defaults in the region moving into 2020 as in our global default study this study of rated latin american issuers showed that s p global ratings credit ratings are effective indicators of relative credit risk s p global ratings research has found a clear negative correspondence between ratings and defaults the higher the issuer rating the lower the observed default frequency we use gini coefficients to measure the correspondence between ratings and defaults gini ratios measure the rank ordering power of ratings over a given time horizon and compare actual rank ordering performance with theoretically perfect rank ordering if corporate ratings were perfectly rank ordered so that all defaults occurred only among the lowest rated issuers the gini coefficient would be 100 for more details on the gini methodology see appendix ii chart 1 main observations in 2018 latin america s annual speculative grade default rate increased to 1 52 as of dec 31 2018 from 0 90 as of dec 31 2017 while the global speculative grade default rate decreased to 2 09 from 2 46 globally the latin american region experienced the largest regional increase in the number of downgrades in 2018 by proportion indeed the downgrade ratio defined as the total number of downgrades divided by upgrades was the highest since 2009 at 2 9 see table 4 corporate downgrades in brazil and argentina more than doubled the negative bias the proportion of issuers with negative outlooks or ratings on creditwatch with negative implications and a forward looking indicator of potential credit deterioration in latin america dropped considerably to 18 from 30 in this same period while credit deterioration was elevated the decrease in negative bias indicated that the downgrade trend would likely ease the average time to default the average number of years elapsed between initial rating and default for latin america s six rated defaults was 7 68 years which is higher than the global average of 5 84 years for all 2018 defaulters in contrast the 1997 2018 long term average time to default for all latin american defaulters was 4 20 years while the average for all global defaulters from 1981 2018 was 5 80 years the shorter time to default may be attributable to the smaller number of data points in latin america as well as the region s higher number of speculative grade issuers as compared with the global pool s p global ratings assigned ratings to 48 new latin american issuers in 2018 down from 54 new issuers in 2017 these new ratings may include issuers that emerged from distressed exchanges and other defaults of the 48 newly rated issuers 40 83 were rated speculative grade issuer credit ratings in the region are largely speculative grade of all 504 actively rated latin american issuers with global scale ratings at the end of 2018 s p global ratings rated 66 speculative grade compared with about 50 for all global issuers and 52 for all emerging market issuers the largest percentage of latin american rated issuers are in the bb rating category see chart 3 the one year weighted average gini coefficient for rated latin american corporate issuers was 75 69 1997 2018 compared with 74 96 in 2017 this metric is based on ratings one year prior to default rather than ratings immediately preceding default the weighted averages in this report use the issuer counts at the beginning of the year as the weights the aerospace auto capital goods metals consumer service and transportation sectors had the highest default rates in latin america in 2018 at 6 90 3 33 and 2 78 respectively of the six latin american defaults one was from the utility sector chart 2 latin america faced numerous challenges to creditworthiness in 2018 political challenges remained despite end to heavy election cycle several important political developments emerged in latin america in 2018 particularly for the region s largest economies the election of right wing jair bolsonaro as brazil s president was initially received well by financial markets but given the polarized state of the brazilian congress passing reforms to tackle the country s high debt burden and fiscal challenges still seemed challenging in mexico a series of controversial announcements made by newly elected president andrés manuel lópez obrador including the cancellation of the new airport outside mexico city and a shift in energy policy increased uncertainty over policy direction meanwhile for argentina changes in the monetary and fiscal framework as part of an assistance package which were aimed at stabilizing investor confidence in the economy kept the economy in recession in 2018 see latin american economies will face another challenging year in 2019 nov 30 2018 financing conditions have somewhat eased so far in 2019 driven by the federal reserve s and european central bank s interest rate cuts amid weakening global growth however the appetite for lower rated issuers remains limited see policy uncertainty undermines growth prospects oct 1 2019 and emerging markets risk monitor growth weakens uncertainty intensifies oct 24 2019 a strengthening u s dollar and rising debt a stronger u s dollar in 2018 resulted in sharp deterioration in investor sentiment toward emerging markets though this has eased somewhat in 2019 especially those with large external financing needs such as argentina one factor behind the appreciation of the dollar among others was a repricing of u s monetary policy toward a faster interest rate hike cycle at that time evident in the relatively aggressive increase of the short end of the u s treasury yield curve in early 2018 in the case of argentina and colombia government external debt has also increased substantially in recent years which is why pressure for fiscal tightening measures remained acute in those countries as the u s dollar strengthened and the fed stepped up its interest rate hikes see

american corporate speculative grade default rate exceeded the global default rate in only four years 1999 2002 2003 and 2012 the spike in the latin american corporate speculative grade default rate to 8 26 in 1999 was related to contagion from the asian financial crisis and the sovereign crisis in russia in 2002 the latin american corporate speculative grade default rate spiked to 31 33 the only time it rose to 10 or higher from 1997 2018 argentina which was in the midst of a depression accounted for the majority of the defaults that year periods of stress in the emerging markets region have been marked by political instability high external debt unsustainable financial policies such as high interest rates to maintain currency pegs heavy dependence on exports and unstable financial markets these factors led to financial uncertainty a loss of consumer confidence and the collapse of asset bubbles which hurt private consumption and investments and caused a spike in corporate defaults these trends were evident during the late 1990s and early 2000s in argentina economic growth was strong during most of the 1990s but a period of political uncertainty and gdp contraction followed from 1999 2002 moreover contagion from the russian crisis and the devaluation of the brazilian real resulted in a decline in argentine exports and a further weakening of confidence and domestic consumption s p global ratings lowered its sovereign credit rating on argentina seven times from 2000 2001 and the country selectively defaulted in 2001 taking a heavy toll on corporations based in argentina argentina s currency was steeply devalued as the country eliminated its peso to dollar peg instituted price controls froze local bank deposits and legally mandated the conversion of local debt contracts from dollar to peso terms at government specified exchange rates argentine corporate defaults totaled 18 in 2001 and 43 in 2002 these defaults were primarily in the financial institutions utilities and energy sectors latin american rating performance our annual study of corporate defaults in latin america identified a clear negative correspondence between ratings and defaults the higher the issuer rating the lower the observed default frequency see chart 4 chart 4 the one year weighted average gini coefficient for rated latin america based corporate issuers from 1997 2018 was 75 69 the three year was 50 79 and the five year was 40 42 for details on the gini methodology see appendix ii meanwhile the one year weighted average gini coefficient for all global corporate issuers since 1981 was 82 5 the three year was 75 17 and the five year was 71 49 the gini ratios for latin america are lower than their global counterparts because of the region s smaller number of rated issuers leading to a higher likelihood that outliers could be distorting the data from 1997 2018 185 companies defaulted in latin america a fraction of the 2 754 defaults recorded globally during the same period latin america s small sample size introduces some challenges in our analysis the average time to default for latin american defaults in 2018 was 7 68 years entities with higher ratings generally take a longer time to default though this is less evident in latin america because of the paucity of investment grade rated bbb or higher defaults see chart 5 for example latin american issuers rated b took an average of 3 21 years to default while bb rated issuers took 5 12 years the average times to default from original rating for latin american issuers are shorter across all rating categories than they are for the global pool this is true regardless of whether the times to default are calculated from the original rating see table 8 or from any subsequent ratings see table 9 this difference in the average timing and the associated standard deviation results partly from latin america s significantly smaller volume of defaults in every rating category for example 613 issuers in the bb category defaulted globally during the 38 years ended 2018 whereas the comparable number for latin america was only 185 defaults in the past 22 years which is the

behavior in latin america is consistent with global trends which have shown a negative correspondence between credit ratings and default probability investment grade issuers in latin america tend to exhibit greater credit stability as measured by the frequency of rating transitions than their speculative grade counterparts see table 11 for instance about 87 50 of issuers in latin america rated a as of jan 1 2018 were still rated a at the end of the year whereas the comparable metric for issuers rated b was only 70 48 caution must be used in interpreting the low stability rates associated with the ccc c rating category because of its small sample size table 11 one year 2018 corporate transition rates latin america versus global from to aaa aa a bbb bb b ccc c d nr latin america aaa 0 00 0

the latin american issuers rated aa from 1997 2018 about 83 33 retained this rating after one year whereas only 69 11 of issuers rated b maintained that rating during the same period see table 12 the difference between table 11 and table 12 is that table 11 shows rating transitions only for 2018 while table 12 shows the long term average from 1997 2018 the transition rates for latin america are also generally consistent with global patterns based on the transition analysis for a two year time horizon rather than a one year horizon lower ratings also tend to display less stability than higher ratings see table 13 rating transitions by modifier also display the same general relationship though differences in sample size occasionally create slight variations between adjacent rating

chart 6 no latin american issuers rated aaa aa a or bbb have ever defaulted on average from 1997 2018 bb rated latin american issuers had a 0 82 default rate in the first year after they were rated and a 2 63 default rate in the second issuers rated b had an average default rate of 4 19 in the first year and 8 75 in the second year after their initial rating the small number of issuers in our pool and the short period of our study limit our findings our 1997 2018 issuer ratings pool for latin america covers only 1 254 issuers compared with 20 518 issuers for our global study 1981 2018 and although this study covers the period from 1997 2018 more than 50 of the total latin american issuer ratings in our pool were assigned after 2005 this means that a significant portion of the pool isn t as mature as the global pool which leads to averages that are more heavily influenced by recent pools especially for longer time horizons table 15 comparison of corporate cumulative average default

ratios and lorenz curves a quantitative measure of ratings performance indicates that the relative rank ordering of latin american ratings is consistent across various time horizons to measure ratings performance or ratings accuracy we plotted the cumulative share of issuers by rating against the cumulative share of defaulters in a lorenz curve to render the accuracy of their rank ordering see charts 7 9 for definitions and methodology see appendix ii our calculations indicate that the weighted average one year gini coefficient is 75 69 the weighted average three year is 50 79 and the weighted average five year is 40 42 if corporate ratings only randomly approximated default risk the gini coefficient would be zero on the other hand if corporate ratings were perfectly rank ordered so that all defaults occurred only among the lowest rated issuers the lorenz curve would capture all of the area on the graph above the diagonal and its gini coefficient would be 100 we also examined the variations in gini coefficients by region see table 17 as expected the gini coefficients decline as the time horizon lengthens because longer time horizons allow for more credit degradation among higher rated issuers in the one year latin american lorenz curve for example 98 76 of defaults occurred in the speculative grade category while speculative grade ratings constituted only 65 21 of all latin american corporate issuers see chart 7 the five year lorenz curve shows that speculative grade issuers constituted 85 50 of defaulters and only 65 64 of the entire sample see chart 9 if the rank ordering of ratings had little predictive value the cumulative share of defaulting corporate issuers and the cumulative share of all issuers would be nearly the same table 17 corporate gini

of long term local currency issuer credit ratings most exhibits in this study are the direct output of the creditpro interface while others reflect manipulation of the underlying database we created charts 5 and 7 10 and tables 1 10 and 12 23 by manipulating the creditpro data an issuer credit rating reflects s p global ratings forward looking opinion of a company s overall creditworthiness this opinion focuses on the obligor s capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due it does not apply to any specific financial obligation because it does not take into account the nature and provisions of the obligation its standing in bankruptcy or liquidation statutory preferences or the legality and enforceability of the obligation it is not necessary for a company to have rated debt to have an issuer credit rating while an issue credit rating is an assessment of default risk it may also incorporate an assessment of the relative seniority or ultimate recovery of the issue in the event of default the junior obligations of a company are typically rated lower than the senior obligations to reflect their lower priority in bankruptcy and ultimate recovery expectations alternatively secured debt may be rated higher than the issuer credit rating notching also applies to the structural subordination of debt issued by operating subsidiaries or holding companies that are part of an enterprise that we view as a single economic entity our ongoing enhancement of the creditpro database used to generate this study could lead to outcomes that differ to some degree from those reported in previous studies however this poses no continuity problem because each study reports statistics going back to jan 1 1997 therefore each annual default

rating histories of 1 254 latin american companies rated by s p global ratings that had ratings between jan 1 1997 and dec 31 2018 these include industrials utilities financial institutions and insurance companies with global scale long term local currency ratings this analysis excludes public information pi ratings and ratings based on the guarantee of another company or government entity structured finance vehicles public sector issuers and sovereign issuers are the subjects of separate default and transition studies and are excluded from this study to avoid double counting the creditpro database excludes subsidiaries with debt that is fully guaranteed by a parent or with default risk that is considered identical to that of a parent the latter are companies with obligations that are not legally guaranteed by a parent but that have operating or financing activities that are so inextricably entwined with those of the parent that it would be impossible to imagine the default of one and not the other at times however some of these subsidiaries might not yet have been covered by a parent s guarantee or the relationship that combines the default risk of parent and subsidiary might have come to an end or might not have begun we included such subsidiaries for the period during which they had a distinct and separate risk of default issuers with withdrawn ratings s p global ratings withdraws ratings when an entity s entire debt is paid off or when the program or programs rated are terminated and the relevant debt extinguished for the purposes of this study a rating may be withdrawn as a result of a merger or acquisition others are withdrawn because of a lack of cooperation particularly when a company is experiencing financial difficulties and refuses to provide all the information needed to continue surveillance on the ratings or at the entity s request definition of default an obligor rated sd selective default or d default is in payment default on one or more of its financial obligations rated or unrated unless s p global ratings believes that such payments will be made within five business days irrespective of any grace period s p global ratings also lowers a rating to d when an issuer files for bankruptcy or takes a similar action that jeopardizes its payments on a financial obligation a d rating is assigned when s p global ratings believes that the default will be a general default and that the obligor will fail to pay all or substantially all of its obligations as they come due s p global assigns an sd rating when it believes that the obligor has selectively defaulted on a specific issue or class of obligations but will continue to meet its payment obligations on other issues or classes of obligations in a timely manner a selective default includes the completion of a distressed exchange offer whereby one or more financial obligations are either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par r regulatory intervention indicates that an obligor is under regulatory supervision owing to its financial condition this does not necessarily indicate a default event but the regulator might have the power to favor one class of obligations over another or pay some obligations and not others preferred stock is not considered a financial obligation and thus a missed preferred stock dividend is not normally equated with default we deem d sd and r issuer ratings to be defaults for the purposes of this study a default is assumed to take place on the earliest of the date s p global revised the rating s to d sd or r the date a debt payment was missed the date a distressed exchange offer was announced or the date the debtor filed for or was forced into bankruptcy when an issuer defaults it is not uncommon for s p global ratings to subsequently withdraw the d rating for the purposes of this study if an issuer defaults we end its rating history at d if any defaulting entity reemerges from bankruptcy or otherwise restructures its defaulted debt instruments thereby reestablishing regular timely payment of all its debts we reenter this issuer into the database as a new entity its rating history after the default event is included in all calculations as separate from its experience leading up to its earlier default many practitioners use statistics from this default study to estimate probability of default and probability of rating transition s p global ratings credit ratings do not imply a specific probability of default calculations static pool methodology s p global ratings research conducts its default studies on the basis of groupings called static pools for the purposes of this study we form static pools by grouping issuers by rating category at the beginning of each year covered by the study each static pool is followed from that point forward all companies included in the study are assigned to one or more static pools when an issuer defaults we assign that default back to all of the static pools to which the issuer belonged we use the static pool methodology to avoid certain pitfalls in estimating default rates this is to ensure that default rates account for rating migration and to allow for default rates to be calculated across multiperiod time horizons some methods for calculating default and rating transition rates might charge defaults against only the initial rating on the issuer ignoring more recent rating changes that supply more current information other methods calculate default rates using only the most recent year s default and rating data which might yield comparatively low default rates during periods of high rating activity because they ignore prior years default activity membership in static pools remains constant each static pool can be interpreted as a buy and hold portfolio because errors if any are corrected by every new update and because the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of companies in the default study are subject to minor revisions as time goes by it is not possible to compare static pools across different studies therefore every update revises results back to the starting date so as to avoid continuity problems issuers that have had ratings withdrawn that is revised to not rated nr are surveilled with the aim of capturing a potential default because static pools include only issuers with active ratings as of their beginning date we exclude companies with withdrawn ratings as well as those that have defaulted from subsequent static pools if an entity has its rating withdrawn after the start date of a particular static pool and subsequently defaults we will include it in that static pool as a default and categorize it in the rating category of which it was a member at that time for instance the 2001 static pool consists of all companies rated as of 12 01 a m on jan 1 2001 companies first rated in 2001 and surviving members of the 2001 static pool form the 2002 static pool all rating changes that took place are reflected in the newly formed 2002 static pool through these issuer ratings as of 12 01 a m on jan 1 2002 consider the following example an issuer is originally rated bb in mid 2000 and s p global ratings downgrades the company to b in 2002 this is followed by a rating withdrawal in 2003 and a default in 2004 we would include this hypothetical company in the 2001 and 2002 pools with the bb rating which was the rating at the beginning of those years likewise we would include it in the 2003 pool with the b rating it would not be part of the 2004 pool because it was not rated as of the first day of that year and we would not include it in any pool after the last day of 2004 because s p global ratings had withdrawn its rating on the company by then yet each of the three pools in which this company was included 2001 2003 would record its 2004 default at the appropriate time horizon default rates we calculated annual default rates for each static pool first in units and later as percentages with respect to the number of issuers in each rating category we combined these percentages to obtain cumulative default rates for the 22 years the study covers issuer weighted default rates all default rates that appear in this study are based on the number of issuers rather than the dollar amounts affected by defaults or rating changes although dollar amounts provide information about the portion of the market that is affected by defaults or rating changes issuer weighted averages are a more useful measure of the performance of ratings average cumulative default rate calculation the cumulative default rates in this study average the experience of all static pools by first calculating marginal default rates for each possible time horizon and for each static pool weight averaging the marginal default rates conditional on survival survivors being nondefaulters and accumulating the average conditional marginal default rates we calculated conditional default rates by dividing the number of issuers in a static pool that default at a specific time horizon by the number of issuers that survived did not default to that point in time weights are based on the number of issuers in each static pool cumulative default rates are one minus the product of the proportion of survivors nondefaulters transition analysis transition rates compare issuer ratings at the beginning of a period with ratings at the end of the period to compute one year rating transition rates by rating category we compared the rating on each entity at the end of a particular year with the rating at the beginning of the same year an issuer that remained rated for more than one year was counted as many times as the number of years it was rated for instance an issuer continually rated from the middle of 1984 to the middle of 1991 would appear in the seven consecutive one year transition matrices from 1985 1991 if the rating on the issuer was withdrawn in the middle of 1991 it would be included in the column representing transitions to nr in the 1991 transition matrix similarly if it defaulted in the middle of 1991 it would be included in the column representing transitions to d in the 1991 one year transition matrix all 1981 static pool members still rated on jan 1 2018 had 38 one year transitions while companies first rated on jan 1 2018 had only one each one year transition matrix displays all rating movements between letter categories from the beginning of the year through year end for each rating listed in the matrix s leftmost column there are nine ratios listed in the rows corresponding to the ratings from aaa to d plus an entry for nr the only ratings considered in these calculations are those on issuers at the beginning of each static pool and those at the end all rating changes that occur in between are ignored for example if an entity was rated a on jan 1 2018 and the rating was lowered to bbb in the middle of the year and later raised to a with no other subsequent rating changes this entity would be included only in the percentage of issuers that began the year as a and ended the year as a this also applies to transition matrices that span longer time horizons if an issuer defaults or if the rating is withdrawn in the middle of the year then the issuer would be considered not rated or rated d on dec 31 multiyear transitions multiyear transitions were also calculated for periods of two to five years in this case we compared the rating at the beginning of the multiyear period with the rating at the end for example three year transition matrices were the result of comparing ratings at the beginning of the years 1997 2016 with the ratings at the end of the years 1999 2018 otherwise the methodology was identical to that used for single year transitions we calculated average transition matrices on the basis of the multiyear matrices just described these average matrices are a true summary the ratios of which represent the historical incidence of the ratings listed in the first column changing to the ones listed in the top row over the course of the multiyear period transition matrices that present averages over multiple time horizons are also calculated as issuer weighted averages rating modifiers we use rating modifiers plus and minus signs to calculate upgrade and downgrade percentages as well as the magnitude of rating changes throughout this study however some transition tables may use full rating categories for practical reasons in other words the use of a rating category suggests that transitions to for example aa from aa or to bbb from bbb are not considered to be rating transitions because the rating remained within the rating category standard deviations many of the tables and charts in this study display averages of default rates transition rates and gini ratios often these are issuer weighted averages prior studies have shown that fluctuations within default rates and transitions can vary greatly depending on many circumstances specific to particular time frames industries and geographic regions as a supplement to many of the averages and time series presented in this study standard deviations are also shown to provide a gauge of the dispersion of data behind these averages for the transition matrices the standard deviation for each cell in a given matrix is a weighted standard deviation calculated using the data from each of the underlying cohort years that contribute to the averages weighted by that cohort year s issuer base for each rating level for example in the average one year transition matrix each cell s weighted standard deviation is calculated from the series of that particular cell in each of the 22 cohorts beginning with the 1997 cohort and ending with the 2018 cohort the squared difference between each cohort s transition rate and the weighted average which is the data point in each cell is multiplied by each cohort s weight these weights are based on the contribution of each cohort s rating level to the 22 year total issuer base for each rating level we then divide this by the ratio of the total number of nonzero weights minus one and the total number of nonzero weights the standard deviations of gini ratios are derived from the time series for all of their constituent annual cohorts as an example the standard deviation applied to the seven year weighted average global gini ratio was calculated from the time series of all available seven year gini ratios by cohort in this case these are the seven year gini ratios beginning with the 1997 cohort through the 2012 seven year cohort we calculated standard deviations for gini ratios in this study as the standard deviations of a sample not those of a population time sample this update limits the reporting of default rates to the 10 year time horizon however the latin america data were gathered for 22 years and all calculations are based on the rating experience of that period in addition average default statistics become less reliable at longer time horizons as the sample size becomes smaller and the cyclical nature of default rates has a bigger effect on averages additional tables table 18 static pool cumulative corporate default rates among all latin

issuers by rating against the cumulative share of defaulters in a lorenz curve to visually render the accuracy of their rank ordering max o lorenz developed the lorenz curve as a graphical representation of the proportionality of a distribution to build the lorenz curve we order the observations from the low end of the ratings scale ccc c to the high end aaa if s p global ratings corporate ratings only randomly approximated default risk the lorenz curve would fall along the diagonal and its gini coefficient which is a summary statistic of the lorenz curve would be zero if corporate ratings were perfectly rank ordered so that all defaults occurred only among the lowest rated issuers the curve would capture all of the area above the diagonal on the graph and its gini coefficient would be 100 see chart 10 we calculate gini coefficients by dividing area b by the total area a plus area b in other words the gini coefficient captures the extent to which actual ratings accuracy diverges from the random scenario and aspires to the ideal scenario chart 10 appendix iii defaults in profile in 2018 six latin american companies including three confidentially rated

slows globalization peaks and business as usual investing comes to an end new york key drivers of this year s late cycle bull market gains are expected to shift as the global markets enter the new year according to bofa merrill lynch global research which was recently named institutional investor s top research firm in the world in its year ahead outlook the research team forecasts a bottoming of economic growth in the spring as trade war tensions ease and relatively low recession risk key highlights include stocks are expected to outperform bonds handily in 2020 as the global economy bottoms out in the first quarter while monetary policy remains accommodative the conventional idea of allocating 60 percent to equities and 40 percent to bonds is unlikely to survive into the 2020s an interim skinny u s china trade deal should temporarily relieve trade concerns ahead of the u s presidential election and pave the way for a midyear mini boost in global growth led by u s rates and a weaker dollar a rebound in u s corporate earnings should spur a long awaited uptick in capital spending and lift the s p 500 to another year end high of 3300 or 6 percent above current levels in a reversal of trend u s stock returns are expected to lag gains forecast for europe and emerging market stocks next year the potential for 6 percent total returns on high grade bonds next year makes u s corporate credit particularly attractive in a world facing 12 trillion of negative yielding debt inflows from foreign investors are expected to remain strong supported by favorable spreads but today s bond market bubble could become the markets biggest vulnerability the new year and decade begin near the tail end of the longest bull market on record and despite recent strong gains investor anxiety remains at a high level said candace browning head of bofa merrill lynch global research many of the driving factors central bank policy globalization oil have peaked and new economic paradigms are emerging in response to a different set of challenges facing the world s social environment political and economic systems rather than focusing on the downside we think the opportunity for investors will be found in what happens next at the annual bank of america merrill lynch year ahead outlook presentation today in new york city the firm s top strategists and economists discussed the overarching themes that are transforming economies and investing paradigms in the year ahead and throughout the 2020s notable among these is the transition to stronger local and regional economic ties following three decades of economic growth fueled by the benefits of globalization an unchecked cross border free flow of goods people and capital that rewarded cheap labor and low consumer prices the shift from globalization to localization and other global macro trends underpins much of bank of america merrill lynch s outlook on the markets and economy next year key macro calls made for the markets and economy in the year ahead are slowing global growth global gdp is forecast to slow from 3 8 percent in 2018 to just over 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 europe should stabilize at around 1 percent while a below consensus call on china assumes growth slowing from 6 1 percent to 5 6 percent inflation is likely to inch lower from 3 1 percent this year to 2 7 percent by 2021 while policy rates remain flat and fiscal policy stays frozen u s economic slowdown despite strong fundamentals u s gdp is expected to slow to trend with growth averaging 1 7 percent over the next two years on the positive side inflation should be muted with core pce inflation at around 2 percent by the end of 2020 the federal reserve is not expected to take further rate action for the foreseeable future unless a material shift in outlook triggers such a move given the fed s focus on avoiding a recession the risk of further cutting outweighs hikes modest gains in u s stocks with greater upside outside u s s p earnings per share are forecast to grow 8 percent to 177 at year end and returns will likely be driven solely by corporate earnings vs price to earnings multiple expansions emerging markets and europe could offer more upside in 2020 crowded positioning in the u s vs the rest of the world and estimate revisions abroad outpacing those in the u s support a rotation into global equities three significant tactical rotations call for allocation shifts from growth to value from large cap to small cap and from the u s to the rest of the world rates on pause as support from monetary policy wanes u s rates are expected to lead the way in 2020 with downside risks somewhat diminished and higher repricing likely ten year rates are expected to move from 2 percent at the end of 2019 to 1 8 percent in 2020 the yield curve remains vulnerable to a paring back of fed easing expectations in the near term while the swap curve is expected to flatten fed actions freed other central banks to ease and with the exception of china many are also expected to put rate actions on hold next year credit cycle rolls on despite weaker global growth u s investment grade corporate earnings growth of 9 percent is expected up from 1 percent in 2019 with spreads tightening by 10 basis points and total returns of 4 to 6 percent gross issuance will likely be down 4 percent to 1 137 trillion with net issuance declining 21 percent to 399 billion in 2020 the 11 year high yield credit cycle is expected to keep on rolling though earnings will be the biggest risk default rates should stabilize at 4 percent next year as spreads gravitate to 450 basis points key tactical rotations call for smaller over larger issuers longer over shorter spread duration and more cyclical sectors emerging markets recovery contingent on trade the outcome of the u s china trade war is crucial to the outlook for emerging markets in 2020 total emerging market returns of 7 1 percent in local debt are forecast but only 2 6 percent for external debt latin america is mounting a cyclical recovery likely led by brazil and andrean economies while argentina s new government faces extreme economic challenges idiosyncratic factors will dominate in emerging emea with egyptian and russian local markets and kenyan and nigerian external debt favored weakening dollar the u s dollar is expected to weaken in 2020 with diminishing policy uncertainty the euro and sterling also should benefit from a resolution of brexit uncertainty with eur usd and gbp usd rising to 1 15 and 1 39 respectively stronger global growth and a weaker dollar will help support emerging markets usd jpy is expected to decline to 103 while aud jpy and asean fx should appreciate sharply on global reflation modest growth in

revised data shows mexico s economy contracted by about 0 1 for three straight quarters before remaining static in the third trimester of 2019 mexico s economic slowdown is unusual because the u s economy is still growing the last mexican economic recession that was not accompanied by a u s slowdown took place in the 1990s during the so called tequila crisis notes bank of america the mexican peso tanked against the u s dollar during that crisis thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe the mexican and the u s economies have historically grown or declined in tandem but not this year revised data released monday by mexico s national institute of statistics and geography showed the country s economy contracted by about 0 1 for three straight quarters before flat lining in the third trimester of 2019 bank of america merrill lynch economist carlos capistran referred to that economic slump as a technical recession mexico s economic slowdown is unusual because the u s economy is still growing the last mexican economic recession that was not accompanied by a u s slowdown took place in the 1990s during the so called tequila crisis capistran points out the tequila crisis refers to a collapse in the mexican peso against the dollar sparked by a violent uprising in southern mexico and the assassination of a presidential candidate in 1994 those events increased the risk premium on mexican assets including the peso and weighed on the country s economy the mexican recession comes amid uncertainty around the u s mexico canada trade agreement which has shaken sentiment in latin america s second largest economy the balance sheets of business and consumers do not seem to be under strain yet capistran said in a note monday so in our view the technical recession was likely triggered by a large confidence shock congress has yet to ratify the usmca deal that was signed by president donald trump last year that deal is meant to replace the north american free trade agreement which president donald trump has called the worst deal ever trump has tried to pressure congress to approve the usmca on monday he tweeted democrats should get down to work and finally approve usmca and much more house speaker nancy pelosi said monday that the usmca deal signed by trump last year left american workers exposed to losing their jobs to mexico included unacceptable provisions to lock in high prescription drug prices and fell short of key environmental standards she noted however that house democrats were within range of reaching a deal on the matter trade with the u s is critical for the mexican economy last year mexico exported 265 billion in goods to the u s and imported 346 5 billion according to data from the u s trade representative s office president andres manuel lopez obrador s administration has also curbed government spending to build the country s budget surplus meanwhile the bank of mexico has the country s overnight interest rate at 7 5 well above the rates seen in the u s these issues weighed on mexican stocks this year the mexico s p bmv ipc index is up just 3 3 in 2019 that s well below the ishares msci acwi exchange traded fund which tracks global stocks which is up more than 20 year to date to be sure central bank rates are expected to fall from current levels also the amlo administration unveiled tuesday a 44 billion infrastructure plan it expects will bring annual economic growth of more than 4 but bank of america s capistran still thinks the risks to the mexican economy remain tilted to the downside the risk in our view is that the administration or banxico try to pursue counter cyclical policies in an isolated manner which could end in fiscal deterioration un anchoring of inflation expectations and a large depreciation he said another risk is that the administration moves further toward populist measures seeking to reactivate growth and to redistribute to the poor but without consideration of inter temporal budget and external constraints subscribe to cnbc on youtube
bank of america merrill lynch 2020 market outlook profits rise economy slows globalization peaks and business as usual investing comes to an end tweet key drivers of this year s late cycle bull market gains are expected to shift as the global markets enter the new year according to bofa merrill lynch global research which was recently named institutional investor s top research firm in the world in its year ahead outlook the research team forecasts a bottoming of economic growth in the spring as trade war tensions ease and relatively low recession risk key highlights include stocks are expected to outperform bonds handily in 2020 as the global economy bottoms out in the first quarter while monetary policy remains accommodative the conventional idea of allocating 60 percent to equities and 40 percent to bonds is unlikely to survive into the 2020s an interim skinny u s china trade deal should temporarily relieve trade concerns ahead of the u s presidential election and pave the way for a midyear mini boost in global growth led by u s rates and a weaker dollar a rebound in u s corporate earnings should spur a long awaited uptick in capital spending and lift the s p 500 to another year end high of 3300 or 6 percent above current levels in a reversal of trend u s stock returns are expected to lag gains forecast for europe and emerging market stocks next year the potential for 6 percent total returns on high grade bonds next year makes u s corporate credit particularly attractive in a world facing 12 trillion of negative yielding debt inflows from foreign investors are expected to remain strong supported by favorable spreads but today s bond market bubble could become the markets biggest vulnerability the new year and decade begin near the tail end of the longest bull market on record and despite recent strong gains investor anxiety remains at a high level said candace browning head of bofa merrill lynch global research many of the driving factors central bank policy globalization oil have peaked and new economic paradigms are emerging in response to a different set of challenges facing the world s social environment political and economic systems rather than focusing on the downside we think the opportunity for investors will be found in what happens next at the annual bank of america merrill lynch year ahead outlook presentation today in new york city the firm s top strategists and economists discussed the overarching themes that are transforming economies and investing paradigms in the year ahead and throughout the 2020s notable among these is the transition to stronger local and regional economic ties following three decades of economic growth fueled by the benefits of globalization an unchecked cross border free flow of goods people and capital that rewarded cheap labor and low consumer prices the shift from globalization to localization and other global macro trends underpins much of bank of america merrill lynch s outlook on the markets and economy next year key macro calls made for the markets and economy in the year ahead are slowing global growth global gdp is forecast to slow from 3 8 percent in 2018 to just over 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 europe should stabilize at around 1 percent while a below consensus call on china assumes growth slowing from 6 1 percent to 5 6 percent inflation is likely to inch lower from 3 1 percent this year to 2 7 percent by 2021 while policy rates remain flat and fiscal policy stays frozen u s economic slowdown despite strong fundamentals u s gdp is expected to slow to trend with growth averaging 1 7 percent over the next two years on the positive side inflation should be muted with core pce inflation at around 2 percent by the end of 2020 the federal reserve is not expected to take further rate action for the foreseeable future unless a material shift in outlook triggers such a move given the fed s focus on avoiding a recession the risk of further cutting outweighs hikes modest gains in u s stocks with greater upside outside u s s p earnings per share are forecast to grow 8 percent to 177 at year end and returns will likely be driven solely by corporate earnings vs price to earnings multiple expansions emerging markets and europe could offer more upside in 2020 crowded positioning in the u s vs the rest of the world and estimate revisions abroad outpacing those in the u s support a rotation into global equities three significant tactical rotations call for allocation shifts from growth to value from large cap to small cap and from the u s to the rest of the world rates on pause as support from monetary policy wanes u s rates are expected to lead the way in 2020 with downside risks somewhat diminished and higher repricing liely ten year rates are expected to move from 2 percent at the end of 2019 to 1 8 percent in 2020 the yield curve remains vulnerable to a paring back of fed easing expectations in the near term while the swap curve is expected to flatten fed actions freed other central banks to ease and with the exception of china many are also expected to put rate actions on hold next year credit cycle rolls on despite weaker global growth u s investment grade corporate earnings growth of 9 percent is expected up from 1 percent in 2019 with spreads tightening by 10 basis points and total returns of 4 to 6 percent gross issuance will likely be down 4 percent to 1 137 trillion with net issuance declining 21 percent to 399 billion in 2020 the 11 year high yield credit cycle is expected to keep on rolling though earnings will be the biggest risk default rates should stabilize at 4 percent next year as spreads gravitate to 450 basis points key tactical rotations call for smaller over larger issuers longer over shorter spread duration and more cyclical sectors emerging markets recovery contingent on trade the outcome of the u s china trade war is crucial to the outlook for emerging markets in 2020 total emerging market returns of 7 1 percent in local debt are forecast but only 2 6 percent for external debt latin america is mounting a cyclical recovery likely led by brazil and andrean economies while argentina s new government faces extreme economic challenges idiosyncratic factors will dominate in emerging emea with egyptian and russian local markets and kenyan and nigerian external debt favored weakening dollar

brent crude could hit 70 per barrel by midyear while diesel may near 100 bbl summer u s natural gas prices could fall below 2 million british thermal units as forward balances continue to weaken after

retained earnings growth which absorbed the restructuring charge was offset by higher risk weighted assets rwa cet1 capital was 36 1 billion as at october 31 2019 an increase from 35 7 billion as at

washington president donald trump revved up his global trade war on two fronts monday announcing tariffs on industrial metals from brazil and argentina while eyeing tariffs of up to 100 percent on dozens of popular french products the administration said the moves were necessary because u s trading partners were acting unfairly to disadvantage both the country s traditional economic pillars as well as its best hopes for future prosperity in a pre dawn tweet trump said he was ordering new tariffs on steel and aluminum from brazil and argentina to counter what he called a massive devaluation of their currencies at the expense of american farmers the unexpected announcement upends the latin american countries 2018 agreement with trump to accept quotas on their shipments to the u s in place of the import taxes hours later robert lighthizer the president s chief trade negotiator released the results of a five month investigation that concluded a french digital services tax discriminated against american internet companies and should be met with tariffs of up to 100 percent on 2 4 billion in products such as cheese yogurt sparkling wine and makeup the proposal which awaits a presidential decision threatens to intensify simmering trans atlantic trade friction coming with trump already accusing european car makers of enjoying government protection from american competition the french tax discriminates against u s companies is inconsistent with prevailing principles of international tax policy and is unusually burdensome for affected u s companies lighthizer said in a statement monday s protectionist flurry came as the president s america first trade policy remains bogged down at the negotiating table and on capitol hill less than a year before the 2020 election advertising even as the president flew to london for a north atlantic treaty organization summit all the essentials of trumpian policymaking bold action debatable economics and sparse details were on display back in washington fallout from the president s renewed embrace of tariffs could cloud prospects for future or ongoing talks with countries in asia and europe it ought to make a whole lot of people nervous said william reinsch of the center for strategic and international studies it kinda makes people wonder what s the point of negotiating if this is going to happen the administration s action against france is designed to create leverage for just such a negotiation at issue is a 3 percent tax france introduced last year which the administration says would unfairly target the american stars of the digital economy french lawmakers call the levy les gafa an acronym for google amazon facebook and apple companies that french officials accuse of paying insufficient taxes on revenues earned in france amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post administration officials worry the french tax could set a precedent for other countries lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in austria italy and turkey advertising industry groups welcomed the recommendation with some such as the information industry technology council calling for both countries to work out a lasting tax policy resolution at the organization for economic co operation and development today ustr is defending the internet which is a great american export said a statement from the internet association an industry group apart from the specifics of monday s order trump s tweets amounted to a robust defense of his unconstrained use of import taxes u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 trump wrote in an apparent reference to the technology heavy nasdaq index and the u s is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china the president s enthusiasm for tariffs is not shared by federal reserve chairman jerome powell who has said they are making executives so uncertain about the outlook that companies are delaying investments and slowing the economy likewise the 28 billion in tariff revenue that trump has earmarked for farmers hurt by his trade war is effectively a tax paid by other americans and now amounts to more than twice the 2009 bailout of the u s auto industry advertising trump s action against brazil and argentina took officials in both countries by surprise typically the u s provides businesses with some warning of tariff changes delaying their effective date to allow goods in transit to arrive at american ports without being taxed but the president tweeted that his tariff order was effective immediately in a sign of how abruptly trump had acted his own administration was unprepared to provide details the white house referred

ratio was 11 4 as at october 31 2019 the cet1 ratio was consistent with the prior quarter as retained earnings growth which absorbed the restructuring charge was offset by higher risk weighted assets rwa cet1 capital was 36 1 billion as at october 31 2019 an increase from 35 7 billion as at july 31 2019 driven by retained earnings growth and a lower deduction for deferred tax assets partially offset by the net impact from higher pension and other post employment benefit obligations due to lower discount rates cet1 capital increased from 32 7 billion as at october 31 2018 due to retained earnings growth and to a lesser degree a lower deduction for deferred tax assets and higher unrealized gains from securities fair valued through accumulated other comprehensive income partially offset

tier 1 and total capital ratios were relatively unchanged from prior periods as higher capital primarily from retained earnings growth was offset by higher rwa the impact of foreign exchange movements on capital ratios was largely offset bmo s investments in foreign operations are primarily denominated in u s dollars and the foreign exchange impact of u s dollar denominated rwa and capital deductions may result in variability in the bank s capital ratios bmo may manage the impact of foreign exchange movements on its capital ratios and did so during the fourth quarter any such activities

these reimbursements were recorded as a reduction in the related expense bmo analyzes revenue at the consolidated level based on gaap revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements rather than on a taxable equivalent basis teb which is consistent with our canadian peer group like many banks we analyze revenue on a teb basis at the operating group level revenue and the provision for income taxes are increased on tax exempt securities to an equivalent before tax basis to facilitate comparisons of income between taxable and tax exempt sources the offset to the group teb

provides analysis on applied materials amat ubiquiti ui and aspen technology azpn here is a synopsis of all five stocks bull of the day anaplan inc has beat on the estimate all five quarters since it went public at the end of 2018 this zacks rank 1 strong buy is expected to grow revenue in the double digits both this year and next anaplan runs a subscription based platform in the category of connected planning its large global customers use the platform to connect people data and plans to allow real time planning and decision making the company has 20 global offices and more than 1 300 customers worldwide another beat in the fiscal third quarter on nov 21 anaplan reported its third quarter fiscal 2020 results and beat the zacks consensus for the fifth quarter in a row it hasn t missed since its 2018 ipo earnings were a loss of 0 08 versus the zacks consensus of a loss of 0 13 anaplan is a growth company and you can see that in the revenue which jumped 44 to 89 4 million year over year subscription revenue rose 47 to 79 7 million while it still saw a loss per share it has been cutting that in the year over year numbers the 0 08 loss in fiscal 2020 was down from the 0 18 loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 it has cash and cash equivalents on hand of 310 8 million raised full year guidance given yet another beat and the hot revenue numbers it s not surprising that the company raised its full year outlook total revenue is now expected to be between 346 to 347 million up from prior guidance of 339 to 343 million that s revenue growth of 44 1 non gaap operating margin is now expected to be in the range of negative 17 and 18 down from the prior guidance of negative 19 5 and 20 5 story continues analysts are bullish on fiscal 2020 with 3 raising estimates to match the company s forecast in the last month the fiscal 2020 zacks consensus estimate has risen to a loss of 0 48 which is up from a loss of 0 68 just 3 months ago that s earnings growth of 34 as the company lost 0 73 in fiscal 2019 the analysts are also adjusting fiscal 2021 but 2 estimates have been cut in the last 60 days however it s moving in the right direction as the fiscal 2021 zacks consensus has falling to a loss of 0 44 from a loss of 0 61 just 90 days ago shares soar in 2019 anaplan was one of the hot ipo stocks in 2019 as shares have soared 97 year to date however over the last 3 months they have been treading water and are actually down 2 3 the pause in the rally could be a buying opportunity for those looking for a mid cap tech growth name for those investors looking for new technology names anaplan is one to keep on the short list bear of the day ryder system inc is still growing revenue but saw an earnings loss in the third quarter thanks to a change in vehicle residual value estimates of all power vehicles this zacks rank 5 strong sell is expected to see earnings decline 81 in 2019 ryder operates in commercial fleet management dedicated transportation and supply chain solutions another beat in the third quarter on oct 29 ryder reported its third quarter results and beat the zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents earnings were 1 52 versus the consensus of 1 49 it is on a beating streak as that was the 10th quarter in a row it met or beat total revenue was up 3 to 2 2 billion fleet management saw revenue pop 4 to 1 4 billion from 1 34 billion a year ago dedicated transportation services also saw a 5 gain to 359 million only supply chain solutions saw a drop of 2 to 618 million so what s the problem the used vehicle market softened in late second quarter and intensified in the third quarter which led to a triggering review and change in residual value estimates on all power vehicles the earnings outlook was adjusted downward even as it expects solid revenue growth new full year guidance the most significant negative impact to earnings will be in the third quarter and is expected to decline each quarter after that but fourth quarter 2019 isn t going to be a picnic either as a result the full year 2019 eps forecast was revised down to between 1 00 and 1 10 9 estimates were revised lower sending the zacks consensus down to 1 06 from 5 64 that s an 81 decline from 2018 s 5 79 2020 s zacks consensus was also cut dramatically to 2 60 from 5 99 60 days ago 2 more estimates were even cut in the last month which could indicate that the used vehicle market remains soft shares under perform the s p 500 in 2019 it s been a roller coaster ride ever since shares hit a new 52 week low at the end of december 2018 they ve gained just 7 6 in 2019 under performing the s p 500 which is up 24 during that same time period however the company is shareholder friendly it has paid a quarterly cash dividend for 43 years or 173 consecutive quarters it s currently yielding an impressive 4 2 but with the earnings guidance cut the shares now look expensive on a p e basis as they are trading at 49 7x the zacks ranks don t look great for most of the

month of shrinking factory activity in china pressured by sluggish domestic demand and limp exports but the devil lurks in the details caixin s pmi a separate survey with a focus on smaller businesses is expected to show a fourth straight month of expansion which would leave a picture that looks increasingly like a two speed economy big industry dominated by lumbering state enterprises is shrinking while private juggernauts such as tencent alibaba and smaller e commerce firms are soaring yet economic planners are biding their time perhaps wary of creating a 2015 style runaway gravy train while moves to ease monetary policy have so far been tentative the pmis may provide an additional push 3 opec gathers for a major policy meeting on thursday december 5th dec 5 is shaping up to be a big day for oil markets the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec gathers for a policy meeting and the same day opec s biggest producer saudi arabia will give the final pricing for the ipo of state oil firm aramco the ipo will be the elephant in the opec meeting room because the oil price at the time will be key to the listing expected in mid december a year ago opec and non opec countries agreed to lower crude supply by 1 2 million barrels per day to prop up prices in the face of slowing oil demand in july they extended that deal until march 2020 seasoned opec watchers know never to exclude the possibility of a surprise decision but sources within the group seem pretty sure the supply cut pact will be extended further into 2020 after all an oil price tumble is something the

bank is selling dollars amid the worst month for the peso since 2011 and an interest rate cut that was priced for december may now be in doubt there is no sign of relief for venezuela where the

bank of america merrill lynch 2020 market outlook profits rise economy slows globalization peaks and business as usual investing comes to an end tweet key drivers of this year s late cycle bull market gains are expected to shift as the global markets enter the new year according to bofa merrill lynch global research which was recently named institutional investor s top research firm in the world in its year ahead outlook the research team forecasts a bottoming of economic growth in the spring as trade war tensions ease and relatively low recession risk key highlights include stocks are expected to outperform bonds handily in 2020 as the global economy bottoms out in the first quarter while monetary policy remains accommodative the conventional idea of allocating 60 percent to equities and 40 percent to bonds is unlikely to survive into the 2020s an interim skinny u s china trade deal should temporarily relieve trade concerns ahead of the u s presidential election and pave the way for a midyear mini boost in global growth led by u s rates and a weaker dollar a rebound in u s corporate earnings should spur a long awaited uptick in capital spending and lift the s p 500 to another year end high of 3300 or 6 percent above current levels in a reversal of trend u s stock returns are expected to lag gains forecast for europe and emerging market stocks next year the potential for 6 percent total returns on high grade bonds next year makes u s corporate credit particularly attractive in a world facing 12 trillion of negative yielding debt inflows from foreign investors are expected to remain strong supported by favorable spreads but today s bond market bubble could become the markets biggest vulnerability the new year and decade begin near the tail end of the longest bull market on record and despite recent strong gains investor anxiety remains at a high level said candace browning head of bofa merrill lynch global research many of the driving factors central bank policy globalization oil have peaked and new economic paradigms are emerging in response to a different set of challenges facing the world s social environment political and economic systems rather than focusing on the downside we think the opportunity for investors will be found in what happens next at the annual bank of america merrill lynch year ahead outlook presentation today in new york city the firm s top strategists and economists discussed the overarching themes that are transforming economies and investing paradigms in the year ahead and throughout the 2020s notable among these is the transition to stronger local and regional economic ties following three decades of economic growth fueled by the benefits of globalization an unchecked cross border free flow of goods people and capital that rewarded cheap labor and low consumer prices the shift from globalization to localization and other global macro trends underpins much of bank of america merrill lynch s outlook on the markets and economy next year key macro calls made for the markets and economy in the year ahead are slowing global growth global gdp is forecast to slow from 3 8 percent in 2018 to just over 3 percent in 2019 and 2020 europe should stabilize at around 1 percent while a below consensus call on china assumes growth slowing from 6 1 percent to 5 6 percent inflation is likely to inch lower from 3 1 percent this year to 2 7 percent by 2021 while policy rates remain flat and fiscal policy stays frozen u s economic slowdown despite strong fundamentals u s gdp is expected to slow to trend with growth averaging 1 7 percent over the next two years on the positive side inflation should be muted with core pce inflation at around 2 percent by the end of 2020 the federal reserve is not expected to take further rate action for the foreseeable future unless a material shift in outlook triggers such a move given the fed s focus on avoiding a recession the risk of further cutting outweighs hikes modest gains in u s stocks with greater upside outside u s s p earnings per share are forecast to grow 8 percent to 177 at year end and returns will likely be driven solely by corporate earnings vs price to earnings multiple expansions emerging markets and europe could offer more upside in 2020 crowded positioning in the u s vs the rest of the world and estimate revisions abroad outpacing those in the u s support a rotation into global equities three significant tactical rotations call for allocation shifts from growth to value from large cap to small cap and from the u s to the rest of the world rates on pause as support from monetary policy wanes u s rates are expected to lead the way in 2020 with downside risks somewhat diminished and higher repricing liely ten year rates are expected to move from 2 percent at the end of 2019 to 1 8 percent in 2020 the yield curve remains vulnerable to a paring back of fed easing expectations in the near term while the swap curve is expected to flatten fed actions freed other central banks to ease and with the exception of china many are also expected to put rate actions on hold next year credit cycle rolls on despite weaker global growth u s investment grade corporate earnings growth of 9 percent is expected up from 1 percent in 2019 with spreads tightening by 10 basis points and total returns of 4 to 6 percent gross issuance will likely be down 4 percent to 1 137 trillion with net issuance declining 21 percent to 399 billion in 2020 the 11 year high yield credit cycle is expected to keep on rolling though earnings will be the biggest risk default rates should stabilize at 4 percent next year as spreads gravitate to 450 basis points key tactical rotations call for smaller over larger issuers longer over shorter spread duration and more cyclical sectors emerging markets recovery contingent on trade the outcome of the u s china trade war is crucial to the outlook for emerging markets in 2020 total emerging market returns of 7 1 percent in local debt are forecast but only 2 6 percent for external debt latin america is mounting a cyclical recovery likely led by brazil and andrean economies while argentina s new government faces extreme economic challenges idiosyncratic factors will dominate in emerging emea with egyptian and russian local markets and kenyan and nigerian external debt favored weakening dollar the u s dollar is expected to weaken in 2020 with diminishing policy uncertainty the euro and sterling also should benefit from a resolution of brexit uncertainty with eur usd and gbp usd rising to 1 15 and 1 39 respectively stronger global growth and a weaker dollar will help support emerging markets usd jpy is expected to decline to 103 while aud jpy and asean fx should appreciate sharply on global reflation modest growth in commodities hedge inflation risks a positive roll yield should support modest commodity returns in 2020 with dispersion expected within energy metals and agricultural brent crude could hit 70 per barrel by midyear while diesel may near 100 bbl summer u s natural gas prices could fall below 2 million british thermal units as forward balances continue to weaken after

for immediate release chicago il december 3 2019 zacks equity research shares of anaplan inc plan as the bull of the day ryder system inc r asthe bear of the day in addition zacks equity research provides analysis on applied materials amat ubiquiti ui and aspen technology azpn here is a synopsis of all five stocks bull of the day anaplan inc has beat on the estimate all five quarters since it went public at the end of 2018 this zacks rank 1 strong buy is expected to grow revenue in the double digits both this year and next anaplan runs a subscription based platform in the category of connected planning its large global customers use the platform to connect people data and plans to allow real time planning and decision making the company has 20 global offices and more than 1 300

missed since its 2018 ipo earnings were a loss of 0 08 versus the zacks consensus of a loss of 0 13 anaplan is a growth company and you can see that in the revenue which jumped 44 to 89 4 million year over year subscription revenue rose 47 to 79 7 million while it still saw a loss per share it has been cutting that in the year over year numbers the 0 08 loss in fiscal 2020 was down from the 0 18 loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 it has cash and cash equivalents on hand of 310 8 million raised full year guidance given yet another beat and the hot revenue numbers it s not surprising that the company raised its full year outlook total revenue is now expected to be between 346 to 347 million up from prior guidance of 339 to 343 million that s revenue growth of 44 1 non gaap operating margin is now expected to be in the range of negative 17 and 18 down from the prior guidance of negative 19 5 and 20 5 analysts are bullish on fiscal 2020 with 3 raising estimates to match the company s forecast in the last month the fiscal 2020 zacks consensus estimate has risen to a loss of 0 48 which is up from a loss of 0 68 just 3 months ago that s earnings growth of 34 as the company lost 0 73 in fiscal 2019 the analysts are also adjusting fiscal 2021 but 2 estimates have been cut in the last 60 days however it s moving in the right direction as the fiscal 2021 zacks consensus has falling to a loss of 0 44 from a loss of 0 61 just 90 days ago shares soar in 2019 anaplan was one of the hot ipo stocks in 2019 as shares have soared 97 year to date however over the last 3 months they have been treading water and are actually down 2 3 the pause in the rally could be a buying opportunity for those looking for a mid cap tech growth name for those investors looking for new technology names anaplan is one to keep on the short list bear of the day ryder system inc is still growing revenue but saw an earnings loss in the third quarter thanks to a change in vehicle residual value estimates of all power vehicles this zacks rank 5 strong sell is expected to see earnings decline 81 in 2019 ryder operates in commercial fleet management dedicated transportation and supply chain solutions another beat in the third quarter on oct 29 ryder reported its third quarter results and beat the zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents earnings were 1 52 versus the consensus of 1 49 it is on a beating streak as that was the 10th quarter in a row it met or beat total revenue was up 3 to 2 2 billion fleet management saw revenue pop 4 to 1 4 billion from 1 34 billion a year ago dedicated transportation services also saw a 5 gain to 359 million only supply chain solutions saw a drop of 2 to 618 million so what s the problem the used vehicle market softened in late second quarter and intensified in the third quarter which led to a triggering review and change in residual value estimates on all power vehicles the earnings outlook was adjusted downward even as it expects solid revenue growth new full year guidance the most significant negative impact to earnings will be in the third quarter and is expected to decline each quarter after that but fourth quarter 2019 isn t going to be a picnic either as a result the full year 2019 eps forecast was revised down to between 1 00 and 1 10 9 estimates were revised lower sending the zacks consensus down to 1 06 from 5 64 that s an 81 decline from 2018 s 5 79 2020 s zacks consensus was also cut dramatically to 2 60 from 5 99 60 days ago 2 more estimates were even cut in the last month which could indicate that the used vehicle market remains soft shares under perform the s p 500 in 2019 it s been a roller coaster ride ever since shares hit a new 52 week low at the end of december 2018 they ve gained just 7 6 in 2019 under performing the s p 500 which is up 24 during that same time period however the company is shareholder friendly it has paid a quarterly cash dividend for 43 years or 173 consecutive quarters it s currently yielding an impressive 4 2 but with the earnings guidance cut the shares now look expensive on a p e basis as they are trading at 49 7x the zacks ranks don t look great for most of the industry the transportation equipment and leasing industry is in the bottom 4 of the zacks industry rank additional content watch out for an overvaluation trigger global week ahead this global week ahead finishes with a u s nonfarm payroll report for november that is the key macro indicator at all times pay heed to that report on friday its sister report from the adp payroll company will

manufacturing and agriculture weakness 2 asian manufacturing pmis come out manufacturing surveys will offer a checkup on asia s trade war wounds with the consensus forecast for a seventh straight month of shrinking factory activity in china pressured by sluggish domestic demand and limp exports but the devil lurks in the details caixin s pmi a separate survey with a focus on smaller businesses is expected to show a fourth straight month of expansion which would leave a picture that looks increasingly like a two speed economy big industry dominated by lumbering state enterprises is shrinking while private juggernauts such as tencent alibaba and smaller e commerce firms are soaring yet economic planners are biding their time perhaps wary of creating a 2015 style runaway gravy train while moves to ease monetary policy have so far been tentative the pmis may provide an additional push 3 opec gathers for a major policy meeting on thursday december 5th dec 5 is shaping up to be a big day for oil markets the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec gathers for a policy meeting and the same day opec s biggest producer saudi arabia will give the final pricing for the ipo of state oil firm aramco the ipo will be the elephant in the opec meeting room because the oil price at the time will be key to the listing expected in mid december a year ago opec and non opec countries agreed to lower crude supply by 1 2 million barrels per day to prop up prices in the face of slowing oil demand in july they extended that deal until march 2020 seasoned opec watchers know never to exclude the possibility of a surprise decision but sources within the group seem pretty sure the supply cut pact will be extended further into 2020 after all an oil price tumble is something the saudis won t want to risk just as the aramco shares list 4 nato celebrates 70 years of existence on tuesday and wednesday beneath the birthday bonhomie tensions will be simmering as the transatlantic

while french president emmanuel macron has ruffled feathers by calling nato brain dead and suggesting a strategic relationship with russia expect heated debate over turkey s threat to vote against a defense plan for the baltics and poland unless nato recognizes the kurdish ypg militia as terrorists unlikely given the ypg helped defeat islamic state so how do they pacify turkish president tayyip erdogan while keeping the ypg on side and summit host prime minister boris johnson will hope trump does not wade into the british election which could be exploited by the opposition johnson seems assured of a majority and will not want to take chances just a week before polling as for nato s future role the summit is will ask a group of wise persons to come up with suggestions but they wont reportuntil the next summit in late 2021 5 will brazil see big economic protests on thursday south american leaders of the mercosur trade bloc gathering in brazil s bento gonçalvea on thursday to discuss tariffs won t be short of talking points waves of violent protest and social discontent sweeping across latin america have already brought down bolivia s government and pushed currencies from chile to colombia to record lows while showing little sign of abating brazil has so far avoided such unrest but its currency the real is at record lows forcing authorities to intervene chile s central bank is selling dollars amid the worst month for the peso since 2011 and an interest rate cut that was priced for december may now be in doubt there is no sign of relief for venezuela where the

overview asia pacific equities mostly declined in sympathy with yesterday s large sell off in the us and europe china and taiwan were the notable exceptions while australia s 2 2 decline following the central bank meeting that resulted in what many are seeing as a hawkish hold led the move lower europe s dow jones stoxx 600 fell 1 6 yesterday the largest loss in two months and is extending the losses for a third session today us shares are trading with a lower and a gap lower opening is possible benchmark 10 year yields are narrowly mixed accept in australia and new zealand where they jumped 10 bp and 8 bp respectively the dollar sold off yesterday and is trading with a mixed tone today in narrow ranges against all the major currencies jp morgan s emerging market currency index is a little weaker threatening to end its two day bounce to resume its downtrend gold is firm and is moving above its 20 day moving average 1464 6 which it has not traded above in a month oil continues consolidating its pre weekend loss that saw wti for january delivery fall from above 58 to 55 asia pacific one chinese media outlet reports china is drawing up a list of unreliable entities ostensibly a list of us companies it will sanction beijing has been threatening to do this for around six months while it could be in retaliation for the recently signed hk bills in the us it could also be in anticipation of the passage another bill working its way through the senate that would sanction officials and companies involved with china s campaign against the uighur muslims yesterday trump renewed his threat to raise tariffs on china if there is no agreement the market had expected the mid december tariffs the us threatened to be suspended like the october s however there appears to be some second guessing now the reserve bank of australia kept rates steady as widely expected however the statement and press conference took on a less than dovish cast the three rate cuts since june appear to be helping the property market which can lift consumption through the wealth effect the central bank is seen with 50 bp of easing before it must resort to unconventional methods asset purchases and has signaled it is in no hurry presently to exhaust its remaining monetary ammunition the next meeting is not until february and the market is split about a rate cut then the labor market and consumption are the most important elements going forward separately australia s swing into a current account surplus position extended in q3 to a 7 9 bln from q2 a 4 7 bln in the same quarters in 2018 australia reported a combined deficit of a 22 5 bln the dollar posted a potential key downside reversal against the yen yesterday by trading on both sides of the pre weekend range and settling below that low however there has been no follow through selling news that the government s pension investment fund gpif will no longer lend out its equity holdings to short sellers failed to have an immediate impact the dollar which was testing jpy109 75 yesterday has not been above jpy109 20 today there is a 780 mln option struck at jpy109 10 that expires today support is seen near jpy108 80 a break could signal another half yen decline the australian dollar has seen strong follow through buying today it bottomed yesterday near 0 6755 and is near 0 6860 in the european morning it is testing the 61 8 retracement of the decline in the past month the 0 6900 0 6920 is the next technical objective the us dollar edged higher against the chinese yuan to resurface above cny7 05 to reach its best level since late october europe france also became subject to us tariff threats yesterday the 90 day grace period since the us concluded that france s digital tax hurts us interests ended last week the trump administration has threatened up to 100 tariffs on about 2 4 bln of french goods mostly consumer goods like wine cheese handbags and cosmetics the next step is for public hearings the us also said it will investigate if austria italy and turkey should be subject to retaliatory action as well note that uk prime minister johnson has also advocated a similar tax a global solution seems preferable and an eu solution second best but the failure of both left it in individual countries hands like the manufacturing pmi the uk s construction pmi rose a little more than expected but is still in contracting mode yesterday s manufacturing pmi showed an improvement from the flash reading but was still lower than october the construction pmi was sequentially better at 45 3 from 44 2 in october it matches the best level since may but remains below the 50 boom bust level last november it stood at 54 3 the final services and composite pmi will be reported tomorrow yesterday s jump to a higher range failed to inject much excitement in the euro which is stuck again in a less than a 20 pip range against the dollar as it consolidates the euro has not been below 1 1070 or above 1 1090 the euro has not traded above 1 11 since november 5 a move below the 1 1050 area would suggest the short squeeze has run its course sterling is firm and pushing closer to 1 30 where there is a gbp225 mln option that expires today it had not traded above 1 30 since october 21 when it approached 1 3015 note that turkey s november cpi was softer than expected rising 0 38 on the month about half as much as the median forecast in the bloomberg survey however the base effect translated into a big jump on a year over year basis to 10 56 from 8 55 and this likely keeps the central bank on the sideline when it meets next week the lira continues to consolidate lastly a surprisingly weak q3 gdp from south africa 0 6 annualized compared with expectations for a flat report sent the rand sharply lower the dollar jumped from near zar14 52 to almost zar14 70 the next important chart points are near zar14 72 zar14 77 america the news stream from the us was poor the president threatened again to increase tariffs on china if there was no deal and reinstated tariffs on aluminum and steel from argentina and brazil bemoaning their weak currencies it threatened france the economic data were not much better not only did the manufacturing ism unexpectedly deteriorated but construction spending missed broadly falling 0 8 in october instead of increase by 0 4 of the median forecast in the bloomberg survey adding insult to injury the september series was revised to show a decline of 0 3 instead of a 0 5 gain the one bright spot was the rise in the november manufacturing pmi to 52 6 from 52 2 flash reading and october s 51 3 the dollar fell but the disappointing data does not have the heft to alter expectations of fed policy foremost that requires a deterioration in the labor market it is not clear why the us deemed it necessary to put the tariffs back on argentina and brazil and to the extent their currencies have weakened it is a sign of a troubled economy not a crafty manipulator perhaps they are being punished because farmers in argentina and brazil compete with us farmers in third markets especially china the us fights a rearguard action china s market for brazil s agriculture is ten times larger than the us market for brazilian steel the value of argentian soy exported to china is three times the value of argentina s shipments aluminum and iron pipe to the us according to bloomberg trump has suggested that there is unlikely to be an agreement with china this year and suggested it might be preferable to wait until after next year s election outside of us auto sales the north american economic calendar is light leaving investors to contemplate the implications of the deterioration in the trade situation over the past 24 hours brazil reports q3 gdp it is expected to have risen by 0 4 the same as q2 and 1 on a year over year basis also the same as in q2 the canadian dollar was one of the few major currencies not to have gained against the greenback yesterday it is little changed today the us dollar continues to straddle the cad1 33 level the technical condition has not changed the macds are elevated but have yet to turn down the slow stochastics are trending gently lower only a break of cad1 3260 or cad1 3330 signals anything of note the us dollar is little changed against the mexican peso its recent uptrend is intact and the trendline is near mxn19 45 today on the topside the mxn19 60 mxn19 65 needs to be overcome to signal the next leg up

advertisement president trump renews tariff threat on brazil and argentina share copy link copy president donald trump announced monday that the u s will restore steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina citing a massive devaluation of their currencies brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries trump tweeted early monday morning from washington he also called on the federal reserve to act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies formal notices of the tariffs were not immediately announced by the treasury or commerce departments or the office of the u s trade representative both brazil and argentina were exempted from 25 steel and 10 aluminum tariffs last year when trump was attempting to avoid a trade war with those countries brazilian president jair bolsonaro said monday that he has an open channel of communication with trump according to state news agency agencia brasil bolsonaro said he would meet with brazilian finance minister paulo guedes monday to discuss the issue and make a call to trump if needed argentina s production and labor minister called trump s decision to impose the tariffs unexpected there was no sign given to our government to the brazilian government or to the public sector that there would be a change in the deal with the united states dante sica told state run news agency telam on monday sica said he met with foreign minister jorge faurie after seeing the tweet in order to analyze the course of action and told telam that he had contacted the u s embassy in argentina as well all contacts in washington d c to get more clarity on the situation the president s decision amounts to retaliation against two countries that have served as alternative suppliers of soybeans and other farm products to china grabbing market share away from american farmers a key constituency the president will need to win reelection in 2020 but bolsonaro contended during a radio interview on monday that he doesn t view the tariffs as retaliation their economy does not compare to ours it is 10 times bigger than ours i don t see this as retaliation i m going to speak to him to see if trump doesn t over penalize us bolsonaro said i m certain he will be open to the conversation trump has prided himself on imposing tariffs and hammering trade deals to bolster his america first economic agenda but the biggest deal at the center of the trade war a u s china trade agreement has yet to be signed additional tariffs on chinese imports are expected to go into effect on dec 15 as china now the world s top steel producer has ramped up its steel production u s steel jobs have declined the president has promised to reinvigorate u s steel jobs but last year the steel industry added 2 400 jobs an increase of just over 1 employment in the industry is still down about 43 since 1990 the united states has bought more steel from brazil than any other country besides canada during the first nine months of this year making up nearly 11 of all steel imports according to census bureau data it relies on argentina much less for steel which made up less than 1 of imports brazil and argentina have also benefited from trump s trade war with china which has hurt american farmers in other ways brazil is the second biggest soybean producer in the world and it s where china s farmers have been getting a lot of their soybeans since beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s agriculture argentina recently made a deal with china that will allow it to import soymeal starting next year in recent weeks however brazil and argentina have seen the values of their currencies drop the brazilian real is down more than 8 against the dollar this year and the argentine peso is down 37 as the country wrestles with an economic crisis that is more than other major emerging market currency including the south african rand mexican peso and south korean won the turkish lira is also down 8 this year in its latest report in may the treasury department had noted the u s dollar had appreciated against some emerging market currencies including the brazilian real amid intensifying economic crises in argentina and turkey but refrained from flagging it as a currency to watch during bolsonaro s visit to the white house earlier this year trump announced that the u s would be designating brazil as a non nato ally and recently a joint communique from the u s brazil ceo forum in late november described joint recommendations for enhancing the u s brazil economic relationship the statement on the forum which was attended by u s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u s director of the national economic council larry kudlow did not hint at any changes to the state of brazil s steel tariff exemption monday s announcement is not the first time that trump has accused a major trading partner of manipulating its currency in order to win a competitive advantage against the united states in june he attacked the european central bank for what he said was unfair manipulation of the euro and has sharply pointed in the past to japan and china as examples of countries that use monetary policy to pursue devaluation in order to gain a trading advantage over the u s in august amid tit for tat retaliation between the world s two largest economies trump directed treasury secretary steven mnuchin to label china a currency manipulator ratcheting up fears by investors that a currency war might ensue

with brent d griffiths the ticker president trump is sending shock waves from wall street to washington and foreign capitals by dialing up his trade war around the world after spending the past two months retreating from its various fronts trump said he may wait until after the 2020 election to strike a trade agreement with china saying there is no deadline on the talks in some ways i like the idea of waiting until after the election for the china deal he said from london where he is attending a nato summit the comments followed his announcement via twitter that he is restoring tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from brazil and argentina and his administration separately said it is considering new levies on a range of french goods in retaliation for a new digital tax the consequences could reach well beyond the metals trade between the united states and its erstwhile south american economic allies and higher prices on french wine and makeup for one it signals trump still views new tariffs as an effective lever to advance his trade agenda a belief packed with peril for the markets broadly and manufacturers and retailers in particular among others advertisement these are our big takeaways from trump s announcements 1 the escalation of trade hostilities marks a serious u turn by the administration trump s team appeared to be winding down its trade fights in recent weeks quietly foregoing tariffs on european auto imports allowing american companies to continue doing business with chinese telecom giant huawei and canceling a tariff hike on chinese goods planned for october while working toward phase one trade deal with beijing but the confrontations the administration just launched could widen trade showdowns in both asia and europe at issue in france per my colleagues david lynch rachel siegel and terrence mccoy is a 3 percent tax france introduced last year which the administration says would unfairly target america s digital economy icons french lawmakers call the levy les gafa an acronym for google amazon facebook and apple companies that french officials accuse of paying insufficient taxes on revenue earned in france administration officials worry that the french tax could set a precedent for other countries lighthizer said he may open investigations into similar taxes in austria italy and turkey lighthizer proposed striking back by levying tariffs of up to 100 percent on 2 4 billion of french products including cheese porcelain and handbags trump s moves against brazil and argentina took officials in both countries by surprise my colleagues report in a sign of how abruptly trump had acted his own administration was unprepared to provide details 2 don t expect a christmas calm for the markets advertisement stock market investors have largely priced in progress toward a trade truce between the united states and china they have been counting on a deal to scuttle new import levies trump is set to impose on 160 billion of chinese goods on dec 15 and they have been betting the president would see it through in part to put the market on sounder footing heading into his reelection campaign but the president s renewed fight with argentina and brazil throws the assumption into doubt a fact reflected in a monday stock market sell off per my colleagues taylor telford and tom heath the record bull run of the past month flamed out with the dow jones industrial average declining 268 points or 95 percent to close at 27 783 the standard poor s 500 index dropped 27 points or 86 percent to close at 3 113 the tech laden nasdaq composite was hit particularly hard finishing at 8 567 a 97 point drop of 1 1 percent chris krueger of cowen washington research group said trump s latest turn points to one of his central conflicts the id and ego of trump in our opinion is dow man vs tariff man he wrote in a note tariffs remain trump s primary trade security blanket and what he reverts to when he feels aggrieved advertisement 3 trump is turning the trade war into a currency war the president in announcing the renewed metals tariffs accused brazil and argentina of devaluing their currencies to make their exports more competitive the claim for which there is no evidence is very different from what trump said in 2018 when he first imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and it marks the latest unpredictable trade shock from the white house as business leaders are begging for more certainty my colleague heather long writes commerce secretary wilbur ross underlined the wider threat the decision poses in a fox business interview brazil he said is not the only one where there are currency issues per heather now trump is showing a willingness to impose tariffs for yet another reason currency moves opening the door to more action potentially against china trump has long railed against china for purposefully devaluing its currency and even promised to label china a currency manipulator as soon as he took office something he eventually did in august 2019 ross went out of his way on fox business to say china appeared to be doing better now still the threat is hanging out there that other nations could be next advertisement 4 trump promised the trade war would revive manufacturing it isn t working indeed manufacturing is in a recession and it s getting worse u s factory activity contracted for a fourth straight month in november as new orders slumped back to around their lowest level since 2012 while construction spending fell in october tempering optimism over the economy that had been fanned by a recent run of upbeat reports reuters s lucia mutikani reports trump blamed the federal reserve manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve which has called interest rates and quantitative tightening wrong from the first days of jay powell donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 2 2019 the fed should lower rates there is almost no inflation and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will soar dollar is very strong relative to others donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 2 2019 but his trade war is a prime culprit we expect trade policy uncertainty to continue weighing on manufacturing activity into the new year slower external and domestic demand will also constrain manufacturing moving forward oxford economics lead economist oren klachkin told reuters and higher prices on imported metals from brazil and argentina will only raise costs for domestic manufacturers advertisement market movers fourth quarter earnings projections nosedive bloomberg news s lu wang wall street analysts are slashing projections for fourth quarter earnings at a furious pace making it more likely that a profit recession will hit corporate america for the first time in almost four years two months into the quarter analysts have shaved 4 off their estimates to 41 12 a share a drop of almost 1 compared with a year ago after a 1 3 decline last quarter while they almost always lower expectations as a period progresses the current pace has been exceeded only twice since 2015 bulls say the hand wringing over stagnant profits is overdone with the s p 500 up almost 25 this year on easy federal reserve policy and a trade truce with china but part of the optimism has been predicated on an anticipated rebound in earnings which keeps getting delayed for now it ll be well into 2020 before profits rise meaningfully with analysts predicting a 9 2 gain for the year advertisement cyber monday poised to top 9 4 billion cyber monday sales were on course to bring in a record 9 4 billion according to early estimates building on a

subsidies to airbus continued to harm the u s aerospace industry and strong action was required to eliminate such market distorting subsidies strong dollar weakens agriculture trump may have bewildered authorities in argentina and brazil by announcing on twitter new steel tariffs as punishment for cheapening their currencies but the measure does shine a light on how much the hardy dollar

advertisement president trump renews tariff threat on brazil and argentina share copy link copy president donald trump announced monday that the u s will restore steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina citing a massive devaluation of their currencies brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the u s from those countries trump tweeted early monday morning from washington he also called on the federal reserve to act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies formal notices of the tariffs were not immediately announced by the treasury or commerce departments or the office of the u s trade representative both brazil and argentina were exempted from 25 steel and 10 aluminum tariffs last year when trump was attempting to avoid a trade war with those countries brazilian president jair bolsonaro said monday that he has an open channel of communication with trump according to state news agency agencia brasil bolsonaro said he would meet with brazilian finance minister paulo guedes monday to discuss the issue and make a call to trump if needed argentina s production and labor minister called trump s decision to impose the tariffs unexpected there was no sign given to our government to the brazilian government or to the public sector that there would be a change in the deal with the united states dante sica told state run news agency telam on monday sica said he met with foreign minister jorge faurie after seeing the tweet in order to analyze the course of action and told telam that he had contacted the u s embassy in argentina as well all contacts in washington d c to get more clarity on the situation the president s decision amounts to retaliation against two countries that have served as alternative suppliers of soybeans and other farm products to china grabbing market share away from american farmers a key constituency the president will need to win reelection in 2020 but bolsonaro contended during a radio interview on monday that he doesn t view the tariffs as retaliation their economy does not compare to ours it is 10 times bigger than ours i don t see this as retaliation i m going to speak to him to see if trump doesn t over penalize us bolsonaro said i m certain he will be open to the conversation trump has prided himself on imposing tariffs and hammering trade deals to bolster his america first economic agenda but the biggest deal at the center of the trade war a u s china trade agreement has yet to be signed additional tariffs on chinese imports are expected to go into effect on dec 15 as china now the world s top steel producer has ramped up its steel production u s steel jobs have declined the president has promised to reinvigorate u s steel jobs but last year the steel industry added 2 400 jobs an increase of just over 1 employment in the industry is still down about 43 since 1990 the united states has bought more steel from brazil than any other country besides canada during the first nine months of this year making up nearly 11 of all steel imports according to census bureau data it relies on argentina much less for steel which made up less than 1 of imports brazil and argentina have also benefited from trump s trade war with china which has hurt american farmers in other ways brazil is the second biggest soybean producer in the world and it s where china s farmers have been getting a lot of their soybeans since beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on u s agriculture argentina recently made a deal with china that will allow it to import soymeal starting next year in recent weeks however brazil and argentina have seen the values of their currencies drop the brazilian real is down more than 8 against the dollar this year and the argentine peso is down 37 as the country wrestles with an economic crisis that is more than other major emerging market currency including the south african rand mexican peso and south korean won the turkish lira is also down 8 this year in its latest report in may the treasury department had noted the u s dollar had appreciated against some emerging market currencies including the brazilian real amid intensifying economic crises in argentina and turkey but refrained from flagging it as a currency to watch during bolsonaro s visit to the white house earlier this year trump announced that the u s would be designating brazil as a non nato ally and recently a joint communique from the u s brazil ceo forum in late november described joint recommendations for enhancing the u s brazil economic relationship the statement on the forum which was attended by u s commerce secretary wilbur ross and u s director of the national economic council larry kudlow did not hint at any changes to the state of brazil s steel tariff exemption monday s announcement is not the first time that trump has accused a major trading partner of manipulating its currency in order to win a competitive advantage against the united states in june he attacked the european central bank for what he said was unfair manipulation of the euro and has sharply pointed in the past to japan and china as examples of countries that use monetary policy to pursue devaluation in order to gain a trading advantage over the u s in august amid tit for tat retaliation between the world s two largest economies trump directed treasury secretary steven mnuchin to label china a currency manipulator ratcheting up fears by investors that a currency war might ensue

china will maintain its conventional monetary policies over the long term and ensure currency stability pboc will refrain from zero interest rate or quantitative easing says governor china will not resort to competitive measures like zero interest rate or quantitative easing but would instead maintain its conventional monetary policies over the long term and ensure currency stability a top monetary official said yi gang governor of the people s bank of china the central bank said in an article in qiu shi the communist party s flagship magazine that the nation s prudent monetary policy which is neither too tight nor too loose will help maintain the monetary conditions matching the requirements of potential output and price stability along with countercyclical adjustments to maintain reasonable and ample liquidity policy observers speculated that yi s article which was published on sunday might indicate the basic policy tone for the central economic work conference a top level policymaking meeting to be held later this month that meeting will discuss the major macroeconomic targets for next year in terms of the foreign exchange rate policy the renminbi exchange rate is determined by the market oriented demand and supply relationship and china will neither use the exchange rate as a tool nor join the competition of currency depreciation said the pboc governor china will continually push forward the market oriented reform of renminbi exchange rate regime and keep the flexibility of the currency necessary macro prudential management will be launched when some pro cyclical signals emerge to keep the renminbi exchange rate basically stable at a reasonable equilibrium yi said monetary policy needs to consider economic growth but does not have to stimulate the growth too aggressively gauging from past experiences worldwide monetary policy has been used as a means to pursue economic growth but has been difficult to achieve the targets on the contrary it may lead to higher inflation or stagflation yi said in his article no matter how many measures we take even tens of thousands of those they will never work if we fail to tame the money issuance said yi who stressed that the monetary policy is the key to stabilize prices the large recession that followed the global financial crisis of 2008 09 triggered unprecedented monetary policy easing around the world central banks in some major advanced economies started deploying a new set of instruments to provide liquidity by using subzero interest rates and large scale asset purchase programs of domestic assets including government bonds mortgage backed securities and private sector debt that became commonly known as unconventional monetary policy robert subbaraman nomura securities head of global macro research said that unlike global peers the chinese central bank has maintained a relatively neutral policy stance and has no strong reason to take unconventional monetary steps given the still stable gdp growth rate another reason preventing a further easing of the monetary policy is the need to prevent systemic financial risks but fiscal policies can play a major role in supporting economic growth in china he said when unconventional monetary policies are becoming conventional it will be difficult to come back which in turn may lead to corporate debt surges or stimulate property bubbles the latest macroeconomic indicators in china including the official purchasing managers index pmi issued by the national bureau of statistics and the caixin pmi signaled a rebound in manufacturing activity during november economists said economic growth is stabilizing and business confidence is improving in light of supportive government policies raymond yeung chief economist for china at anz bank said there is little room for the pboc to lower interest rates next year in order to control the debt growth monetary policy is not a priority to spur long term economic growth and we need to use credit very carefully china is seeking to strike a balance between supporting a slowing economy that has been affected by the trade friction with the united states and controlling financial risks in the next stage we should continue to make good use of structural monetary policy tools create and improve policy tools as needed dredge the transmission of monetary policy to support economic restructuring and optimization said pboc s yi some experts said the short term rebound of productive activities may not indicate a bottoming out of the economy as strong growth headwinds remain so further supportive policies are required especially from the fiscal side to maintain a gdp growth rate of above 6 percent

the stock market has now priced in a perfect resolution for all of its erstwhile perils wall street shills would have you believe that since the fed has turned dovish it will always be able to push stocks higher the trade war is about to reach a peaceful conclusion and that will be enough to fix all that ails the global economy a no deal brexit is off the table and a smooth transition out of the eu will occur peace will soon break out in hong kong and its troubled economy will have no contagious global economic effects and there will be a sharp rebound in eps growth from the current earnings recession because well just because we need one however beneath the surface of this economic charade the carcass is rotting and the stink can be smelled by anyone who isn t willingly holding their nose to this point the leveraged loan market which consists of loans made to highly indebted and barely solvent entities has seen an increase of 100 since 2007 according to the bank for international settlements there are about 16 trillion worth of u s business debt about 1 3rd of which is comprised of leveraged loans and bonds that are rated junk half of the bonds that are in the category of investment grade have a rating that is bbb which is just one level above junk if that isn t scary enough dealers are willing to hold in inventory 12 billion of these types of loans according to bloomberg the salient question is what will happen come the next recession when panicked holders try to sell trillions of dollars worth of distressed debt to a market that currently provides liquidity for just 075 of the market related the free money bubble is about to burst the conference board s leading economic index declined for a third consecutive month in october and its six month growth rate turned negative for the first time since may 2016 meanwhile washington d c is mired in self destruct mode there is still no passage of a phase one trade deal even though one was announced on oct 11th with much fanfare no passage of the usmca trade deal even though it has been sitting on nancy pelosi s desk for a year no passage of a budget deal and so the government is forced to fund operations by passing continuing resolutions this c r that was just passed only funds the government until dec 20th maybe we should be happy that washington is broken because when it works all they can agree on is how to spend a lot more money to this point october government spending hit a record 380 billion which led to a 34 jump in the year over year deficit and caused 134 5 billion worth of red ink to be spilled in one month the u s is mired in permanent qe is posting trillion dollar deficits without end has waring political parties and operates its government without a budget we are sadly looking more like a banana republic every day investors have placed their faith in a fed that has continuously proven its incompetence former fed chair janet yellen avowed not too long ago that there would not be another financial crisis in our lifetimes however she is now warning the odds of a recession are higher than normal and at a level that frankly i am not comfortable with she was quoted saying this at the world business forum on nov 21st what i find most disturbing about her comments made was what she said about retirees and savers yellen actually bemoaned the fact that people are forced to save money in the bank and get nothing for doing so in fact she was actually concerned that they are getting penalized for doing the right thing and falling further behind inflation what ms yellen raised interest rates just 50 bps in her total four year tenure at the fed but only now she is worried about savers and the fed s role in fostering the wealth gap but what she has not and cannot admit to is how bad the next recession is going to be while she did elude to the fact that central banks no longer have room to lower borrowing costs she fails to understand that her willingness to keep offering free money for many years likely means her recession prediction is really a depression forecast this is based on the record debt levels and historic asset bubbles that have been engendered by the fed s actions as the march towards global recession proceeds onward the composite eu pmi for both manufacturing and services released last friday fell to 50 3 from 50 6 orders fell for the third straight month and employment growth also slowed the australia uk and japan pmis all show these economies are still contracting the official nbs manufacturing pmi in china fell to 49 3 in october from the previous month s 49 8 any reading below 50 shows economic contraction the only slightly better news was found in the u s flash services sector purchasing managers index in november it rose to 51 6 from 50 6 but still is indicative of an economy that is barely growing even the better than expected durable goods orders being pumped on financial news networks isn t the real story while the headline month over month reading for october climbed by 0 6 the year over year number declined by 0 7 and the important core capital goods new orders figure fell by 0 8 yoy falling capital goods means business are not investing in productive assets and gdp growth will indeed suffer as a result wall street shills keep wishing for a turn in the global economy in 2020 because a booming rebound has already been priced into equities but the only turn we are getting so far is one to the downside that is going to be really bad news for the buy and hold crowd i want to close with a bit of central bank hypocrisy the following is an excerpt from a paper published by two economists at the st louis fed scott a wolla and kaitlyn frerking they warned about the potential dangers involved when a nation s central bank buys its own debt related are investors being lulled into a false sense of security a solution some countries with high levels of unsustainable debt have tried is printing money in this scenario the government borrows money by issuing bonds and then orders the central bank to buy those bonds by creating printing money history has taught us however that this type of policy leads to extremely high rates of inflation hyperinflation and often ends in economic ruin the paper published this month never acknowledges that this is exactly what the fed has done and continues to do to this day not just a little bit but in a big way the fed has already permanently monetized nearly 4 trillion worth of debt and it is just getting started down this pernicious path this strategy is a page taken from the how to be a banana republic playbook and has been repackaged by some far left politicians and sudo economists and renamed as the modern monetary theory mmt is just a euphemism for debt monetization nevertheless no matter what you call it creating new money from nothing to purchase government debt has never worked in the history of economics and has always led to economic ruin there will be times when debt will be explicitly restructured deflation and other secular periods consisting of inflationary defaults mmt qe helicopter money or whatever name jerome powell is willing to put on it investors need to model these dynamics to make sure they are on the correct side of the cycle depending upon how the government is defaulting on this debt by

if mantega s complaints look dumb in retrospect trump s latest broadside looks even dumber mantega s complaint came when brazil s economy was surging on the back of strong commodity prices which themselves were driven by the voracious manufacturing appetite of china if guido mantega s complaints look dumb in retrospect donald trump s latest broadside looks even dumber bloomberg the strong brazilian real hadn t stopped the country s economy from going on a great run in the subsequent decade the us far outstripped brazil s growth despite a steadily strengthening dollar currency values matter greatly to competitiveness of course and central banks can use interest rates to manipulate them but the arrow of causation also works in the other direction a weak economy will lead to a weak currency and vice versa that is the story of the us dollar and the brazilian real over the last decade the weak dollar in 2010 was a product of the weakness of the us economy low rates and quantitative easing were deemed necessary to keep the economy ticking over and allow the country to clear its debts outright deflation appeared a real risk higher rates from the fed at that point might have weakened the real but they might also have stopped us economic growth in its tracks which would have been very bad news for brazil advertisement is brazil manipulating its currency lower not at all its central bank s target rate the selic is very low at present by brazilian standards but only because inflation is at its lowest this century further as the country s use of dollar denominated debt has increased over the last decade a weak real makes interest payments more expensive and increases the risk of a crisis no country knows this better than argentina which has suffered several epic crises of devaluation and default in living memory and where voters have just kicked out a president mauricio macri in large part for failing to tame inflation brazil s currency is weak because the economy and inflation are weak ap macri failed to stop further sharp devaluations of the argentine peso despite massive overnight rates of more than 50 per cent another disadvantage of a weak currency is inflation and argentines know all about that it too is currently running at more than 50 per cent any implication that argentina is deliberately weakening its currency for competitive advantage is beyond absurdity in the long run the currency war has had only one winner gdp per capita in both brazil and argentina is less than a quarter that of the us and both countries have fallen further behind even as their currencies have weakened advertisement why then is trump choosing to open a new front in the trade war on two countries that currently have little or no ability to harm the us it is possible that he is being crazy like a fox and trying to convince people that he is capable of anything such a strategy the argument goes might convince china of the need to do what he wants the risk with such a strategy is to give the appearance that he has no understanding of how the economy works and thus the more likely explanation for his behaviour is that he truly doesn t understand what he is doing meanwhile brazil and argentina have shown the us the best way to weaken a currency if your economy slows the chances are that your currency will get cheaper that is what has happened over the last decade to the big economies of south america and in the much shorter term the sharp sell off in the dollar on monday in response to disappointing data on manufacturing suggests that the president should be careful what he wishes for today s weak brazilian real appears to be exactly what guido mantega wished for back in 2010 but nobody in brazil could possibly have wished for the disastrous decade that made that weak currency possible jauthers bloomberg net this column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or bloomberg lp and its owners

hey there time traveller this article was published 02 12 2019 1588 days ago so information in it may no longer be current washington there are lots of ways it seems to land on one of president donald trump s tariff hit lists countries can allegedly steal u s trade secrets or they can introduce a tax that the trump administration doesn t like or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of u s policy in favour of a pugnacious america first approach trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against america s trading partners he s also strived to replace a 25 year old north american trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking so far though he s been stymied by the u s congress people walk by the new york stock exchange tuesday dec 3 2019 stocks fell broadly tuesday after president donald trump cast doubt over the potential for a trade deal with china this year and threatened to impose tariffs on french goods ap photo mark lennihan here s a look at some of the major items on trump s trade agenda ___ a trade war with china for the past 17 months the world s top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s the trump administration accuses beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world s supreme leader in such cutting edge industries as robotics and driverless cars the administration backed by many u s business groups alleges that china steals technology forces u s companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes china s tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape trump has also railed against america s gaping trade deficit with china 380 billion last year the president has imposed tariffs on more than 360 billion worth of chinese imports and plans to tax an additional 160 billion in goods on dec 15 a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything china ships to the united states beijing has hit 120 billion in u s products with retaliatory tariffs thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration in october the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some chinese goods beijing agreed to buy large quantities of u s farm exports but they have failed to finalize that so called phase 1 agreement and on tuesday trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election ___ metals mayhem last year trump unsheathed a little used weapon in u s trade policy section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to america s national security using that justification he imposed tariffs of 25 tariff on imported steel and 10 on aluminum but he exempted several countries argentina and brazil for instance avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the u s with one early morning tweet monday trump demolished that arrangement he accused argentina and brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets it s true that brazil s real and the argentina s peso have plummeted against the u s dollar but it s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation rather it s because their economies are in crisis brazil is contending with double digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation huge debts and widespread poverty ___ nafta 2 0 trump last year browbeat mexico and canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the north american free trade agreement but his version the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca still awaits approval from the u s congress having taken effect in 1994 the original nafta erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc many u s manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low wage mexican labour and ship products back to the united states duty free trump and other critics accused nafta of wiping out american manufacturing jobs trump warned that if he couldn t negotiate a better deal he d kill nafta altogether usmca emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations the revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the united states among other things it requires that 40 to 45 of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least 16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal s duty free status but house democrats who must approve usmca insist that trump s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced they ve been negotiating changes with trump s top trade official robert lighthizer but have yet to resolve their differences ___ france s tech tax the administration on monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100 on cheese wine lipstick and other french imports collectively worth 2 4 billion the reason france last summer passed a digital services tax that targets american tech giants such as amazon and google the french tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low tax european union countries it imposes a 3 annual levy on french revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros 830 million and french revenue exceeding 25 million euros the trump administration has also criticized the french tax for targeting companies revenue not their profits and for being retroactive french president emmanuel macron has threatened a robust response from europe if the u s proceeds with the tariffs ___ taxing foreign cars at trump s request the commerce department launched an investigation into auto imports and then dutifully declared that they too posed a threat to america s national security that could clear the way for trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in trump s protectionist policies the united states last year imported 192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and 159 billion in auto parts virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on

interview with luis de guindos vice president of the ecb conducted by pablo rodríguez suanzes on 25 november 2019 how are you finding life in frankfurt frankfurt is a nice city i like it the ecb is the most important institution in the framework of the eu and of the euro area in particular exposure to the public is very different to when you re in government here the relationship is mainly with the european parliament through hearings and with the public through speeches is my life better it s different how do you feel about not being able to speak as freely as before i can keep speaking normally i still attend the economic and financial affairs council ecofin each week we have discussions in various forums on issues around monetary and economic policy and financial stability so i have something to offer but my contributions aren t political do you miss it i don t miss anything that was my job for six years i m not at all bored here when and why did you decide you wanted to try to become the vice president of the ecb i wanted to leave the government at the end of its first term i spoke to president rajoy and we said it could be a possibility and it was very attractive to me it s the most important institution in the euro area very prestigious it takes very significant decisions which made it an extremely attractive proposition how do you explain the arrival of people like you or christine lagarde who have a different profile to the one that ecb executive board members have traditionally had i don t think anything was predetermined or premeditated members of the governing council have different profiles and each of them contributes according to their experience i contribute my knowledge of the european economy and the financial system and my experience taking decisions when the spanish economy was at its most delicate moment what role does politics play in the ecb the 25 members of the governing council don t always agree although many of the decisions we take are unanimous there are those who think that the situation requires further measures and others who think we have already gone too far we look for a consensus the decisions are very democratic one governor one vote but actually taking a vote is an exception not the rule in recent months there has been very strong unprecedented public criticism i m not at all concerned by the fact that there are differing views that s healthy and it s normal because there are 25 of us but what has been happening in recent months has not been very helpful it hasn t undermined the effectiveness of the september package of measures because it went ahead as planned but it s much better to be united we are a collegial institution and once we have reached an agreement everyone should defend it this is not to say for example that i agreed with every element of the package but once something has been approved i defend it is the consensus broken no this is actually one of the top priorities of the new president each of us will have our own ideas about the situation and the appropriate measures to take that s one thing but it s something else entirely to air disagreements in public you and mr draghi have met at various forums since 2011 how was the past year when you were working side by side mario draghi will go down in history as one of the founding fathers of the euro even though he isn t one in the strictest sense there were two stages to his presidency the first was saving the euro with his famous whatever it takes the second was fighting deflation these were his two main interventions and he was successful in both he will be remembered very positively when he uttered those famous words in london in 2012 he changed the outlook in the euro area the banking union was implemented right away four or five years ago we were facing the risk of deflation and the asset purchase programme was launched which brought the ecb in line with other central banks mario draghi has modernised the instruments of monetary policy despite this his critics point to the fact that he has left behind a european economy that is drugged with low growth rates at zero and inflation very far from the objective monetary policy is not the reason for this it s been the main driver of the economic recovery and growth in europe 11 million jobs have been created in no small part thanks to monetary policy this is the main thing although there are collateral effects the problem we have at the moment is that these monetary policy decisions need to be complemented by other instruments sometimes it seemed like you were not exactly among mr draghi s most ardent supporters i have always supported president draghi but when you heard him being talked about as the saviour of the euro or the person who had rescued spain it didn t sit well with you well he didn t see it like that either in spain we rescued ourselves off our own backs with the help of our european partners including the ecb mr draghi made a key contribution but there s no single saviour here it was a set of circumstances and a matter of everyone carrying out their responsibilities in their individual roles as vice president will you continue to appear alongside president lagarde i have no idea i suppose it will continue like that it s an unwritten rule a tradition traditions can change but they can also be of value brexit trade and currency wars geopolitical tensions all of this in an environment of lower growth zero rates and stimulus plans when you were in government you joked that you slept like a baby in that you woke up crying every two hours how are you sleeping now well very well i wouldn t wish what happened in 2012 on my worst enemy the situation now is totally different back then we were on the brink of collapse the spanish economy the italian economy doubts about the integrity of the euro the situation of the spanish banking industry was terrifying and contagion was spreading to the treasury it was a dramatic situation i don t think there is going to be a recession in europe that s very unlikely but yes i am worried that we will have two or three years of subdued growth of below potential growth that is what is worrying me at the moment and that this subdued growth may mean that the price stability objective is not met monetary policy is not the philosopher s stone it cannot be used to fix everything other policies are needed so do you echo the calls of presidents draghi and lagarde for countries with fiscal space above all germany to boost spending and investment this is important yes but my proposal goes further than that our current system of national fiscal policies and national budgets with a set of rules like the stability and growth pact is not sufficient we need a fiscal instrument of the sort proposed by president macron a few years ago an instrument that has the capacity to act countercyclically and that complements monetary policy but it s something you were already asking for when you were a minister and it s not happening now and even in the best of cases it won t happen for another four or five years and without that level of firepower we have to call for it because it is sensible it is not a question of whether it is possible but rather one of reality it would be very important for the entire euro area and i am convinced that it will come about sooner rather than later what are your thoughts on the spanish economy the spanish economy is doing well it is competitive and enjoying above average growth and that is the result of the reforms in 2012 and 2013 and society s efforts it is doing well that s the truth it has been affected by the economic slowdown like the rest of the euro area but growth is still at 2 why the financial sector was cleaned up and the economy is now competitive those are the two reasons why it is doing better spain didn t have any issues during the growth phase of the cycle but now we are maybe seeing the effects of not having made any reforms in recent years deferred budgets or adjusted deficits during growth periods my recommendation is for the euro area as a whole not just for spain if you have debt approaching 100 of gdp you have to reduce it to be less vulnerable are you worried by the political uncertainty political uncertainty is an important factor because we always need stable governments capable of taking action and this is of course quite obvious we don t have the political stability necessary to put into place the necessary measures and policies including a budget what do they think here in frankfurt about the fact that the budget has been deferred since the time when you were still a minister spain has continued to reduce its public debt it could have been reduced more but it could also have been reduced less in any case there is one fundamental factor the growth differential in the spanish economy this now comes from a financial sector that doesn t have the same doubts hanging over it as it did five to seven years ago and it is competitive the most important thing in contrast to the previous and other growth cycles is that it is growing without an increase in loans and without a real estate bubble with lending growth that is below nominal gdp and a current account surplus in the balance of payments as long as these two things continue the spanish economy will keep growing faster than the rest the recommendation which is also valid for portugal greece and ireland and even for italy is this stabilise the banking sector and the credit markets and maintain competitiveness then you will do better than average the public message is quite clear are there more discreet messages in private no none i say the same thing in public that i do in private have the ecb s non standard measures run their course no we can still increase bond purchases or lower interest rates further which means that we still have the same tools available what is happening is that the secondary effects are becoming more tangible and each measure has less of a return i look at the effects and these can vary greatly i am worried by risk taking in the asset management sector against the background of low interest rates it is a matter of concern for me banks are now better capitalised they have more liquidity and they are much safer than they were but they face low profitability which is a problem supervision is centralised and is more suitable than when it was the remit of national authorities but in the area of asset management and investment funds what we see is that in a low interest rate environment their investment strategy always moves towards increased risk in the sense of assets with potentially greater returns and greater risks but that are less liquid and there is also more leveraging not to the extent seen in the united states but still more than before and the supervision in this sector is not comparable with that in the banking sector there is a risk if they are asked for units to be paid out they have to do so within two or three days i see a potential risk of liquidity imbalance that is what worries me the most at the moment and while it may not technically be a secondary effect of monetary policy because its causes are structural i am concerned by the banking sector s low profitability are you in favour of changing or widening the ecb s mandate or of defining more precisely what is below but close to 2 we have to look at that yes the ecb set out its strategy in 1998 and revised it in 2003 and while it can t be a change of mandate since that is defined in the treaty we could revisit the definition of price stability and what are the steps to achieve that i am in favour of starting the discussion but we haven t had it the president has announced it but this is not a matter of one or two governing council meetings it is something that must be done without haste but decisively what about helicopter money i e giving money directly to citizens no that has never been considered but should it be considered just like changing the mandate no absolutely not there is a lot of talk currently about japanification about secular stagnation add to this demographics and the fact that there is a smaller working population with lower productivity than before what scares you the most from a journalistic standpoint talking about japanification is attractive but there are actually many differences while european demographics are not brilliant they cannot be compared with japan the situation facing banks here is not as bad no real estate bubble has burst here the way it did there the parallels are in low inflation low interest rates and low growth but the outlooks are different and i don t think that the term really applies to the european economy will edis be complete when you leave office yes i think it will and quite a few years before that in fact one of the german proposals is to limit the amount of sovereign debt held by financial entities spain has experienced precisely that with only national entities continuing to buy public debt at the same rate does that seem reasonable to you it s a starting point completing edis is crucial but we also have to take measures simultaneously to limit how much risk is generated by certain countries in my experience with banco popular and the savings banks the problem wasn t public debt the underlying problem was other types of loans that led to solvency problems does the issue with popular villarejo and bbva bother you we do not comment on specific situations of course european banking supervision and risk surveillance is on the lookout for anything that might have an effect on financial stability but so far we have not seen anything
washington there are lots of ways it seems to land on one of president donald trump s tariff hit lists countries can allegedly steal u s trade secrets or they can introduce a tax that the trump administration doesn t like or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of u s policy in favour of a pugnacious america first approach trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against america s trading partners he s also strived to replace a 25 year old north american trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking so far though he s been stymied by the u s congress here s a look at some of the major items on trump s trade agenda ___ a trade war with china for the past 17 months the world s top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s the trump administration accuses beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world s supreme leader in such cutting edge industries as robotics and driverless cars the administration backed by many u s business groups alleges that china steals technology forces u s companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes china s tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape trump has also railed against america s gaping trade deficit with china 380 billion last year the president has imposed tariffs on more than 360 billion worth of chinese imports and plans to tax an additional 160 billion in goods on dec 15 a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything china ships to the united states beijing has hit 120 billion in u s products with retaliatory tariffs thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration in october the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some chinese goods beijing agreed to buy large quantities of u s farm exports but they have failed to finalize that so called phase 1 agreement and on tuesday trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election ___ metals mayhem last year trump unsheathed a little used weapon in u s trade policy section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to america s national security using that justification he imposed tariffs of 25 tariff on imported steel and 10 on aluminum but he exempted several countries argentina and brazil for instance avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the u s with one early morning tweet monday trump demolished that arrangement he accused argentina and brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets it s true that brazil s real and the argentina s peso have plummeted against the u s dollar but it s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation rather it s because their economies are in crisis brazil is contending with double digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation huge debts and widespread poverty ___ nafta 2 0 trump last year browbeat mexico and canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the north american free trade agreement but his version the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca still awaits approval from the u s congress having taken effect in 1994 the original nafta erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc many u s manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low wage mexican labour and ship products back to the united states duty free trump and other critics accused nafta of wiping out american manufacturing jobs trump warned that if he couldn t negotiate a better deal he d kill nafta altogether usmca emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations the revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the united states among other things it requires that 40 to 45 of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least 16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal s duty free status but house democrats who must approve usmca insist that trump s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced they ve been negotiating changes with trump s top trade official robert lighthizer but have yet to resolve their differences ___ france s tech tax the administration on monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100 on cheese wine lipstick and other french imports collectively worth 2 4 billion the reason france last summer passed a digital services tax that targets american tech giants such as amazon and google the french tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low tax european union countries it imposes a 3 annual levy on french revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros 830 million and french revenue exceeding 25 million euros the trump administration has also criticized the french tax for targeting companies revenue not their profits and for being retroactive french president emmanuel macron has threatened a robust response from europe if the u s proceeds with the tariffs ___ taxing foreign cars at trump s request the commerce department launched an investigation into auto imports and then dutifully declared that they too posed a threat to america s national security that could clear the way for trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in trump s protectionist policies the united states last year imported 192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and 159 billion in auto parts virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of japan and the european union prime minister shinzo abe has said that trump vowed to forgo tariffs on japan s cars as part of a mini trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year in may trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with japan and eu as the mid november approached trump said he d decide on the tariffs very soon but the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration

experts warn of recession fx scarcity imminent why 2020 budget estimate for oil price production is unrealistic economists and other stakeholders in the oil and gas sector yesterday predicted a bumpy road for nigeria s n146 96 trillion economy insisting that prevailing realities at the international oil market could worsen the nation s fiscal outlook especially the implementation of the n10 33 trillion 2020 budget they also raised the alarm over another slip into recession and shortage of foreign exchange given that the nation s foreign reserve has depleted to about 40 95 billion the experts spoke ahead of a meeting of the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec and other allies next tomorrow where an agreement that could impact future oil prices may be reached though they expressed optimism in the continuous extension of oil production cut by opec and its allies to stabilise oil prices at the international market they noted that nigeria s economy with reference especially to the 2020 budget remains volatile in the proposed 2020 budget the federal government estimated oil sales to stand at 2 18 million bpd at a price of 57 per barrel while the exchange rate is expected to remain n305 per dollar but last week the prices fell eroding the increase recorded in november west texas intermediate dropped more than four percent to settle at 55 17 brent plummeted by 1 44 to settle at 62 43 while bonny light slumped by 1 9 to settle at 62 15 on monday afternoon wti stood at 56 63 brent at 62 08 while bonny light was 62 15 already the international energy agency iea has pointed to a looming oil glut especially due to uncertainties clouding the global economy iea had reduced demand growth forecast by 100 000 bpd for both 2019 and 2020 to 1 million bpd and 1 2 million bpd respectively while data from the central bank of nigeria cbn shows that nigeria s foreign reserves dropped by 812 million to 40 95 billion as at october 18 2019 there have been doubts over growth rate for the global economy most analysts are pessimistic about a stabilising oil price due to the current u s china trade war brexit and the crippling growth of major economies particularly china india germany and others gross domestic product gdp in nigeria was worth 397 30 billion in 2018 representing 0 64 percent of gdp world economy it averaged 125 26 billion from 1960 until 2018 reaching an all time high of 568 50 billion in 2014 and a record low of 4 20 usd billion in 1960 while the gdp grew by 2 28 per cent year on year in real terms in the third quarter of 2019 as against 1 81 percent recorded in the third quarter of 2018 the stakeholders feared that the looming glut and possible cut in nigeria s production share at the opec meeting could erode the increase in the gdp especially as inflation rate in nigeria rose to its highest in eight months hitting 11 61 percent in october according to the national bureau of statistics the 2020 fiscal budget remains in a deficit noted prof segun ajibola a former chairman of council chartered institute of bankers of nigeria and dean college of postgraduate studies caleb university according to him any cut in nigeria s quota below the projected level of 2 18 barrels per day would have a devastating effect on the budget implementation worsening the projected deficit as we inch close to the end of 2019 the foreign exchange reserve is at a low of 39 billion at the current price of about 63 the price is still okay for the 2020 budget but there is no assurance that it won t go down another challenge is the penchant of some opec members for disobeying quotas especially those from the middle east ajibola said the only way out for nigeria ajibola explained is to reduce overdependence on oil as a source of revenue through a complete overhaul of the monolithic structure that has been the hallmark of nigeria s economy since the 1970s in the face of mounting debt service and growing temptation to borrow an additional 29 billion ajibola said a cut in nigeria s quota would drive down foreign exchange earnings the economy is still stressed and we must pray and work hard so that it does not slip into another recession he warned renowned energy economist prof adeola adenikinju of the department of economics and centre for petroleum energy economics and law university of ibadan said the outlook for crude oil price in 2020 is not very bright he observed that the price of oil could hover around 58 per barrel in 2020 a development that would slightly be above the 2020 budget price of 57 opec had previously adjusted nigeria s quota to 1 77 million bpd up from 1 69 million bpd though nigeria since march this year reportedly failed to comply the minister of state for petroleum resources said production has been reset to fully comply with the cartel adenikinju said further the fact is that nigeria s budget might become harder to implement there will be no room for fiscal buffer and hence more reliance on debt to finance government expenses the outlook for the states would even be worse as the new minimum wage kicks in and with limited alternative sources of funding he noted that the current fiscal projection for the oil sector is unrealistic it would be better he said for the national assembly to adopt a more conservative estimate for oil price and oil production to allow for a more realistic budget that will prepare the economy against various vulnerabilities and uncertainties in the global economy though nigeria had enjoyed waiver from opec s production cut it might be difficult for such exemption to be granted said habeeb jaiyeola pricewaterhousecoopers associate director energy utilities resources if we are granted a waiver it will be good for us because our economy depends clearly on oil that will allow us to push volume into the market and generate more revenue however if they do not grant us a waiver it will have direct effect on our economy because our revenue is directly linked to oil jaiyeola said the chairman international energy services ies ltd dr diran fawibe said the outcome of opec s meeting would most likely be an extension of current production cut noting that there was a need to firm up the prices such that oil would remain above 60 per barrel urging nigeria to support a policy that would make price favourable particularly for budget implementation fawibe said large producers like russia and saudi would likely agree to cut in production the oil estimate for the budget is too optimistic nigeria s quota cannot be up to 2 2 million barrel per day diran said he however advised the country to work towards producing condensates since the opec production cut does not include condensates this diran said would shore up production level and increase revenue imo state governor emeka ihedioha meanwhile has warned that the the days of crude oil are numbered he made the disclosure in owerri the state capital during the ahiajoku festival which traditionally ushers in the harvest season urging nigerians to as a matter of urgency prepare for life after crude oil the governor stressed till date palm oil remains one of the most important cash crops in the region and it could serve as a major driver for economic development

investors to evaluate the company s results in the same way management does management believes that supplementing gaap disclosure with non gaap disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the company s operational performance and allows for meaningful period to period comparisons and analysis of trends in the company s business further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non gaap measures the provision of supplemental non gaap information can allow for a comparison of the company s relative performance against other companies that also report non gaap operating results non gaap diluted earnings per share excludes to the extent applicable the impact of the following items stock based compensation amortization of acquisition related intangibles and previously the net amortization of debt discount on the company s convertible senior notes as well as income tax adjustments these items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period but instead for the company s long term benefit over multiple periods specifically management is excluding the following items from its non gaap earnings per share as applicable for the periods presented in the q3 fy20 financial statements and for its non gaap estimates for q4 and fy20 stock based expenses the company s compensation strategy includes the use of stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and executives it is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long term employee retention rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period thus stock based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period amortization of purchased intangibles the company views amortization of acquisition related intangible assets such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company s research and development efforts trade names customer lists and customer relationships and in some cases acquired lease intangibles as items arising from pre acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition while these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non gaap measures management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation gains on strategic investments net upon the adoption of accounting standards update 2016 01 on february 1 2018 the company is required to record all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its gaap and non gaap estimates for future periods the company is required to record all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses the company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its gaap and non gaap estimates for future periods income tax effects and adjustments the company utilizes a fixed long term projected non gaap tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition related costs since each of these can vary in size and frequency when projecting this long term rate the company evaluated a three year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non cash items stock based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles the projected rate also assumes no new acquisitions in the three year period and considers other factors including the company s expected tax structure its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the company operates for fiscal 2020 the company uses a projected non gaap tax rate of 22 5 which reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions the non gaap tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons including the rapidly evolving global tax environment significant changes in the company s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other changes to the company s strategy or business operations the company will re evaluate its long term rate as appropriate

leading the slide all but seven of the dow 30 blue chips finished in negative territory with boeing american express and united technologies the biggest drags president trump threw another curve ball into the trade picture monday when he announced on twitter that he would reinstate steel and aluminum tariffs on brazil and argentina he accused the two nations of weakening their currencies to gain competitive advantage against the u s an oft repeated rebuke that he s cited in his ongoing push for lower or even negative interest rates from the federal reserve brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers trump said in monday morning tweet he then pivoted to the federal reserve saying the central bank should act so that countries of which there are many no longer take advantage of our strong dollar by further devaluing their currencies this makes it very hard for our farmers to fairly export their goods lower rates loosen fed stock futures had been trending up early monday two surveys over the weekend showed that china s manufacturing sector rallied to an eight month high in november and european manufacturing data showed a better than expected easing in the sector s contraction the strong data suggested that china s economy could be stabilizing after months of a brutal slowdown quieting some fears about the trade war s toll on one of the world s most powerful economic engines but trump s early morning announcement quickly cooled markets by midday all three market measures were in the red the stock market s early gains in the futures markets melted away after the president s early morning tweet said chris rupkey chief financial economist of mufg union bank in a note then came monday s u s manufacturing report about a half hour after trading began u s manufacturing disappointed in november according to the institute for supply management its manufacturing index dropped to 48 1 in november from 48 3 in october coming in well below analyst expectations readings below 50 indicate business conditions are getting worse global trade remains the most significant cross industry issue timothy fiore chair of the ism s manufacturing business survey committee said in the report with manufacturing being in deep trouble globally today s pmi reading of 48 1 could mean that the sector won t avoid a recession so the consumer economy would have to remain robust to sustain growth in the u s ken berman a strategist with gorilla trades wrote in commentary monday also on monday the commerce department reported a downward revision in september construction spending that showed a 0 3 decline instead of the 0 5 surge as originally reported november was a blockbuster month for wall street as strong earnings and trade hopes yielded 10 record breaking closes for u s indexes the standard poor s 500 is still up nearly 25 for the year heading into a period that s typically high performing for stocks december could also bring progress on the trade front as the terms of an agreement by the united states mexico and canada could be finalized while resolution on the first phase of a trade deal with china continues to flit in and out of reach last week trump said that negotiators were in the final throes of sorting out a trade deal with china that would bring the first phase of resolution in the 16 month conflict but over the weekend china s state run newspaper the global times reported that negotiators are optimistic about a deal before the lunar new year in january but that rollbacks of tariffs are essential if a deal is to be reached in an interview with fox business on monday commerce secretary wilbur ross said progress with china has been one step forward one step backward and made it clear trump was not looking to compromise on tariffs ross said trump to move forward with the tariff increases slated for dec 15 if a phase one deal wasn t inked by then that won t interfere with this year s christmas nobody s reordering stuff after the 15th of december ross said retailers have stocked up so it s a very good time if we have to put more tariffs on when trump announced the reinstated the steel and aluminum tariffs he pointed to the strength of the markets as evidence that his hard line trade policies weren t hurting the u s economy u s markets are up as much as 21 since the announcement of tariffs on 3 1 2018 trump tweeted monday and the u s is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china on friday a top mexican trade negotiator said that terms of a replacement for the north american free trade agreement one of the trump administration s key goals could be cemented early this week fueling hopes that congress could approve it before the end of 2019 the trump administration reached an agreement with the governments in canada and mexico last year but it must be approved by the house and the senate before the changes can become official trump s renewed tariffs on steel and aluminum dealt a surprise blow to one of brazil s most crucial industries in a vulnerable moment for the economy as unemployment hovers above 10 and growth continues to slow brazilian steel exports to the u s accounted for roughly 2 6 billion last year making the u s one of brazil s biggest markets for steel and analysts expected the tariffs to be painful in argentina where steel and aluminum exports represent roughly 700 million the unexpected news comes as the nation is undergoing a transition of power if the tariffs persist they will be one of the earliest diplomatic tests to face the incoming presidency of alberto fernández a leftist politician who will take office within a week before leaving the white house for a trip to a nato gathering in london trump told reporters he had given brazil and argentina a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers trump said our steel companies will be very happy and our farmers will be very happy the flurry of potential trade activity is coalescing during what is typically a period of low volatility and high advances for stocks said sam stovall president of cfra research seasonal optimism typically gathers additional steam in the final month of the year as investors look to earnings projections for the coming year indeed since 1945 the s p 500 posted its best average return in december along with the highest frequency of advance and lowest level of volatility stovall wrote in a note to investors monday trade relations earnings estimates and valuations will likely influence trading this month while the angle of ascent for u s economic growth along with the presidential primaries will garner additional attention as the new year progresses
washington there are lots of ways it seems to land on one of president donald trump s tariff hit lists countries can allegedly steal u s trade secrets or they can introduce a tax that the trump administration doesn t like or they can be unlucky enough to find themselves in such dire economic straits that their currencies go into a freefall making good on his campaign pledge to upend decades of u s policy in favour of a pugnacious america first approach trump has launched a series of protectionist broadsides against america s trading partners he s also strived to replace a 25 year old north american trade agreement with an updated version more to his liking so far though he s been stymied by the u s congress here s a look at some of the major items on trump s trade agenda ___ a trade war with china for the past 17 months the world s top two economies have been locked in the biggest global trade war since the 1930s the trump administration accuses beijing of cheating in its quest to become the world s supreme leader in such cutting edge industries as robotics and driverless cars the administration backed by many u s business groups alleges that china steals technology forces u s companies to hand over trade secrets as the price of admission to its vast market and unfairly subsidizes china s tech companies while hogtying their foreign competitors in red tape trump has also railed against america s gaping trade deficit with china 380 billion last year the president has imposed tariffs on more than 360 billion worth of chinese imports and plans to tax an additional 160 billion in goods on dec 15 a move that would extend his import taxes to just about everything china ships to the united states beijing has hit 120 billion in u s products with retaliatory tariffs thirteen rounds of negotiations have failed to achieve even a preliminary breakthrough beijing is reluctant to make the kind of substantive policy reforms that might satisfy the administration in october the two sides agreed to a modest deal that left the thorniest issues unresolved trump agreed not to proceed with plans to raise tariffs on some chinese goods beijing agreed to buy large quantities of u s farm exports but they have failed to finalize that so called phase 1 agreement and on tuesday trump warned that an agreement might not be reached until after the 2020 presidential election ___ metals mayhem last year trump unsheathed a little used weapon in u s trade policy section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 to declare foreign steel and aluminum a threat to america s national security using that justification he imposed tariffs of 25 tariff on imported steel and 10 on aluminum but he exempted several countries argentina and brazil for instance avoided the tariffs by agreeing instead to accept quotas on their metal exports to the u s with one early morning tweet monday trump demolished that arrangement he accused argentina and brazil of manipulating their currencies lower in order to give their exporters an unfair price advantage in foreign markets it s true that brazil s real and the argentina s peso have plummeted against the u s dollar but it s not because their governments have engaged in currency manipulation rather it s because their economies are in crisis brazil is contending with double digit unemployment and economic stagnation after two years of deep recession argentina is suffering from an economic crisis marked by runaway inflation huge debts and widespread poverty ___ nafta 2 0 trump last year browbeat mexico and canada into agreeing to a rewrite of the north american free trade agreement but his version the u s mexico canada agreement or usmca still awaits approval from the u s congress having taken effect in 1994 the original nafta erased most trade barriers between the three economies and created a powerful regional trade bloc many u s manufacturers moved factories south of the border to capitalize on low wage mexican labour and ship products back to the united states duty free trump and other critics accused nafta of wiping out american manufacturing jobs trump warned that if he couldn t negotiate a better deal he d kill nafta altogether usmca emerged after more than a year of contentious negotiations the revamped deal is meant to return some factories and factory jobs to the united states among other things it requires that 40 to 45 of autos must be built where auto workers earn at least 16 an hour in order to qualify for the trade deal s duty free status but house democrats who must approve usmca insist that trump s version needs to be tweaked to ensure that it can be enforced they ve been negotiating changes with trump s top trade official robert lighthizer but have yet to resolve their differences ___ france s tech tax the administration on monday announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 100 on cheese wine lipstick and other french imports collectively worth 2 4 billion the reason france last summer passed a digital services tax that targets american tech giants such as amazon and google the french tax is designed to prevent tech companies from dodging taxes by establishing their headquarters in low tax european union countries it imposes a 3 annual levy on french revenue of digital companies with yearly global sales worth more than 750 million euros 830 million and french revenue exceeding 25 million euros the trump administration has also criticized the french tax for targeting companies revenue not their profits and for being retroactive french president emmanuel macron has threatened a robust response from europe if the u s proceeds with the tariffs ___ taxing foreign cars at trump s request the commerce department launched an investigation into auto imports and then dutifully declared that they too posed a threat to america s national security that could clear the way for trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in trump s protectionist policies the united states last year imported 192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and 159 billion in auto parts virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of japan and the european union prime minister shinzo abe has said that trump vowed to forgo tariffs on japan s cars as part of a mini trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year in may trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with japan and eu as the mid november approached trump said he d decide on the tariffs very soon but the deadline came and went with no comment from the administration

taxing foreign cars at trump s request the commerce department launched an investigation into auto imports and then dutifully declared that they too posed a threat to america s national security that could clear the way for trump to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles and auto parts auto tariffs would mark a major escalation in trump s protectionist policies the united states last year imported 192 billion worth of passenger vehicles and 159 billion in auto parts virtually no one outside the white house supports the tariffs imposing them would widen a rift with europe and risk a backlash in congress where lawmakers are already considering scaling back the president s power to impose tariffs on national security grounds trump has sought to use the tariff threat to wring trade concessions out of japan and the european union prime minister shinzo abe has said that trump vowed to forgo tariffs on japan s cars as part of a mini trade deal the two countries reached earlier this year in may trump delayed the tariffs for six months while continuing negotiations with japan and eu as the mid november approached trump said he d decide on the tariffs very soon but the deadline came and went

noem s budget address as prepared for delivery mr president mr speaker members of the legislature and my fellow south dakotans we meet today with an incredible year behind us and great potential before us after the year that we have had to endure from blizzards to flooding to tornadoes south dakota families once again showed the nation how strong we are and how resilient we can be our people are ready to tackle the future and it is up to us to make sure that we are setting our state up for long term successful growth in our time together today i will provide an overview of the state s economy revenues and expenses but perhaps most importantly i will outline the conditions needed to enable our families workers and businesses to thrive for many years to come like last year what we are discussing today is only a high level overview it doesn t touch on everything i m recommending if you want to dive into all the details please read through my budget book and the deck of appendix slides attached to this presentation on my website now last year my husband and first gentleman bryon thought the budget address needed a little something extra as you may recall he promised everyone popcorn well bryon is a man of his word and there s popcorn on your desks when i travel across the state and around the country people often remark on how strong south dakota s financial position is compared to the rest of the nation like you all i take pride in the fact that we structurally balance our budget and have a aaa credit rating and i m committed to maintaining it while ensuring future security and growth for the people of south dakota as you probably already suspect money is tight this year but just as south dakotans always do we will find a way to be successful with the resources at our disposal at my direction state agencies have already tightened their belts throughout today s discussion i will explain why i think we need to scale back certain areas of the budget in order to provide funding for areas that will make our state stronger i want to make one thing clear the men and women who work for our state are incredible people each and every day i am amazed at their efforts to make this state run as efficiently and as effectively as possible in short i want to commend our state employees for their commitment and dedication to the hardworking taxpayers of south dakota one final note before i jump into the numbers when i ran for governor i committed to make transparency a cornerstone of my administration last year i unveiled a new website that made it easier to navigate state spending but today we are expanding on that initiative and opening up the state s budget even more south dakotans will be able to view my recommended budget the budget the legislature adopts as well as the actual spending of those dollars in an interactive easy to use format i encourage all of you as well as every south dakotan to bookmark open sd gov and to visit the new open budget link building a strong foundation for future economic growth and opportunities for south dakota families requires buy in from the public so i want everyone to keep an eye on our state s fiscal position let s dive in in conjunction with outside economic experts i look to the council of economic advisors and bfm staff to inform the assumptions included in my budget proposal historically low unemployment rates rising wages a strong housing market and record level consumer confidence demonstrate the strength of our economy now nationwide the economy faces headwinds from slower growth in the rest of the world uncertainty about the 2020 elections as well as current trade negotiations as of today we expect continued positive economic development but we must remain vigilant especially given recent slow revenue growth inflation is another important variable to keep an eye on because it has a direct impact on the growth of our sales tax traditionally speaking higher inflation creates stronger growth in sales tax revenue but lower inflation as we ve seen over the past several years leads to slower growth in sales tax we expect that inflation will be in the 1 9 2 1 percent range over the next two years which is lower than the previous two years finally as you know agriculture is a major component of our state s economy from the trade war to flooding our farmers and ranchers have dealt with a lot this past year we are already looking ahead to the spring wondering what the weather has in store for us the prospect of a trade deal getting done this year or early next year continues to change on a daily basis with these factors in mind we are assuming that the agriculture sector will stay pretty flat over the next year with that background on economic conditions let s look at the full revenue picture including the revisions for the current year fy20 and estimates for fy21 this chart shows the year over year increase in adopted revenues for the past five years this averages to approximately 52 1 million in new ongoing revenue per year that this legislature has adopted please keep that number in mind as we talk about my recommended revenue estimate sales and use tax accounts for roughly 63 percent of our state s ongoing revenues understanding recent trends around this major revenue source is important to understanding our overall revenue picture in fy19 sales and use tax collections grew at 3 6 percent over 2018 this was 1 3 percent short of the revised estimate that was adopted last february now to meet our adopted estimate in fy20 we would need to have growth of 4 9 percent over 2019 actuals you can see that year to date we are seeing growth of 4 1 percent in light of this my recommendation is to revise our sales and use tax growth rate to 4 5 percent this slide shows the major categories of general fund revenues you ll see a side by side comparison of what was adopted last year to what i m recommending today in total you can see i recommend a downward adjustment of 5 9 million dollars as shown on that top line by moderating growth expectations for the sales and use tax it leads to a reduction in the estimate of 3 6 million dollars following the chart down the lottery has been revised by 1 4 million this includes instant online and video lottery receipts to the general fund video lottery is currently running 4 7 percent higher than a year ago the contractor s excise tax has been revised down by 3 7 million to date we are 1 0 percent lower than the adopted estimate we still anticipate healthy housing and construction activity but just not at the level that was originally estimated the insurance company tax has been adjusted down by 1 7 million the remaining revisions get us to the total 5 9 million reduction before we dive in to fy21 numbers i want to talk about some federal tax legislation that impacts our budget senator thune introduced legislation in 2015 that eliminated a grandfather clause in federal law that allowed south dakota to continue taxing internet access services i cosponsored similar legislation in the house of representatives this legislation was signed into law in february of 2016 and starting next july 1 it will provide permanent tax relief to south dakota families and businesses who currently pay the government for simply accessing the internet this will lead to an estimated 30 million in tax relief for south dakotans with 20 million of that coming from state revenues and approximately 10 million from local governments this chart is just like the previous one but it adds the recommended 2021 ongoing receipts based on our modeling we project an increase in sales and use tax of 36 6 million remember as we just discussed of the 30 million in tax relief provided by the internet tax freedom forever act 20 million is in state taxes for a net increase of 16 6 million lottery is projected to grow by 3 6 million contractor s excise tax is estimated to remain strong next year growing by 4 million insurance company tax is projected to grow by 4 6 million tobacco taxes continue to decline as fewer people use the products so the estimate is forecasted to decrease by 1 8 million in total for fy21 i propose a revenue forecast of 1 billion 723 4 million this is 28 1 million higher than the revised fy20 forecast while we have 28 1 million in new ongoing revenue there are a couple of factors that must be taken into consideration to understand what is actually available to fund new ongoing expenditures last year the adopted budget left 500 thousand dollars on the bottom line as we discussed the revisions in the current year are 5 9 million which also must be accounted for in the next year looking at the full picture we are left with 22 7 million of total revenue available to fund new ongoing expenditures now at the beginning of the revenue discussion i showed a slide with the past five years of adopted ongoing revenue increases this chart shows how our revised 2020 and 2021 estimates compare the model calls for an additional 42 7 million in ongoing revenue this year while slightly below recent trends it could be considered a fairly average year for ongoing revenue increases when we account for the estimated 20 million dollars in tax relief that is being provided to south dakotans the picture changes quite significantly great news for south dakota families and also a lean budget year for the state now that we have discussed the revenue picture i want to talk about some of my budget proposals for the current year fy20 here is our total one time revenue available revised fy20 ongoing revenue is down 5 9 million we have other one time funding available in the amount of 7 7 million most of this is attributable to refinancing gains from low interest rates south dakota is very cautious about using reserves and we should all be proud of that when we talk about our reserve funds we are talking about the combined balance of the budget reserve fund and the general revenue replacement fund while maintaining 10 percent in reserve funds we are able to spend 16 8 million in the current year for one time investments in total we have 18 6 million in one time money available to spend it s important that we find ways to invest this money so we can capture gains for south dakota families for years to come one of my top priorities is keeping south dakotans safe one component of that is equipping our law enforcement and first responders with the tools they need to protect our communities in 2003 we created the state radio system forming a single uniform communications system for first responders in every corner of this state however with the aging infrastructure and software our current system needs an update i recommend we spend 5 1 million in one time funds which augments the 4 6 million you appropriated last year thus fulfilling our commitment to local law enforcement and first responders to upgrade our statewide communication system this will ensure a smooth transition to the new system so there are no gaps in protecting south dakota families additionally by now you all know of my vision for high speed internet in our state we absolutely need faster more reliable connections so everyone in our state can participate in the next generation of south dakota s economy we ve made improvements in this area but there s still more work to be done in mellette for example students without access to high speed internet at their homes have their parents drive them to school late at night so they can use the school s internet to do their homework many nights the school has a line of cars in front of it sadly this isn t unique to mellette half of our counties have areas where one in four people have no high speed internet access last year s investment of 5 million leveraged more than 11 4 million in direct project costs to increase connectivity across the state eight projects were awarded funding to bring internet access to about 4 800 households and more than 100 businesses in underserved parts of south dakota in addition to that because the state had a broadband plan in place applicants for the federal reconnect dollars scored extra points those awards are just starting to come in but we re being told those dollars should bring the investment in south dakota up to nearly 25 million possibly more but we must do more to bring our communities into the 21st century so let s continue investing in this project with another 5 million this year we must also invest in our universities and its training programs for the next generation eleven of the university of south dakota s fastest growing majors are in the school of health sciences representing a significant opportunity for future growth in our state as we continue to see greater demand for this skillset we must be prepared to train our workforce to meet it therefore i m recommending 5 million dollars be dedicated to the construction of a new school of health sciences building at usd i m also recommending we dedicate 396 thousand for the cyber cync incubator at dakota state university with the investment of 60 million to open the madlabs facility this fall a new era of research and development began we can further enhance this by linking the madlabs operation to this incubator to spur economic development in turn providing greater opportunities for south dakota families and helping keep top talent in our state let s turn to storm recovery over the last year south dakota has been devastated by catastrophic weather events but as we all know south dakotans are unique our people set an example of resolve and community that the rest of the nation could aspire to in the words of tuff hedeman my friend and a four time world champion bull rider we bear down try hard and never quit never for example following the sioux falls tornadoes one man spent his weekend driving around town responding to 211 requests and lending a hand wherever it was needed he fixed flat tires on tractors being used for cleanup he cleared loads of trees and debris he even helped an older gentleman clean up in a couple hours what the man thought would take him a month this story is just one of many it makes me so proud it should make us all so proud of our people and our state but there is still so much that needs to be fixed and rebuilt in our communities my budget includes a proposal to partner with local governments to provide not only disaster relief but also resources for mitigating future disasters local governments have highlighted their cash flow concerns with high dollar repairs to answer this need starting with the 2019 disasters we will now offer loans to cities counties townships and tribes from the emergency and disaster fund the state will continue to pay for 10 of the cost of the disasters but will now offer loans for the other 90 the national institute of building sciences has found that mitigation funding can save 6 dollars in future disaster recovery costs for every 1 dollar spent on hazard mitigation it is our belief that the hazard mitigation grant program and the pre disaster mitigation program will help cover project costs to improve infrastructure resiliency provide long term solutions to repetitive loss situations and help avoid reliance on federal dollars for future recovery even though these programs have existed for years they have not been used to their full advantage because of local funding concerns in addition to lowering the match requirement from 25 to 15 the state will also provide loans from the emergency and disaster fund for the local share of these mitigation programs we must rebuild damaged communities build stronger communities for the future and ensure long term resilience so our families can thrive obviously i ve only discussed a few of my one time spending proposals to the appropriators adding this up it would appear that we have spent more money than what is available however my fy20 budget proposal also includes various increases and more than 17 million in reductions to various state agencies which are laid out in detail in the budget book now that we have discussed one time expenses let s turn to the proposed ongoing expenses for fy21 as a reminder this slide shows our ongoing revenue available we are projecting 22 7 million will be available to fund new expenses first let s look at the overview of ongoing expenses due to the lack of revenue growth i will not be able to recommend inflationary increases for education or medicaid providers or for state employee salaries but my budget does include the following increases for education i am including funding tied to increased k 12 student enrollments i am also recommending additional funding for the special education allocation rebase my recommendation also includes increases in mandatory provider inflation for things like medicare crossovers prescription drugs and federally qualified health centers additionally i recommend funding for increases in medicaid utilization and cost as well as increases for home and community based services for the developmentally disabled long term care services continue to be a priority in this state my budget includes a new funding mechanism for assisted living services i am proposing rate tiers for these providers to offer a broader range of services for state employees i am recommending that we maintain the current health insurance benefits and add enhancements to family leave in fy21 general education student counts are projected to increase by approximately 1 percent and special education student counts are projected to increase by approximately 2 percent there are six disability categories funded in special education the allocation amounts for each of the six categories have been recalculated based on statewide average expenditures for the previous three years and take effect in fy21 these allocation adjustments are projected to result in nearly 14 million in total funds going to school districts for special education we all know many of us too well how big a problem meth use is across our state in south dakota twice as many 12 to 17 year olds reported using meth in the last year as compared to the national average not only does it devastate our families but it also costs the state millions of dollars every year recently i heard a story about a young woman we ll call her jenny who became addicted to drugs in her early 20s her addiction spun out of control pretty quickly and it wasn t long before she found herself in jail homeless and unemployed people tried to help her but she sunk deeper and deeper into addiction jenny found out she was pregnant when she was three months along she tried to get clean but relapsed hard shortly before the birth of her baby boy she was high on drugs when she gave birth because of her addiction and the concerns for the baby the courts gave child protection services custody of her son when he was released from the hospital jenny was broken the one thing in the world that was hers had been taken from her and she hit rock bottom but it was also her turning point jenny started working with a family services specialist from cps and the foster family who was caring for her baby she worked hard knowing that it wasn t just about her anymore her actions would determine whether she would ever be able to have her son returned to her she went through drug court found housing and a job and steadily made her way toward recovery jenny s son is three now and they live together they have maintained a relationship with the foster family that cared for him in many ways they ve become like extended family she s been promoted in her job and has been clean now for almost three years when i heard this story i was amazed at the redemption it portrays and i want to hear stories like that over and over but i also see that the road to recovery requires help it takes people raising their hands to be foster parents to be that middle mom or middle dad that these kids need it takes social workers who commit to doing the journey together it takes pastors and teachers and counselors and doctors judges neighbors police officers and people who know just when to offer a word of encouragement the health and well being of our kids is something each of us here today cares deeply about we know that addiction to meth requires more intensive therapy than other addictions my budget contains ongoing funding to support additional intensive meth treatment it s time this horrible drug is eradicated from our communities building stronger healthier and safer communities begins with families about five years ago blake and rachel schmieg of big stone city were considering adoption they had three boys biologically and had always wanted a girl after months of thinking and praying they decided to try foster parenting one day they got a call asking them to take in an 18 year old girl named sadie who needed a safe place to live until she finished high school they said yes sadie quickly became an important part of their life remembering back onto those first few weeks and months in their home sadie said that she felt like she was part of a family for the first time in her life she remembers when the younger boys made christmas ornaments for all their family members at school and made one for her she remembers having a stocking at christmas time she remembers reading to the boys and feeling like she belonged as sadie got closer and closer to finishing high school they started having conversations about what was next and how everything would work once she went to college where would she go for christmas break where would she leave the things that wouldn t fit in a dorm room little did sadie know that blake and rachel had been talking about the possibility of adoption when they asked her if she wanted to become a permanent part of their family sadie started crying she said it was the first time she had ever felt wanted over the next few months the family waded through legal tape and began the process of adoption only to realize that the adult adoption law in south dakota didn t fit their situation they were told there was nothing they could do and that adoption was off the table as blake said we hit wall after wall but we knew this was something god had called us to do so we looked for doors and windows working with representative fred deutsch the family drafted a bill to change the law gave testimony in front of a committee and followed the bill through the legislative process in march they travelled to pierre when i signed the bill into law it was an incredible day on august 20 sadie was legally adopted they got the paperwork that told them what they d known for a long time sadie was theirs and they were hers forever blake and rachel are here today would you stand thank you for all you are doing for the next generation you re truly an inspiration to us all some of you have heard me speak about how foster care and adoption have impacted my life i grew up with a foster brother and i ve been blessed with several nieces and nephews who ve brought sunshine and a new kind of love into our family adoption is beautiful it s lifechanging last year i spoke about the need for more foster families and south dakotans rose to the challenge this year my budget includes ongoing funding to meet the increased interest in individuals wanting to become licensed foster parents and approved adoptive parents every child deserves a family every child deserves a home here is an overview of fy21 ongoing budget recommendations we have broken this overview into major budget categories as you can see my ongoing recommendation includes almost 9 million in budget reductions across a number of agencies the total recommended general fund increase for fy21 is 22 7 million this chart shows a summary of the bottom lines for the current and upcoming fiscal years i began this address by noting how challenging 2019 was for our great state but what s so exciting the real bottom line is that we have tremendous opportunity before us we have some revenue challenges yes but i expect that will drive us to do better with the resources we have the growth of our current industries and the attraction of new ones will drive opportunity expanding on some already successful initiatives will drive opportunity and laying the foundation to enhance our competitiveness with respect to other states will help ensure our top talent stays in south dakota creating more opportunity for years to come in his 34th and final address from the oval office ronald reagan said the number one lesson he learned while president was that all great change in america begins at the dinner table the same is true today government programs don t drive change it happens out there around the state one conversation at a time at dinner tables in coffee shops leaning against a fencepost this budget sets us up for continued financial success and

november proved to be a stellar month for the us dollar the us dollar index a measure of the value of the currency against a basket of major currencies gained 1 12 per cent month on month while the us dollar swiss franc and us dollar japanese yen currency pairs hit five and six month highs respectively the first few trading sessions of december saw bouts of weakness drag the greenback lower on the back of a far weaker us ism manufacturing index coming in at contractionary levels of 48 1 actual versus a forecast of 49 2 however the weakness should be short lived overall i maintain my dollar long bias if we see a delay in the december 15 tariffs this would be perceived as optimistic which should lend weight to dollar bulls despite the us federal reserve cutting rates in october it has maintained a rather dovish stance towards future rates as the country s equity markets hit record highs in november in the short term watch for developments around the trade wars to drive us based assets all eyes will be on president donald trump in the lead up to the december 15 tariffs the us is set to introduce an additional 15 per cent tariff on about 156 billion dh573bn of chinese goods and this could be averted if a trade deal is reached in the lead up such an announcement would be a major boon for equities and currencies as markets would adopt a risk on approach while it is highly likely for this round of tariffs to be rolled back keep an ear out for developments from washington in the interim watch the us ism non manufacturing purchasing manager s index due on wednesday and the us nonfarm payrolls on friday which is expected to come in at 180 000 any figure falling below expectations would see strong weakness in us equities and the dollar and vice versa overall i maintain my dollar long bias if we see a delay in the december 15 tariffs this would be perceived as optimistic which should lend weight to dollar bulls next week will see the release of us consumer price index figures expectations are for the core cpi figure to come in at 2 3 per cent year on year while the month on month increase is expected at 0 2 per cent this will be followed by the headline fed interest rate decision despite strong overtures from the president at the start of this week when mr trump tweeted about the central bank s ridiculous policies of the fed i do not expect a cut at the december meet in the october meeting s minutes the fed noted that policy is well calibrated to support the economy unless there was a material reassessment of the outlook again escalation of trade war developments through the implementation of another round of tariffs could force the fed to act but this would not come into play until at least the first quarter of 2020 across the pond volatility is set to kick off in uk pound assets with all focus turning to the country s imminent general election on december 12 again the political implications make it very difficult to predict looking at the most recent polls from the past weekend the probability of a hung government currently seems the highest prime minister boris johnson will work tirelessly to form a majority through a coalition and if we have a clear cut picture this could see pound asset classes move higher i suggest exercising caution before building positions in sterling and look at building a strategy only until after the election results are conclusive the pound is trading near three month highs to start the month just under the 1 30 level which i called as a strong resistance point in my last column we could see upward moves above 1 33 with a favourable election result in the immediate aftermath of the result next week meanwhile my november views on the euro us dollar pair and gold panned out perfectly and i continue to see opportunities in both starting with gold the precious metal sold off rather aggressively in november dropping more than 3 per cent month on month to hit three month lows strong buying propped up gold above 1 445 per ounce levels i was never convinced with the gold rally at 1 500 levels and it has remained under pressure ever since look at building long positions in the channel between 1 430 and 1 450 the euro dollar pair will continue to weaken and re test 1 0990 levels achieved on november 29 where it will find good buying support while we could see some further upsides in the euro in the early parts of december expect my earlier upside target of 1 1175 to hold with downsides floored at 1 0990 levels until the end of the year gaurav kashyap is a market strategist at equiti global markets the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the views of equiti

november was a great month for the us dollar but december is proving to be a challenging one we are only 2 trading days into the new month but president trump is back to his old ways with the market reacting to all of the elusive comments coming out of the white house on monday he called for lower interest rates and criticized the strong dollar on tuesday an avalanche of headlines hit the wires suggesting that trades talks are going nowhere while trump keeps on emphasizing that china wants a deal everyone from commerce secretary ross to vice president pence have implied that the bar is high because trump won t allow china to take advantage of us with the wrong deal the president himself openly mused that it may be better to wait until after the november election to make deal fox news went on to say their sources indicate that the tariffs will be increased on december 15th of course none of this has been confirmed but today s comments from trump and white house officials indicates that trade talks are not going well the fox headline could be the trump s administration s way of preparing the markets for the possibility of new tariffs so at the end of the day even as non farm payrolls come into focus in the near term nothing matters more to the direction of currencies than the decision on tariffs adp and non manufacturing ism are scheduled for release tomorrow weaker numbers will have a greater impact on the greenback than strong ones as they would reinforce risk aversion the bank of canada also has a monetary policy meeting that could trigger a breakout in usd cad for the past 2 weeks usd cad has been confined in a tight range and while no changes are expected from the central bank governor poloz s speech will be watched closely when the boc met in october they set a bottom in usd cad when they said the resilience of canada s economy will be increasingly tested they saw the outlook weakening since july with trade conflicts likely to cause business investments and exports to shrink in the second half of the year however last month governor poloz squashed expectations for easing when he described monetary policy conditions as just right data since octoberhas been mixed retail sales improved slightly inflationary pressures remained stable but labor market housing and manufacturing activity weakened canada s labor market is strong but it finally peaked and the worry is that this will carry over to the rest of the economy if governor poloz focuses on the risks usd cad could break through 1 3350 easily but if he emphasizes the appropriateness of current policy usd cad should sink below 1 3250 the australian dollar traded sharply higher after the reserve bank left monetary policy unchanged despite recent weakness in australian data the monetary policy statement highlighted the improvements in the property market and the central bank s view that the easing of monetary policy this year is supporting employment and income growth in australia and a return of inflation to the medium term target range which confirms our view that the rba is in no rush to ease again the new zealand dollar also extended its gains despite a decline in dairy prices euro rallied for the fourth day in a row but with eu becoming the subject of trade comments from trump investors should also keep a close eye on the currency trump believes that the eu and france in particular has treated the us unfairly on trade but he said today we will probably work it out on trade conflicting like these is the exact reason why the eur usd will be particularly sensitive to eu us trade headlines revisions to ez service sector pmis are also scheduled for release tomorrow and if there are upward revisions like manufacturing pmi it could help eur usd test 1 11

washington cnn president donald trump has escalated trade tensions across the globe by imposing tariffs on foreign steel threatening tariffs on allies like the european union and engaging in a tit for tat trade war with china that has hurt american farmers the president has made striking new trade deals that protect us industries a top priority but two of his key agreements haven t been settled negotiations with china are ongoing and about a year after trump signed his replacement for the north american free trade agreement congress still hasn t voted to ratify the deal and his longstanding pledge to revive american manufacturing through a muscular trade policy took another hit monday with new data showing that the sector continued to slow for a fourth straight month us manufacturing is stuck in a mild recession with little prospect of a real near term revival said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics in a note monday while job growth and consumer spending remain strong keeping the us economy moving trade uncertainty has been a drag on business growth it s challenging for those business owners engaged in trade to make investments and pricing decisions when they don t know how long tariffs will last plus the tariffs make some manufacturing inputs more expensive new orders are the lowest they ve been since april 2009 noted shepherdson trump is continuing to escalate trade tensions on monday the president also announced tariffs on steel and aluminum coming from brazil and argentina he said the duties would help manufacturers and farmers which are two of his key political demographics i gave them a big break on tariffs but now i m taking that break off trump said because it s very unfair to our manufacturers and very unfair to our farmers his administration said it would consider putting additional tariffs on the european union for subsidies it provides to aircraft manufacturer airbus which competes against american jet maker boeing it already hit 7 5 billion worth of european goods like french wine and italian cheeses with tariffs in october the administration also proposed tariffs monday on 2 4 billion of french products after releasing a report that said a new french tax on digital services represents a barrier to trade trump s steel tariffs provided an immediate boost to the us steel industry in 2018 it enjoyed a bump in prices production increased and some companies announced plans to restart mills or build new ones manufacturing job growth accelerated but employment is still well off its 1990s peak the tariffs can also raise the price of goods made with steel including equipment for farmers american farmers have been particularly hard hit by the trade war with china beijing slapped tariffs on products including soybeans corn and wheat to help mitigate the pain the trump administration has offered aid money totaling 28 billion about double the cost of the 2009 auto bailout farm lobby groups are also pressuring congress to finalize the us mexico canada agreement us democrats have been negotiating for months behind closed doors with the trump administration on changes to the deal especially on labor enforcement provisions house speaker nancy pelosi has said she wants to hold a vote on the deal by the end of the year though that time line could slip given congress s busy to do list in december trump recently came to a new trade agreement with japan opening up market access for american ranchers and farmers but some said the deal didn t offer anything more than what was included in the trans pacific partnership which trump withdrew from early in his administration it s unclear when a deal might be reached with china negotiations with beijing have been ongoing for well over a year in october trump suggested they were close to reaching a phase one agreement that could ease trade tensions but would fall short of a comprehensive deal but presidential adviser kellyanne conway said monday that it s up to china whether an agreement is reached before the 2020 election it happens when it happens she told reporters and it s going to take a while because this is new for china they weren t expecting president trump to get elected and they weren t expecting president trump to make good on the promises he had made and said for 20 years as a business leader the new tariff threat on brazil and argentina could impact trump s ability to finalize a broad deal with china argued phil levy the chief economist at freight forwarder flexport who served as a senior economist for trade under president george w bush this sends a signal that it is very difficult to trust this president to do a trade deal the deal only lasts until he has another concern levy said last year trump exempted brazil an argentina from a round of tariffs on steel and aluminum that he imposed for national security reasons instead the two countries agreed to limit their exports under a quota but on monday trump reversed course he said that they ve devalued their currencies making it harder for american exporters to compete trump also repeatedly called on the federal reserve to take action to weaken the us dollar a favorite target manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve trump tweeted monday
