argentina s looming economic crisis is the result of extreme neoliberal policy as implemented by the military dictatorship the imf and current president mauricio macri argentina on the brink has been a recurring mantra in the financial press since at least the mid 80s argentina of 2019 is no different with news everyday of factory closures and lay offs 70 interest rates stifling the already fragile industrial sector wages plummeting to their lowest level in decades and inflation approaching 50 percent annually the specter of debt default has again started to circle over the ravaged landscape of the south american nation the doom and gloom of the financial times and other media outlets is accurate if disingenuous not long ago the mouthpieces of high finance were jubilant with the 2015 victory of right wing politician mauricio macri celebrating the arrival of a market friendly government in the midst of the anti neoliberal pink tide cambiemos â let s change â should have been a tip off rather than pointing towards a bold new future macri s unfortunately named political party has revived the same ersatz change that characterized the neoliberal nineties massive overnight devaluations of the national currency dismemberment of national industry indiscriminate market deregulation labor flexibilization and perhaps most important of all the effective subsiding of capital flight through astronomic debt â one could be forgiven for confusing argentina of 2019 with argentina of the late nineties several analysts recognized early on how this story would end marxist historian and economist claudio katz among them has been emphatic in analyzing the underlying structural problems that make argentina so maladapted to contemporary global capitalism as the weakest link in a region defined by uneven and combined development we spoke with katz in his buenos aires home to better understand why argentina finds itself on the brink again na before discussing argentina s current economic crisis i thought it might be useful to backtrack and take the long view argentina began the twentieth century in pretty good shape with a comparative advantage in exports that put it on level with canada australia and other emerging first world economies by the twenty first century liberal economists were comparing it unfavorably to neighboring chile and peru what happened why has argentina throughout its history been so unstable politically as well as economically ck there are a number of important features that set argentina apart from most other countries few countries have economic cycles that fluctuate so wildly or that suffer similarly high inflation rates over long periods of time there are also few countries in the world with such a high degree of capital flight the numbers behind these trends suggest that something different is in play in argentina the effects of globalization over the past decades have been particularly decisive for argentina its economy was once relatively independent at the beginning of the twentieth century when it exported grains and beef around the world it also experienced a prosperous period of industrialization halfway through the last century both these economic structures however have eroded in the last decades firstly because argentina lost the supremacy it once enjoyed in grains and beef markets as the value of its products began to fall on the international market argentina reverted to supplying primary commodities like soy and minerals that is it fell to the lowest rung on the global commodity supply chain in terms of industry argentina was affected by the global shift in investments towards asia the impact was even more dramatic than in europe or the united states because the existing industrialization in the country was much more fragile argentina s position like that of brazil is increasingly weak within the global market although brazil has suffered less because it has a huge domestic market mexico which was also affected has an important market to the north chile peru and colombia don t have any industry so the problem hasn t really hit them in the same way as far as politics are concerned argentina is characterized by a structural instability that is unlike almost any other country that instability has to do in large part with the role of the military in the post 1983 period the armed forces were completely demobilized during the democratic transition so that unlike brazil and other latin american countries the domestic role of the military in argentine society is completely negligible what happened was the argentine military government was defeated in the malvinas falklands war no other latin american country engaged in an armed conflict like malvinas or suffered such a resounding military defeat adding to that defeat a powerful democratic movement stood up to the military in a way that no other latin american populace did those two factors deprived the subsequent regime of a key stabilizing factor that other countries â think bolsonaro s brazil â can still rely on na and the weakness of the military has contributed to the country s political instability ck exactly the transition could not establish a stable post dictatorial regime the structures that could have presided over a stable post transition period the military were dismantled during the transition itself by contrast in mexico or brazil the army still plays a key role in argentina the military is irrelevant ever since the argentine ruling classes have only ever managed to contain the country s combative social movements with great difficulty just looking at their longevity these movements have no parallel in the region in a political context marked by constant instability it s thanks to the social movements that there has never been a credible threat of a return of the dictatorship they act as a breakwater a threat if you like against backsliding but that same level of social mobilization also makes it very difficult for the ruling classes to run the country different from brazil chile and mexico argentina has one of the most powerful labor movements in the world there have been forty general strikes since the democratic transition of 1983 there have been five during macri s presidency france is the only point of comparison where the general strike is observed and serious union organization exists another important element is argentina s human rights movement which is intensely democratic in argentina democratic rights have been won through struggle â the feminist movement so important here can be viewed as part of this same struggle this was also one of the first countries to legalize same sex marriage democratic struggles are part of an unbroken history going back to the mothers of plaza de mayo which emerged during the dictatorship another element unique to argentina is the importance of public education it s an odd country in that sense because it s a peripheral nation structurally like any other latin american country but with a system of public education that more closely resembles a developed country this is all to say that there is a strange divorce between national history and national reality the country has been torn apart socially and economically but it hasn t experienced a comparable deterioration at the political or cultural level that incongruence is what part of makes the country so difficult to govern and one administration after another has tried and failed political life in argentina is incredibly intense and the general level of politicization remains very high meanwhile the local ruling classes are observing all this deciding between investing locally or moving their money offshore and they opt for capital flight the amount of capital held abroad amounts to roughly 75 80 percent of gdp in other words there is a whole second argentina located abroad the wealth that is created here is immediately transferred abroad which is why we find ourselves in the current situation and why the country is so unstable in theoretical terms we might say that argentina is an extreme case of uneven and combined development and this makes the contradictions here especially intense na turning to the current economic crisis how dire is the current situation ck argentina is going through a very serious crisis that could very well end in a violent social upheaval every day we re on the brink of collapse and the only plan the government has is to hold tight until general elections in october this critical situation will continue on through october and well into the next government the cause is clear enough the general impression is that at some point in argentina s future it will default on its debt as in fact occurred in the not so distant past the numbers themselves are alarming although not so much in terms of scale debt servicing accounts for 100 percent of gdp which comparatively isn t that rare what is unusual is the speed with which the government has accrued this debt when president macri began his term in 2015 debt repayment stood at 40 percent of gdp to see that number spike to 100 percent of gdp in just three to four years it s just not normal interest rates already high have gone up at a rate that tax revenue can t possibly keep up with the underlying problem though is not the debt per se so much as the uses of that debt if the country takes on debt and uses it to build bridges schools and industry in some way that debt is justified the problem is that the bulk of the debt has been used to finance capital flight what happens is the state takes on debt it sells bonds on the market and argentine capitalists take out dollars and relocate their money abroad argentina is exceptional in terms of the amount of wealth held abroad and this phenomenon has accelerated dramatically under president macri using debt to finance capital flight is a recipe for a nationwide collapse exactly one year ago the banks were observing this very situation seeing that argentina could not possibly pay off its debts and they decided not to loan anymore na in other words argentina defaulted on its loans ck it was more like a pre default because argentina continued to accrue debt but that marked the beginning of the crisis exactly a year ago and for a year now we ve been going from one failed solution to the next this is why the government got rid of two finance ministers â first federico sturzenegger then luis caputo finally the imf showed up it issued its first bailout package which lasted all of two months the second bailout didn t have much effect either the reality that argentina won t be able to continue servicing its debt is manifested on two levels in a currency crisis where the populace starts to buy up us dollars against the expectation that foreign reserves will be emptied the second level is a bank run this hasn t fully come to pass yet although to a certain extent there is a regular daily run on the banks and the government s only response is to hike up interest rates to prevent the run on the argentine peso but this is a vicious cycle every time there is an interest rate hike it creates the sensation that the government will eventually be unable to service the debt the response then is more bank runs leading to higher interest rates and so on these measures have had terrible consequences for the real economy exorbitant interest rates have plunged the country into recession the recession which began small is now colossal and the country s industry has been demolished unemployment and lay offs are on the rise what we have now is a scenario marked by stagflation that is combined stagnation and inflation when both of these problems are occurring simultaneously which in classical economic theory shouldn t happen it means that the economy is being suffocated and the social costs are extraordinary salaries and pensions lag way behind inflation poverty rates skyrocket children don t have enough to eat in school lunchrooms in community kitchens etc the social crisis is acute and there are several possible outcomes one as i mentioned is collapse collapse in this case would come in the form of the currency crisis transforming into a full blown run on the banks this may or may not happen it could happen before or after elections na the international financial press still seems to favor cambiemos even if they are willing to recognize that the administration was characterized by mismanagement what would you call it ck there may have been mismanagement but this crisis is the product of a determinate economic policy it doesn t have to do with any of the causes that local and foreign commentators have alleged it s not a reflection of the argentine people or the last seventy years of argentine history it isn t the fault of the previous government and it isn t the consequence of an external crisis the crisis is the result of extreme neoliberal policy it happened in the 1970s during the military dictatorship under the stewardship of minister of economy josé alfredo martã nez de hoz and again in the nineties with president menem it happened with the alianza government eighteen years ago and again today every time argentina has implemented free trade policies and deregulated markets the outcome has been the same after that one can start to speak of mismanagement but in that case mismanagement just means doing what one can within an exceedingly narrow range of choices everything starts to seem like bad economic policy when there is a structural problem that can t be addressed when a country is already on the edge of default there s no such thing as good administration na with general elections in october are there any signs of a viable alternative ck until october we re stuck in a holding pattern after october several possibilities may open up one highly unlikely is that the incumbent cambiemos party wins the election it would be truly strange for a government to be re elected in an economic and social scenario like the current one but it could happen and the result will be to pile austerity on top of existing austerity considering the potential economic and social consequences that this would bring a victory for cambiemos is a truly terrifying scenario to contemplate it would mean among other things the total surrender of the country s natural resources like the vaca muerta oilfields again the deep structural effects of a victory for cambiemos would be catastrophic and have to be avoided na would the results be something like what greece experienced at the hands of the troika ck not exactly because in greece austerity was implemented by a left wing government rather than the right wing it would be as if syriza never came to power at the same time some people are expecting positive results particularly those who remember how argentina rebuilt itself in 2003 after the 2001 crisis there s an assumption that a combination of factors will lead towards recovery the problem is that the circumstances today are very different our position post 2001 was much more favorable debt payment was postponed for five years so there was debt relief that allowed the country to recover commodity prices were high and the domestic market was able to recuperate in large part because the mega devaluation of the immediately preceding era allowed for an immediate rebound of the export sector another possibility would be something like tsipras in greece represented in local terms by the fernández ticket of cristina de kirchner and alberto fernandez this alternative seems to be on the table if one looks at what happened in greece â unemployment the collapse of pensions recession a full blown crisis â this is possible the most important similarity is that where greece had the troika argentina is under the thumb of the imf the imf like the troika plays the role of sole interlocutor this is different from the previous crisis in argentina then debt was spread out among many private lenders today it s just the imf i don t see the portuguese path as a viable solution either although some people in argentina are looking to the luso model as a possible fix i don t see it happening because portugal was given debt relief and was subject to more lenient treatment than greece after austerity in greece there was a political decision on the part of the german government to be more benevolent towards portugal i don t think this will happen in argentina but the possibility is there i think we can expect a much more unforgiving version of the imf like the troika with greece or like the imf in its treatment of the ukraine which suffered from extreme austerity measures in 2015 what remains to be seen is whether argentina will follow the argentine model a crisis that builds and builds until it explodes producing a shift in the country s entire economic and social orientation na the imf is already involved in ecuador and other countries in the region would you say that the fund is looking to make an example of its most unruly latin american client ck the takeaway idea is that the imf is the sole authority behind the crisis the fund has always had a privileged role in managing international crises but the debtor relation has never been directly with the imf what typically occurs is a country finds itself indebted to many banks and eventually reaches a point where it can t pay the imf shows up at that point and assumes the role of guarantor of future payment however argentina s current debt with the fund is on par with what is owed to the banks argentina has received a historic 57 billion bailout package from the imf which is actually a problem for the imf in that sense the crisis is not only a concern for argentina but for the imf itself the way this unfolded was unusual the united states demanded the fund loan money to argentina for purely geopolitical reasons â with an eye on venezuela the united states is trying to shore up an important ally in the southern cone this was against the fund s own wishes because they knew they were lending to a client that will never pay them back when argentina does reach insolvency for the first time in history it won t be with the banks but directly with the fund hence international financial analysts are concerned about the effects argentina could produce within the imf what all this means is that the fund will assume a hardline stance towards argentina in practice that won t mean further repayment demands but instead a series of deferrals on payments in exchange for deepened austerity the international monetary fund currently has its own representative set up in argentina s central bank the minister of economy is essentially imf director christine lagarde however what is especially troubling nowadays is the level of naivety one finds locally with regard to the imf people seem to think that the government is the sole culprit and that the imf is here to lend a helping hand even the kirchnerist opposition has embraced an image of the imf as if it were a benevolent institution like an old friend the opposition is eager to meet with fund representatives and send a message that we are willing to negotiate it s alarming to see the opposition rushing off to washington rather than raising awareness and encouraging social mobilization in contrast with other periods the bulk of the opposition isn t rallying against the imf there were some gestures in that direction in may june 2018 but those efforts were swept under the rug this is worrying because sooner or later the fund will come back and say very well now it s time for a labor reform bill and a pension reform bill which is the priority of the imf the imf wants to impose a labor reform bill like in brazil and a pension reform bill like greece s now more than ever we need to remember two examples greece and ecuador in ecuador lenã n moreno campaigned with rafael correa on the slogan i am the anti right candidate he beat the right wing as a progressive candidate and then applied the same austerity measures as macri it s disheartening to find right wing economic policy embraced by so called progressives a more conservative sector of kirchnerism is starting to fall in line with this tendency na striking too since the kirchners rose to political prominence based on their opposition to the imf is there no discussion around the legitimacy of the debt ck only on the left unlike kirchnerism the left has a series of proposals the first get our priorities in order are we more concerned with the payment of interests or the wellbeing of the population should we be building schools feeding our children helping pensioners pay for medication or paying off the imf many believe that we can do both here we need to avoid idealism if we can do both then that would be wonderful but we need to assume the worst possible scenario starting by looking at our own history with the imf would the imf accept a different set of terms this seems unlikely preparing for the worst case scenario we need to utilize mass mobilization and start to develop people s consciousness failing to do so the imf won t leave us with many choices the second step is to perform a debt audit what is it that we re paying for all of the debt accrued by the macri government has gone to financing capital flight we re paying the interest on money that entered the country and was then placed in offshore tax havens by argentine capitalists the people are being forced to pay for a scheme that the capitalists are responsible for this is inadmissible so the first step is perform a debt audit an inquiry into what that debt consisted of what was it used for who received the money and so on let those who profited from these financial operations be the ones that cover the expenses that s the purpose of a debt inquiry thirdly regardless of what happens in argentina we have to exercise control over the currency by october there won t be a single us dollar left in the central bank argentina is buried under a heap of debt and has no reserves to pay it back since they ve been sent offshore under such circumstances taking control of our currency and the banks is vital without these three measures â prioritizing payments a debt audit control of the currency and financial system â it will be very difficult to find any way out of the crisis the left is proposing these ideas in the midst of an increasingly conservative political climate where few are willing to listen we need to push for a sovereign handling of the debt one that would put us in the position of paying on our own terms and not those established by the fund na you mentioned earlier the fernández ticket â the electoral formula of cristina fernández de kirchner as vice president and alberto fernández as president reactions have ranged from celebratory â cristina seems to have hit on a winning formula that can beat macri â to more cautious skepticism about the rightward shift of kirchnerism how should the left broadly construed regard the fernández ticket ck as i ve said the left and its candidates â the workers left front and others â are the only political force that is proposing a serious clearly delineated program to confront the imf and overcome the crisis they will need to make their voices heard more than ever during the electoral campaign which will be dominated by vague promises and they will need to have members in congress whose allegiance to the popular cause is unshakeable that being said the argentine left struggles with sectarianism and has trouble presenting a common front in elections that same sectarianism prevents the left from engaging with other political sectors and social movements which is what the current conjuncture calls for a serious engagement with the renewed hope that the fernández ticket awakens among the popular classes the left is of course aware that it is not enough to just have a valid program the problem is in their diagnosis they attribute their shortcomings to a lack of social mobilization when the real problem is political in nature the rise of the fernández formula is being propelled by a rejection of macri and the favorable memory of kirchnerism different from the 2001 crisis when the leading slogan que se vayan todos was an expression of a wholesale rejection of the political class voter turnout is extremely high this means among other things that the left needs to mature with respect to its position on an eventual second round run off between macrismo and the fernández ticket it needs to be categorical in its endorsement of a vote against the right which will have the effect of giving left parties greater visibility and more favorable outcomes in legislative elections this was the strategy adopted by the brazilian left in endorsing the vote against bolsonaro na where are the social movements in all this some voices on the left have leveled the accusation â perhaps in bad faith â that social organizations have become a tool used by the government to outsource the administration of basic services and to effectively pacify the poorest sectors ck no that s incorrect the social organizations currently operating among the country s marginalized communities represent one of the biggest achievements of the 2001 and post 2001 period that period saw an extraordinary level of popular organization and that organization now forms an essential part of argentina s social fabric since the government took power there have been huge marches to guarantee continued social spending and the preservation of social rights the level of consciousness and organization is superior to previous levels it would be a serious mistake to speak as some do of the social movements as if they were comparable to the highly bureaucratized general confederation of labor cgt it s thanks to the organizing efforts of social movements that the more serious regional problems â criminality social disintegration â have been kept at bay social organizations are responsible for what could otherwise have been a complete unraveling of the social fabric as we ve seen in mexico and brazil na speaking of social disintegration what about the extreme right is there not some risk that the progressives embrace of austerity could lead to disenchantment and as happened in brazil produce a surge in far right tendencies ck not in the immediate here there are some noteworthy differences between argentina and brazil popular mobilization in brazil cratered under the workers party pt in argentina there has not been a comparable process of demobilization like what took place under dilma under dilma the right wing wrested control of the streets away from the left in brazil dilma let the people down cristina didn t do that she lost the elections â it s one thing to lose an election and another to create a generalized sense of disenchantment among the popular classes cristina left office with the plaza de mayo full of supporters whereas dilma left without a single supporter behind her dilma had a neoliberal finance minister cristina didn t in latin america whoever holds the streets has the political power the political force that can exercise its authority over the streets will see that power reflected in the institutions in that sense the right wing in argentina has little presence on the streets by way of contrast with brazil there the right won because it won the streets that s also why venezuelan right won t win because it can t win the streets from the government the other issue is that the argentine right wing bet all its chips on macri macri was the right wing government of choice and now the verdict is in there are some more far right formations like alfredo olmedo or espert with the libertarian party but they are marginal to the main political currents na beyond the generalities of the pink tide â widely understood to be receding â can you identify any particular sites of resistance or even emergent left wing forces on the continent ck the decade long progressive cycle was the result of popular rebellions that triumphed over neoliberal governments shifting the relations of force and providing a sense of political relief these triumphs ushered in a democratic resurgence soon enough conservatism was reinstated reaction has taken hold at various points in the region but the future development of the conservative restoration is still uncertain the restoration hasn t been consolidated and the progressive cycle hasn t returned amid such uncertainty i think developments in three countries will be decisive the first big test is what will happen in venezuela depending on how the situation in venezuela is played out the reality in latin america will follow a determinate path the country possesses a strategic centrality â if the venezuelan right wing and the united states triumph there venezuela will become a pillar for a lasting conservative restoration the coup attempt led by the faux president guaidó has failed for the time being there s no sign of military intervention if the right loses in venezuela there will be an opening for a resurgence of the progressive cycle the second test is brazil brazil is currently in the midst of a deeply conservative phase with potentially fascist components however in terms of the right wing consolidating power bolsonaro has failed in every way imaginable he acts like a buffoon the military distrusts him and now most recently an important social struggle has reemerged in the form of the student movement if bolsonaro s power erodes that would be a strong signal of a progressive resurgence in mexico with amlo the verdict is still out â we ve yet to see if there will be substantial political change for the time being it seems unlikely the third big test is argentina this will be an electoral test â whether macri or the opposition wins the elections these are two totally different scenarios macri s reelection would mean the consolidation of the conservative restoration whereas the kirchnerist sector could potentially mean the re launching of the progressive cycle we haven t yet seen popular rebellions like those taking place in argentina bolivia and venezuela at the beginning of the nineties but i would say that the possibilities in latin america remain open na and a last question as one of the most prominent living exponents of dependency theory what can that approach tell us about contemporary capitalism ck dependency theory is experiencing a resurgence in latin america for three reasons the first is economic the enduring underdevelopment of the region and the extraction of its resources have been central elements in the analysis of dependency theory a country is dependent because it s underdeveloped and is unable to develop because its wealth is drawn out of it this was especially prevalent in latin america during the last decade through its reversion to primary commodity production and extractivism industrial regression crises social deterioration and so on the dynamics of dependency have become especially characteristic of latin america in the last decade more so than in other regions for example i study the contrast between latin america and south and southeast asia in latin america the tendency towards dependency has become more pronounced than in other regions dependency theory is also important for grasping the importance of political sovereignty latin america lacks sovereignty because of us imperialism latin america is still north america s backyard â with trump more than ever â but the dispute between the united states and china over the region s resources has become central the proprietary interests of us imperialism are being challenged by the continental presence and investment of the chinese government lastly there is an ideological dimension dependency theory as an idea ties back to a resurgent interest in latin american marxism a half century after the cuban revolution there s a renewed interest in a particular brand of marxist thought that is unique to the region and dependency theory is part of that tradition this revival we re seeing is not just a fascination with radical ideas in latin america or with more heterodox versions of marxism the resurgence responds to the possibility of formulating a unique synthesis of latin american concerns and marxist theory and dependency theory is one expression of that synthesis translation by joel ruggi jacobin

by joseph t salerno via mises wire in consecutive issues of the freeman richard timberlake has contributed an interesting trilogy of articles advancing a monetarist critique of the conduct of u s monetary policy during the 1920s and 1930s 1 in the first of these articles timberlake disputes the late murray rothbard s austrian account of the boom bust cycle of the 1920s and 1930s timberlake contends that rothbard proceeds on the basis of a new and unacceptable meaning for the term inflation and a contrived definition of the money supply to invent a fed orchestrated inflation of the 1920s that in fact never occurred moreover timberlake alleges rothbard s account was marred by a mismeasurement of the central bank s monetary data as well as by a misunderstanding of the nature and operation of the fed controlled pseudo gold standard by which u s dollars were created during this period in the two subsequent articles timberlake also takes issue respectively with the u s treasury s policy of neutralizing gold inflows and the fed s policy of sharply raising reserve requirements in the mid 1930s arguing that these complementary policies aborted an incipient economic recovery and brought on the recession of 1937 38 in what follows i will address the weighty charges brought against rothbard and in the process offer an evaluation of the federal reserve system s culpability for the economic events of these tragic years that diverges radically from timberlake s the meaning of inflation let me begin with timberlake s contention that rothbard imputes a meaning to the word inflation that is both new and unacceptable in fact rothbard s definition of inflation as the increase in money supply not consisting in i e not covered by an increase in gold is an old and venerable one it was the definition that was forged in the theoretical debate between the hard money british currency school and the inflationist british banking school in the mid nineteenth century according to the proto austrian currency school which triumphed in the debate the gold standard was not sufficient to prevent the booms and busts of the business cycle which had continued to plague great britain despite its restoration of the gold standard in 1821 2 briefly according to the currency school if commercial banks were permitted to issue bank notes via lending or investment operations in excess of the gold deposited with them this would increase the money supply and precipitate an inflationary boom the resulting increase in domestic money prices and incomes would eventually cause a balance of payments deficit financed by an outflow of gold this external drain of their gold reserves and the impending threat of internal drains due to domestic bank runs would then induce the banks to sharply restrict their loans and investments resulting in a severe contraction of their uncovered notes or fiduciary media and a decline in the domestic money supply accompanied by economy wide depression to avoid the recurrence of this cycle the currency school recommended that all further issues of fiduciary media be rigorously suppressed and that henceforth the money supply change strictly in accordance with the inflows and outflows of gold through the nation s balance of payments the latter provided a natural noncycle generating mechanism for distributing the world s money supply strictly in accordance with the international pattern of monetary demands following the triumph of the currency school doctrine and the implementation of its policy prescription by the bank of england its definition of inflation became accepted in the english speaking world especially in the united states where there existed a much more radical and analytically insightful american branch of the school the term inflation was now used strictly to denote an increase in the supply of money that consisted in the creation of currency and bank deposits unbacked by gold thus for example the american financial writer charles holt carroll wrote in 1868 that the source of inflation and of the commercial crisis is in the nature of the system which pretends to lend money but creates currency by discounting such bills when there is no such money in existence 3 even earlier in 1858 carroll had written instead of using gold and silver for currency they are merely used as the basis of the greatest possible inflation by the banks and that we should prevent any artificial increase of currency to prevent a future catastrophe 4 so it was the artificial increase of currency only through the creation of unbacked bank notes and deposits that constituted inflation the leading monetary theorist in the united states in the last quarter of the nineteenth century was francis a walker according to walker writing in 1888 a permanent excess of the circulating money of a country over that country s distributive share of the money of the commercial world is called inflation 5 while this version of the definition is applicable to inconvertible paper fiat currency walker also believed that inflation was an inherent feature of the issuance of convertible bank notes and deposits that lacked gold backing in walker s words there resides in bank money even under the most stringent provisions for convertibility the capability of local and temporary inflation 6 unfortunately however because the writers of the british currency school unlike their american cousins neglected to consider bank deposits as part of the money supply their policies as adopted in great britain failed to prevent inflation and the business cycle consequently and tragically the school s doctrines and policies fell into profound disrepute by the late nineteenth century and its definition of inflation was replaced by that of the opposing banking school which saw inflation as a state in which the money supply exceeds the needs of trade early american quantity theorists following the proto monetarist irving fisher in particular seized upon and adapted this definition to their peculiar analytical perspective thus edwin kemmerer wrote in 1920 that although the term inflation in current discussion is used in a variety of meanings there is one idea common to most uses of the word namely the idea of a supply of circulating media in excess of trade needs 7 kemmerer went on to define inflation as a state in which at a given price level a country s circulating media money and deposit currency increase relatively to trade needs from here it was a short step to the currently prevailing definition of inflation as an increase in the price level 8 so rothbard s theory is surely not new and to say that it is unacceptable is simply to express one s agreement with the long entrenched preference among orthodox quantity theorists including contemporary monetarists for the banking school over the currency school defining money timberlake also challenges rothbard s statistical definition of the money supply for including savings and loan share capital and life insurance net policy reserves alleging that rothbard contrived this definition in order to make the rate of monetary growth appear larger than it actually was during the 1920s timberlake argues that the two items in question are not money because they cannot be spent on ordinary goods and services to spend them one needs to cash them in for other money currency or bank drafts 9 let us take these items one at time in the case of savings and loan share capital there are two responses to timberlake first the share accounts offered by savings and loan associations are and always have been economically indistinguishable from the savings deposits offered by commercial banks included in the older pre 1980 definition of m2 that timberlake apparently upholds as the appropriate definition of the money supply 10 in practice depositors could withdraw their savings deposits from commercial banks on demand because the law that permitted the banks to insist on a waiting period was rarely if ever invoked similarly while savings and loan associations were contractually obligated to repurchase their shares at par on request of the shareholder they could legally delay such repurchase for shorter or longer periods depending on their individual bylaws nonetheless such delays rarely occurred and for many years savings and loan associations have made the proud boast every withdrawal paid upon demand or some similar statement 11 moreover while timberlake is right that shareholders had to trade their share accounts in for currency or bank drafts at par and on demand before they could spend them on goods and services this was equally true of savings depositors at commercial banks thus the public has always considered dollars held in savings and loan share accounts or savings accounts as readily spendable as dollars held in commercial bank savings deposits second timberlake curiously does not object to rothbard s inclusion of the savings deposits of mutual savings banks in the money supply although they also are not included in the m2 definition he favors 12 what makes timberlake s position even more puzzling is that mutual savings banks were practically identical in economic function to savings and loan associations and were also technically mutually owned by their depositors 13 so why then does timberlake insist so vehemently on treating the liabilities of these two institutions differently a resolution of this mystery can perhaps be found in the work of milton friedman and anna schwartz who excluded the share accounts of savings and loans and of credit unions from their definition of the money supply on the grounds that these institutions are technically not banks as defined in accordance with the definition of banks agreed upon by federal bank supervisory agencies since holders of funds in these institutions are for the most part technically shareholders not depositors despite this legal technicality however even friedman and schwartz were forced to admit that those who place funds with these institutions clearly may regard such funds as close substitutes for bank deposits as we define them 14 life insurance reserves this brings us to the issue of the net policy reserves of life insurance companies rothbard claimed that the cash surrender values of life insurance companies that is the immediately cashable claims possessed by policyholders against life insurance companies statistically approximated by the companies net policy reserves represent a source of currently spendable dollars and should be included in the money supply once again the question is not whether insurance companies superficially resemble banks or can be technically classified as such according to some arbitrary regulatory definition it is whether they essentially function like depository institutions receiving funds from the public with which to make loans and investments while contractually promising that such funds are available for withdrawal on demand by the policyholder in rothbard s view the policyholder is economically in precisely the same position as a bank depositor and thrift institution shareholder in holding an immediately cashable par value claim to dollars now admittedly rothbard s inclusion of this item in the money supply is controversial much more so than his inclusion of savings and loan share accounts however he was hardly alone in maintaining this position a number of mainstream writers of money and banking textbooks in the 1960s and 1970s recognized that cashable life insurance reserves possessed some of the characteristics of money for example walter w haines characterized insurance companies as savings institutions and noted that these savings can be withdrawn at any time simply by allowing the policy to lapse a feature that marks them as a near money on a par with savings accounts 15 m l burstein maintained that the cash value of a life insurance policy offered ready convertibility into cash was almost as liquid as a mattressful of currency and satisfied the precautionary motive for holding liquid assets no less than savings and loan accounts and savings bonds 16 albert hart and peter kenen included the net cash values of life insurance in the broadest class of financial assets possessing the attribute of moneyness while thomas f cargill ranked them on a liquidity spectrum immediately below large certificates of deposit which are included in the current m3 definition of the money supply 17 more important however even if we grant for the sake of argument that net life insurance reserves should be excluded from the money supply we find that it makes very little difference to rothbard s characterization of the 1920s as an inflationary decade with this item included the increase in rothbard s m between mid 1921 and the end of 1928 totaled about 61 percent yielding an annual rate of monetary inflation of 8 1 percent a year with this item left out but savings and loan share accounts included the money supply increased by about 55 percent over the period or at an annual rate of 7 3 percent 18 mirabile dictu by using a definition of the money stock that arbitrarily excludes savings and loan share accounts while including mutual savings bank deposits on the basis of an inexplicable adherence to a legalistic regulatory definition of banks it turns out that it is timberlake and friedman and schwartz who have mismeasured money supply growth during the 1920s flawed institutions timberlake also criticizes rothbard for ignorance of the flawed institutional framework within which the gold standard and the central bank generated money and also of mismeasurement of the central bank s monetary data 19 but this is surely a curious charge to level against rothbard steeped as he was in currency school doctrine in fact rothbard was quite cognizant that the u s monetary regime of the 1920s and 1930s was not a genuine gold standard in which the supply of money was determined exclusively by market forces that is by the balance of payments and the mining of gold but a hybrid system in which the fed possessed substantial power to manipulate the money supply by pyramiding paper bank reserves atop its stock of gold reserves indeed rothbard went much further than timberlake in rigorously and completely separating those factors affecting the money supply that were subject to fed control from those that the fed had no control over 20 in analyzing the central bank monetary data timberlake starts with the monetary base or total fed which is equal to currency in circulation plus member bank reserves from this aggregate he properly subtracts the fed s legal tender reserves mainly the gold stock whose size depends on balance of payments flows and is not under the immediate control of the fed what remains is the net monetary obligations of the fed or net fed which according to timberlake faithfully indicates the intent of fed policy 21 from 1921 to 1929 this aggregate declined by 8 percent per year leading timberlake to conclude that the intent of fed policy was decidedly deflationary during this period the motive for this deflationary policy bias was timberlake suggests to aid great britain in re establishing and maintaining gold convertibility for the pound sterling we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us however as important as it is the gold stock is not the only factor that lay beyond the fed s control for as rothbard points out currency in circulation which improperly remains in timberlake s net fed aggregate is not controlled by the fed at all but by the banking public any time a depositor withdraws cash from a bank currency in circulation increases and bank reserves decline dollar for dollar under a fractional reserve banking system this loss of reserves causes a multiple contraction of bank deposits that far exceeds the original increase in currency in circulation that induced it and therefore results in a net deflation of the money supply conversely a decline in the amount of currency held by the public causes an overall increase in bank reserves and an overall inflation of the money supply this is not all however timberlake also ignores the fact that under the prevailing policy regime the banks themselves could autonomously reduce the amount of bank reserves and thus the quantity of money in existence by deliberately reducing their indebtedness to the fed during this period it was the chosen policy of the fed to lend liberally and continuously to all banks at an interest or discount rate below the market rate while the fed was legally authorized to make such loans to its member banks it was not mandated to do so furthermore it also retained complete power to set the discount rate it charged on these loans hence if it had chosen to the fed could have restricted its lending to emergency situations and charged a penalty rate substantially above the market rate so as to discourage all but the most seriously troubled banks from applying for loans in short it could have almost completely neutralized the inflationary impact of its discounting operations this emergency lending policy had been urged by some prominent officials within the fed establishment itself 22 the fact that the fed chose instead to pursue a continuous lending policy meant that the increase in bank reserves that resulted from the origination of new fed loans to member banks via the rediscounting of business bills or advances on collateralized bank promissory notes was under the exclusive control of the fed but it also meant that the reduction in bank reserves entailed by the net repayment of discounted bills was uncontrolled by the fed because it depended solely on the decisions of the banks given the fed s indiscriminate below market rate discount policy the banks were always in a position to maintain or augment their debts to the fed if they so desired simply by discounting additional bills with the fed thus as rothbard concluded when bills repaid exceeded new bills discounted banks were deliberately and autonomously diminishing their level of indebtedness to the fed and this must be counted as an uncontrolled deflationary influence on bank reserves real fed intent if we follow rothbard then in identifying currency in circulation and the reduction of bank indebtedness to the fed along with the gold stock as the main uncontrolled factors affecting bank reserves we get a picture of the fed s intent during the 1920s and early 1930s that is poles apart from the one suggested by timberlake indeed we find that from the inception of the monetary inflation in mid 1921 to its termination at the end of 1928 uncontrolled reserves decreased by 1 430 billion while controlled reserves increased by 2 217 billion since member bank reserves totaled 1 604 billion at the beginning of this period this means that controlled reserves shot up by 138 percent or 18 4 percent per year during this seven and one half year period while uncontrolled reserves fell by 89 percent or 11 9 percent per year thus rothbard correctly concluded that the 1920s were an inflationary decade and that it was indeed the intention of the federal reserve system that it be so 23 the fed s inflationary intent is perfectly consistent moreover with its motive of helping great britain re establish and maintain the pre war parity between gold and the british pound while timberlake properly recognizes this motive underlying fed policy he is incorrect in suggesting that it necessitates a deflationary policy on the part of the fed in fact the precise opposite is required the british pound in the mid 1920s was overvalued vis à vis gold and the u s dollar causing british products to appear relatively overpriced in world markets as a result great britain experienced imports chronically in excess of exports accompanied by persistent balance of payments deficits and outflows of gold reserves had the fed deflated the u s money supply thus lowering u s prices even more relative to british prices as timberlake claims was its intention it would have exacerbated and not resolved great britain s gold drain clearly then the fed s desire to aid britain in reversing its balance of payments deficits and rebuilding its gold stocks called for an inflationary policy intended to pump up u s prices thereby rendering british products relatively cheap and enhancing the demand for them on world markets 24 this point about the motive for the fed s easy money policy in the 1920s was not only advanced by rothbard but by other economists including monetarists such as kenneth weiher according to weiher great britain was calling for help and benjamin strong heard the call expansionary monetary policy in the u s would drive prices up and interest rates down in this country which would tend to send gold flowing toward great britain where prices were lower and interest rates higher these changes would help america s ally build up its stock of gold here can be no question that the fed would not have moved when it did were it not for concern over the gold standard and the plight of great britain by 1927 the stagnant british economy needed help from the united states and the rest of europe just as had been the case in 1924 monetary policy was shifted to an expansionary program in an effort to aid great britain s struggles to return to the gold standard 25 rothbard s reinterpretation of the monetary data also cuts against timberlake s claim that the fed monetarily starved the country into the worst economic crisis it has ever experienced 26 on the contrary the factors controlled by the fed continued to exercise a highly inflationary impact on bank reserves and the money supply from late 1929 through 1932 as the fed attempted desperately to ward off the depression precipitated by the termination of the bank credit inflation that it had orchestrated in the 1920s the deflation of the money supply therefore was caused wholly by factors beyond the control of the fed first there was a loss of confidence in the fed dominated phony gold standard among the domestic public and foreign investors as a result there occurred an increase in currency in circulation and a decline in the fed s gold stock both of which caused bank reserves to decline second u s banks prudently attempted to save themselves and their depositors by restricting their loans to overcapitalized and failing businesses and instead using these funds to pay down their indebtedness to the fed which gave further impetus to the uncontrolled reduction of bank reserves third in the second quarter of 1932 the banks also began to increase their liquid reserves beyond the legal minimum the accumulation of excess reserves as they were called constituted a separate uncontrolled factor that reinforced the deflationary influence of the uncontrolled decline in bank reserves on the money supply from the end of december 1929 to the end of december 1931 bank reserves fell from 2 36 billion to 1 96 billion causing rm for rothbard s money supply to drop from 73 52 billion to 68 25 billion or at an annual rate of 3 6 percent but this monetary deflation was not caused by the fed which pumped up controlled reserves by 672 million or at an annual rate of 17 percent during the period while uncontrolled reserves declined by 1 063 million or by 27 percent per year during 1932 rm continued to decline falling to 64 72 billion or by 5 2 percent but bank reserves increased sharply during the year from 1 96 billion to 2 51 billion as the fed furiously inflated controlled reserves in the last ten months of the year controlled reserves rose by a staggering 1 165 million or at an annual rate of 76 percent fortunately this attempted massive inflation of the money supply was undone by the domestic public foreign investors and the banks as uncontrolled reserves dwindled by 495 million and banks began to accumulate substantial excess reserves the story was much the same in 1933 as a determined inflationary campaign conducted by the fed in the early part of the year controlled reserves rose by 785 million in february alone was defeated by the public and the banks and rm declined by over 3 billion or by almost 5 percent 27 so once the data have been properly arranged and interpreted it becomes clear that the fed does not deserve praise for the bank credit deflation of 1930 1933 this honor goes to private dollar holders domes tic and foreign who attempted to reclaim their rightful property from a central bank manipulated and inflationary financial system masquerading as a gold standard that had repeatedly betrayed their trust sterilizing gold in two follow up articles timberlake extends his attack on what he considers to be the deflationary monetary policies pursued by the treasury and fed in the mid 1930s in particular he criticizes the treasury s policy of neutralizing or sterilizing the effect of the inflow of gold on bank reserves from late 1936 to early 1938 and the fed s policy of increasing reserve requirements in 1936 and 1937 but neither of these policies caused a contraction of the money supply they merely temporarily interrupted a massive monetary inflation caused by the abolition of the gold standard and subsequent devaluation of the dollar engineered by the roosevelt administration it is important to recognize that this influx of gold was not a result of the uncontrolled operation of the gold standard which had been abolished in 1933 rather it was the result of the deliberate and steady increase in the price at which gold was purchased by the u s treasury and the reconstruction finance corporation by january 1934 the price of gold had risen from 20 67 to 35 00 per ounce or by almost 70 percent where it was officially pegged by the gold reserve act of 1934 the treasury was now legally mandated to maintain this devalued exchange rate between gold and the dollar by freely purchasing all the gold offered to it at this price in effect then treasury gold purchases were now economically identical to inflationary fed open market purchases substituting demonetized gold for government securities consequently in response to this unilateral increase in the price of gold above its world price there occurred a prodigious influx of gold into the united states a golden avalanche it was called at the time which vastly increased bank reserves the result was an unprecedented inflation of the money supply m2 during 1934 1935 and 1936 at annual rates of 14 percent 14 8 percent and 11 4 percent respectively 28 with respect to its influence on the supplies of bank reserves and money the demonetized gold stock thus had been transformed into a factor controlled by monetary in this case treasury policy given that the use and ownership of gold money by the public had been legally suppressed gold was effectively demonetized and its continued purchase by the treasury was purely a matter of discretionary monetary policy accordingly and contrary to timberlake s assertion when during 1937 the treasury began to finance its purchases of gold in a manner that neutralized their effect on bank reserves it was not engaging in deflation the simultaneous sales of government securities to finance these purchases were simply and properly eliminating any extraneous effects of a demonetized asset on the money supply even if gold were permitted to continue in its monetary function however timberlake would still be wrong in criticizing the policy of neutralizing its effect on bank reserves for under a genuine currency school type gold standard a country s money supply would increase by exactly the amount of the gold inflow from abroad this is not inflationary and represents precisely the proper amount by which the money supply should expand because it is the outcome of the deliberate actions of the country s residents who are decreasing their purchases of foreign imports and increasing their sales of exports in order to satisfy their desires for greater money holdings this balance of payments mechanism is a natural part of the market economy and works continually on all levels including the region state town and even household to efficiently adapt money supply to relative changes in money demand a problem arises however when these benign money demand driven gold inflows are used as they were in the 1920s and early 1930s as bank reserves to create unbacked notes and deposits in this case as f a hayek has so aptly described international gold flows will regularly cause a serious distortion of the free market interest rate and investment pattern in the affected countries leading to a business cycle 29 the reason is that the needed adjustment in national money supplies upward or downward now entails creating or destroying fiduciary media by expanding or contracting bank loans in defiance of the preferences of the economy s consumers and savers thus a policy of neutralizing the effect of gold flows on bank reserves in the context of a fractional reserve banking system dominated by a central bank does not constitute a gross violation of the rules of the gold standard to the contrary it tends to facilitate the operation of the natural money supply mechanism that prevails under a genuine gold standard not surprisingly in the third article of the trilogy timberlake also objects to the fed s policy of raising reserve requirements in 1936 and 1937 which was undertaken to mop up the massive amounts of excess reserves held by the banking system timberlake advances two criticisms against this policy first the policy was unnecessary because even if all the excess reserves that existed on the eve of its implementation were subsequently fully loaned out by the banks the inflationary potential was relatively minor appealing to the banking school definition of inflation timberlake pronounces the 52 percent increase in the money supply that would have resulted as only mildly inflationary because the larger money supply would have exceeded the needs of trade of a fully employed economy by 5 6 percent at 1929 prices which were about 25 percent higher than prices prevailing in june 1936 30 in plain language timberlake is literally defining away a potential money and price inflation of gargantuan proportions because of its perceived expedience in expanding employment and output and extricating the economy from a depression but as timberlake himself admits in a footnote and as rothbard and other austrians have never ceased to argue what impeded the economy s natural and noninflationary recovery from the depression was the existence of government programs had actively worked against money price declines for ten years 31 growing money supply in his second criticism timberlake contends that the increase in reserve requirements went beyond closing off a potential avenue of recovery for the economy and turned what had been an ongoing recovery into another cyclical disaster but if we once again turn to timberlake s data we find that the money supply m2 continued to grow from 43 3 to 45 2 billion or by 4 4 percent between june 30 1936 and june 30 1937 the year in which this policy was implemented even if we focus on the last six months of the period there was hardly a wrenching deflation as the money supply increased at an annual rate of 0 8 percent 32 even from timberlake s monetarist standpoint then it is difficult to blame the recession within a depression of 1937 1938 on deflationary fed policy unfortunately timberlake s strained and narrow emphasis on fed deflationism as the cause of all the woes of the 1930s causes him to ignore a plausible austrian explanation of the relapse of 1937 as a result of a spurt of union activity due to the supreme court s upholding of the national labor relations act of 1935 money wages jumped 13 7 percent in the first three quarters of 1937 this sudden jump in the price of labor far outstripped the rise in output prices and with labor productivity substantially unchanged brought about a sharp decline in employment beginning in late 1937 33 the large upward spurt in excess reserves and the accompanying decrease in the money supply that we observe in timberlake s data between june 30 1937 and june 30 1938 therefore can be explained as the result and not the cause of the recession 34 as business profits were squeezed by the run up of labor costs and the economy slipped into recession banks prudently began to contract their loans and pile up liquid reserves to protect themselves against prospective loan defaults and bank runs to offset this uncontrolled decline of the money supply beginning in mid 1938 the fed and the treasury once again resorted to an inflationary policy reversing the reserve requirement increase and allowing gold inflows to once again pump up bank reserves as a result m2 increased by 5 9 percent 10 1 percent and 12 5 percent in 1938 1939 and 1940 respectively 35 our conclusion then is that the fed s monetary policy except for very brief periods in 1929 and 1936 1937 when it turned mildly disinflationist was consistently and unremittingly inflationist in the 1920s and 1930s this inflationism was the cause of the great depression and one of the reasons why it was so protracted

menafn jordan times by anatole kaletsky london the us economy has entered its 11th year of uninterrupted expansion breaking the previous record for the longest period of growth in american history without a recession but far from celebrating many economists conclude from this unprecedented performance that a recession is now overdue if not immediately then surely before the 2020 presidential election fortunately for the us economy but sadly for president donald trump s opponents the idea that economic expansions have some kind of natural lifespan and then die of old age has neither empirical nor theoretical support history shows that us expansions since the end of world war ii have varied in length from 12 months to 120 months with no sign of mean reversion moreover it can be argued that the 18 year period from 1982 to 2000 was really one continuous economic upswing interrupted only briefly by the spike in oil prices caused by iraq s invasion of kuwait and there are clearer instances of advanced economies that have avoided recessions for much longer than the ten year record the united states has just surpassed australia is now in its 28th year without a recession and the united kingdom experienced 17 years of uninterrupted growth from 1992 to 2008 unlike the us both australia and the uk are more recession prone because of their dependence on commodities finance and property speculation economic principles are equally unhelpful to advocates of the overdue recession theory the normal condition of any reasonably well managed market economy since the invention of active demand management policies in the 1940s is to continue expanding at around its trend rate of growth roughly 2 per cent in the us in the postwar period recessions have generally resulted from three causes substantial monetary or fiscal tightening in response to inflationary pressures some kind of financial crisis such as the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008 and the technology bust of 2000 or a massive external shock that vastly increased energy prices until one of these events occurs we can be fairly confident that the us expansion will not just die of old age why then are so many economists now worried about a us recession and convinced that financial markets are underestimating the downside risks to economic growth the main reasons are the us china trade war and a financial warning signal the inverted yield curve the first risk is obvious the second requires some explanation an inverted yield curve is a relatively unusual condition that occurs when long term bond yields fall below short term interest rates in the us the overnight federal funds rate is around 2 4 per cent but ten year yields recently fell to below 2 per cent such an inversion is often cited as a signal of imminent recession but it should not be the signal often comes years before the recession it claims to predict more important bond market pricing has drastically changed in the decade since the global financial crisis bond yields have become increasingly divorced from real economic conditions partly because of quantitative easing and regulatory pressures on pension funds to buy bonds regardless of economic conditions but mainly because inflation seems to have decoupled from unemployment and growth even if the decoupling of growth and inflation ultimately turns out to be illusory the mere fact that the us federal reserve and other central banks believe that the old growth inflation linkage is broken means that they will keep interest rates much lower for much longer than in previous economic cycles as long as central bankers continue to behave like this bond yields will continue to reflect investors expectations about what central banks will do with short term interest rates rather than their expectations about economic prospects or recession risks the main message from financial markets as i argued in april is not that the us is near a recession it is simply that the fed is preparing to cut interest rates if that happens and it almost certainly will a us recession will become less likely not more so the same is true in china the chinese government and central bank have responded to trump s trade war albeit somewhat belatedly by cutting interest rates and reserve requirements reducing taxes ramping up public spending and easing credit restraints china s stimulus measures like the fed s expected easing will take some time to feed through into economic data but these measures virtually guarantee that the us china trade war will cause only limited damage to growth prospects in both countries at least in the next year or two which is the time horizon over which macroeconomic policies operate a much more serious threat to the world economy comes from europe an innocent bystander in the us china trade war that has already suffered far more than either of the belligerents when the international monetary fund imf revised its 2019 growth projections in april to take account of the problems that emerged in late 2018 the forecasts for china and the us were essentially unchanged despite their trade war up 0 1 percentage point in china down 0 2 in the us but the imf downgraded its growth forecast for germany by 1 1 percentage points by 0 9 for italy and by 0 6 for the eurozone as a whole europe has been the main victim of the us china trade war for the same reason it was the main victim of the 2008 financial crisis which also originated in the us while the us and china are stimulating their economies to counteract the trade slowdown the european authorities are as usual responding with exactly the wrong policies instead of easing monetary fiscal or credit policies the eurozone response is pro cyclical the european commission is trying to force italy to reduce public spending and raise taxes germany s finance ministry is using lower than expected budget surpluses as an excuse to squeeze investment and delay tax cuts and bank supervisors are forcing banks to tighten their credit standards increase loss provisions and cut lending to preserve capital such policies condemned europe to spend most of the post crisis period in recession or near recession while the us and china enjoyed a decade of uninterrupted growth if similarly foolish policies are maintained the same thing will happen again anatole

meeting between himself and president xi is due on june 28 and 29 expectations are not very high that the two leaders will be ready to accept the terms and conditions of a trade deal economic conditions in both china and the us have worsened distinctly since the trade war however it is likely that trump and xi will at least get the ball rolling on restarting scheduled trade talks which were halted for the preceding six weeks if trump and xi shock with a breakthrough then risk appetite is likely to get a notable boost with equity markets expected to be the biggest beneficiaries on

standard poor s maintained costa rica s debt rating at bb but warned that it could lower it this year if the next government on may 8 does not take measures to resolve the fiscal problem in its review of the long term debt rating and in the short term the rating agency again pointed out that due to the absence of a fiscal reform public finances continue to erode limiting the possibilities of long term growth and increasing vulnerability to external shocks s p ensures that the probability of a reduction in the debt in the course of this year is 33 if the new government in may fails to address the problem of public finances advertisement persistent and high fiscal deficits could result in lower gdp growth a higher debt burden and growing external vulnerabilities leading to a downgrade in the rating on the contrary a prompt approval of a fiscal reform that reduces the deficit and stabilizes in general terms the burden of the government debt along with a growth in the economy and moderate account deficits could prevent further erosion of the financial profile this could the rating agency explains result in an improvement in the rating outlook from negative to stable this year click here for standard poor s global ratings requires registration from a press release by standard poor s lack of fiscal reform continues to erode costa rica s public finances constraining its long term growth prospects and highlighting its vulnerability to external shocks we are affirming our bb long term foreign and local currency ratings on costa rica the outlook remains negative reflecting the one in three chances that we could lower the ratings on costa rica this year if the new administration that takes office later this year fails to address the fiscal situation of the country advertisement rating action on feb 21 2018 s p global ratings affirmed its bb long term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on the republic of costa rica the outlook remains negative at the same time we affirmed our b short term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings and our bb transfer and convertibility assessment outlook the negative outlook reflects the at least one in three chance that we could lower the ratings this year if the new administration that takes office later this year fails to promptly address the fiscal situation of the country persistently high fiscal deficits could result in lower gdp growth a higher debt burden and increased external vulnerabilities that would lead to a downgrade conversely early approval of a fiscal reform that reduces the fiscal deficit and stabilizes the general government s debt burden along with continued economic growth and moderate current account deficits cads could prevent further erosion of the sovereign s financial profile this could lead us to revise the outlook to stable this year rationale the ratings on costa rica reflect its stable political system ample political checks and balances and higher social indicators than peers it also reflects the weak government effectiveness to approve fiscal reform quickly many years of large fiscal deficits have raised the government s debt burden that along with a high level of dollarization in the financial system and overall monetary inflexibility contributes to its external vulnerability advertisement institutional and economic profile new political landscape might increase the chances of fiscal reform which could benefit economic growth costa rica s stable political system and higher social indicators compare positively with peers the inability of the outgoing government of president luis guillermo solis to implement fiscal reform has weakened public finances national elections this year offer the possibility that the new president and congress might advance quickly with long discussed fiscal reform timely reform that reduces the fiscal deficit would have a positive impact on investors confidence and economic growth over the next few years costa rica continues to compare positively with peers in the region and insimilar rating categories because of its strong democratic history the stability of its political institutions and higher social standards overall low poverty and crime compare positively among most of its central american peers we estimate that its gdp per capita would reach us 11 580 in 2018 however our assessment of its institutional effectiveness also reflects the inability of several consecutive governments including congress to take measures on revenue and spending to control a persistently large fiscal deficit a prolonged stalemate in congress over policies to boost tax revenues and contain government spending has contributed to currently weak public finances lower investor confidence and worse debt management the results of national elections on feb 4 2018 indicate that the new congress will be modestly less fragmented than the last one which could help advance fiscal reform this year also the recent political debate about fiscal issues during the political campaign along with support from the private sector and international organizations could encourage the new administration and congress to take corrective actions soon in the presidential race fabricio alvarado from partido restauracion nacional prn got 24 9 of votes and carlos alvarado from the ruling partido acción ciudadana pac got 21 6 of votes they will face a runoff election on april 1 2018 these results show an overall vote against the country s two traditional political parties over the last 30 years partido liberacion nacional pln and partido unidad social cristiana pusc neither of which has a candidate in the second round of the presidential elections regardless of the winner we expect overall continuity in economic policy besides the fiscal reform the new government will also face accelerating public infrastructure investment and improve effectiveness of education spending among other challenges a smooth political transition and early approval of a fiscal reform could help recover economic growth momentum gdp growth of 3 2 in 2017 was the lowest since 2013 growth slowed in part because of less dynamic internal demand weak demand reflects rising domestic interest rates a consequence of heavy government borrowing in the country s limited domestic market for 2018 and 2019 we expect broadly similar economic activity in the country with average real gdp growth of 3 4 and gdp per capita growth of around 2 projected higher economic growth in the u s should keep the exports increasing more than likely offsetting higher prices on imports nevertheless current higher local interest rates would continue reflecting slower credit growth and sluggish private consumption and investment over the next few years fiscal reform would also contribute to easing pressure on the local credit market which could improve credit conditions for the private sector sustainable public finances and a more efficient energy sector while keeping crime rates low should keep costa rica s foreign direct investment fdi attractive and could boost economic growth flexibility and performance profile fiscal deterioration and external vulnerabilities are likely to persist while inflation could remain within target over the next two years we expect the general government fiscal deficit and debt levels to remain high and potentially rise if there is not fiscal reform the cad would likely remain moderate over the next few years mostly financed through fdi inflation will likely remain within the central bank s target despite expected higher commodity prices the still high level of dollarization in the financial system exposes costa rica to external shocks the general government deficit continued to increase and reached 5 7 of gdp in 2017 our definition of general government includes the central bank decentralized government agencies and social security on the expenditure side the main drivers were increases in central government capital expenditures and interest payments on the revenue side the tax and nontax revenue growth rate decelerated to 4 from 9 the previous year following decelerating gdp growth our base case assumes a slightly worse fiscal deficit this year above 6 of gdp and implementation of fiscal reform that starts to show results in 2019 gradually reducing the general government deficit toward 4 5 in 2020 such a fiscal trajectory should also help reduce the growing debt trend in 2017 net general government debt reached 44 7 of gdp more than double the 21 of 2010 a comprehensive fiscal reform would be necessary to stabilize and eventually start reducing the sovereign debt in the following years we forecast that costa rica s debt would continue rising to reach close to 52 of gdp in 2020 we expect a similar trend for interest payments that should nevertheless stay below 13 of general government revenues over the same period in 2017 interest payments reached the highest level over the last 10 years representing 11 of such revenues as of december 2017 21 of general government debt was denominated in foreign currency over the last two years the country has not been able to issue externally because of a lack of congressional authorization which is causing a crowding out effect in the local credit market with a corresponding rise in interest rates and deceleration of private credit given that the banks assets to gdp ratio is 77 and that our banking industry country risk assessment bicra is at 7 we consider costa rica s contingent liabilities as limited bicras are grouped on a scale from 1 to 10 ranging from what we view as the lowest risk banking systems to the highest risk this is also based on the immaterial size of the non deposit taking corporations 3 of gdp relative to the size of the deposit taking institutions and that the nonfinancial public enterprises have had historically flat balances costa rica s external profile has deteriorated in recent years given a cad that has averaged close to 4 over the last five years in 2017 the cad reached 3 2 of gdp covered in full by fdi the cad rose from the previous year 2 6 of gdp mainly because of a higher net income deficit following increased interest and dividend payments the trade deficit stayed at 9 of gdp balancing increased exports with higher oil prices that in turn increased the import bill while the service balance continued to post a surplus of 10 5 of gdp with almost half from the tourism sector we expect a gradual increase in costa rica s cad toward 4 of gdp up to 2020 mostly financed by fdi containing the sovereign s external debt burden this should keep the sovereign s gross external financing needs around 105 of current account receipts and usable reserves and its narrow net external debt gross external debt less official reserves other liquid external assets held by the public sector and financial sector external assets around 52 of car in 2018 2020 our projection considers higher expected u s growth the main destination of the country s exports and source of tourism moderate currency depreciation and possibly rising commodity prices and increased imports as economic growth recovers fdi continues to perform well despite increasing fiscal pressures and political uncertainty in 2017 fdi reached 5 of gdp broadly in line with the average of the previous three years steady fdi flows could be explained by the overall good business climate low crime rates and stronger human capital than its peers in the region a high level of dollarization in the financial system exposes costa rica to external shocks and at the same time constrains its monetary policy an unexpectedly sharp change in the exchange rate could create asset quality problems in the financial system dollarization also limits the central bank s ability to act as a lender of last resort in 2017 dollar denominated loans represented 39 of total loans to the private sector inflation recovered to 2 6 by year end 2017 from historical lows around 0 in the previous two years following increasing prices in commodities particularly hydrocarbons we expect inflation to remain within the central bank s target over the next two years 3 plus minus 1 as we expect that private consumption would stay subdued given higher interest rates compared to previous years which would compensate for higher commodity prices our inflation forecast also considers a similar colon gradual depreciation as in previous years the central bank s exchange rate policy is managed floating episodes of exchange rate volatility in 2017 were because of long lasting low local interest rates despite increases in the u s interest rate which contributed to local currency depreciation the central bank acted rapidly by using its foreign exchange reserves and increasing local interest rates to stabilize the currency in the second half of the year recurrent central bank intervention would prevent steep local currency depreciation over the next 12 months in october 2017 the central bank signed a new loan with fondo latinoamericano de reservas flar for us 1 billion that will be disbursed this year the bank estimates that reserves will stay around 13 of gdp a level we consider adequate in 2018 credit growth will likely remain slow we are expecting lower credit demand under the country s electoral process which brings uncertainty coupled with higher interest rates which could result in a fall of the consumption confidence levels and in credit appetite as in 2017 we expect this slowdown to continue during the first months of 2018 and then confidence levels could be restored during the second half of 2018 reaching annual credit growth around 8 supported mainly by corporate and commercial lending share this share print twitter telegram tumblr reddit pocket linkedin pinterest mastodon whatsapp email facebook like this like loading

is abilene affordable to a first year teacher not really usa today research found regarding teacher pay according to data released earlier this year starting teachers in the city were deemed unable to afford the average annual rent charged to live in the city in the abilene isd for example starting teachers this past school year earned 45 000 before taxes and other deductions meanwhile average annual rent costs came out to about 12 400 according to figures released by real estate site zillow studying both private and public school teachers throughout the city usa today determined first year teachers spend about 35 percent of their take home income on rent what does affordable mean to gauge teachers standard of living usa today looked at salaries in the lowest middle and highest pay brackets in almost all the nation s metropolitan areas cities and their surrounding counties the data reflect the earnings of teachers in public and private schools collected as part of a bureau of labor statistics survey released in may 2017 areas were deemed affordable if teachers would have to spend no more than 30 percent of their salaries after accounting for federal taxes to afford the local median rent or mortgage that s in line with experts recommendations for budgeting in today s era of teacher strikes and walkouts in larger cities such as los angeles and in states such as oklahoma and west virginia the analysis answers a key question can educators in this area afford to live on their take home pay often that answer is no because housing costs exceeded 30 percent of teachers salaries after taxes the reasons why varied depending on the community starting teacher salaries were low or teachers pay didn t increase much over time or housing was comparably expensive compounding teachers financial challenges are other costs the analysis could not include such as student debt health insurance contributions and child care costs more experience more pay it s not as bad of an outlook for teachers in the higher wage brackets percentages of rent mortgage payment to take home income dropped below the 30 percent level if they were at the median range of service in abilene isd the median is 15 years as a teacher according to usa today these teachers paid about 29 percent of their income to housing for those who were nearing the end of their careers the percentage dropped to slightly less than 23 percent nearby wylie isd trustees approved their own cost of living increases for its teaching staff before the start of the year and with a new state law

teachers with about 2 9 million in new salary expenses wylie isd meanwhile will employ about 310 teachers next year with a new middle school and an expanded elementary school opening state mandates to increase teacher pay in texas have led some teacher groups to advocate for more than just a cost of living increase education abilene the abilene isd group affiliated with the texas state teachers association and the national education association released a series of requests they re making to the district s trustees ahead of budget considerations posted to the group s social media pages the requests are for a 2 000 increase to starting teacher pay 5 percent to 6 percent increases to all steps after that and one time payments to help offset health insurance costs a practice abilene isd has embraced in years past education abilene also has spent considerable time advocating for other employees in the district including aides and has requested all auxiliary and paraprofessional employees receive at least 10 per hour pay a little less than 1 million in additional funds must be paid to employees including these paraprofessionals education abilene president roger hall said he has had meetings with superintendent david young about these requests and talks have been productive ahead of july and august board meetings hall said young and the district s school board have been easy to work with concerning teacher salaries each of the past five years as long as he s been a teacher at cooper high school the district has offered some sort of increase and since young joined the district at the start of the 2015 16 school year hall said he s reformed the compensation package to provide even more money to educators at a more equitable level outside abilene is tougher in sunny miami bilingual elementary teacher mari corugedo has 26 years of experience a master s degree and a passion for helping spanish speaking students quickly learn english her annual compensation for those skills 64 000 plus benefits that doesn t go far in this popular coastal city where median rent has shot up to almost 2 000 per month and the median mortgage is almost 1 300 per month before taxes or insurance according to the real estate site zillow we spend a good 30 percent to 40 percent of our income on our mortgage said corugedo 52 i would have moved out of miami by now if not for my husband s additional income beginner teachers have an even tougher time affording miami skyrocketing housing prices combined with relatively low educator salaries have made the area one of the nation s priciest cities for starting teachers in the first analysis of its kind usa today examined salaries and housing costs for teachers all over the country new teachers can t afford the median rent almost anywhere in the u s the analysis shows a point often made during recent teacher strikes across the country but that s not the full story it s not just pay no matter where they work or what they earn teachers feel disrespect despite widespread demand for higher salaries teachers in some regions are making ends meet especially as they approach the middle of their careers in other areas mid career teachers are right to say they can t afford to live on their salaries without picking up side hustles or commuting long distances some of those places are only affordable for the very highest paid teachers and then there are places that no teacher can afford no matter how much they earn such as miami a lot of people who have a passion for education cannot make it as a career said karla hernandez mats president of the union for teachers in miami dade county public schools we have teachers as uber drivers lyft drivers they certainly love teaching but they can t pay their bills with love starting out teachers can afford few cities beginning teachers or those in the bottom 10 percent of the pay scale can afford to rent a median priced unit in just 13 of the 291 metro areas analyzed the johnstown pennsylvania metro area is one of them the former steelworker town about 90 minutes east of pittsburgh is a distressed city with a low tax base around 3 000 students attend schools in the local district 83 percent of them are poor a starting johnstown teacher with a bachelor s degree earns 49 995 nearby homes are relatively cheap in part because the city has a number of blighted properties and public housing complexes as a result said nancy behe president of the johnstown teachers union many teachers own their homes instead of renting teacher pay varies in the smaller districts nearby but in one the starting salary is just 18 500 behe said which pulls down pay for the johnstown metro area in the usa today analysis new teachers also can afford to live in springfield ohio starting salaries in the school district are currently about 37 000 and rising to 37 789 next year plus the current contract gives teachers an annual bonus of 1 000 said kathryn richison a longtime springfield teacher houses in springfield are affordable she said that s largely because people aren t clamoring to buy or rent them many choose to live instead in nearby dayton or columbus for the big city amenities richison said how much should teachers be paid the average salary of a u s teacher was 58 950 in 2016 17 when adjusted for inflation that s slightly less than what the average teacher earned almost two decades ago even when benefits are thrown in america s teachers earned 13 less in 2018 than private sector workers with similar levels of education according to the economic policy institute the nonprofit think tank which receives funding from labor unions examined decades of federal data growing unrest over low pay sparked teacher walkouts last year in states such as arizona oklahoma and west virginia wages have continued to be at the heart of teacher demonstrations in 2019 have teacher strikes worked how a west virginia teacher s facebook post

according to government data first reported by the wall street journal both political parties have taken note republicans who trimmed education budgets over the past decade are starting to pivot

president former vice president joe biden has proposed tripling federal money for low income schools in part to give teachers raises u s sen kamala harris from california wants to give the average american teacher a 13 500 raise or enough to cover the gap between teachers and other college educated workers that would cost the federal government about 315 billion over 10 years many mid career teachers need a side hustle for now just under half of the metropolitan areas studied 135 are affordable for teachers earning a median wage for teachers in the rest of the country the hustle continues year after year in the clairton school district in western pennsylvania fifth grade teacher stacie baur earns about 43 100 per year her bachelor s and master s degrees saddled her with 130 000 in debt for extra income she rises before 4 a m every day to teach children in china how to speak english via a video feed baur earns 10 50 for each 25 minute class during the week she ll teach four in a row before rushing to clairton on the weekends she teaches 10 classes each day baur and her husband live 25 minutes from clairton in pittsburgh because they like the city housing in clairton is cheaper but they found a great deal on a pittsburgh apartment for 850 per month baur 33 doesn t see herself owning a home or starting a family anytime soon we haven t been able to save for the down payment yet baur said it s hard to save when things keep getting more expensive these mid career teachers are still struggling in some areas teachers are struggling because their pay doesn t increase much even as they gain more years of experience on average in the metros analyzed usa today found that elementary school teachers salaries grow by 31 322 after taxes as they moved from the bottom to the top of the pay scale but in some metro areas teachers salaries increased far less than that in the districts around enid oklahoma a state where teachers went on strike in 2018 to protest some of the lowest pay in the country salaries start around 32 000 the top 10 percent of earners in the largely rural area are only pocketing 48 000 after federal taxes according to usa today s analysis in enid public schools salaries ranged from about 38 000 to about 60 000 this past year according to the state teachers union jennie scott an elementary teacher in enid said health insurance costs make the area tough to afford scott said she paid 200 monthly for family coverage when she taught in georgia now it s 700 monthly out of pocket if she wants to pay for health insurance for the family a lot of teachers i know have insurance for themselves but not their husband and kids she said they just pray it will work out salaries in oklahoma are inching up public school teachers received an average 6 100 pay bump after the walkouts in 2018 and they ll receive another average 1 220 pay bump this year over on the east coast school districts generally pay higher salaries but housing is more expensive too ryan brown a bridgeport connecticut middle school teacher lives at his parents place 45 minutes away because he can t afford rent in bridgeport before taxes brown s six years of experience earn him about 56 000 a year he also spends two nights a week tutoring that nets him an additional 600 per month which is helping him pay down 11 000 in student loans teachers don t usually make a lot of money out of the gate said brown 29 but the steady incline is not as steady as you think brown has joined educators for excellence a group that s backing a bill in connecticut that would allow cities to create affordable housing programs for teachers some teachers have left u s entirely overseas teaching jobs give fair salary housing respect low pay can be offset by really cheap housing in rural texas teacher sarah mcmanus has 12 years of experience and works at a middle school in henderson about two hours from dallas she earns 42 000 annually before taxes but she and her husband who works in medical billing easily can afford a home with five bedrooms two bathrooms and a swimming pool they bought the house for about 140 000 the monthly mortgage is only about 1 200 and their property taxes are negligible when she lived in dallas mcmanus worked in the gig economy to help supplement her salary as a single teacher now she appreciates the affordability of country living but she still misses some big city perks i see my students around town every day and i have a seven minute commute to school mcmanus said but i do miss the mall and the symphony and wearing heels for senior teachers most metros are affordable america s top earning teachers can afford the median rent in almost all the metro areas usa today studied specifically 249 out of 291 in new york city s public schools teacher salaries range from about 61 000 to about 129 000 according to the specifics of the 2019 2022 contract reported by chalkbeat an education news site that s all before taxes salaries for teachers in charter and private schools in the nyc metro area can be less partly because of those high end salaries a city that s legendary for expensive apartments is actually affordable for an individual teacher once he or she reaches the top of the pay scale teachers in the top 10 percent of earners in the new york metro area would need to spend about 28 percent of their salaries to afford the city s median rent according to usa today s analysis now consider baltimore ap statistics teacher jackie secor is in her 12th year of teaching in the baltimore city school district where she earns about 93 000 in base pay before taxes the 34 year old receives a special pay boost for exemplary teachers secor lives just outside the city in a three bedroom 1 5 bath home that she shares with her husband an architect and two kids their mortgage is about 2 000 monthly secor said she never has had trouble affording rent as a starting teacher she earned about 43 000 and lived with a roommate by her fifth or sixth year she paid 1 100 per month on an apartment for herself baltimore pays really well and it s affordable secor said i hear people complain about class size but not about pay some metros are too expensive for all teachers the list of metro areas that are never affordable for teachers is mostly unsurprising the california tech hubs of san jose and san francisco lead the list along with leisurely ritzy napa honolulu hawaii is up there as well paradise living with 2 roommates in a dump hawaii is too expensive for teachers then there s miami in usa today s analysis top earning elementary teachers around miami only took home about 58 000 after taxes with local rent at around 1 900 per month that means even the highest paid teachers would spend more than a third of their salaries on housing corugedo the veteran bilingual teacher said rising housing prices have driven young teachers out of miami it s a big factor in the district s teacher shortage she said a lot of my colleagues have to tutor work a second job or do after school care for other people s children corugedo said the community has started to respond miami residents approved a property tax referendum in fall 2018 that put 211 million toward teacher raises the largest rental company in miami dade county now offers move in discounts for educators corugedo she said she s lucky her combined income allows her to afford her house her husband has a good job with ups a position that didn t even require a college degree he makes a lot more than i do she said education coverage at usa today is made possible in part by a grant from the bill melinda gates foundation the gates foundation does not provide editorial input if you appreciate locally driven news you can support local journalists with a digital subscription to reporternews com how we did it this story caps a school year focus on the pressures facing american teachers to perform the analysis usa today relied on data from two sources salary figures came from employers who reported to the bureau of labor statistics occupational employment statistics program as released in may 2017 because elementary teachers are the most prevalent the analysis focused on elementary pay in the 10th median and 90th percentile in each metro the survey includes public and private schools other analyses of teacher salaries tend to use a single measure of pay usually starting teacher salaries or median pay both of which oversimplify the issue usa today s spectrum of pay approach based on percentiles was designed to account for the fact that most teachers make more money as they gain years of experience similarly examining pay in metro areas instead of states allowed reporters to differentiate between high and low cost areas even within the same state to further account for real life factors usa today applied the federal tax rate for single filers to each salary figure to estimate elementary teachers take home pay in each metro next the analysis aimed to show whether teachers could afford to live on their take home pay their pay was compared with the proprietary zillow rental index from the real estate website that measure starts with median rents in each metro and applies a three month moving average while accounting for outlier figures the analysis focused on rent prices because mortgage payments can vary dramatically based on local taxes interest rates and insurance rates rental prices were most inclusive of the additional costs that factor into housing the 291 metros analyzed were those for which data existed in both the federal salary and zillow data sets
we hear a lot about suicide when celebrities like anthony bourdain and kate spade die by their own hand otherwise it seldom makes the headlines that s odd given the magnitude of the problem in 2017 47 173 americans killed themselves in that single year in other words the suicide count was nearly seven times greater than the number of american soldiers killed in the afghanistan and iraq wars between 2001 and 2018 a suicide occurs in the united states roughly once every 12 minutes what s more after decades of decline the rate of self inflicted deaths per 100 000 people annually the suicide rate has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s suicides now claim two and a half times as many lives in this country as do homicides even though the murder rate gets so much more attention in other words we re talking about a national epidemic of self inflicted deaths worrisome numbers anyone who has lost a close relative or friend to suicide or has worked on a suicide hotline as i have knows that statistics transform the individual the personal and indeed the mysterious aspects of that violent act why this person why now why in this manner into depersonalized abstractions still to grasp how serious the suicide epidemic has become numbers are a necessity according to a 2018 centers for disease control study between 1999 and 2016 the suicide rate increased in every state in the union except nevada which already had a remarkably high rate in 30 states it jumped by 25 or more in 17 by at least a third nationally it increased 33 in some states the upsurge was far higher north dakota 57 6 new hampshire 48 3 kansas 45 idaho 43 alas the news only gets grimmer since 2008 suicide has ranked 10th among the causes of death in this country for americans between the ages of 10 and 34 however it comes in second for those between 35 and 45 fourth the united states also has the ninth highest rate in the 38 country organization for economic cooperation and development globally it ranks 27th more importantly the trend in the united states doesn t align with what s happening elsewhere in the developed world the world health organization for instance reports that great britain canada and china all have notably lower suicide rates than the u s as do all but six countries in the european union japan s is only slightly lower world bank statistics show that worldwide the suicide rate fell from 12 8 per 100 000 in 2000 to 10 6 in 2016 it s been falling in china japan where it has declined steadily for nearly a decade and is at its lowest point in 37 years most of europe and even countries like south korea and russia that have a significantly higher suicide rate than the united states in russia for instance it has dropped by nearly 26 from a high point of 42 per 100 000 in 1994 to 31 in 2019 we know a fair amount about the patterns of suicide in the united states in 2017 the rate was highest for men between the ages of 45 and 64 30 per 100 000 and those 75 and older 39 7 per 100 000 the rates in rural counties are almost double those in the most urbanized ones which is why states like idaho kansas new hampshire and north dakota sit atop the suicide list furthermore a far higher percentage of people in rural states own guns than in cities and suburbs leading to a higher rate of suicide involving firearms the means used in half of all such acts in this country there are gender based differences as well from 1999 to 2017 the rate for men was substantially higher than for women almost four and a half times higher in the first of those years slightly more than three and a half times in the last education is also a factor the suicide rate is lowest among individuals with college degrees those who at best completed high school are by comparison twice as likely to kill themselves suicide rates also tend to be lower among people in higher income brackets the economics of stress this surge in the suicide rate has taken place in years during which the working class has experienced greater economic hardship and psychological stress increased competition from abroad and outsourcing the results of globalization have contributed to job loss particularly in economic sectors like manufacturing steel and mining that had long been mainstays of employment for such workers the jobs still available often paid less and provided fewer benefits technological change including computerization robotics and the coming of artificial intelligence has similarly begun to displace labor in significant ways leaving americans without college degrees especially those 50 and older in far more difficult straits when it comes to finding new jobs that pay well the lack of anything resembling an industrial policy of a sort that exists in europe has made these dislocations even more painful for american workers while a sharp decline in private sector union membership downfrom nearly 17 in 1983 to 6 4 today has reduced their ability to press for higher wages through collective bargaining furthermore the inflation adjusted median wage has barely budged over the last four decades even as ceo salaries have soared and a decline in worker productivity doesn t explain it between 1973 and 2017 productivity increased by 77 while a worker s average hourly wage only rose by 12 4 wage stagnation has made it harder for working class americans to get by let alone have a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents or grandparents the gap in earnings between those at the top and bottom of american society has also increased a lot since 1979 the wages of americans in the 10th percentile increased by a pitiful 1 2 those in the 50th percentile did a bit better making a gain of 6 by contrast those in the 90th percentile increased by 34 3 and those near the peak of the wage pyramid the top 1 and especially the rarefied 0 1 made far more substantial gains and mind you we re just talking about wages not other forms of income like large stock dividends expensive homes or eyepopping inheritances the share of net national wealth held by the richest 0 1 increased from 10 in the 1980s to 20 in 2016 by contrast the share of the bottom 90 shrank in those same decades from about 35 to 20 as for the top 1 by 2016 its share had increased to almost 39 the precise relationship between economic inequality and suicide rates remains unclear and suicide certainly can t simply be reduced to wealth disparities or financial stress still strikingly in contrast to the united states suicide rates are noticeably lower and have been declining in western european countries where income inequalities are far less pronounced publicly funded healthcare is regarded as a right not demonized as a pathway to serfdom social safety nets far more extensive and apprenticeships and worker retraining programs more widespread evidence from the united states brazil japan and sweden does indicate that as income inequality increases so does the suicide rate if so the good news is that progressive economic policies should democrats ever retake the white house and the senate could make a positive difference a study based on state by state variations in the u s found that simply boosting the minimum wage and earned income tax credit by 10 appreciably reduces the suicide rate among people without college degrees the race enigma one aspect of the suicide epidemic is puzzling though whites have fared far better economically and in many other ways than african americans their suicide rate is significantly higher it increased from 11 3 per 100 000 in 2000 to 15 85 per 100 000 in 2017 for african americans in those years the rates were 5 52 per 100 000 and 6 61 per 100 000 black men are 10 times more likely to be homicide victims than white men but the latter are two and half times more likely to kill themselves the higher suicide rate among whites as well as among people with only a high school diploma highlights suicide s disproportionate effect on working class whites this segment of the population also accounts for a disproportionate share of what economists anne case and angus deaton have labeled deaths of despair those caused by suicides plus opioid overdoses and liver diseases linked to alcohol abuse though it s hard to offer a complete explanation for this economic hardship and its ripple effects do appear to matter according to a study by the st louis federal reserve the white working class accounted for 45 of all income earned in the united states in 1990 but only 27 in 2016 in those same years its share of national wealth plummeted from 45 to 22 and as inflation adjusted wages have decreased for men without college degrees many white workers seem to have lost hope of success of any sort paradoxically the sense of failure and the accompanying stress may be greater for white workers precisely because they traditionally were much better off economically than their african american and hispanic counterparts in addition the fraying of communities knit together by employment in once robust factories and mines has increased social isolation among them and the evidence that it along with opioid addiction and alcohol abuse increases the risk of suicide is strong on top of that a significantly higher proportion of whites than blacks and hispanics own firearms and suicide rates are markedly higher in states where gun ownership is more widespread trump s faux populism the large increase in suicide within the white working class began a couple of decades before donald trump s election still it s reasonable to ask what he s tried to do about it particularly since votes from these americans helped propel him to the white house in 2016 he received 64 of the votes of whites without college degrees hillary clinton only 28 nationwide he beat clinton in counties where deaths of despair rose significantly between 2000 and 2015 white workers will remain crucial to trump s chances of winning in 2020 yet while he has spoken about and initiated steps aimed at reducing the high suicide rate among veterans his speeches and tweets have never highlighted the national suicide epidemic or its inordinate impact on white workers more importantly to the extent that economic despair contributes to their high suicide rate his policies will only make matters worse the real benefits from the december 2017 tax cuts and jobs act championed by the president and congressional republicans flowed to those on the top steps of the economic ladder by 2027 when the act s provisions will run out the wealthiest americans are expected to have captured 81 8 of the gains and that s not counting the windfall they received from recent changes in taxes on inheritances trump and the gop doubled the annual amount exempt from estate taxes wealth bequeathed to heirs through 2025 from 5 6 million per individual to 11 2 million or 22 4 million per couple and who benefits most from this act of generosity not workers that s for sure but every household with an estate worth 22 million or more will as for job retraining provided by the workforce innovation and opportunity act the president proposed cutting that program by 40 in his 2019 budget later settling for keeping it at 2017 levels future cuts seem in the cards as long as trump is in the white house the congressional budget office projects that his tax cuts alone will produce even bigger budget deficits in the years to come the shortfall last year was 779 billion and it is expected to reach 1 trillion by 2020 inevitably the president and congressional republicans will then demand additional reductions in spending for social programs this is all the more likely because trump and those republicans also slashedcorporate taxes from 35 to 21 an estimated 1 4 trillion in savings for corporations over the next decade and unlike the income tax cut the corporate tax has no end date the president assured his base that the big bucks those companies had stashed abroad would start flowing home and produce a wave of job creation all without adding to the deficit as it happens however most of that repatriated cash has been used for corporate stock buy backs which totaled more than 800 billion last year that in turn boosted share prices but didn t exactly rain money down on workers no surprise of course since the wealthiest 10 of americans own at least 84 of all stocks and the bottom 60 have less than 2 of them and the president s corporate tax cut hasn t produced the tsunami of job generating investments he predicted either indeed in its aftermath more than 80 of american companies stated that their plans for investment and hiring hadn t changed as a result the monthly increase in jobs has proven unremarkable compared to president obama s second term when the economic recovery that trump largely inherited began yes the economy did grow 2 3 in 2017 and 2 9 in 2018 though not 3 1 as the president claimed there wasn t however any unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before as he insisted in this year s state of the union address anyway what matters for workers struggling to get by is growth in real wages and there s nothing to celebrate on that front between 2017 and mid 2018 they actually declined by 1 63 for white workers and 2 5 for african americans while they rose for hispanics by a measly 0 37 and though trump insists that his beloved tariff hikes are going to help workers they will actually raise the prices of goods hurting the working class and other low income americans the most then there are the obstacles those susceptible to suicide face in receiving insurance provided mental health care if you re a white worker without medical coverage or have a policy with a deductible and co payments that are high and your income while low is too high to qualify for medicaid trump and the gop haven t done anything for you never mind the president s tweet proclaiming that the republican party will become the party of healthcare let me amend that actually they have done something it s just not what you d call helpful the percentage of uninsured adults which fell from 18 in 2013 to 10 9 at the end of 2016 thanks in no small measure to obamacare had risen to 13 7 by the end of last year the bottom line on a problem that literally has life and death significance for a pivotal portion of his base trump has been awol in fact to the extent that economic strain contributes to the alarming suicide rate among white workers

2019 bloomberg finance lp there s been a lot of talk about how cryptocurrencies and blockchain are at odds with policy objectives and nation states especially with the emergence of libra and the reaction to it from policy makers across the world however there are areas of collaboration where the spirit of bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies it spawned reduces the volatility generated by the conventional financial system one of the most underrated implications of the great recession in 2008 was how it showed the stark weaknesses and strengths of an integrated global economy and spurred policy innovations to break out of the silo of nation by nation monetary policy one of the most direct mechanisms for this was the rise of currency swaps open lines where central banks agree to swap their domestic currencies between each other to help alleviate financial problems in foreign jurisdictions that increasingly affected globalized domestic currencies this had been something tested with the chiang mai initiative cmi and the asian financial crisis but the global financial crisis of 2008 was the first time this regional set up became a global reality and it is only now that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are playing an experimental role on december 12th 2017 the federal reserve extended us dollar swap lines with both the european central bank and the swiss national bank allowing both of them to fulfill domestic demand for us dollars european and swiss demand for us dollars was actually affecting short term funding markets and interest rates the currency swaps allowed the federal reserve to alleviate those pressures without directly funding foreign banks the ecb and snb stepped in instead after lehman brothers declared bankruptcy the federal reserve voted to extend swap lines to other established g10 central banks as well as less established central banks as needed to address strains in money markets in other jurisdictions nor was the fed alone in doing this soon the european central bank would send euros to sweden and the swiss national bank would send swiss francs to the ecb banks around the world had borrowed too many funds in foreign currencies and central banks needed to have reserves in those foreign currencies to satisfy demand in effect a global and integrated economy needed a coordinated monetary response one of the most interesting decisions for central banks when it came to swap lines was just who to extend them to what governments and central banks outside of the g10 would get the privilege in the end the fed decided to also extend swap lines to brazil mexico singapore and south korea all of which were outside the established group of g10 economies the criterion for these were not well established beyond the fact that instability in these economies might have affected the american economy however it showed what happened when a central bank whose brand runs on trust has to pick and choose which other central banks to trust in 2013 the federal reserve decided to keep the swap lines it had open during the crisis indefinitely open turning what had been a temporary solution into a permanent backstop for the global financial system ensuring that banks borrowing in foreign currencies could defray some of the risks of defaulting on those debts currency swaps are political decisions and central banks resorted to keeping collateral at hand for those partner central banks they did not fully trust every extension of a currency swap creates moral hazard on the part of the issuer european banks may have wanted us dollars because they had overextended their borrowing capabilities with this regard a currency swap with the fed guarantees they will never truly face financial consequences for that overextension into this heady policy discussion and this new monetary tool enter the monetary authority of singapore and the bank of canada s first pilot executing a bilateral currency swap between each other via distributed ledger technology in a talk at mit s business of blockchain conference chief fintech officer of the monetary authority of singapore sopnendu mohanty explicitly mentioned the pilot and expanded upon it the next wave of central bank blockchain projects can make further progress by bringing technology exploration together with policy questions about the future of cross border payments on stage he talked about distributed ledgers as a potential solution to how to deal with central banks that were not as established in the global financial system as the g10 central banks and explicitly mentioned developing future pilots of cross border currency swaps driven by distributed ledger technologies in the canadian policy speech mentioning the domestic dlt experiment project jasper the bank of canada was to embark on trade finance and cross border currency swaps were explicitly mentioned with the bank of canada claiming one estimate suggests dlt could enable banks to save as much as 20 billion a year in global back office costs if applied to cross border payments securities trading and regulatory compliance about as much money as the amount poured into fintech every year from an earlier part of the speech it is clear that dlt can help solidify the formation of currency swaps even among partner central banks who may have reasons to doubt one another dlt and blockchains allow central banks perform cross border settlement near instantly allowing much needed funds to flow quickly in times of crisis beyond that however is a tacit admission that some of the principles of bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies it spawned have paradoxically addressed key points of weakness in the evolution of the global financial system currency swaps are a realpolitik take on the reality that domestic monetary policy is eroded by foreign money markets the ability to transact without a very high threshold of trust and the need to do so immediately harken back to a fundamental tenet of cryptocurrency while much has been written about the tensions between cryptocurrencies and central banks in truth we might be witnessing an ongoing hegelian dialectic with the global financial system as thesis cryptocurrency as anti thesis and the synthesis of the two yet to come
bad news suddenly has become good again no matter where you look there are signs of a global slowdown while wars are brewing at a trade currency and even military level here at home the economy is sputtering growth is slowing inflation is on the mat unemployment is ticking higher the situation has deteriorated to such an extent that it s even jolted the reserve bank into action after three years of nothing it cut rates three weeks ago and now the betting is on that we could see another cut as early as next week many economists are tipping three cuts this year and yet at every turn investors appear to be overjoyed clamouring over one another to pile into the stock market after taking a thumping late last year when the global outlook appeared relatively benign optimistic even the local market this year has been on a tear notching up one of the strongest performances in the world with an 18 per cent gain and things will only get better as the news gets worse growth slowdown fires up stocks last week our stock market galloped to an 11 year high and finally is within striking distance of cracking the record from october 2007 just before the global economy tanked compare that with wall street before the crash a decade ago the dow jones industrial average peaked at around 14 000 points on friday it closed at 26 719 points more than double its pre crash peak for most of the past decade australia has outpaced america s economy the resources boom saw us power through the worst of the global financial crisis as almost every major developed economy plunged into recession why then the relatively poor stock market performance shouldn t the market reflect what s happening in the economy in days past stock investors positioned themselves for where they saw the economy six or even 12 months ahead not any longer these days traders and investors pretty much care about just one thing interest rates the lower they go the better the market performs and generally speaking rates only fall in times of trouble when the economy needs a boost one reason for this apparent mismatch is that there is so much investment cash out there looking for a home when interest rates fall it quickly migrates to stocks there s another factor at work too the global economy now is so overloaded with debt that were interest rates ever to rise there would be a massive spate of defaults that once again could threaten the banking system that s why wall street tanked late last year as the us federal reserve persisted with its plan to normalise interest rates to push them higher december was its worst month since the great depression in the 1930s global debt now stands at more than us250 trillion 360 trillion more than three times its level 20 years ago much of it backed by property having painted themselves into a corner by issuing so much debt and printing so much cash central banks including our own reserve bank are now so frightened about the potentially catastrophic impact of a downturn in either stock or property markets that they are prepared to do almost anything to avoid it market values must be maintained it s a great strategy for anyone who owns a home or has a share portfolio for those who don t it s a recipe for disaster or at the very least a widening of inequality and the wealth gap why the rba will cut again and again reserve bank governor philip lowe won t have a bar of it there s nothing wrong with the economy really the rba isn t cutting rates because things are deteriorating not at all it s cutting rates because the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment has slipped ah of course where we once imagined the nairu at 5 per cent unemployment the point considered full employment because anything under that saw labour shortages wage breakouts and rampant inflation it s now closer to 4 5 per cent maybe even lower that s an oblique way of saying we re in uncharted waters and the only way to navigate through is to throw caution to the wind the real reason for the rba rate cuts is the dramatic fall in housing prices and the prospect that unemployment may spike particularly if the escalating trade dispute between the us and china further crimps chinese economic growth should more people end up out of work as the graph below from investment bank ubs indicates there would be a rise in mortgage delinquencies and an acceleration of the housing price slump ubs labour demand index consistent with slowing of employment growth supplied if there are two more cuts in coming months that will take the official cash rate to 0 75 per cent and at that point we officially will have joined the race to the bottom of course quite a few countries already have reached the bottom and gone even further america spent years at zero per cent germany and other parts of europe have seen interest rates at well below zero japan however is the world leader in negative rates as this chart below shows market value of negative yielding debt supplied all up there s around us10 trillion worth of debt priced at an interest rate below zero why would anyone lend money deposit cash or buy a bond that guaranteed you d lose money primarily because they think rates could go even lower and many banks are forced to hold government issued bonds even ones that lose money for liquidity reasons once considered radical policy it s now becoming the norm and involves various strategies such as quantitative easing printing money zirp zero interest rate policy and nirp negative interest rate policy our monetary mandarins having explicitly raised the possibility of exploring such actions late last year this week ruled them out instead wisely urging governments to start spending big on infrastructure rate cut goes nowhere what now the disappointment must be palpable when the rba cut rates three weeks ago its primary goal was to sink the aussie dollar to make our exports more competitive and to give a leg up to local industry it worked for a while but by the end of last week the local currency had climbed back above us69c that s the problem with rate cuts and currency manipulation it only works when you go it alone or you re in the minority when everyone is doing it it has no effect at all shortly after our rate cut us president donald trump s demands for one at home grew louder as he openly discussed sacking fed chair jerome powell if he doesn t get his way european central bank chief mario draghi also has abandoned any plans to push rates higher eliciting an attack from mr trump who bizarrely for a leader engaged in the same strategy accused him of trying to manipulate the euro mr trump is threatening retaliation possibly through trade sanctions none of this bodes well for the global economy perhaps it s time to get into the stock market it s a great strategy until it isn t
trump clueless on trade tariffs president trump doesn t like u s trade deficits he also doesn t like migrants flowing into the u s from south of the border his tariffs and tariff threats are slowing trade and world economic growth and this will in turn increase the migrant flows into the united states after all as foreign economic activity slows and more foreigners are either thrown out of work or find their incomes drying up they will be motivated to migrate trump remains clueless as to why tariffs fuel migration but that s not trump s only international trade blind spot he and his cabinet think that u s trade deficits are a problem and that they are caused by foreign countries that manipulate their currencies and engage in unfair trade practices these ideas are wrongheaded these misguided ideas have plagued other administrations even those lead by free market presidents like ronald reagan indeed i spent many days while at reagan s council of economic advisers trying to defend the president s free trade ideas but at the end of the day the free trader faction which was led by the likes of reagan himself lost the war the protectionists who harbored exactly the same wrongheaded ideas as trump rolled us as my longtime colleague and close friend bill niskanen who was a member of reagan s council of economic advisers put it in his definitive book reaganomics an insider s account of the policies and the people oxford university press 1988 trade policy in the reagan administration is best described as a strategic retreat the consistent goal of the president was free trade both in the united states and abroad in response to domestic political pressure however the administration imposed more new restraints on trade than any administration since hoover a strategic retreat is regarded as the most difficult military maneuver and may be better than the most likely alternative but it is not a satisfactory outcome for those who want even more detail and a confirmation of that provided by nisknanen there is nothing better than the magisterial treatise by douglas irwin clashing over commerce a history of u s trade policy university of chicago press 2017 let s turn to the simple economics and evidence about the trade deficit that proves why president trump s trade message and protectionist policies are to put it simply wrong in economics identities play an important role these identities are obtained by equating two different breakdowns of a single aggregate identities are interesting and usually important by definition in national income accounting the following identity can be derived it is the key to understanding the trade deficit imports exports investment savings government spending taxes given this identity which must hold the trade deficit is equal to the excess of private sector investment over savings plus the excess of government spending over tax revenue so the counterpart of the trade deficit is the sum of the private sector deficit and the government deficit federal state and local the u s trade deficit therefore is just the mirror image of what is happening in the u s domestic economy if expenditures in the u s exceed the incomes produced in the u s which they do the excess expenditures will be met by an excess of imports over exports read a trade deficit the table below shows that newly released u s data support the important trade identity the cumulative trade deficit the u s has racked up since 1975 is about 12 377 trillion and the total investment minus savings deficit is about 11 255 trillion the data talk and they talk pretty loudly prof steve h hanke so president trump can bully countries he identifies as unfair traders he can impose all the restrictions on trading partners that his heart desires but it won t change the trade balance never mind the fact that most economists think president trump s ideas on trade are wrong when it comes to trade trump is the master of the message and the optics in consequence his base is with him on trade and so are a surprising number of others the problem is that trump s trade message is tailor made for delivery on twitter and television indeed those media outlets are suitable for sound bites but not for complex arguments and data points that s why economics is at a disadvantage when it comes to trump s favorite media nevertheless this is what economics has to say about the trade deficit bugaboo first it is not a problem indeed the u s has run a trade deficit every year since 1975 and the u s has done relatively well since then the sky didn t fall because of our trade deficit secondly the trade deficit is not made by foreigners who engage in unfair trade practices it is homegrown made in the u s a to the extent that domestic savings in the u s falls short of domestic investments the economy must import more than its exports resulting in a negative trade balance to finance the excess of imports over exports the u s must import capital from abroad this can be done without strain because the u s dollar is the world s reserve currency our borrowing from abroad shows up in the huge chunk of u s public debt that is held by foreigners as it turns out the trump administration s fiscal policies which promise an ever widening fiscal deficit will throw a spanner in trump s trade policy works if his fiscal deficits are not offset by an increase in private savings relative to private investment increases in the federal deficit will translate into larger trade deficits so the u s trade deficit will not only be made in the good old u s a it will be made by president trump himself an arch enemy of trade deficits by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter steve_hanke steve h hanke is a professor of applied

the us economy has entered its 11th year of uninterrupted expansion breaking the previous record for the longest period of growth in american history without a recession but far from celebrating many economists conclude from this unprecedented performance that a recession is now overdue if not immediately then surely before the 2020 presidential election fortunately for the us economy but sadly for president donald trump s opponents the idea that economic expansions have some kind of natural lifespan and then die of old age has neither empirical nor theoretical support history shows that us expansions since the end of world war ii have varied in length from 12 months to 120 months with no sign of mean reversion moreover it can be argued that the 18 year period from 1982 2000 was really one continuous economic upswing interrupted only briefly by the spike in oil prices caused by iraq s invasion of kuwait and there are clearer instances of advanced economies that have avoided recessions for much longer than the 10 year record the united states has just surpassed australia is now in its 28th year without a recession and the united kingdom experienced 17 years of uninterrupted growth from 1992 2008 unlike the us both australia and the uk are more recession prone because of their dependence on commodities finance and property speculation economic principles are equally unhelpful to advocates of the overdue recession theory the normal condition of any reasonably well managed market economy since the invention of active demand management policies in the 1940s is to continue expanding at around its trend rate of growth roughly 2 in the us in the postwar period recessions have generally resulted from three causes substantial monetary or fiscal tightening in response to inflationary pressures some kind of financial crisis such as the subprime mortgage collapse of 2008 and the technology bust of 2000 or a massive external shock that vastly increased energy prices until one of these events occurs we can be fairly confident that the us expansion will not just die of old age why then are so many economists now worried about a us recession and convinced that financial markets are underestimating the downside risks to economic growth the main reasons are the us china trade war and a financial warning signal the inverted yield curve the first risk is obvious the second requires some explanation an inverted yield curve is a relatively unusual condition that occurs when long term bond yields fall below short term interest rates in the us the overnight federal funds rate is around 2 4 but 10 year yields recently fell to below 2 such an inversion is often cited as a signal of imminent recession but it shouldn t be the signal often comes years before the recession it claims to predict more important bond market pricing has drastically changed in the decade since the global financial crisis bond yields have become increasingly divorced from real economic conditions partly because of quantitative easing and regulatory pressures on pension funds to buy bonds regardless of economic conditions but mainly because inflation seems to have decoupled from unemployment and growth even if the decoupling of growth and inflation ultimately turns out to be illusory the mere fact that the us federal reserve and other central banks believe that the old growth inflation linkage is broken means that they will keep interest rates much lower for much longer than in previous economic cycles as long as central bankers continue to behave like this bond yields will continue to reflect investors expectations about what central banks will do with short term interest rates rather than their expectations about economic prospects or recession risks the main message from financial markets as i argued in april is not that the us is near a recession it is simply that the fed is preparing to cut interest rates if that happens and it almost certainly will a us recession will become less likely not more so the same is true in china the chinese government and central bank have responded to trump s trade war albeit somewhat belatedly by cutting interest rates and reserve requirements reducing taxes ramping up public spending and easing credit restraints china s stimulus measures like the fed s expected easing will take some time to feed through into economic data but these measures virtually guarantee that the us china trade war will cause only limited damage to growth prospects in both countries at least in the next year or two which is the time horizon over which macroeconomic policies operate a much more serious threat to the world economy comes from europe an innocent bystander in the us china trade war that has already suffered far more than either of the belligerents when the international monetary fund revised its 2019 growth projections in april to take account of the problems that emerged in late 2018 the forecasts for china and the us were essentially unchanged despite their trade war up 0 1 percentage point in china down 0 2 in the us but the imf downgraded its growth forecast for germany by 1 1 percentage points by 0 9 for italy and by 0 6 for the eurozone as a whole europe has been the main victim of the us china trade war for the same reason it was the main victim of the 2008 financial crisis which also originated in the us while the us and china are stimulating their economies to counteract the trade slowdown the european authorities are as usual responding with exactly the wrong policies instead of easing monetary fiscal or credit policies the eurozone response is pro cyclical the european commission is trying to force italy to reduce public spending and raise taxes germany s finance ministry is using lower than expected budget surpluses as an excuse to squeeze investment and delay tax cuts and bank supervisors are forcing banks to tighten their credit standards increase loss provisions and cut lending to preserve capital such policies condemned europe to spend most of the post crisis period in recession or near recession while the us and china enjoyed a decade of uninterrupted growth if similarly foolish policies are maintained the same thing will happen again project syndicate

trump clueless on trade tariffs president trump doesn t like u s trade deficits he also doesn t like migrants flowing into the u s from south of the border his tariffs and tariff threats are slowing trade and world economic growth and this will in turn increase the migrant flows into the united states after all as foreign economic activity slows and more foreigners are either thrown out of work or find their incomes drying up they will be motivated to migrate trump remains clueless as to why tariffs fuel migration but that s not trump s only international trade blind spot he and his cabinet think that u s trade deficits are a problem and that they are caused by foreign countries that manipulate their currencies and engage in unfair trade practices these ideas are wrongheaded these misguided ideas have plagued other administrations even those lead by free market presidents like ronald reagan indeed i spent many days while at reagan s council of economic advisers trying to defend the president s free trade ideas but at the end of the day the free trader faction which was led by the likes of reagan himself lost the war the protectionists who harbored exactly the same wrongheaded ideas as trump rolled us as my longtime colleague and close friend bill niskanen who was a member of reagan s council of economic advisers put it in his definitive book reaganomics an insider s account of the policies and the people oxford university press 1988 trade policy in the reagan administration is best described as a strategic retreat the consistent goal of the president was free trade both in the united states and abroad in response to domestic political pressure however the administration imposed more new restraints on trade than any administration since hoover a strategic retreat is regarded as the most difficult military maneuver and may be better than the most likely alternative but it is not a satisfactory outcome for those who want even more detail and a confirmation of that provided by nisknanen there is nothing better than the magisterial treatise by douglas irwin clashing over commerce a history of u s trade policy university of chicago press 2017 let s turn to the simple economics and evidence about the trade deficit that proves why president trump s trade message and protectionist policies are to put it simply wrong in economics identities play an important role these identities are obtained by equating two different breakdowns of a single aggregate identities are interesting and usually important by definition in national income accounting the following identity can be derived it is the key to understanding the trade deficit imports exports investment savings government spending taxes given this identity which must hold the trade deficit is equal to the excess of private sector investment over savings plus the excess of government spending over tax revenue so the counterpart of the trade deficit is the sum of the private sector deficit and the government deficit federal state and local the u s trade deficit therefore is just the mirror image of what is happening in the u s domestic economy if expenditures in the u s exceed the incomes produced in the u s which they do the excess expenditures will be met by an excess of imports over exports read a trade deficit the table below shows that newly released u s data support the important trade identity the cumulative trade deficit the u s has racked up since 1975 is about 12 377 trillion and the total investment minus savings deficit is about 11 255 trillion the data talk and they talk pretty loudly prof steve h hanke so president trump can bully countries he identifies as unfair traders he can impose all the restrictions on trading partners that his heart desires but it won t change the trade balance never mind the fact that most economists think president trump s ideas on trade are wrong when it comes to trade trump is the master of the message and the optics in consequence his base is with him on trade and so are a surprising number of others the problem is that trump s trade message is tailor made for delivery on twitter and television indeed those media outlets are suitable for sound bites but not for complex arguments and data points that s why economics is at a disadvantage when it comes to trump s favorite media nevertheless this is what economics has to say about the trade deficit bugaboo first it is not a problem indeed the u s has run a trade deficit every year since 1975 and the u s has done relatively well since then the sky didn t fall because of our trade deficit secondly the trade deficit is not made by foreigners who engage in unfair trade practices it is homegrown made in the u s a to the extent that domestic savings in the u s falls short of domestic investments the economy must import more than its exports resulting in a negative trade balance to finance the excess of imports over exports the u s must import capital from abroad this can be done without strain because the u s dollar is the world s reserve currency our borrowing from abroad shows up in the huge chunk of u s public debt that is held by foreigners as it turns out the trump administration s fiscal policies which promise an ever widening fiscal deficit will throw a spanner in trump s trade policy works if his fiscal deficits are not offset by an increase in private savings relative to private investment increases in the federal deficit will translate into larger trade deficits so the u s trade deficit will not only be made in the good old u s a it will be made by president trump himself an arch enemy of trade deficits by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter steve_hanke steve h hanke is a professor of applied

us sanctions on iran and their growing impact on the local economy are aggravating the country s banking crisis forcing iran to choose between deep reforms or preserving short term financial stability of its liquidity deficient financial institutions significant liquidity and solvency problems are posing a growing risk to iran s financial stability according to a policy brief by the peterson institute for international economics piie the banking system s problems also stem from the heavy handed role of the state banks often corrupt relations with some semi official corporations and the central bank of iran s ineffectiveness in regulating lenders it added a substantial portion of banks assets is impaired and their capital positions are very weak adnan mazarei non resident senior fellow at piie and former deputy director at the international monetary fund said the us administration in november last year moved to reimpose sanctions on tehran leading to significant inflation and pressure on the country s economy as crude exports the main source of income for iran fell sharply iranian banks some of the state related entities and the government officials were also subject to us sanctions earlier in 2018 the us administration announced unilateral withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa signed by world powers to restrict iran s nuclear programme in exchange for economic relief the us move led to pressures on the iranian rial even prior to the sanctions taking effect iran s economy contracted by 3 9 per cent at the end of last year and the imf expects a further 6 per cent contraction in its gross domestic product in 2019 mr mazarei said iran s precarious banking system is expected to increase the economy s vulnerability to external factors a worsening of the banking crisis can probably be avoided in the short run but banking distress will continue to mount making the system more vulnerable to an external shock especially if iran s oil exports are completely halted or if there is a major military confrontation with the united states which could lead to much higher inflation and further financial difficulties he explained with reimposed us sanctions the liquidity in the banking system is expected to deteriorate prompting more capital injections from the central bank the piie noted iran now faces a choice between either implementing deeper reforms to correct the banking system or preserving short term financial stability structural reforms however would be challenging given the complexity and size of the problem the policy paper said given the difficult economic conditions fragile confidence in the banking system and the complexity and costs of cleaning up the banks the authorities are unlikely to pursue deep reform and will instead continue to focus on self preservation with a bias toward short term financial stability mr mazarei said even if a short term collapse of the banking sector could be avoided the worsening economic fundamentals will likely lead to further decay in banks balance sheets making them more vulnerable to weakened confidence in the system according to the policy paper asset quality is a major issue for the iranian lenders with official data indicating non performing loans climbing to about 11 per cent however unofficial figures suggest the impairment ratio could be as high as 50 per cent the piie said the lenders capital position is weak with capital adequacy reaching 4 9 per cent as of june 2017 below the basel 1 minimum requirements of 8 per cent it added the central bank has bailed out lenders in the past by providing large capital injections over the years as banks face chronic liquidity problems and their holdings of real estate and equity assets are making them more vulnerable to shifts in local economy with or without sanctions the situation is not sustainable for iran s banking system mr mazarei said
the peak of the vacation season is approaching which usually entails a decline in business activity including that in financial markets on the one hand a decrease in the volatility of major currency pairs which is already low entails a fall in profits but on the other hand it also reduces potential losses in the event of a failed position we have repeatedly discussed in our previous forecasts the trade wars led by us president trump with both china and europe and the possibility of a global economic crisis and local recessions brexit and other political risks prospects for a rate increase by the fed and quantitative easing in the eurozone as well as many other factors influencing the formation of both short term and long term trends if we talk about the mood of experts in the coming months for the most part they expect that the us dollar will be able to strengthen its position in relation to other leading world currencies eur usd here 75 of analysts supported by 80 of indicators on mn believe that the pair will definitely make another attempt to update the lows of spring 2019 and will finally break through support in the 1 1100 zone the targets for the bears are 1 0900 and 1 0800 of course a possible margin of 25 35 points must be considered according to the remaining 25 of experts the zone of 1 1100 is the fall limit and the pair will now go to the zone 1 1530 1 1650 most trend indicators and oscillators on w1 are also colored green usd chf the euro and the swiss franc are quite strongly correlated the european currency is falling against the dollar and the swiss currency is losing ground at the same time that is why here just as in the case of eur usd most experts 75 have preferred the american according to them the pair is expected to rise first to the level of 1 0130 and then 100 points higher to the height of 1 0230 by the way about 15 of the oscillators on w1 and mn are already signaling that the pair is oversold an alternative view is presented by a quarter of experts who do not see the dollar above the symbolic 1 0000 level in their opinion no more than 0 9600 0 9700 francs will be given for the american in the second half of the summer nzd usd and aud usd we only talk about those pairs in this review regarding the future of which most experts have already more or less formed an opinion one of these pairs is nzd usd here 85 of the votes have been cast for the bears if this prediction turns out to be correct the new zealand kiwi may fall to the low of 10 08 2018 in the zone of 0 6420 90 of the oscillators on both timeframes w1 and mn agree with this forecast bears have scored a bit less support when voting for the future of the nearest colleague of the new zealander the australian dollar those turned out to be only 60 true they have been supported by almost 85 of trend indicators and oscillators on w1 and mn the purpose of the bears is to update the june 17 lows reaching the bottom in the zone of 0 6750 0 6800 20 have favored the growth of the pair to the height of 0 7300 and another 20 have predicted a calm movement along the pivot point at the level of 0 7000 and there are two more pairs the forecasts for which have seemed to us quite interesting both are tied to the british pound these are gbp jpy and eur gbp 70 of analysts believe that the pair gbp jpy has reached its bottom at 135 65 and now it is expected to grow first to the height of 141 50 and then a rise above the horizon 143 75 is not excluded those experts who expect a tough brexit and the uk exit from the eu without a deal see the pair at 131 00 even though the british currency fell against the euro throughout may and early june most analysts are looking at the future of the pound rather optimistically just as in the case of gbp jpy 70 have voted for the growth of the pound and the decline of the eur gbp pair to the zone of 0 8600 0 8680 the next target is the lows of march 2019 in the area 0 8470 as for the bulls they aim to rise above the high of 01 01 2019 breaking the height of 0 9100
exactly two months after the first interaction program between national planning commission npc and nepal policy institute npi a follow up session attended by a senior member of the planning commission was held in bangkok on 29 may 2019 npi recalled issues of concerns in the context of preparation of the ongoing long term periodic development plan of nepal recommendations included priority goals for consideration by the government in the areas of i food security for nepal s imports of basic food items have not abated ii removing restrictions on all foreign direct investment laws iii adoption of economic diplomacy as top foreign policy strategy however there is ambiguity in the current budget plan for budget focus is on general welfare for political expediency in the context of long term development plan nepal policy institute has recommended a theme of building physical infrastructure for connectivity increased food production of basic food commodities prudent and effective use of management of natural resources with enhanced institutional monitoring capabilities starting with effective national planning commission proposed theme could have commenced through the current annual budget cycle nepal policy institute stresses the fact that without increased production of basic foods nepal will remain vulnerable for it is seriously in a vicious circle of food insecurity national sovereignty is compromised nation s economic vulnerability hinges on inadequate supply of basic food items because nepal is largely dependent on food imports from india government must attend to this and urgently open all investment avenues for food production this should start with removing all foreign direct investment barriers in small and medium enterprises promote foreign private investments in agriculture to boost increased food production by creating competitive productive environment which would contribute to increased basic food commodities cost efficiency quality product and better consumer pricing and reduce dependency from food imports without removing investment thresholds and restrictions on small and medium scale enterprises there is neither going to increase investment in agriculture sector nor generate rural employment employment focused investment in small and medium enterprise is practiced in countries in asia and elsewhere there is no need for limitations on investments so long as enterprises generate local employment foreign private investments will not eliminate local enterprises instead it creates competitive environment and promotes innovation through innovative entrepreneurship which will result into production quality competitive pricing and generate employment however support to vulnerable local communities will be essential in this endeavor for creating long term sustainability elusive private foreign direct investment global economic environment is undergoing a trough of times but the clear direction is yet to fully comprehend due to rise in protectionism in industrialized countries fueled by continuing trade disputes between the usa and china and others income disparity and technology war between the economic giants the rise of protectionism in trade can be attributed mainly to a widening income gaps between those who have benefitted from liberalized economic globalization and those who have not b stagnant economic growth in the western hemisphere c shift in growing market economic phenomenon to the east and falling demand in industrialized countries d innovation and application of game changer algorithm and d anxiety over disruptions emanating from advancing artificial intelligence these challenges will impact almost everything we can imagine including on employment production consumption human behavior socio political values and more significantly supply chain disruptions affecting emerging economies in asia and beyond but every challenge comes with new opportunities if we can recognize them and be creative and innovative nepal policy institute is curious whether government of nepal intends to capitalize on such opportunities as some countries in asia are either preparing or already marching so npi believes nepal must forthwith abolish all restrictive investment measures making nepal the most attractive destination in the world nepal must integrate into world economic mainstreams follow the trends through closer economic alliances with economic giants accessing wider market and nothing less without eliminating restrictions on foreign direct investments why would any private entrepreneur come to protectionist nepal for investment and for what reasons we must re evaluate our economic strategies which generally appear ineffective economic diplomacy should be energized pragmatically and timely and be conducive to creating free and open domestic investment environment starting at international business arena promoting technology free trade innovation and supply chain poverty eradication and standard of living nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the global map government ought to address this more coherently and differently drawing on relevant experiences from other countries specially china extreme poverty level below us 1 90 per person day at 2011 prices as established by the world bank in october 2015 remain static and this could change by the time nepal reaches to next category level poverty eradication program suffers from poor management of funds program overlapping and duplication of activities lacking sustainability focus because of politicization faulty implementation and unsatisfactory monitoring such program cannot ensure every citizen will have access to basic health care clean water schooling to high school beyond functional illiteracy sustainable income food with minimum nutrition clothing shelter and security which define standard of living per capita income of us 1 90 determined at 2011 prices will not be adequate for an acceptable level of minimum standard of living in the next decade governments have been professing that nepal will graduate from least developed country ldc category to middle level income countries by 2021 and attain sustainable development goal by 2030 this requires we must raise either per capita income level to us 2 460 from the current estimated level of us 1 007 or maintain steady progress target at no less than minimum of 66 on human development index and 32 on economic vulnerability index with restrictive investment environment and protectionist laws in statutes absence of industries basic infrastructures and without structural changes skilled labor technology and access to larger market nepal is unlikely to achieve us 2 460 per capita income target for graduation into the next category during the 2021 triennial review or able to sustain minimum progress achieved on human development and economic vulnerability indices informed nepal observers wonder whether there is an expectation that nepal will be treated differently or by any default promoted to entrance level of the next category and likely to forfeit all special treatments as favoured nation associated with ldc in securing investment loans credit and trading facilities in concessional terms this can only be a self inflicting venture like hara kiri in nation s development history the moot question is what specific efforts and productive activities are contemplated to raise extreme poverty level from us 1 90 per person per day to reach us 3 20 required for lower middle income level in the upcoming development planning cycle mere emphasis on annualized projected growth based on volatile service and volatile agriculture sectors will not ensure sustainability at the next level we must not only bridge the income disparity gaps through raising real income level of citizens and maintain it beyond cash subsidy by state who are at the lower margin of economic strata otherwise economic development will be trapped within the confines of a small middle class that dominates nepal s economic landscape and socio economic disparity will continue to widen further lessons must be learned from the experiences of brazil the philippines south africa argentina and india for example where economy is getting trapped within the limits of middle income group this phenomenon is creating unexpected social exclusion of many and contributing to the rise of political populism through nationalism environment and quality of life kathmandu valley has notoriously become one of the most polluted cities in the world and melting himalayan glacier is not going to spare unforeseen disastrous in nepal this is no time for complacency we must urgently find a long term permanent solution to mitigate this the national capital city faces serious health hazards due to air pollution reportedly kills over 30 000 persons annually depleting water table increasing industrial poisoning and soil erosion research reports indicate kathmandu valley lies on alluvial soil structure and highly susceptible to high intensity earthquakes for valley is on the himalayan fault lines it is high time government and planners start contemplating relocation of capital away from the susceptible valley national planning commission should study and explore viable options for reasons of earthquake vulnerability congestion health hazards water shortage growing population over crowding and difficulties in redesigning expensive physical infrastructure and most importantly for better quality of life government can develop separate administrative and political capital city or plan for a new one away from the valley while promoting cities and towns of the valley as national heritage and religious sites as prime tourist destination recently indonesian government decided to relocate waterlogged and flood prone capital city jakarta to a new destination pakistan had also relocated its capital city during 60s away from port city of karachi for security concerns to a beautifully planned islamabad which ranks one of the best living cities in asia likewise brazil had shifted its capital from rio de janeiro to brasilia to mitigate overcrowding congestion and pollution new delhi was also planned to beat old delhi chaos in myanmar new capital city naypitaw was planned away from former capital city yangon for security concerns bangkok was relocated away from the ancient capital of ayutthaya because of border security concerns
while i m not especially old i can t call myself young anymore when i go to the gym it takes me longer to stretch than to work out people my age debate the best vitamin supplements not the best burger joints when i am asked for identification at the market it isn t to confirm i am old enough to buy beer it s to see whether i am eligible for a senior discount signs of aging aren t confined to my personal life we see them everywhere populations in developed nations are collectively getting older a trend that will have a tremendous influence on economic performance in the years ahead politics and policy have tended to dominate economic discussions of late recent swings on both fronts have created uncertainty for the near term outlook by contrast demographics work gradually and subtly with a powerful long term influence demographic change may be the most underappreciated economic issue facing the world today roots of the problem an economy s development is powered by a combination of growth in the labor force and growth in productivity the former is the product of trends in fertility longevity and immigration as an undergraduate i was exposed to the research of the nobel prize winning economist gary becker who analyzed the economics of fertility the rate of child bearing his study of international data across time and place revealed a startling truth richer families have fewer children and poorer families have more the same is broadly true for richer countries and poorer countries this might initially seem counter intuitive as wealthier families can theoretically afford to have more children but children are expensive both explicitly and implicitly the opportunity cost of caring for kids time taken away from work or leisure time can be substantial more so for parents with higher incomes and as with other consumption goods we tend to substitute away from having children as their costs rise i know this sounds heartless but it is a useful way of explaining the data the richer the country the lower its birth rate for families of more modest means the costs of child raising are lower and in many societies children start contributing to the family s income at an early age these conditions favor larger families in societies where children are expected to care for the elderly fertility tends to be lower the capacity for care is fixed and must be split between generations the presence of well developed child care and elder care programs can change the equation japan for example is addressing a severe fertility problem by opening more day care facilities china provides an interesting case study of the effects of economics on fertility interestingly china s birth rate was already falling when the one child policy was implemented in 1979 and declined only slightly after the program began since the policy was relaxed in 2016 fertility in china has barely budged the reason china s increasing standard of living to be sure cultural and religious influences have a bearing on fertility but incentives matter countries have tried to promote higher birth rates through various policy measures exemptions for children in the u s tax code are one example but they rarely have much impact on family size man made and natural disasters can also have an effect on fertility wars and pandemics prompt a replenishment of population happily we have not had a global episode on either front for a long time but when extraordinary events occur they create unevenness in the size of successive generations the baby boom that followed world war ii is a case in point it not only produced a burst in fertility starting in 1946 but an echo of that development a generation later the result was the millennial generation which is discussed as much for its behavior as its size peaks and valleys in the age distribution can create complications for societies when they occur they cause the labor force to wax and wane resulting in periodic imbalances between those working and those retired we re seeing the consequences of both of these phenomena at the moment life goes on while fertility measures the rate of childbirth longevity focuses on how long those children can expect to live in most parts of the world longevity has been on a persistent upswing thanks to advances in nutrition and health care since 1960 life expectancy for americans at age 65 has risen from 77 to 83 measures of the quality of life at advanced ages have also improved this should in theory improve the resilience of the labor force however official retirement ages have not kept pace with life expectancy and there is still a strong tendency to transition away from full time employment when benefit payments become available the more generous these payments the more likely it is that workers will retire with the postwar generation crossing retirement age in substantial numbers each year sustaining growth in the labor force becomes more challenging this also creates an immense problem for retirement systems which we discuss later in many places immigration has become a four letter word immigration can help fill in demographic gaps and has done so successfully throughout history countries more open to immigration have better labor force growth immigrant communities in many countries also have high rates of entrepreneurship and innovation which can abet economic potential but in many places immigration has become a four letter word uncontrolled migration in several regions has raised anxiety and contributed to an advancing wave of nationalism negative rhetoric surrounding immigration has spread quickly obscuring the more positive aspects of welcoming non natives immigration is an exceptionally complicated issue with dimensions far beyond economics but without sufficient immigration the demographic challenges faced by many countries will prove more difficult to manage bridging the divide technology provides two main avenues to circumvent the limitations of aging labor forces the first is tapping into labor supply beyond borders a dearth of workers in one country might lead to the work shifting to another of course some occupations require proximity between customer and provider but an expanding range of activities can be done from almost anywhere but logistics and politics could limit offshoring countries receiving business will need sufficient physical and human capital to handle it educational attainment including language skills and infrastructure in developing countries is often uneven and the optics of shifting jobs from domestic to foreign workers could certainly arouse concern among nationalists the mismatch of population and capital is a central theme to watch in the years ahead nearly all of the next generation s global population growth is projected to come from emerging markets which are considerably younger and a significant fraction of this growth will occur in countries considered dangerous by the united nations demographic imbalances could cause more mass migration in the years ahead youth can be an asset if it has the opportunity to achieve but a lack of opportunity can lead to political instability and the kind of mass migration that has been so challenging over the past several years the fact that the mediterranean sea separates some of the youngest and poorest countries from some of the oldest and richest will provide a continuous challenge for border control in europe the same may be true for the frontier separating mexico and the united states the second way in which technology can compensate for aging is in the development of robotics and artificial intelligence investment in these areas is accelerating and the resulting boost in productivity may compensate for slower labor force growth androids serving as nurses to the elderly are a poignant example of this theme but while the advance of machines might serve those who are retired they will also threaten those still working the path to an automated future will be a bumpy one consequences the implications of aging populations are far ranging as we discussed last december the world is poorly prepared for retirement individuals and the systems that serve them have been guilty of collective myopia which will make the golden years much less golden behavioral economists have demonstrated that human beings struggle with complex problems especially when the consequences are far off into the future determining how much to save how to invest and how to manage resources after retirement are difficult tasks for most people pension systems whether public or private take these weighty matters off of peoples hands and vest them in administrators who in theory have the background to address them successfully but the rise in longevity creates a challenge for retirement planning participants and systems have had to adapt to retirement horizons of twenty years or longer which require substantially higher levels of saving and asset accumulation and as corporations and governments seek to shed the risk and responsibility that comes with administering retirement plans pensions have been in decline in many parts of the world in some cases this has been done intelligently the australian superannuation program is one example in others individuals have been left adrift defined contribution plans which shift responsibility for the plan s funding and performance to the individual have become much more common used well they can be successful but not everyone has access to such plans and some who do choose not to participate and still others fail to save sufficiently or make good investment choices problems with retirement systems are broad and deep government provided retirement programs take a range of different forms but without sufficient distance between these systems and the broader government ledger bad outcomes can emerge a legislature struggling to balance its budget or pursue other fiscal objectives may defer contributions to the retirement system placing it in an underfunded position when benefits become due in the united states illinois is an acute case of this but systems in other parts of the world have a similar affliction addressing shortfalls will require new taxes reductions in benefits or diversion of funds intended for other uses none of these will be favorable for economic growth data show a shocking fraction of citizens will be heavily reliant on government benefits in retirement which will make reform even more challenging it doesn t help that the historically low levels of interest rates are limiting returns to retirement plan assets the fraction of government debt carrying negative yields recently set a multi year high some administrators have increased the riskiness of their investments in an attempt to close gaps but that could prove costly the approach and arrival of retirement has other important economic effects workers nearing retirement age are much less likely to change jobs reducing the dynamism of the labor force workers who pass retirement age typically become thrifty to avoid outliving their savings and the elderly use more government provided health care increasing the burden on sovereign finances older populations living on fixed incomes are more sensitive to tax increases and they vote in far higher concentrations than younger cohorts this will make fiscal policy debate more difficult at a time when government indebtedness is rising rapidly at a local level the elderly are less likely to support investments in education their children having long since graduated hindering efforts to enhance human capital formation people are working longer but there are limits to this trend one clear solution to all of this would be for workers to remain in the labor force longer and in fact a trend in this direction has been underway for some time as people are healthier at advanced ages and more commonly work with their minds than their backs longer careers are within reach this development could be extended with a stick raising retirement ages or a carrot offering incentives to remain in place but studies are showing that productivity declines with the age of workers who become progressively less able or willing to adapt to new technology it takes me six months to get used to all of the features on a new mobile device employers may therefore not encourage baby boomers to stick around and some countries offer generous retirement benefits which can be alluring demographic transition in developed countries could also have implications for asset markets in the united states baby boomers aspired to be suburban homeowners the generations that followed them preferred to rent in urban settings some of this is the product of financial considerations the financial crisis and student debt caused young people to view homeownership differently than their parents this will leave a geographic mismatch between supply and demand that has implications for commercial real estate especially for retail as well academic work on the potential impact of aging on equity prices has been mixed in theory more sellers baby boomers than buyers generation x would depress prices all else equal but studies examining this impact have not found a strong causal link conclusions in one sense the population problem in developed markets is temporary in the united states the millennial generation is already larger than that of the baby boom and projections suggest labor force growth will begin increasing again within the next ten years the ratio of those working to those retired should eventually begin to recover to the benefit of pension and health systems but in the meantime slow labor force growth will limit economic growth during this interim the global mismatch of old and young has the potential to sustain nationalist spirits that are also hesitant about trade deprived an avenue to prosperity young people in emerging markets will be restless making the world a less secure place the support for international coordination will be waning just as it is needed the most once you fall behind the aging curve it is very hard to catch up the march of demographics may be slow but it is sure and while the consequences of aging may seem far off into the future they will be substantial unless we address them now they will become much less manageable later and now if you will excuse me it is time for my vitamins
david hisco deserves credit for his housing market stand photo file comment it is hard to have much sympathy for david hisco in the circumstances of his departure from the anz bank but he deserves credit for at least one notable contribution to new zealand s wellbeing today it could be said that if anyone did their bit to stop new zealand s runaway house price inflation a few years ago it was david hisco he did it with a contributed opinion published in this very newspaper on july 20 2016 it began auckland house prices and the new zealand dollar are overcooked having been in banking since 1980 i have seen this movie before the ending is pretty much the same sometimes a little plot twist but usually messy the piece went to discuss the already obvious risks facing borrowers and repeat the often made point that property prices can go down as well as up but in the course of that familiar script he dropped two announcements i doubt banks can keep lending at the current large volumes he wrote and a little further down the current situation will see anz implement even tougher criteria for investment loans as house price inflation spreads from auckland to other regions in the middle of 2016 this was a bombshell the housing market had been booming since a brief lull after the global financial crisis and still there seemed no end to it the treasury reserve bank governors economists and financial commentators had been issuing the same warnings for years the reserve bank had introduced loan to value limits the previous year and the national government had set a bright line test for liability for capital gains tax on investment property anz boss worked to turn tide on property prices photo ted baghurst these came into force in october and november 2015 but by march the market had absorbed them and real estate was roaring again prices kept rising by the month and scarcely a day passed when newspapers did not report more stunning records for house sales in auckland then the hisco piece appeared it took a day or two to sink in that the chief executive of the country s largest trading bank had just declared it was pulling back on mortgage lending the decision to do so publicly would not have been hisco s alone but as chief executive he carried the risk that the bank might be handing business to its competitors it was soon evident the competitors agreed with him by the end of 2016 finance was becoming harder to find and virtually impossible for apartment developments auckland house prices barely moved in the last quarter of that year and have been steady without falling very much for the past three years the big four trading banks are as important as the reserve bank to the stability of the financial system the central bank keeps in close touch with them and the trading banks can correct monetary policy misjudgments they sometimes for example do not pass on official cash rate cuts that are out of line with the interest rates trading banks have to pay for their international borrowing economic stability depends on the two banking tiers working in unison it worries me that over the past year the reserve bank has been at odds with the trading banks and the anz in particular on their capital requirements ever since the 2008 global crisis central banks worldwide have been discussing how to ensure trading banks do not repeat the poorly secured mortgage lending that led to the crisis that discussion is rather less urgent in australia and new zealand because our australian owned banks bless them had been wary of the debt instruments that proved disastrous in the united states and europe nevertheless the rbnz has taken it upon itself to propose that trading banks here be required to hold higher reserves as a ratio of their lending than the banks australian directors think necessary or good for investment in the new zealand economy the reserve bank even censured the anz for a breach of its existing capital rules last month i don t pretend to understand how trading banks know how much they can safely lend at multiples of the deposits they hold but they are in a better position than the reserve bank to make commercial judgments none of this has anything to do with hisco s departure according to the chairman of anz in new zealand sir john key he said hisco has been let go over the accounting of expenses hisco thought he was entitled to claim clearly hisco has fallen foul of a crackdown on fringe benefits by the parent bank in australia where banking has had a media mauling in recent years his perks may have been outrageous but he did well to help turn the tide on house prices business leaders seldom speak out for the public good let s give him that
a strategy to re anchor inflation expectations neel kashkari follow 13 min read jun 21 2019 1 listen share in the federal open market committee meeting that concluded on wednesday of this week i advocated for a 50 basis point rate cut to 1 75 percent to 2 00 percent and a commitment not to raise rates again until core inflation reaches our 2 percent target on a sustained basis i believe an aggressive policy action such as this is required to re anchor inflation expectations at our target since i became president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis in january 2016 i have advocated against interest rate increases because i did not see sufficient evidence that inflationary pressures were building and i believed there was still slack in the labor market these views led me to formally dissent against rate increases in march june and december 2017 more recently i supported the committee s decision in january 2019 to pause further rate increases in the past few months the job market has slowed wage growth has flattened inflation has continued to come in below our 2 percent target inflation expectations have fallen and the yield curve has inverted minneapolis fed economists estimate that long run inflation expectations are currently around 1 7 percent while that may seem like a small miss from our 2 percent target it means we will have less ammunition to respond to a future downturn because real interest rates net of inflation drive economic activity long run inflation expectations are a reflection of the reaction function the fomc has taught the markets over a number years i have argued that since formally adopting its 2 percent target in 2012 the committee has treated it like a ceiling rather than a symmetric target such treatment is consistent with long run inflation expectations of 1 7 percent rather than 2 percent with inflation expectations falling further in recent months i believe the committee should now take action to re anchor expectations at 2 percent to do so we will need to teach the markets a new reaction function that credibly treats 2 percent as a symmetric target given that it has taken years for the markets to learn our current reaction function i don t believe a rate cut or two in isolation will do much to boost inflation expectations that is why i argued we should also commit to not raising rates from the new lower level until we see core inflation sustainably reach our target the committee has consistently been too optimistic in forecasting inflation returning to 2 percent core inflation is the best predictor we have of future headline inflation my proposed strategy keeps rates on hold for as long as necessary until we actually hit our target i believe such a strong credible commitment will boost inflation expectations while not allowing them to drift too high if economic conditions weaken or if inflation fails to return to target this strategy does not preclude further rate reductions this strategy will also support further job growth stronger wage growth and continued economic expansion in february 2017 i first published the data and analyses i focus on in reaching my monetary policy recommendations for those interested in a deeper look at my rationale for advocating for a rate cut at this week s meeting i have updated the same framework to show how the data have changed in the past two and a half years and how my interpretation of those data has led me to make this policy recommendation my analysis an update to the framework first published in february 2017 let me acknowledge up front that the analysis that follows is somewhat detailed and complex yet it is still not comprehensive fomc participants look at a wider range of data than i detail here i am focusing only on the data that i find most important to determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy as i have done previously let me begin my analysis by assessing our progress in meeting the dual mandate congress has given us price stability and maximum employment price stability the fomc has defined its price stability mandate as inflation of 2 percent using the personal consumption expenditures pce measurement importantly we have said that 2 percent is a target not a ceiling so if we are under or over 2 percent it should be of equal concern we look at where inflation is heading not just where it has been core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices is one of the best predictors we have of future headline inflation our ultimate goal for that reason i pay attention to the current readings of core inflation chart 1 shows both headline and core inflation since 2010 one clearly sees that core inflation has repeatedly approached our 2 percent target only to fall back down currently core inflation is at 1 6 percent year over year and headline is at 1 5 percent having fallen over the past six months it is certainly possible that temporary factors are holding inflation down but we ve been saying that for years looking at this chart it is not surprising that long run inflation expectations are below 2 percent since we appear to never allow core inflation to climb above 2 percent a point i expand on below next let s formally look at inflation expectations or where consumers and investors think inflation is likely headed chart 2 inflation expectations are important drivers of future inflation so it is critical that they remain anchored at our 2 percent target survey measures of long term inflation expectations are flat or trending downward note that the michigan survey the black line is consistently elevated relative to our 2 percent target what is important is the trend rather than the absolute level the michigan survey has found inflation expectations trending downward over the past few years and they recently hit their lowest ever reading in contrast professional forecasters seem to remain confident that inflation will average 2 percent market based measures of long term inflation expectations jumped a bit immediately after the 2016 presidential election since then the markets inflation forecasts have moved up and then turned around and have now moved back down as chart 3 indicates market based expectations remain at the low end of their historical range and have fallen notably in recent months but perhaps inflationary pressures are building that we aren t yet seeing in the data i look at wages and costs of labor as potentially early warning signs of inflation around the corner if employers have to pay more to retain or hire workers eventually they will have to pass those costs on to their customers ultimately those costs must show up as inflation but we aren t seeing strong upward movement in these data the orange line in chart 4 is the employment cost index a measure of compensation that includes benefits and is adjusted for employment shifts among occupations and industries the blue line is the average hourly earnings for all employees both lines have moved up in recent years and are roughly flat over the past year importantly productivity growth has also climbed in recent years so these higher wage growth levels net of productivity still do not signal high future inflation in short while the cost of labor is climbing slowly it isn t showing signs of building inflationary pressures that are ready to take off and push inflation above the fed s target now let s look around the world most major advanced economies have been suffering from low inflation since the global financial crisis it seems unlikely that the united states will experience a surge of inflation while the rest of the developed world suffers from low inflation as you can see in chart 5 with the exception of the uk which has experienced high inflation due to currency depreciation resulting from brexit uncertainty core inflation rates in advanced economies continue to come in below their targets despite aggressive monetary policy strategies both japan and the euro area have struggled to achieve their inflation targets in summary inflation has moved further below our target and market based measures of inflation expectations remain at low levels and are still falling some argue that the decline in inflation this year is transitory but we don t know that for certain and the longer it persists the more tenuous the transitory factors story becomes maximum employment next let s look at our maximum employment mandate chart 6 one of the big questions i continue to wrestle with is whether the labor market has fully recovered or if there is still some slack in it over the past few years some people repeatedly declared that we had reached maximum employment and that no further gains were possible without triggering higher inflation and repeatedly the labor market proved otherwise the headline unemployment rate has fallen from a peak of 10 percent to 3 6 percent below its precrisis level we also look at a broader measure of unemployment what we call the u 6 measure which includes people who have given up looking for a job or are involuntarily stuck in a part time job the u 6 measure peaked at 17 1 percent in 2010 and has fallen to 7 1 percent today also below its precrisis level but these measures still leave out a large number of people who might prefer to work if better job opportunities were available to them the employment to population ratio and the labor force participation rate capture the percentage of adults working or actively looking for work we know these are trending downward over time due to the aging of our society as more people retire a smaller share of adults are in the labor force to adjust for those trends i prefer to look at these measures by focusing on prime working age adults chart 7 shows that with the strong job gains in recent years and the decline in unemployment rates the labor market appears to have recovered to its precrisis strength but going back further there still may be room for improvement it is important to note that job growth has slowed in recent months from an average of 223 000 jobs per month in 2018 to 164 000 per month so far in 2019 while that job growth still exceeds the roughly 100 000 per month needed to keep up with population growth wage growth also appears to have leveled off if we were reaching maximum employment i would have expected job growth to slow and wage growth to pick up as firms competed for scarce workers the fact that job growth and wage growth are both slowing suggests weakening economic growth rather than an economy running out of workers the bottom line is that the job market has improved substantially and we are getting closer to maximum employment but we likely aren t there yet in 2012 the midpoint estimate among fomc participants for the long term unemployment rate was 5 6 percent the fomc s best estimate for maximum employment we now know that was too conservative many more americans wanted to work than we had expected if the fomc had declared victory when we reached 5 6 percent unemployment millions of additional workers would have been left on the sidelines given that we simply don t know how many more people will choose to work if wages pick up further how will i know if we are at maximum employment when i see wage growth net of productivity of at least 2 percent that will at least indicate the possibility that we are at maximum employment that threshold nonetheless ignores the potential for labor s share of national income to increase which would allow wage growth to increase further without triggering higher inflation we should be open to that possibility we also know that the aggregate national averages don t highlight the serious challenges individual communities are experiencing for example while the headline unemployment rate today for all americans is 3 6 percent it is still 6 2 percent for african americans and 4 2 percent for hispanics the broader u 6 measure mentioned above is roughly double the headline rate for each group current rate environment ok so we are still coming up short on our inflation mandate and while we are closer to reaching maximum employment we likely aren t there yet let s have a look at where we are now is current monetary policy accommodative neutral or tight i look at a variety of measures including simple rules such as the taylor rule to determine whether we are accommodative or not there are many versions of such rules and none are perfect one concept i find useful although it requires a lot of judgment is the notion of a neutral real interest rate sometimes referred to as r which is the rate that neither stimulates nor restrains the economy many economists believe the neutral rate is not static but rises and falls over time as a result of broader macroeconomic forces such as population growth demographics technology development and trade there are a range of estimates for the current neutral real rate having looked at them i have argued in recent years that the neutral rate is in the range of zero to 50 basis points with the federal funds rate at 2 25 to 2 50 percent and inflation at around 1 5 percent that implies that the current real federal funds rate is between 0 75 percent and 1 0 percent which is restrictive relative to these estimates of neutral if inflation were running at our 2 percent target policy would then be in the range of neutral these estimates are highly uncertain it seems likely that policy is somewhere between neutral and moderately restrictive given the lack of inflation pressures and potential remaining slack in the labor market i want to make sure policy is not restrictive and i believe we should err on the side of providing accommodation this supports my policy recommendation to cut rates financial stability concerns please see my essay on how i think about monetary policy and financial stability in short while some asset prices appear elevated i don t see a correction as being likely to trigger financial instability investors would face losses from a stock market correction but it s not the fed s job to protect investors from losses our jobs are to achieve our dual mandate and to promote financial stability global environment the global economy appears to be slowing with weak growth in canada output declining in mexico slowing activity in china and the european central bank considering additional stimulus in addition trade tensions have added to global uncertainty flattening yield curve the yield curve has flattened dramatically in recent years and has actually inverted in recent months an inverted yield curve where short rates are above long rates is one of the best signals we have of elevated recession risk and has preceded every single recession in the past 50 years i believe the fomc s rate increases in recent years have directly affected the yield curve as the fomc has raised rates the front end of the curve has moved up with our policy moves which is to be expected but because the committee raised rates in a low inflation environment we were sending a hawkish signal which was also likely holding down the long end of the curve by depressing inflation expectations it is important to note that even after the committee announced its pause of further rate increases in january of this year long rates continued to come down further inverting the curve those more recent moves were likely driven by the markets expecting a lower r slower economic growth or lower long term inflation all of these potential signals suggest that monetary policy may be too restrictive policy tools the fomc s plan to shrink its balance sheet was well telegraphed in advance of implementation and is proceeding on schedule due to end in september of this year i don t think the remaining roll off over the next few months is having much effect on the overall stance of policy i am agnostic as to whether to end the roll off earlier than september what might be wrong what if low inflation really is transitory and surprises us to the upside in a few months time in my view that will be a high class problem if core inflation crosses 2 percent on a sustained basis my policy proposal allows the committee to then raise rates at that point a much more worrying risk is that the slowing job growth and inverted yield curve are signaling further economic weakness and further declines in inflation expectations in my view the cost of cutting rates early is much smaller than the cost of cutting too late if we wait until we are sure the economy is slowing and inflation expectations fall further it will be much harder for us to reverse those concerning developments and sustain the economic expansion conclusion over the past few months the job market has slowed wage growth has flattened inflation has continued to come in below our 2 percent target inflation expectations have fallen and the yield curve has inverted i believe the fomc should take strong action to re anchor inflation expectations at our 2 percent target and support strong job growth higher wage growth and sustained economic expansion the best way i can think of to do that is for the committee to cut rates by 50 basis points and then commit to not raising rates until core inflation returns to our target on a sustained basis
in a democratic house at war with the trump administration one official has managed to forge warm ties across the aisle u s trade representative robert lighthizer lighthizer has fostered a strong relationship with the house lawmakers who will decide the fate of president trump s signature achievement on trade the united states canada mexico agreement usmca the deal faces deep opposition from house democrats in its current form and a short timeline for passage with the 2020 election nearing but democrats have praised lighthizer for his transparency and candor amid tense negotiations even as they battle trump on multiple fronts mosads he s very forthcoming and he s very good on the politics he s accessible he s loquacious said rep brian higgins d n y a member of the house ways and means committee which oversees trade he can give you an answer that you re not necessarily mad about because he appears to be forthright and honest he added calling lighthizer user friendly for trump passage of the usmca an update to the north american free trade agreement nafta is a central legislative goal trump has sparked trade wars with partners such as the european union and adversaries such as china but critics say he has little to show for it speaker nancy pelosi d calif will have the final say over whether and when legislation codifying the agreement will be put to a vote pelosi has complained that the deal needs better enforcement measures needs stronger environmental and labor protections and provisions on pharmaceuticals but despite her issues with the deal and the tough negotiations with the administration pelosi has praised lighthizer for regularly meeting with democrats and working to address their concerns i believe that the trade representative has been most accommodating and available for members she said in february we ve had good rapport with mr lighthizer she added lighthizer returned the praise at a hearing tuesday the speaker has been completely fair and above board and i think constructive in the way she s done it he said in response to a question from sen john cornyn r texas about pelosi s handling of the deal lighthizer added that pelosi has been exactly as you hope she would be lighthizer is one of the few trump administration officials to receive broad bipartisan support a former trade attorney reagan administration trade official and republican senate aide lighthizer was confirmed by the senate in 2017 with a 82 17 vote his rapport with pelosi is a stark contrast from the pressure campaign waged by trump who has threatened to pull out of nafta if his replacement deal is not ratified the president and his congressional allies have grown frustrated with the lengthy negotiations and have urged pelosi to put usmca up for a vote without delay trump in may ordered lighthizer to start the clock on a fast track process needed to pass usmca before congress leave for its summer recess the move doesn t force pelosi s hand but was a clear message from trump to speed up talks over the trade deal pelosi responded in a statement that she was disappointed in trump for pre empting her negotiations with lighthizer while democrats have been on a path to yes some veteran democratic lawmakers have even compared lighthizer favorably against former president obama trade chief michael froman who negotiated the defunct trans pacific partnership tpp it s such a contrast with froman who i found to be really impossible to work with and very great amount of duplicity said rep lloyd doggett d texas another ways and means member doggett said froman in comparison to lighthizer was less forthcoming not answering questions directly or not answering them at all he cited a case involving illegal peruvian logging in which he said froman refused to take action doggett said that lighthizer despite working for a president for whom i have nothing but disdain responded and backed the peruvians down the obama administration did trigger an audit provision on peruvian logging and seize a shipment of logs following the investigation other members of the democratic caucus who spoke to the hill gave froman high praise some republicans like house ways and means ranking member rep kevin brady texas are bullish on lighthizer s chances of getting the deal through the house brady said he is optimistic lighthizer can bring democrats around on what he called a dream trade agreement for pelosi s party ambassador lighthizer has asked for the time and space to have these conversations brady said i think we ought to give him that time and we as republicans want to help how we can but even with the warm relationships lighthizer has fostered on capitol hill democrats remain wary of the new trade deal rep earl blumenauer d ore who heads up the ways and means trade subcommittee said this week that the deal was unlikely to advance this summer james lucier managing partner at political research firm capital alpha partners said lighthizer will have little sway over the house progressives least likely to support the deal he can talk intelligibly about hard hat jobs to old guys like richie neal and steny hoyer but they don t control or represent the party any more lucier said in an email the progressives are driving the train rep bill pascrell d n j a senior ways and means member expressed concerns that some democrats may fold under pressure to pass the agreement when people say we re looking for yes some really mean it and they ll settle for nothing less pascrell said that s what i m a little skeptical about and higgins said he is nervous that more strident white house voices could taint the talks i suspect the real influence is the white house and peter navarro he said referring to trump s hawkish trade advisor the pressure on lighthizer is certain to increase as the clock ticks down doggett said that if trump does overcome the daunting odds and sees his the trade deal get through the democratic house he will have lighthizer to thank given his boss i don t want to praise him so much it costs him his job he joked

parts suppliers usmca also requires nearly half of all car parts to be made by workers earning at least 16 an hour that provision would ensure american manufacturing workers earn strong wages this deal has the strongest labor provisions of any u s trade agreement in history it requires all three countries to protect labor rights recognized by the international labor organization it also makes

xi jinping might possibly agree next weekend on further steps to bring down china s trade imbalance with the us giving donald trump a face saving way of ending his trade war but xi won t agree to change china s economic system why should he the american economic system is focused on maximizing shareholder returns and it s achieving that goal on friday the s p 500 notched a new all time high but average americans have seen no significant gains in their incomes for four decades adjusted for inflation china s economic system by contrast is focused on maximizing china and it s achieving that goal forty years ago china was still backward and agrarian today it s the world s second largest economy home to the world s biggest auto industry and some of the world s most powerful technology companies over the last four decades hundreds of millions of chinese people have been lifted out of poverty these giant corporations have no particular allegiance to america their only responsibility is to their shareholders the two systems are fundamentally different at the core of the american system are 500 giant companies headquartered in the us but making buying and selling things all over the world half of their employees are non american located outside the us a third of their shareholders are non american these giant corporations have no particular allegiance to america their only allegiance and responsibility is to their shareholders they ll do whatever is necessary to get their share prices as high as possible including keeping wages down fighting unions reclassifying employees as independent contractors outsourcing anywhere around world where parts are cheapest shifting their profits around the world wherever taxes are lowest and paying their top ceos ludicrous sums at the core of china s economy by contrast are state owned companies that borrow from state banks at artificially low rates these state firms balance the ups and downs of the economy spending more when private companies are reluctant to do so they re also engines of economic growth making the capital intensive investments china needs to prosper including investments in leading edge technologies china s core planners and state owned companies will do whatever is necessary both to improve the wellbeing of the chinese people and become the world s largest and most powerful economy since 1978 the chinese economy has grown by an average of more than 9 per year growth has slowed recently and american tariffs could bring it down to 6 or 7 but that s still faster than almost any other economy in the world including the us the american system relies on taxes subsidies and regulations to coax corporations to act in the interest of the american public but these levers have proven weak relative to the overriding corporate goal of maximizing shareholder returns last week for example walmart american s largest employer announced it would lay off 570 employees despite taking home more than 2bn courtesy of trump and the republican corporate tax cuts last year the company closed dozens of sam s club stores leaving thousands of americans out of work at the same time walmart has plowed more than 20bn into buying back shares of its own stock which boosts the pay of walmart executives and enriches wealthy investors but does nothing for the economy it should be noted that walmart is a global company not adverse to bribing foreign officials to get its way on thursday it agreed to pay 282m to settle federal allegations of overseas corruption including channeling more than 500 000 to an intermediary in brazil known as a sorceress for her ability to make construction permit problems disappear across the american economy the trump tax cut did squat for jobs and wages but did nicely for corporate executives and big investors instead of reinvesting the savings into their businesses the international monetary fund reports that companies used it to buy back stock but wait america is a democracy and china is a dictatorship right true but most americans have little or no influence on public policy which is why the trump tax cut did so little for them that s the conclusion of professors martin gilens of princeton and benjamin page of northwestern who analyzed 1 799 policy issues before congress and found that the preferences of the average american appear to have only a minuscule near zero statistically non significant impact upon public policy instead american lawmakers respond to the demands of wealthy individuals typically corporate executives and wall street moguls and of big corporations those with the most lobbying prowess and deepest pockets to bankroll campaigns don t blame american corporations they re in business to make profits and maximize their share prices not to serve america but because of their dominance in american politics and their commitment to share prices instead of the wellbeing of americans it s folly to count on them to create good american jobs or improve american competitiveness i m not suggesting we emulate the chinese economic system i am suggesting that we not be smug about the american economic system instead of trying to get china to change we should lessen the dominance of big american corporations over american policy china isn t the reason half of america hasn t had a raise in four decades the simple fact is americans cannot thrive within a system run largely by big american corporations organized to boost their share prices but not boost americans

caught between muted inflation and the prospect of a trade war the federal reserve has a fine line to walk at its meeting next week wall street is growing more certain that the central bank will implement one if not more interest rate cuts this year the consumer price index ticked up just 0 1 percent in may following a 0 3 percent increase the previous month in addition to wednesday s inflation measures the department of labor said thursday that import prices for may fell by 0 3 percent a steeper drop than expected this weaker than expected inflation data gives the fed a more compelling case for a rate cut adding to the growing amount of data that indicates a softening economy this adds to the narrative that the fed is likely to begin cutting rates later this year against the backdrop of slowing economic growth said emily roland head of capital markets research at john hancock investment management the reason the cpi data matters is it reinforces in the fed s mind what s been a troubling trend of slowing inflation that s less than their target said joseph lavorgna managing director and chief economist of the americas at natixis if the fed does pivot toward a more dovish stance as many expect more accommodative monetary policy will be driven by a combination of economic metrics signaling slower growth and worry about the destabilizing effect of a potential trade war with china the median dot plot from the march meeting showed one rate hike for next year but the bond market is now pricing in three rate cuts roland said for an institution that prizes stability and balance this turnaround has come at a surprising pace it s been a remarkable shift in the posture of the fed in just the past few weeks said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america the numbers came in a little bit lighter than expected which means the fed does have some more room to consider a cut said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network but that move would be unlikely to come right away the fed has always said they are data dependent and the current data suggests they shouldn t do anything mcmillan said my guess is they ll hold off a little bit longer to get some clarity on maybe how the next payroll numbers are showing up gdp revisions maybe some progress on g 20 with trade lavorgna said the fed has a lot of reasons to cut rates it s not just the trade issues among economists though there is a growing expectation that the language used by fed chairman jerome powell will indicate that the prospect of a rate cut in july is on the table wall street always parses the minutiae of fed remarks but reading tea leaves this time around is a particularly high stakes activity at this point the fed is in a sit tight posture they re waiting to see what happens i m going to be looking for any sign that they re shifting from watchful waiting to we have to act mcmillan said they re very aware of what could go wrong the biggest unknown is the outcome of a potential china trade deal if the white house and beijing fail to meet at the g 20 summit later this month and forge a deal that will avert tariffs being levied on the entirety of chinese goods entering the u s the case for faster monetary easing grows stronger it all boils down to whether the fed is really concerned about the economic danger of the trade war mcmillan said the fed s other challenge is one of optics economists say president donald trump has frequently criticized his appointee to lead the central bank and called for lower interest rates the appearance that the central bank is acting on trump s bidding would hurt the fed s reputation and would be likely to spook investors if they continue to ease and it looks like they re doing it at the president s direction that does considerable damage to market confidence mcmillan said i actually do think that s part of the decision north said but we re also looking at weak data he said if indications of a slowdown continue to accumulate in prices consumption and job growth metrics it increases the likelihood that trump will eventually get his rate cut especially if the trade standoff is not resolved it appears that there is pressure to have a powell put on the economy north said but the fundamentals justify it as well it s not just what trump is saying
originally posted to the jcpa website the manama economic workshop as part of the first stages of the long anticipated u s peace plan the u s administration and bahrain announced that they would host an economic workshop entitled peace to prosperity in the bahraini capital of manama on june 25 and 26 2019 advertisement as stated in a joint statement by the united states and bahrain on may 19 2019 this workshop is a pivotal opportunity to convene government civil society and business leaders to share ideas discuss strategies and galvanize support for potential economic investments and initiatives that could be made possible by a peace agreement peace to prosperity will facilitate discussions on an ambitious achievable vision and framework for a prosperous future for the palestinian people and the region including enhancements to economic governance development of human capital and facilitation of rapid private sector growth if implemented this vision has the potential to radically transform lives and put the region on a path toward a brighter future 2 the workshop as summarized by globes on may 20 2019 is aimed at recruiting businesspeople entrepreneurs and people from civil society for large investments in the middle east with an emphasis on the west bank and the gaza strip with the cooperation and a flow of investments also to jordan egypt and lebanon with the participation of the persian gulf states would deal with economics and development according to the needs of the palestinians would support progress in the entire region and would provide a platform for exchanging ideas and a strategic dialogue in order to encourage investments and economic initiatives likely to lead to the achievement of a regional peace 3 bahraini foreign minister khalid bin ahmed al khalifa stressed that the meeting serves no other purpose than to help the palestinian people through developing their abilities and enhancing their resources 4 the need for such an initiative is logical and clear the initiative comes against the background of the extremely sad economic plight of the two respective palestinian populations in the west bank areas of judea and samaria governed by the palestinian authority and in the gaza strip governed by the hamas terror organization misgovernment mismanagement of resources poverty and waste and rampant corruption among the palestinian leadership and governing elements cannot help a population in dire need of economic and social stability and prosperity these elements do not encourage support for any peace process with neighboring israel channeling monies into building and maintaining terrorist infrastructures and conducting negative and destructive political campaigning are an integral part of the palestinian mismanagement of their economy extensive incitement and political campaigning throughout the world directed against israel rather than investing in essential public services all undermine the welfare and prosperity of the palestinian public the illogical and misguided palestinian insistence on paying significant portions of their budget as salaries to incarcerated terrorists and their families as a sign of their institutional support glorification and encouragement of terror is the antithesis of any concept of prudent economic governance but more notably it is also a serious violation of accepted international norms encapsulated in counter terror conventions prohibiting the transfer of finances to terrorists and for use by terror organizations as well as un resolutions and declarations calling upon states to refrain from financing terror activities 5 the stubborn refusal of the palestinian authority to accept monies to which they are entitled under the oslo accords earmarked for paying salaries to officials of the palestinian administration and for the maintenance of everyday public life and basic services but minus the terrorist subsidies only enhances the territories financial plight and deprives the palestinian public of essential resources palestinian rejection and boycott given the deficient economic situation of the palestinians logic would dictate a positive and co operative attitude to any plan aimed at improving their economic stability and prosperity logic would similarly expect that any responsible palestinian leadership and concerned public would welcome with open arms a serious initiative aimed at developing their abilities enhancing their resources and encouraging investments and economic initiatives this especially since the peace to prosperity workshop is launched without prejudice to any ensuing political negotiation process with israel however the palestinian leadership has nevertheless chosen to boycott the manama workshop officially and to attempt to undermine it actively saeb erekat the senior plo official ostensibly heading the palestinian negotiation affairs department has in clear contrast to the title and aims of his department become the chief demagogue and inciter amongst the palestinian leadership in rejecting the manama meeting in his official statement coming two days after the u s bahrain announcement he called in the name of the palestinian president mahmoud abbas and the plo executive committee to all palestinian political movements and factions national figures private sector and civil society not to attend the manama meeting 6 in an attempt to politicize what is intended to be a non political and purely economic event he went on to claim we did not mandate anyone to negotiate on our behalf those concerned and want to serve the interest of the palestinian people should respect this collective position palestine s full economic potential can only be achieved by ending the israeli occupation respecting international law and un resolutions in a similar vein and as part of a propaganda effort to politicize the purpose of the meeting and to dissuade arab governments from participating another official palestinian spokesman stated the palestinian government deeply regrets the declaration of cairo and amman about participating in the workshop and call on them and all brotherly and friendly countries to withdraw from participating in the workshop under the cover of this participation the united states is trying to create solutions outside the realm of international legitimacy that detract from the legitimate national rights of the palestinian people in an article published in haaretz we palestinians say to trump no to bahrain bribes and never ending occupation former senior palestinian official and negotiator nabil sha ath continued the attempt to politicize the meeting and to curiously and irrelevantly bring international law into the issue for the trump team the manama meeting represents a strategic stage in their efforts to undermine both international law and the inalienable rights of the palestinian people but they are also dedicated to dismembering the arab peace initiative and to pivot away from palestinians achieving their rights of freedom and self determination to discussing palestinians economic prosperity under israeli rule the manama meeting is one phase in a larger effort to undermine palestinian rights and normalize israeli violations while promoting arab israeli normalization these have been at the core of the u s administration s efforts it is precisely because we believe in a just and lasting peace for our region that we say no to the manama meeting only a political solution that ends the israeli occupation and fulfills the rights of the palestinian people in accordance with international law can promote sustainable economic prosperity there can be no prosperity without freedom 7 palestinian american historian and columbia university professor rashid khalidi in an article entitled the neocolonial arrogance of the kushner plan 8 curiously attempted to dramatize the manama workshop and present it as an exercise intended to pave the way to a normalization of never ending occupation and creeping annexation under conditions of extreme legal discrimination between israeli jews and palestinian arabs a situation resembling nothing so much as apartheid south africa similarly palestinian private sector associations and federations including the palestinian federation of business associations palestinian federation of industries business women forum palestine palestine trade center paltrade federation of palestinian chambers of commerce industry and agriculture and the palestinian american chamber of commerce have expressed their rejection of the invitation to attend the u s brokered economic workshop 9 this situation raises several questions regarding capacity capability and willingness of the palestinian leadership to live up to its responsibilities to its own public to act for their welfare and economic prosperity as well as to its responsibilities under its international obligations palestinian international responsibilities and commitments there is no doubt as to the political responsibilities of the palestinians to negotiate peace thus one may well ask whether their negative and obstructive position regarding the manama workshop and their concerted attempt to politicize what is intended to be a non political meeting is not in effect a serious violation of their international responsibilities and obligations the palestinian leadership took upon themselves such obligations when accepting the reins of governance and the representation of the palestinian people under the oslo accords such responsibilities and legal obligations are set out in a series of peace process documents to which the palestinian leadership is committed including the september 1993 exchange of letters between pm rabin and chairman arafat which set the stage for the oslo peace process the plo commits itself to the middle east peace process and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations similarly in his letter to johan jorgen holst foreign minister of norway and host of the oslo meetings arafat confirmed upon the signing of the declaration of principles the plo encourages and calls upon the palestinian people in the west bank and gaza strip to take part in the steps leading to the normalization of life rejecting violence and terrorism contributing to peace and stability and participating actively in shaping reconstruction economic development and cooperation 10 in the september 13 1993 declaration of principles on interim self government arrangements commonly termed oslo i the two sides in recognizing their mutual legitimate and political rights are committed to strive to live in peaceful coexistence and mutual dignity and security and achieve a just lasting and comprehensive peace settlement and historic reconciliation through the agreed political process 11 in the article on cooperation in economic fields the parties acknowledged the mutual benefit of cooperation in promoting the development of the west bank the gaza strip and israel in the article on israeli palestinian cooperation concerning regional programs 12 both parties view the multilateral working groups as an appropriate instrument for promoting a marshall plan the regional programs and other programs including special programs for the west bank and gaza strip such regional development programs include commitments to co operate in the context of the multilateral peace efforts in promoting a development program for the region including the west bank and the gaza strip to be initiated by the g 7 the parties will request the g 7 to seek the participation in this program of other interested states such as members of the organization for economic cooperation and development regional arab states and institutions as well as members of the private sector 13 this development program was to consist of a social rehabilitation program a housing and construction program a small and medium business development plan an infrastructure development program water electricity transportation and communications etc and a human resources plan other programs were to include establishment of a middle east development fund a middle east development bank a joint israeli palestinian jordanian plan for coordinated exploitation of the dead sea area a mediterranean sea gaza dead sea canal regional desalinization and other water development projects a regional plan for agricultural development and prevention of desertification interconnection of electricity grids transfer distribution and industrial exploitation of gas oil and other energy resources and a regional tourism transportation and telecommunications development plan in the israeli palestinian interim agreement on the west bank and the gaza strip signed at washington d c september 28 1995 oslo ii the parties recognized that the peace process and the new era that it has created as well as the new relationship established between the two parties as described above are irreversible and the determination of the two parties to maintain sustain and continue the peace process to this end they agreed to establish a mechanism to develop programs of cooperation between them 14 such a mechanism was agreed to in the sixth annex to the interim agreement entitled protocol concerning israeli palestinian cooperation programs 15 in which they committed to establish dialogue and cooperation on the bases of equality fairness and reciprocity within the context of the interim period and to act together in order to ensure that peace stability and cooperation between them are reinforced and sustained such a mechanism was agreed to in the sixth annex to the interim agreement entitled protocol concerning israeli palestinian cooperation programs in which they committed they also agreed to establish and maintain between them an extensive program of cooperation in fields of human activity including in economic scientific social and cultural fields involving officials institutions and the private sector and to strengthening regional cooperation 16 in article iv of the interim agreement on the subject of economic cooperation the two sides recognized the importance of economic growth especially on the palestinian side and cooperation based on the principles of equity fairness and reciprocity as a key factor in the context of building peace and reconciliation they committed to promoting economic cooperation including the promotion of joint ventures in such fields as industrial cooperation agricultural cooperation and cooperation in the fields of environment energy transport and tourism scientific and technological cultural and educational cooperation conclusion the wide range of palestinian commitments throughout the peace process documentation points to a clear obligation on the part of the palestinian leadership to advance encourage support and participate in all projects and initiatives aimed at furthering economic cooperation for the sake of the stability and prosperity of the palestinian public by boycotting the manama peace to prosperity meeting and by conducting a concerted political campaign to misrepresent and undermine it the palestinian leadership is irresponsibly undermining its basic responsibilities to seek to improve the welfare and prosperity of its people through good governance the palestinian leadership is violating its solemn commitments in the context of the peace process both vis a vis israel as well as vis a vis those countries and regional organs that supported endorsed and witnessed the oslo accords including egypt jordan the united states the european union russia norway and the united nations it is a sad reflection on a misguided and irresponsible leadership that prefers conflict incitement and hostility rather than the hope for peace and economic improvement for the palestinian people notes
central banks are prepared to take fresh measures to strengthen and extend the business cycle primarily because price pressures are below what their predecessors thought would be acceptable levels draghi speaking for the ecb the federal reserve and the bank of japan ratcheted up their concerns which even without new initiatives were sufficient to drive interest rates lower there is no real definition of many terms economists throw around like recession or depression the two negative quarters of declining gdp is not a technical definition but a rule of thumb ironically there weren t recessions before the great depression the end of business or credit cycles were called panics and crises the use of recession appears to have been applied to economies to distinguish the end of the business cycle from the great depression neither the u s nor europe seems to be on the verge of an economic contraction given a shrinking population the japanese economy can contract and per capita gdp can still rise the bundesbank warned last week that the german economy may have contracted in q2 but the eurozone flash suggests the region expanded although the composite pmi averaged 51 8 in q2 following a 51 5 average in q1 growth may be half of the 0 4 in recorded in the first three months of the year the most important data point for the eurozone next week is the reading some may see it as a non story as headline inflation is expected to remain at 1 2 and the at 0 8 unchanged data is the story if conditions do not improve the ecb needs to provide more stimulus the federal reserve took a different spin the median economic forecasts were little changed but acknowledged softer price pressures the fed argued that it was the uncertainty around the economic forecasts that spurred the change in stance it exited its patient mode and on signs that the economy is faltering the atlanta fed s gdp tracker puts q2 u s growth near 2 0 annualized the u s report a revised estimate of q1 on june 27 it is likely to remain a little above 3 0 so even if the ny fed s gdp tracker is right and growth in q2 is closer to 1 4 growth in h1 has seen been above trend although appears to have slowed it has been enough to keep the at the lowest in a generation the low likely reflects a myriad of social issues well beyond the reach of monetary policy the day after the q1 gdp revisions the government reports the continued jobs growth and growing above the rate of inflation has helped underpin consumption household consumption averaged a monthly increase of 0 5 a month in q1 after 0 2 in q4 18 and 0 3 for the entire year after a 0 3 increase in april consumption is expected to have firmed to 0 5 the american consumer remains the bedrock of the economy the year over year pace of the

photograph richard drew ap xi jinping might possibly agree next weekend on further steps to bring down china s trade imbalance with the us giving donald trump a face saving way of ending his trade war related elizabeth warren s economic nationalism vision shows there s a better way robert reich but xi won t agree to change china s economic system why should he the american economic system is focused on maximizing shareholder returns and it s achieving that goal on friday the s p 500 notched a new all time high but average americans have seen no significant gains in their incomes for four decades adjusted for inflation china s economic system by contrast is focused on maximizing china and it s achieving that goal forty years ago china was still backward and agrarian today it s the world s second largest economy home to the world s biggest auto industry and some of the world s most powerful technology companies over the last four decades hundreds of millions of chinese people have been lifted out of poverty these giant corporations have no particular allegiance to america their only responsibility is to their shareholders the two systems are fundamentally different at the core of the american system are 500 giant companies headquartered in the us but making buying and selling things all over the world half of their employees are non american located outside the us a third of their shareholders are non american these giant corporations have no particular allegiance to america their only allegiance and responsibility is to their shareholders they ll do whatever is necessary to get their share prices as high as possible including keeping wages down fighting unions reclassifying employees as independent contractors outsourcing anywhere around world where parts are cheapest shifting their profits around the world wherever taxes are lowest and paying their top ceos ludicrous sums at the core of china s economy by contrast are state owned companies that borrow from state banks at artificially low rates these state firms balance the ups and downs of the economy spending more when private companies are reluctant to do so they re also engines of economic growth making the capital intensive investments china needs to prosper including investments in leading edge technologies china s core planners and state owned companies will do whatever is necessary both to improve the wellbeing of the chinese people and become the world s largest and most powerful economy since 1978 the chinese economy has grown by an average of more than 9 per year growth has slowed recently and american tariffs could bring it down to 6 or 7 but that s still faster than almost any other economy in the world including the us the american system relies on taxes subsidies and regulations to coax corporations to act in the interest of the american public but these levers have proven weak relative to the overriding corporate goal of maximizing shareholder returns last week for example walmart american s largest employer announced it would lay off 570 employees despite taking home more than 2bn courtesy of trump and the republican corporate tax cuts last year the company closed dozens of sam s club stores leaving thousands of americans out of work at the same time walmart has plowed more than 20bn into buying back shares of its own stock which boosts the pay of walmart executives and enriches wealthy investors but does nothing for the economy it should be noted that walmart is a global company not adverse to bribing foreign officials to get its way on thursday it agreed to pay 282m to settle federal allegations of overseas corruption including channeling more than 500 000 to an intermediary in brazil known as a sorceress for her ability to make construction permit problems disappear across the american economy the trump tax cut did squat for jobs and wages but did nicely for corporate executives and big investors instead of reinvesting the savings into their businesses the international monetary fund reports that companies used it to buy back stock but wait america is a democracy and china is a dictatorship right true but most americans have little or no influence on public policy which is why the trump tax cut did so little for them that s the conclusion of professors martin gilens of princeton and benjamin page of northwestern who analyzed 1 799 policy issues before congress and found that the preferences of the average american appear to have only a minuscule near zero statistically non significant impact upon public policy instead american lawmakers respond to the demands of wealthy individuals typically corporate executives and wall street moguls and of big corporations those with the most lobbying prowess and deepest pockets to bankroll campaigns related the gig is up america s booming economy is built on hollow promises robert reich don t blame american corporations they re in business to make profits and maximize their share prices not to serve america but because of their dominance in american politics and their commitment to share prices instead of the wellbeing of americans it s folly to count on them to create good american jobs or improve american competitiveness i m not suggesting we emulate the chinese economic system i am suggesting that we not be smug about the american economic system instead of trying to get china to change we should lessen the dominance of big american corporations over american policy china isn t the reason half of america hasn t had a raise in four decades the simple fact is americans cannot thrive within a system run largely by big american corporations organized to boost their share prices but not boost americans robert reich a former us secretary of labor is professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley and the author of saving capitalism for the many not the few and the common good he is also a columnist for guardian us
sen elizabeth warren d ma c speaks on health care as sen bernie sanders i vt 2nd l listens during an event on capitol hill in washington dc alex wong getty images business has dominated the early policy discussions in the 2020 democratic presidential primary expect more talk about candidates plans for corporate america when 20 hopefuls square off over two nights in the first democratic debates this week in the race s early days democrats have pledged to overhaul chunks of the u s economy from health care to technology and agriculture they have promised to roll back at least parts of the gop corporate tax cuts candidates have sparred over how large a role the government should take in molding the economy they have differed over how free trade affects the economy and whether trade deals can sufficiently protect american workers business issues will give candidates a platform to set themselves apart as they elbow for position in a jammed field expect sens elizabeth warren d mass and bernie sanders i vt who have pledged to rein in corporate america s excesses to make hay about business issues as they jockey for position near the top of the field but lesser known candidates such as former rep john delaney and ex colorado gov john hickenlooper will likely try to tout their pro business chops as they try to climb out of the polling basement i would certainly expect the candidates who have most frontally questioned the role of corporations and business in america specifically sanders and warren to be most aggressive in bringing up those issues said william galston a senior fellow at the brookings institution i do think the candidates who lean left will be targeted by the more centrist or moderate competitors as being unduly anti business here are some business issues that figure to feature heavily in the nbc news msnbc telemundo debates which will take place in miami on wednesday and thursday medicare for all or medicare for more watch now health care spending accounts for about one sixth of the u s economy any overhaul of insurance markets has massive stakes not only for consumers but also insurance companies disagreements have emerged in the primary over how much to change the private insurance market or whether to get rid of it entirely sanders has led the charge for medicare for all a government run system that would provide comprehensive coverage with no deductibles or copays it would effectively end the private insurance market which sanders has argued leads to greed and profiteering four of sanders presidential primary rivals warren sens cory booker of new jersey kirsten gillibrand of new york and kamala harris of california co sponsored his medicare for all legislation earlier this year momentum has gathered behind medicare for all amid spiraling health care costs and republican efforts to dismantle the affordable care act while the law known as obamacare reduced the uninsured population in the u s many liberals argue it did not go far enough to slash costs and improve care for americans some in the field have argued sanders vision would be too expensive or bring too drastic a change from the current system other candidates have laid out alternatives to expand coverage sen amy klobuchar d minn wants to allow americans to opt into medicare former vice president joe biden wants a medicare like public option along with premium free access to the public option for people who would qualify for medicaid but live in states where where governments have not expanded access to the insurance program for low income people delaney who has proposed a new public health care option for people under 65 with the choice to buy private plans has criticized sanders over health care most frequently earlier this month medicare for all supporter rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y told delaney to sashay away because he opposes the health care plan in a statement earlier this week delaney criticized medicare for all again making private insurance illegal is bad policy and bad politics and the truth is the leading supporters of medicare for all know this that s why they attacked me he said delaney will not share the debate stage with sanders but will appear wednesday with medicare for all supporters such as warren and booker breaking up the technology titans watch now washington ramped up its scrutiny of large technology companies amid concerns about consumer data protection and misinformation on social media but warren blew the debate wide open in march when she called to break up companies such as amazon facebook and apple today s big tech companies have too much power too much power over our economy our society and our democracy she wrote at the time they ve bulldozed competition used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else and in the process they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation expect some discussion about the technology industry when democrats take the stage together in miami the democratic field has broadly called for more regulation of huge technology companies though some have not gone as far as warren in calling for their breakup for instance while booker did not call to separate tech companies outright during a recent cnbc interview he suggested he would consider it as president i m willing to say that we need to look at tech companies in general because we have a problem in this country with corporate concentrations of power that are undermining basic free market democratic ideals the senator said so if i am the leader of this country which i hope i am i m going to be coming after hard these large monopolistic companies others such as harris and rep eric swalwell d calif have not called to break up big technology companies facebook and apple are based in northern california within the state harris represents and near swalwell s congressional district the new york times recently asked 18 of the candidates whether tech giants should be broken up trade wars and trade deals president donald trump s ongoing trade war with china has highlighted existing trade fault lines within the democratic party conflict over the issue could flare up during the debates this week the president has slapped tariffs on 250 billion in chinese goods beijing has put retaliatory duties on 110 billion in products from the u s which has contributed to pain for farmers in key electoral states such as iowa and georgia candidates such as sanders and warren have largely aligned with trump on trade they argue free trade deals have sapped u s jobs and hurt manufacturing workers biden and sanders who sit near the front of the democratic pack in nearly all national and state polls have publicly disagreed on the issue sanders criticized biden last month after the former vice president downplayed the economic threat posed by beijing the independent senator from vermont has tried to contrast his record from biden s for instance he has noted that he voted against the north american free trade agreement as a house member while biden supported it while serving as a senator as a member of the obama administration biden also backed the trans pacific partnership trade deal sanders opposed it biden and sanders will share the debate stage on thursday while he has not clashed with fellow democrats over trade former rep beto o rourke of texas has called the president s trade policies disastrous for farmers top democrats have also showed skepticism of the united states mexico canada agreement trump s replacement for nafta the deal is one of the president s top economic and political priorities congress has not yet ratified it as house democrats raise concerns about its environmental and labor protections as well as how it could affect drug prices biden warren sanders harris o rourke and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg all signed on to a statement calling on congress to oppose the deal s approval unless changes are made the washington post reported thursday capitalism vs democratic socialism

central banks are prepared to take fresh measures to strengthen and extend the business cycle primarily because price pressures are below what their predecessors thought would be acceptable levels draghi speaking for the ecb the federal reserve and the bank of japan ratcheted up their concerns which even without new initiatives were sufficient to drive interest rates lower there is no real definition of many terms economists throw around like recession or depression the two negative quarters of declining gdp is not a technical definition but a rule of thumb ironically there weren t recessions before the great depression the end of business or credit cycles were called panics and crises the use of recession appears to have been applied to economies to distinguish the end of the business cycle from the great depression neither the us nor europe seems to be on the verge of an economic contraction given a shrinking population the japanese economy can contract and per capita gdp can still rise the bundesbank warned last week that the german economy may have contracted in q2 but the eurozone flash composite pmi suggests the region expanded although the composite pmi averaged 51 8 in q2 following a 51 5 average in q1 gdp growth maybe half of the 0 4 in recorded in the first three months of the year the most important data point for the eurozone next week is the flash cpi reading some may see it as a non story as headline inflation is expected to remain at 1 2 and the core rate at 0 8 unchanged data is the story draghi was clear if conditions do not improve the ecb needs to provide more stimulus the federal reserve took a different spin the median economic forecasts were little changed but acknowledged softer price pressures the fed argued that it was the uncertainty around the economic forecasts that spurred the change in stance it exited its patient mode and appears poised to pounce on signs that the economy is faltering the atlanta fed s gdp tracker puts q2 us growth near 2 0 annualized the us report a revised estimate of q1 gdp on june 27 it is likely to remain a little above 3 0 so even if the ny fed s gdp tracker is right and growth in q2 is closer to 1 4 growth in h1 has seen been above trend although job growth appears to have slowed it has been enough to keep the unemployment rate at the lowest in a generation the low participation rate likely reflects a myriad of social issues well beyond the reach of monetary policy the day after the q1 gdp revisions the government reports personal consumption expenditures the continued jobs growth and wages growing above the rate of inflation has helped underpin consumption household consumption averaged a monthly increase of 0 5 a month in q1 after 0 2 in q4 18 and 0 3 for the entire year after a 0 3 increase in april consumption is expected to have firmed to 0 5 the american consumer remains the bedrock of the economy the year over year pace of the pce deflator is likely to be

by northmantrader in lieu of my weekly technical update this opinion piece instead the free money whores are back again harsh perhaps untrue not really as i ve stated before our market system is broken central banks originally created to save economies from disasters have now become the prime movers in preventing so much as a cold propagating free money socialism for the top 1 indeed after a series of financial panics particularly the panic of 1907 the fed was created in 1913 for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises now they are in the business of managing markets full time all the time and have become the primary focal point of price discovery it is self evident according to jay powell the fed s primary mission is now to sustain the economic expansion i ve never used the term manipulation before but let s just be clear what sustain the economic expansion really means to prevent natural market forces from taking hold that s manipulation business cycles are natural they serve a purpose they lay the foundation for new growth they weed out the excess they permit for a reset of an aging expansion for a renewed flourishing of innovation new solutions creativity and yes growth of course because of all this recessions bring about temporary pain but nobody wants pain anymore and hence central bankers with hero magazine covers have now taken on a new role that of preventing a recession altogether yes that is the message that continuously being sent breaking fed claims no more recessions ever we have the tools t co dubdbcwexd sven henrich northmantrader june 21 2019 no more cleansing no more resets but only ever more excess and propagating the notion that they alone can prevent the cleansing process from taking place with their favorite and only method free money of yes here we go again oh yes the free money whores are here again hurry back into stocks now interest rates are coming down en masse investors who adjusted their portfolios for a high rate environment must readjust that means leaning into growth stocks again scouring asia for opportunities and earning income from investments that won t succumb to the low rate trend and will also hold up in a shaky economy barron s calls the fed flip flop graceful i call it disgraceful just stop it s 2019 wealth inequality is higher than ever corporate debt is higher than ever and growth is slowing innovation is hampered by a system that has benefitted the few which have grown into bloated monopolies and the entire system itself remains held afloat by massive and ever more expending debt after all there is zero intellectual integrity to anything that is being propagated in recent times fed chairs have bemoaned rising wealth inequality oh how un american it all is and rising corporate debt being a threat to the economy but then they proceed to again exacerbate both by promising more easy money their default solution in the misguided attempt to bail investors out from all pain and any bad decisions and that is the beauty of being a bull in these times of permanent easy money live off the central bank bailouts so what if you re wrong on fundamentals central bank daddy is always there to bail out the narrative q2 earnings will be worse than q1 earnings and they are worse than earnings last year we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it matters not because free money is back and hence spx made new all time highs last week in spite of the data again it s self evident the month of june seeing one of the biggest june rallies in history was a central bank affair of promising more free money yes thank you central banks but facts don t stop some people from congratulating themselves stock market is on track to have the best june in over 50 years thank you mr president wsj donald j trump realdonaldtrump june 22 2019 oh yes intellectual integrity is hard to come by in this day and age yes we were oversold and a rally was technically setting up as i outlined on may 30th in the bull case yes technicals work and they work nicely but in no way can one ignore the extremes that are bestowed on these markets by central bank manipulation yes i now have to call it that as it is self evident and so we are jumping from one vertical rally to the next during the past year and a half markets have been subject to wild and massive swings a battle zone between deteriorating fundamentals in context of an aging business cycle and desperate attempts to levitate markets with tax cuts buybacks and central banks promising ever more free money hence we get charts like these will the free money gang succeed again will they trump the reality of what the banking sector and yields are signaling watch this space will they be able to ignore the reality that the constant interventions with free money have made things much worse in this cycle and that is the question investors have to ask themselves as they are asked to jump in on the new free money train at all time highs all time highs accomplished via central bank speeches a free money train that promises more wealth inequality more corporate debt more government debt but no solutions other than free money capitalism s success was predicated on rewarding risk taken with the knowledge that failure was possible it was based on the competition of ideas free flow of markets and capital in search for rewarding successful business models and innovation this system here does not punish failure it rewards failure it rewards slow growth by offering more free money in response it subsidizes non performance with a constant safety net and yes it is the antithesis of free flow of markets as it forces capital into specific asset classes because there is no alternative and a result it not only produces capital inefficiencies it promotes them the extends them it creates a circular reference error that stifles growth what you think 13 trillion in negative yielding debt is a sign of efficient allocation of capital a sign of free market capitalism i humbly submit this has nothing to do with capitalism but it is socialism with a specific audience in mind for everyone whining about socialism it already exists it s called central banking socialism for the top 1 sven henrich northmantrader april 21 2019 a system that has produced and continues to produce what janet yellen once called un american ever more wealth inequality if you truly want capitalism and a road to eventual higher growth reject this form of socialism let the world cleanse itself and from the pain let free market economics do what its best at produce real growth stop with the constant daddy bail outs it is unbecoming of capitalism so go ahead celebrate new market highs just don t call it free market economics call it what it is free money socialism spx 2950 it s amazing what one can do in 10 years with 4t in qe 6t in corporate debt buybacks 12t in new government debt and the weakest rate hike cycle in history off of zero bound no less by all means let s celebrate this accomplishment of free market economics sven henrich northmantrader june 21 2019 central banks are not saving capitalism they re ruining it
washington president donald trump s renewed focus on what he calls unfair exchange rates could presage a new global battlefield that has the potential to do great damage to the world economy trump has spent two years attacking the underpinnings of the global trading system launching multi front tariff wars on allies and adversaries alike while complaining that the united states has been taken advantage of under a proposed new rule that could come into effect as early as next month the us may impose punitive tariffs on any country it determines is manipulating its currency to make its products more competitive than american goods trump has frequently attacked eurozone countries like germany for benefitting from a relatively weak currency and last week said they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others as trump s attack on european central bank president mario draghi in the past week shows once mundane monetary policy moves could be used as ammunition to justify retaliation economists warn this opens the door to a damaging global currency war pitting everyone against everyone if trump follows this new path likely with the backing of commerce secretary and trade hardliner wilbur ross the united states would be vulnerable to retaliation when the federal reserve eventually cuts the benchmark interest rate as trump has demanded they do central banks use interest rate cuts to spur a sluggish economy weakening a currency s value in exchange for boosting exports which then power economic growth mark sobel who served in the treasury for years under republican and democratic administrations said he has serious reservations about the new plan in his submission to the commerce department he said the rule change is fundamentally flawed and could prove counterproductive and harm the us economy dubious legality over the years lawmakers and presidents from both the democratic and republican parties have floated plans to go after governments that manipulate their exchange rate to compete in the global trading system but the efforts mostly aimed at china have always been resisted and eventually abandoned in part because they were viewed as a violation of global trade rules and ironically china has not been intervening in markets in recent years except to keep the yuan from falling and the currency has instead gained in value since the financial crisis currently the us treasury issues a twice yearly report scrutinizing possible currency manipulation but since the mid 1990s the department has never taken the final step of labeling a country as a manipulator even in the years when china was very active in its efforts to keep the yuan weak now the commerce department has moved to wrest control of the issue away from the treasury by proposing a rule modification that would allow it to treat currency manipulation the same as it would a foreign government subsidy that harms american manufacturers if approved commerce could impose tariffs to offset the weaker exchange rate against the us dollar the department is accepting comments from the public until june 27 and could implement the change any time after that according to the proposal commerce said it would defer to treasury s evaluation of whether a currency is undervalued unless we have good reason to believe otherwise that ambiguity raises red flags for economists many of whom believe commerce does not have the technical expertise to make that evaluation the plan would grant the commerce department excessive discretion sobel said it also is notoriously difficult to calculate objectively whether a particular currency is undervalued and if so by how much for years the peterson institute for international economics produced a report evaluating exchange rates but stopped because they were completely arbitrary the think tank s chief adam posen told reporters recently china should have been hammered hard in the early mid 2000s for massive manipulation of the currency posen said but to do so now is pretty close to absurd
on the day the senate rushed through legislation to temporarily suspend one of canada s international trade obligations citing fears of as yet unspecified surges donald trump sat beside justin trudeau and said the current trade situation for north american steel is very well taken care of c 101 cleared the house of commons thanks to a late night motion on wednesday then sailed through all stages of debate in the senate in under an hour thursday afternoon with approval by voice votes after only one speech in favour and one opposed the new law deletes waits two years and then reinstates a world trade organization rule canada signed on to 25 years ago which requires a waiting period of two years between the time a protective measure ends and the re application of a similar safeguard measure on the same product we can t have tremendous shipment of certain products the u s president said thursday after cbc news asked if the u s could impose more tariffs on canada and mexico listeners familiar with trump s fixations could infer that by certain products the president likely meant chinese steel there won t be hopefully transshipping trump said referring to the practice of using one country as a stopover to another to dodge tariffs if there s transshipping i ll call justin and he ll take care of it and if he doesn t i ll probably call him a second time and if he doesn t we ll have to talk he said looking at trudeau we ll be fine prime minister trudeau replied i think the situation is very well taken care of trump concluded fears of a dealbreaker speaking to reporters later trudeau said concerns about dumping are shared by both canadians and americans then as apparent proof of this concern he noted the senate had just passed c 101 in record time to ensure that the north american market on steel and aluminum remains protected from outside influences but the new legislation isn t about dumping remedies duties extra taxes applied at the border after one country proves another country s exports are unfairly cheap canada already has 77 different anti dumping and countervailing duties in place against 25 different countries including china to combat unfair dumping and subsidization c 101 is about emergency safeguards the wto allows temporary protection measures such as the application of surtaxes above a certain historical quota when a domestic market is threatened by otherwise fairly traded imports without the two year waiting period the government has more flexibility to respond if any sudden surges of offshore steel are detected but it still has to justify its protections before the canadian international trade tribunal a process that did not recommend continuing safeguards on five steel products earlier this spring without this rule change canada could not re instate surtaxes on these products for the next two years here s the fear canada s new agreement with the u s to lift the previous 25 per cent steel tariffs is a snap back deal the americans can slap tariffs back on in the event that imports of aluminum or steel products surge meaningfully officials are still negotiating the exact definition of the word surge in the meantime the canadian government has hustled to give itself more flexibility minister of finance bill morneau introduced c 101 on june 5 it received royal assent on june 21 a remarkably short sprint to passage by canadian parliamentary standards justin tang canadian press independent sen frances lankin sponsored c 101 s hasty adoption thursday once parliament rose for the summer she told cbc news it wouldn t be able to respond in the event of an emergency canada is not signalling that they are walking away from the general agreement of world trading partners she said but in these exceptional circumstances we are reserving the right to protect our local industry i was informed that the u s did not ask for this directly but i see the tea leaves as well lankin said we know that if there s transshipment which is what could follow a surge of imports into this country that could be a dealbreaker for the tariff removal watching our every move when the commons finance committee reviewed c 101 over june 12 14 chair wayne easter thanked participants for coming on extremely short notice on an extremely hasty bill officials told mps how canada tried to act in the spring of 2018 to alleviate concerns about transshipment risks including by changing marking regulations to better identify the origin of steel the u s imposed its tariffs anyway prime minister justin trudeau and his cabinet ministers have popped up at canadian steel and aluminum facilities many times over the last year to show their support for the industry in the face of u s tariffs adrian wyld canadian press john layton executive director for trade remedies at global affairs canada s north american trade division said that while the u s would notice what we would do he didn t think american tariff decisions had anything to do with measures canada takes against other countries we never had discussions with the united states about specific concerns they have with transshipments nor did the u s ever ask us to impose measures to address transshipment he said adding that he didn t think the emergency surtax canada applied provisionally to seven kinds of offshore steel last of october had any impact on the u s deciding to tax canadian imports at first based on trump s statements canada thought the tariffs were linked to the ongoing renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta layton said we never discovered what the problem was with transshipment catherine cobden president of the canadian steel producers association told mps that so long as the u s has a 25 per cent tariff on offshore steel and canada doesn t domestic producers are significantly exposed to high volumes of low priced steel and are at grave risk she said the government needs the flexibility to respond because imports will surge the u s is watching our every move we have to demonstrate that we have the tools and we will use them she said it s just a process of elimination there s nowhere else for the steel to go canadian steel producers association president catherine cobden duration 5 21 canadian steel producers association president catherine cobden talks about the government s new measures for the steel industry ken neumann of the united steelworkers union said that one of the biggest u s complaints voiced during recent oecd meetings was that canada was not protecting its industry if this bill does not pass john white of the canadian automobile dealers association warned it would be one other reason for our friends in the south not to ratify only one invited witness a small businessman affected by rising steel input costs objected to c 101 in the private sector flexibility translates to volatility and volatility leads to drastic price swings which are terrible for planning said chad bunch of calgary s bunch welding ltd legal to pass illegal to use liberal mp peter fragiskatos asked layton the trade official if c 101 was consistent with canada s international legal obligations layton told the finance committee that canada was never obligated to write the wto s waiting period rule into its domestic law however if canada were to impose another measure within the two year period because we ve removed it from our law i think other wto members would have questions about how that is consistent with the obligation in the wto agreement he said fragiskatos then asked the official to confirm that canada wouldn t be offside with the wto or likely to face any complaints i think we will face questions about why we re doing it but my understanding is that there wouldn t be a wto dispute launched because of our law layton said put another way c 101 is legal to pass but possibly illegal to use the same week mps reviewed c 101 canadian officials in geneva were meeting with trading partners who did in fact have questions about canada s new legislation sen lankin said officials told her they re emphasizing c 101 s two year sunset clause trade lawyers have warned that other countries won t wait to retaliate against canada for pulling back from its obligations canada s already beleagured farm exports could be in line for more trouble but lankin said that as far as she s been told of these discussions there were no alarm bells that had gone off
washington the drumbeat for a federal reserve interest rate cut is getting louder with one policy maker calling for a 50 basis point reduction minneapolis fed president neel kashkari said friday that he d advocated for such a move at the central bank s june 18 19 meeting where officials ended leaving rates unchanged other policy makers speaking on friday didn t go as far as kashkari considered one of the fed s more dovish officials but their comments reinforced expectations that the fed is on course to reduce rates perhaps as soon as its july 30 31 gathering president donald trump who s sharply criticized fed chairman jerome powell for keeping credit too tight said thursday that he expects the central bank to lower rates can t win it all eventually he ll do what s right the president said of powell powell deputy richard clarida said on friday that the argument for easier policy has strengthened recently as the economic outlook has turned more uncertain the case for providing accommodation has increased fed vice chair clarida said in a bloomberg television interview there s been a marking down in global growth prospects there s been uncertainty about international trade trump is slated to meet chinese president xi jinping at the june 28 29 summit of group of 20 nations in osaka japan to try to head off a further escalation in the trade war between the world s two biggest economies the president also has threatened to impose tariffs on auto imports from japan and the european union downside risks adding to the uncertainty are heightened tensions in the middle east after iran shot down a u s drone and trump tweeted he came within minutes of launching a retaliatory attack on saturday trump said that military action is always on the table fed governor lael brainard also sounds open to a rate cut even as she describes the u s economic outlook as solid recent weeks have seen important downside risks brainard said friday at a fed event in cincinnati adding that the central bank must take those into account when setting policy a gauge of u s factory activity fell in june to the lowest since late 2009 while a separate measure of the service sector edged down to a three year low according to surveys of business purchasing managers by ihs markit the data suggest that economic activity is rapidly downshifting said joseph lavorgna chief economist for the americas at investment bank and asset manager natixis what our economists say the messaging from the june fomc meeting showed policy makers demonstrating heightened sensitivity to both market and economic signals bloomberg economics now projects the fed to execute 50 bps of rate cuts by year end in an attempt to reduce inversion pressures on the yield curve and to avoid orchestrating policy in a manner contrary to the increasing dovishness among other major foreign central banks u s economists carl riccadonna and yelena shulyatyeva the federal open market committee s vote on wednesday to leave rates unchanged in a 2 25 to 2 5 range wasn t unanimous st louis fed president james bullard sought a quarter point rate cut his vote marked the first dissent of powell s 16 month tenure as chairman kashkari isn t a voting member of the fomc this year although he will be in 2020 in a blog posting on friday explaining his dissent bullard said he favored a cut to guard against downside risks of too low inflation and weaker growth even if a sharper than expected slowdown does not materialize a rate cut would help promote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation expectations to target he said inflation target the fed has failed to convincingly hit its 2 inflation objective since 2012 what s more inflation expectations particularly in financial markets have fallen recently and fed officials themselves have marked down their forecast of price rises this year to 1 5 from 1 8 in march kashkari zeroed in on tepid inflation and inflation expectations in his call for easier monetary policy at this month s fomc meeting i advocated for a 50 basis point rate cut to 1 75 to 2 and a commitment not to raise rates again until core inflation reaches our 2 target on a sustained basis kashkari wrote in an essay i believe an aggressive policy action such as this is required to re anchor inflation expectations at our target ellen zentner chief u s economist at morgan stanley said that rate cuts are the best way for the fed to boost inflation expectations stabilize financial markets counter global growth and trade risks and support the economy there s one answer right now for their ills and that s for them to drop rates zentner who expects a half point cut next month said in a bloomberg television interview friday it s the right prescription to start aggressively bloomberg
advertisement politicians often like lower interest rates because they can give the economy a lift shoring up voter support but economists say politicized central banks lead to high levels of inflation and erodes trust among investors and creditors trump has nevertheless stepped up pressure on the federal reserve and its chairman jerome powell in recent weeks as his trade policies threaten to hurt the american economy view markets insider s homepage for more stories in the early 1970s president richard nixon handily won another term in the white house after pressuring his federal reserve chairman to keep interest rates low there was a catch though the american economy entered a decade of turbulence plagued by periods of double digit inflation that cautionary tale has long served to keep those in the oval office publicly mum on monetary policy until recently for evidence of that consider what president donald trump has done in the last year alone he s pressured the fed to slash interest rates reportedly sought to remove central bank chief jerome powell and attempted to install political loyalists on its policymaking board not to mention his ever active twitter account his preferred vessel for delivering stinging messages to the fed specifically powell advertisement the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening trump wrote on twitter in early june they don t have a clue why trump and other politicians favor lower rates politicians often like lower interest rates because it means an expanded money supply that gives people and corporations more purchasing and spending power which gives the economy a lift that in turn shores up voter support on the flipside if the economy is overheating and inflation is threatening to run away the fed will raise rates and constrict the money supply this is what trump is hoping to avoid heading into 2020 even if it s not necessarily the best outcome for the economy at large a bonus just for you click here to claim 30 days of access to business insider prime but economists say politicized central banks lead to high levels of inflation and eventually erode trust among investors and creditors advertisement mr trump has been attacking the fed s actions with more vitriol than any previous president in memory steven rattner a wall street financier who was an obama administration adviser wrote in a recent new york times op ed we need to guard the independence of the central bank the most important government institution that has not been divided by the deep partisanship so evident elsewhere trump continues to butt heads with powell and the fed trump has nevertheless stepped up broadsides on the central bank in recent weeks as his trade policies threaten to hurt the american economy he has even suggested powell and his fellow officials should wield monetary policy to gain leverage in those disputes which have dimmed outlooks for growth at home and elsewhere they devalue their currency they have for years trump said of china in a cnbc interview this month it s put them at a tremendous competitive advantage and we don t have that advantage because we have a fed that doesn t lower interest rates powell and the fed defied those calls to a degree at the end of a two day policy meeting wednesday but still softened language and signaled trump will get the rate cut he so desires in july that was reflected in its so called dot plot which showed policymakers were split on projections for the year read more the fed just quietly acknowledged that it made a policy blunder last year and escalated the stakes for investors as the next recession looms advertisement eight individuals saw at least one cut in 2019 while others thought policy should remain the same or even be tightened aside from below target inflation readings and uncertainty caused by trade tensions many aspects of the economy have held up better than expected a rate cut now would give the perception that it was succumbing to pressure from the white house and enabling trump s trade war said kenneth kuttner a williams college economist and former federal reserve staffer on the other hand standing pat on principle would provoke intensified wrath and potentially delay what would might otherwise be an appropriate response to weakening economic conditions the market impact of this prolonged battle for the time being trump appears to be winning his battle of wills with powell and the fed and he s getting a little help from both the stock and bond markets which have been increasingly pricing in the possibility of rate cuts in fact stocks reached a new record high last thursday a day after the fomc s latest statement economists surveyed by bloomberg now think with 100 certainty that the fed will cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points at the july 31 meeting the stock market situation is ultimately a tricky one for powell whose hawkish comments in late december 2018 sparked the biggest equity sell off in months and nearly ended the 10 year bull market the fed chair quickly capitulated in early january setting stocks back on a record setting trajectory advertisement considering the fed is supposed to be an independent body the fact that stock investors appeared to wield so much influence struck some experts as odd as it stands the federal reserve s reputation as an independent institution is most at risk with casual observers according to josh wright the chief economist at icims a recruiting software company they see the headlines but they re not picking through the legal arguments about precisely what kind of authority different officials have nor are they picking through the fed s analyses and arguments to determine whether and to what extent its policies are being influenced by politicians he said the risk is that over time that erosion spreads
reading time 3 minutes there has been a lot of concern over the slow increase in living standards of the average canadian over the past few decades in the long run economists say that the key to increasing real corrected for inflation wages is to increase productivity of those in the labour force how to actually do that is complicated and it s even harder to implement the potential solutions which can be politically dicey the first thing and the longest term thing is to increase the skills of workers canada does a reasonably good job in its public education system of having graduates who are literate numerate technically aware and able to absorb further knowledge in the post secondary system of vocational technical and university education however some resource misallocation exists surplus people in soft humanities and social sciences programs not enough in science technology engineering and mathematics stem programs yet on the whole canada s workforce is well trained the post secondary educated represent half the total and that s near the top of the list of organization for economic co operation and development oecd nations another crucial thing is confidence in the rule of law and ease of doing business in a country both for foreign investors and local or national ones in this regard canada is mediocre ranking only 22nd in the world bank s 2018 assessment many other developed nations are more attractive for investors anyone trying to get a mine pipeline or construction project started can attest to this also sectors such as communications media transportation and healthcare are highly regulated deterring interest the other major factor affecting long term productivity is the deployment of capital investment for the ultimate benefit of the skilled workforce again canada is doing badly in this regard from 2016 through 2018 non residential private investment grew from 154 billion to 157 billion or just three percent far lower than the growth rate in nominal not adjusted for inflation gross domestic product of about five percent potential rates of return must increase to encourage capital investment and the productivity improvements and wage growth that follow policy changes must be made including to corporate income tax like quebec the new alberta government in alberta is embarking on such a change it will gradually lower its tax rate on corporate income from the current 12 percent down to eight percent by 2023 this will make the combined federal and provincial corporate tax rate in alberta 23 percent unless the federal government changes rates in the interim this will help make alberta not just competitive with the rest of canada but with the united states too in the u s the combined federal and state rate averages about 26 percent however the u s has another advantage immediate expensing of all capital expenditures only some sorts of machinery receive such treatment in canada while other equipment instruments structures intellectual property and vehicles are not included the u s reforms undertaken since the election of president donald trump have already boosted corporate capital investment and raised productivity and wages with little effect on revenues to government it should also be noted that ireland s low corporate rate of 12 5 percent has been vital to that country s rise from poverty to prosperity canada can t just wait around for the oil price to recover or pipeline projects to finally get built our leaders must make the country more attractive to investors by encouraging investment as higher levels of investment and productivity improve our trade balance the loonie will rise further increasing individual purchasing power without these policy changes our standard of living will keep rising very slowly ian madsen is a senior policy analyst with the frontier centre for public policy anderson agbugba a frontier centre intern contributed to this article troy media the views opinions and positions expressed by columnists and contributors are the author s alone they do not inherently or expressly reflect the views opinions and or positions of our publication
president donald trump has a silent partner behind several of the accomplishments he likes to boast about barack obama despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw the kickoff of trump s 2020 campaign with a rally in florida that and other events provided trump a platform that he used to exaggerate what he s done take some factually challenged swipes at obama and democrats at large and make promises that will be hard to keep here are samples migrants trump in interview with telemundo broadcast thursday talking about separating children from adults at the mexican border when i became president president obama had a separation policy i didn t have it he had it i brought the families together i m the one that brought em together now i said something when i did that i m the one that put people together they separated i put em together jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public uproar and under a court order trump ceased the separations zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns about the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns trump in telemundo interview talking about detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas trade trump in remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal pales in comparison with one that did go into effect with the u s on board the uruguay round concluded in 1994 the round of negotiations created the world trade organization and was signed by 123 countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output trump on his tariffs in a rally tuesday in orlando fla we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically iran trump in a friday tweet president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus 1 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal trump on his accomplishments in fox news interview wednesday and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers energy trump at orlando rally we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world trump in fox news interview wednesday we re now no 1 in the world in energy the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s jobs trump at orlando rally almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 trump at orlando rally women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 economy trump at orlando rally it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history the wall trump in fox news interview wednesday we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year trump at orlando rally we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers taxes trump at orlando rally we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later environment trump in fox news interview wednesday our water and our air today is cleaner than it ever was our air it s the best it ever was trump at orlando rally our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far the facts not true about air quality which hasn t gotten better under the trump administration u s drinking water is among the best by one leading measure after decades of improvement progress in air quality has stalled over the last two years the u s had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier federal data show there were 15 more days with unhealthy air in america both last year and the year before than there were on average from 2013 through 2016 the four years when america had its fewest number of those days since at least 1980 the obama administration in fact set records for the fewest air polluted days in 2016 on water yale university s global environmental performance index finds 10 countries tied for the cleanest drinking water the u s among them on environmental quality overall the u s was 27th behind a variety of european countries canada japan australia and more switzerland was no 1 judges trump on the confirmation of federal judges at orlando rally president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions the facts trump s sarcasm aside he does have a better success rate than obama in filling judicial vacancies the republican controlled senate in obama s last two years avoided taking action on many of his nominees republicans still control the senate and have been able to confirm about 120 of trump s picks despite their slim majority that s about 35 more than obama had confirmed at this point in his presidency health care trump at orlando rally we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions always the facts his administration s actions say otherwise it is pressing in court for full repeal of obama s health law which requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with pre existing conditions but the white house has provided no details abortion trump at orlando rally leading democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth the facts executing children is already a crime trump is offering here a somewhat toned down version of a distorted story he s been telling for months that falsely suggests democrats are ok with murder his account arises from extremely rare instances when babies are born alive as a result of an attempted abortion when these cases occur execution is not an option when a baby is born with anomalies so severe that he or she would die soon after birth a family may choose what s known as palliative care or comfort care this might involve allowing the baby to die naturally without medical intervention providing comfort without life extending treatment is not specific to newborns it may happen with fatally ill patients of any age veterans trump at orlando rally we passed va choice they ve been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years the facts no congress approved the private sector veterans choice health program in 2014 and obama signed it into law trump signed an expansion of it russia investigation trump on fox news interview wednesday i m the most transparent president in history i let mueller have everything they wanted the facts it s highly questionable to say trump was fully cooperative in the russia investigation trump declined to sit for an interview with robert mueller s team gave written answers that investigators described as inadequate and incomplete said more than 30 times that he could not remember something he was asked about in writing and according to the report tried to get aides to fire the special counsel or otherwise shut or limit the inquiry in the end the mueller report found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia but left open the question of whether trump obstructed justice according to the report mueller s team declined to make a prosecutorial judgment on whether to charge partly because of a justice department legal opinion that said sitting presidents cannot be indicted the report instead factually laid out instances in which trump might have obstructed justice specifically leaving it open for congress to take up the matter
nearly three years later president donald trump continues using barack obama as his personal punching bag to blame things on despite assailing his democratic predecessor for waging a cruel and heartless war on american energy for example trump can brag about u s energy supremacy thanks to the sector s growth in the obama years and the obama trump decade is soon to yield an economic record if things stay on track a little longer the most sustained expansion in u s history though trump claims all the credit the expansion started in obama s first year continued through his presidency and has been maintained under trump there are no fist bumps in the offing however the past week saw the kickoff of trump s 2020 campaign with a rally in florida that and other events provided trump a platform that he used to exaggerate what he s done take some factually challenged swipes at obama and democrats at large and make promises that will be hard to keep a roundup of the weeks biggest trump fact checks migrants trump on separating children from adults at the mexican border when i became president president obama had a separation policy i didn t have it he had it i brought the families together i m the one that brought em together now i said something when i did that i m the one that put people together they separated i put em together interview with telemundo broadcast thursday jose diaz balart interviewer you did not the facts trump is not telling the truth the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents resulted from his zero tolerance policy obama had no such policy after a public uproar and under a court order trump ceased the separations zero tolerance meant that u s authorities would criminally prosecute all adults caught crossing into the u s illegally doing so meant detention for adults and the removal of their children while their parents were in custody during the obama administration such family separations were the exception they became the practice under trump s policy which he suspended a year ago before trump s zero tolerance policy migrant families caught illegally entering the u s were usually referred for civil deportation proceedings not requiring separation unless they were known to have a criminal record then and now immigration officials may take a child from a parent in certain cases such as serious criminal charges against a parent concerns over the health and welfare of a child or medical concerns detention centers trump on detention centers at the border president obama is the one that built those prison cells telemundo interview the facts he has a point whether they are called prison cells or something else obama held children in temporary ill equipped facilities and built a large center in mcallen texas that is used now democrats routinely and inaccurately blame trump for creating cages for children they are actually referring to chain link fencing inside the mcallen center obama s creation conditions for detained migrants deteriorated sharply during a surge of central american arrivals under trump particularly in el paso texas trade trump this will be the largest trade deal ever made and it won t even be close if you take a look at the numbers second is so far away you don t even call it second so it s very exciting and very exciting for mexico very exciting for canada remarks thursday with canadian prime minister justin trudeau the facts that s wrong simply by virtue of the number of trade partners involved the proposed new agreement replacing the north american free trade agreement covers the same three countries the trans pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration included the three nafta partners united states canada and mexico plus japan and eight other pacific rim countries trump withdrew the united states from the pact on his third day in office even the pacific deal pales in comparison with one that did go into effect with the u s on board the uruguay round concluded in 1994 the round of negotiations created the world trade organization and was signed by 123 countries the federal reserve bank of boston said the wto s initial membership accounted for more than 90 percent of global economic output tariffs trump on his tariffs we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury we have never taken 10 cents from china rally tuesday in orlando florida the facts it s false to say the u s never collected a dime in tariffs on chinese goods before he took action they are simply higher in some cases than they were before it s also wrong to suggest that the tariffs are being paid by china tariff money coming into the treasury is mainly from u s businesses and consumers not from china tariffs are primarily if not entirely a tax paid domestically iran trump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them 150 billion dollars plus i 8 billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled death to america i terminated deal tweet friday trump on his accomplishments and then terminating one of the worst deals ever made the iran deal that was made by president obama paid 150 billion paid 1 8 billion in cash i terminated that and iran is a much different country fox news interview wednesday the facts there was no 150 billion payout from the u s treasury the money he refers to represents iranian assets held abroad that were frozen until the international deal was reached and tehran was allowed to access its funds the payout of about 1 8 billion is a separate matter that dates to the 1970s when iran paid the u s 400 million for military equipment that was never delivered because the government was overthrown and diplomatic relations ruptured that left people businesses and governments in each country indebted to partners in the other and these complex claims took decades to sort out in tribunals and arbitration for its part iran paid settlements of more than 2 5 billion to u s citizens and businesses the day after the nuclear deal was implemented the u s and iran announced they had settled the claim over the 1970s military equipment order with the u s agreeing to pay the 400 million principal along with about 1 3 billion in interest the 400 million was paid in cash and flown to tehran on a cargo plane which gave rise to trump s dramatic accounts of money stuffed in barrels or boxes and delivered in the dead of night the arrangement provided for the interest to be paid later not crammed into containers energy trump we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the no 1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world orlando rally trump we re now no 1 in the world in energy fox news interview wednesday the facts as he s done many times before trump is crediting himself with things that happened under obama here s what the government s u s energy information administration says the united states has been the world s top producer of natural gas since 2009 when u s natural gas production surpassed that of russia and the world s top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013 when u s production exceeded saudi arabia s jobs trump almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before orlando rally the facts true but that s a tribute to americans making babies and immigrants coming to the country population growth in other words other than during recessions employment growth has been trending upward since 1939 when the labor department started counting the phenomenon is not a marker of leadership it has spanned successful and failed presidents more on point the annual rate of job growth has been within the same range since roughly 2011 it was 1 6 through may another measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still below record highs the labor department says 60 6 percent of people in the u s 16 years and older were working in may that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 during bill clinton s administration though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 women s unemployment trump women s unemployment is now the lowest it s been in 74 years orlando rally the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it ticked up in may to 3 2 economy trump it s soaring to incredible new heights perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country orlando rally the facts the economy is not one of the best in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 2 percent in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 percent for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 percent in 1984 the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump has legitimate claim to a good economy but when it comes to records there s one he will have to share with obama the economy is on track to achieve its longest expansion ever in july much of that decade long growth came during obama s presidency an achievement that trump so far has largely sustained other than in its durability the economy is far from the finest in history the wall trump we ll have over 400 miles built by the end of next year fox news interview wednesday trump we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving very rapidly orlando rally the facts that s highly unlikely and even if so the great majority of the wall he s talking about would be replacement barrier not new miles of construction trump has added strikingly little length to barriers along the mexico border despite his pre eminent 2016 campaign promise to get a wall done even to reach 400 miles or 640 kilometers he would have to prevail in legal challenges to his declaration of a national emergency or get congress to find more money to get anywhere close so far the administration has awarded contracts for 247 miles 395 km of wall construction but that initiative has been constrained by court cases that are still playing out in any event all but 17 miles 27 km of his awarded contracts so far would replace existing barriers taxes trump we ve done so much with the biggest tax cut in history orlando rally the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and obama s renewal of them a decade later

washington president donald trump s renewed focus on what he calls unfair exchange rates could presage a new global battlefield that has the potential to do great damage to the world economy trump has spent two years attacking the underpinnings of the global trading system launching multi front tariff wars on allies and adversaries alike while complaining that the united states has been taken advantage of under a proposed new rule that could come into effect as early as next month the us may impose punitive tariffs on any country it determines is manipulating its currency to make its products more competitive than american goods trump has frequently attacked eurozone countries like germany for benefitting from a relatively weak currency and last week said they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others as trump s attack on european central bank president mario draghi in the past week shows once mundane monetary policy moves could be used as ammunition to justify retaliation economists warn this opens the door to a damaging global currency war pitting everyone against everyone if trump follows this new path likely with the backing of commerce secretary and trade hardliner wilbur ross the united states would be vulnerable to retaliation when the federal reserve eventually cuts the benchmark interest rate as trump has demanded they do central banks use interest rate cuts to spur a sluggish economy weakening a currency s value in exchange for boosting exports which then power economic growth mark sobel who served in the treasury for years under republican and democratic administrations said he has serious reservations about the new plan in his submission to the commerce department he said the rule change is fundamentally flawed and could prove counterproductive and harm the us economy dubious legality over the years lawmakers and presidents from both the democratic and republican parties have floated plans to go after governments that manipulate their exchange rate to compete in the global trading system but the efforts mostly aimed at china have always been resisted and eventually abandoned in part because they were viewed as a violation of global trade rules and ironically china has not been intervening in markets in recent years except to keep the yuan from falling and the currency has instead gained in value since the financial crisis currently the us treasury issues a twice yearly report scrutinizing possible currency manipulation but since the mid 1990s the department has never taken the final step of labeling a country as a manipulator even in the years when china was very active in its efforts to keep the yuan weak now the commerce department has moved to wrest control of the issue away from the treasury by proposing a rule modification that would allow it to treat currency manipulation the same as it would a foreign government subsidy that harms american manufacturers if approved commerce could impose tariffs to offset the weaker exchange rate against the us dollar the department is accepting comments from the public until june 27 and could implement the change any time after that according to the proposal commerce said it would defer to treasury s evaluation of whether a currency is undervalued unless we have good reason to believe otherwise that ambiguity raises red flags for economists many of whom believe commerce does not have the technical expertise to make that evaluation the plan would grant the commerce department excessive discretion sobel said it also is notoriously difficult to calculate objectively whether a particular currency is undervalued and if so by how much for years the peterson institute for international economics produced a report evaluating exchange rates but stopped because they were completely arbitrary the think tank s chief adam posen told reporters recently china should have been hammered hard in the early mid 2000s for massive manipulation of the currency posen said but to do so now is pretty close to absurd
many on the left both in mexico and abroad welcomed the new president of mexico hoping that his progressive rhetoric of a fourth transformation augured a new era of positive change in mexico andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo even convinced a number of indigenous resistance groups that his administration would be favorable to their struggles against the neoliberal extractivist megaprojects that are devastating their lands indigenous rights supporter richard gere recently met with amlo in the national palace and even noam chomsky spoke up favorably after a meeting with amlo during his campaign last year obrador s national development plan unveiled in january reads like a leftist dream come true criticizing neoliberalism and the washington consensus promoting renewable energy and agricultural independence and of course championing the poor and dispossessed the plan was promoted as a moral regeneration and even invoked the ethics of leading by obeying mandar obedeciendo a famous zapatista phrase that encapsulates their dedication to self government from below six months on he has proven that nothing could be farther from the truth in practice amlo s presidency is a continuation of the neoliberal regime and of the clientelism that has characterized the mexican government for ages like so many governments before it the amlo administration is using government handouts to divide communities and to undermine autonomous organizing efforts that threaten the capitalist class protected by amlo groups that have been most vocal against amlo include the zapatistas the national indigenous congress the cni the movement in defense of land and territory and the many local led resistances that have so far stood in the way of dozens of destructive capital projects amlo s creation of the national institute of indigenous peoples to manage indigenous affairs is clearly designed to undermine organizations such as the national indigenous congress an anti capitalist indigenous resistance movement focused on defending land and resources and protecting indigenous culture the waffling and false promises of the amlo administration bear a striking resemblance to the administrations of two other north american progressive leaders former us president barack obama and current canadian prime minister justin trudeau amlo is a master at doublespeak claiming to be against privatization and gmos canceling the new airport and special economic zones and a number of other measures that favor specific segments of the population such as people over 68 on social security high school students older students seeking job training and workers receiving minimum wage which went up from about 4 80 per day to a little more than 5 per day for most of the country and up to slightly less than 10 per day in the border area in order to mollify demands by the trump administration to reduce immigration to the us by raising wages at the border at the same time however amlo assures the mexican business elite there will be no radical changes in his administration nor any abandonment of structural reforms that have been responsible for rising inequality land dispossession degradation of public education increased dependence on agricultural imports the devastation of small farming in the face of subsidized agribusiness and dozens of environmentally catastrophic extractivist projects controlled by international corporations amlo s strategy appears to be directed at dismantling a bloc of capitalists privileged by previous neoliberal administrations in favor of another bloc of capital that will be loyal to him looking at a few important cases of amlo s policies on megaprojects can shed light on what is really driving the new administration that is hiding behind a mask of progressiveness amlo s megaproject strategy amlo is pushing through massive projects that previous administrations had been forced to suspend in the face of local often indigenous led resistance and legal challenges in april amlo declared the end of the special economic zones created by peña nieto in order to prioritize other megaprojects which he claims will improve regional development the maya train a new refinery in tabasco along the gulf of mexico the trans isthmus corridor and the plan integral morelos all of which involve dispossession of farmers and indigenous communities in some cases construction and management have already opened to bidding by transnational corporations amlo has been relying on hastily organized plebiscites to bypass the consultations with local indigenous authorities that are mandated by the government when indigenous territories are affected ironically but perhaps not unusual for self declared left regimes amlo has set in motion projects that former right and center right governments had not succeeded in implementing the maya train the cynically named maya train will link palenque to cancún with several stops along the so called riviera maya the tracks will cover 1 500 kilometers and cross seven states the new train route is planned to dramatically increase tourism promising economic development for locals the same promise that the mexican government made when it first promoted the area as a tourist haven in the mid 1980s the funding for cancún s infrastructure originally came from loans from the world bank and inter american development bank using mexico s vast oil reserves as collateral business press is excited about the improved investment opportunities in the riviera maya and amlo claims that trump has sent him a message promising the us will invest in the train what the government calls development is cheap luxury for foreigners on the backs of local workers and the ecosystem the area is already overrun by big box hotels fine dining restaurants and nightclubs which allow tourists from advanced capitalist societies to enjoy luxury on the cheap all inclusive hotels charge typically between 150 and 400 per day for guests to eat drink relax on the beach and get entertained without having to venture outside the hotel compound by comparison local economic benefits from this arrangement are minimal already in 2003 a journalist reported that finding a small family run mexican taqueria or panaderia a taco stand or a traditional bakery much easier in downtown los angeles or chicago than it is in cancún tourists are spared the sight of the wretchedly under serviced neighborhoods outside of town that are home to the army of service maintenance and construction workers whose starting salary ranges from 180 to 420 per month for a six day week one can imagine how far that goes in a city dominated by international tourism since the beginning of the tourist boom in the 1980s mexico s caribbean coast has suffered tragic devastation of thousands of acres of virgin jungle and mangroves accompanied by the dispossession of lands of mostly indigenous farmers and the privatization of once mangrove rich pristine beach areas now converted into exclusive playgrounds for tourists the companies making the most profit are big hotel groups like the spanish based transnational corporations barcelo and palladium and construction companies like obrascon huarte and lain even without the maya train bringing four million new tourists a year to the area the sustainability of the coastal area is endangered by polluted beaches reefs destroyed by wastewater and sewage sargassum algae and polluted groundwater one third of the planned railroad route traverses tropical forests that are home to one of the few remaining sites of extraordinary biodiversity in the world including the calakmul biosphere reserve mexico s largest tropical forest reserve and one of the last pristine rainforests left in mesoamerica believed to contribute significantly to oxygen production in the northern hemisphere aside from the vast range of diverse plants and animals the area supports numerous indigenous farming communities and contains thousands of ancient mayan structures in coastal areas the train will pass next to the mangrove rich bacalar lagoon already compromised by tourist establishments mexico has among the most mangroves in the world but they are disappearing at the fastest rate victor lichtinger mexico s former secretary of the environment notes once penetrated by the train however the inevitable consequence will be development at the expense of nature other opponents of the development including 100 researchers and academics from the yucatán peninsula have written a letter to amlo arguing that the interruption of biological corridors will cause the reduction and extinction of vulnerable species the zapatistas and other indigenous groups in the southeast of mexico who adhere to the principles of autonomy self government and protection of the environment as part of the defense of their lands and territory have vowed to fight against the maya train death project which they claim will sound the death knell for the environment and therefore for their communities that have thus far survived 500 years of colonialism and extractivism indigenous organizers have claimed with good reason given the historical record that this project sets the stage for future extractive megaprojects which transnational companies are chomping at the bit to initiate as it provides critical infrastructure that will facilitate their access to these areas dos bocas refinery in july 2018 after amlo s election but before his inauguration the president announced he was going to build the dos bocas oil refinery on the gulf coast in his home state of tabasco the refinery has been held up for years due to legal challenges based on environmental impact reports amlo s administration uses a familiar argument the refinery will guarantee mexico s energy independence as a principle of national security by october a shady company contracted by pemex petróleos de mexico the state owned petroleum company had deforested 230 hectares of mangrove forest rain forest and agricultural lands previously used to cultivate mangoes and coconuts after amlo came to power a six year old environmental impact statement for a completely different project was dusted off to justify green lighting the refinery s construction in march the energy minister rocío nahle announced that five transnational corporations had been invited to bid for the construction of the refinery but on december 9 the initiation ceremony marking the first day of construction had to be moved to another site due to flooding of the construction site fernando alvarez noguera a biologist specializing in mangrove forests was not surprised he had repeatedly warned that the destruction of mangroves would lead to flooding he also explained that the refinery pollution would affect the health of the local population and that waste from the refinery would endanger oyster production in the area asea the environmental agency in charge of protecting the environment from activities of the oil industry rejected the phony environmental impact report and fined the company in charge of the works over 700 000 for illegal deforestation trans isthmus corridor amlo has also announced the revival of a decades old project to build an industrial corridor across the isthmus of tehuantepec the trans isthmus corridor a dry canal joining the pacific ocean to the gulf of mexico would presumably compete with the panama canal for cross continental traffic it has been proposed under different names and scrapped over the decades by previous administrations like the maya train this project would traverse some of the country s most important tropical forests and jungles containing great biodiversity and home to over 500 indigenous communities the area also contains the largest lagoon system on the mexican pacific the industrial corridor would sever a major biological corridor for fauna and flora of north and south america people of the region are opposed to the industrial corridor which involves building maquiladoras manufacturing plants that import and assemble duty free components for export and usually rely on cheap labor and relaxed labor and environmental laws and new mining and fracking projects all of which tap into the scarce water resources in the region a coalition of 50 organizations composed of indigenous groups defending land and territory as well as other farmers ecologists and unions signed a declaration directed at amlo rejecting the megaproject they claim the corridor is a continuation of the projects of death driven by neoliberalism and will cause dispossession of land and water environmental damage criminality and a threat to national sovereignty as well as violence against indigenous people furthermore they fear that the project will lead to the militarization of the area under the newly created national guard fears that the megaproject will devastate local communities are based on what has transpired with similar development projects in the isthmus recently under the green energy promotion of the previous administration vast windmill farms were built across the windy flatlands of the isthmus accompanied by promises of development and increased well being for the population which is majority indigenous and dependent on agriculture and fishing the concrete bases of the more than 1 600 wind turbines have severely disrupted the underground water flows of nearly 18 000 hectares of agricultural land the wind farms have had a devastating effect on the ecology and forms of life of the people who inhabit the area despite promises that they could continue to farm their lands fences and security guards protecting the turbines prevent farmers from moving freely the turbines leak oil into the soil and sometimes ignite there are concerns that the windmills have affected the rainfall patterns in the area and many people have suffered mental problems from the incessant noise of the turbines the communities have suffered these and many other negative effects in order to provide electricity for export and to provide cheaper electricity to transnational corporations walmart bimbo the world s largest food processing corporation grupo mexico and penoles two of latin america s largest mineral extraction and processing companies are investors in the wind farms as well as recipients of the electricity produced none of the electricity generated by the wind farms serves the local communities meanwhile the cost of electricity has skyrocketed in the small local communities which use tiny amounts of it in their homes people resisting the trans isthmus corridor understand the consequences of the project but they are derided by government officials and corporate spokespeople who dismiss them as backward and incapable of understanding the benefits of modern technology plan integral morelos in 2009 the mexican government approved the plan integral morelos pim granting construction contracts to transnational corporations for the construction of two massive thermal power plants fueled by a 160 kilometer long natural gas pipeline part of which would run along the slopes of the active popocatépetl volcano the plan was devised without consulting the local indigenous communities whose lands were affected this is a violation of mexican law and international agreements mexico is a signatory of international labour organization convention 169 which protects indigenous lands the pipeline was to cross 60 communities in three states morelos puebla tlaxcala including sacred indigenous sites and thousands of hectares of agricultural land the plan included an aqueduct to divert 50 million liters of water daily from the cuautla river to cool the turbines it is water that local communities depend on but it would be dumped back into the river after treatment more than 900 000 people were affected by these plans including 50 000 indigenous people from 37 tribes many of whom make a living growing corn beans squash and tomatoes and raising cattle and pigs aside from dispossession destruction of agricultural lands and contamination of waterways the pipeline poses an additional risk of explosions due to volcanic activity for 10 years local communities carried out legal challenges meetings direct actions blocking construction sites they successfully obstructed the construction and prevented the plants from opening while on the campaign trail in 2014 amlo visited the area and vowed to cancel the project promises that garnered him votes in the area but within weeks of his inauguration he announced his intention to approve the project pending consultations mandated by mexican law the hastily organized referenda took place on february 23 and 24 they went in favor of the government s proposals but were widely criticized for among other things providing false information on the project and preventing environmentalists and local resisters from supplying information to voters the visiting representative on indigenous affairs to the un noted that amlo s consultations do not fulfill the obligations of mexico under international law that protects indigenous groups she warned the government the indigenous consultation should not be understood as a simple process of socialization on decisions previously taken by the state the indigenous asamblea permanente de los pueblos de morelos appm many of whose members supported amlo in his three attempts to get elected for president published a declaration against plan integral morelos invoking the 20 000 inhabitants of morelos who voted against the power plant a few days before amlo s contested consultations local activist samir flores a member of the appm was gunned down in front of his house the day before flores had publicly denounced the pim in an effort to convince the government to cancel the project local and national groups who form part of a network of defenders of land and territory blame the murder on government s tacit support of armed groups and the lack of will to investigate what they consider to be a political murder designed to intimidate their resistance efforts lopez obrador even more of the same three of the projects described here are unfolding in the very parts of the country where indigenous forms of life are the strongest and where resistance to megaprojects is vocal and organized the amlo government like so many others before it is throwing this population under the bus of capitalist development for those organizing resistance to the megaprojects of death as the opponents call them the situation feels more and more like a war against the people especially with the creation of amlo s new military apparatus the national guard amlo plans to deploy the national guard in every town throughout the country supposedly to aid in the fight against crime and corruption but it is under the command of an active military person and composed of current members of the military police the marine police and the federal police as almost everyone in mexico is aware these are the same corrupt organizations that protect the narco criminals and the paramilitaries who in turn protect and support the capitalist extractive interests mexican military and police are notorious for the murder of civilians and the widespread abuse of human rights for an excellent in depth analysis of the role of policing and militarization in the rise of narco criminality and its repressive effect on indigenous organizing against megaprojects see dawn paley s drug war capitalism indigenous groups active in the defense of the land and their territories know full well the national guard will inevitably serve to dispossess communities of their lands and to support the megaprojects recently zapatista territory one of the few areas in the world where anti capitalist movement has succeeded in establishing autonomous territories has experienced a rise in aggression by the military the police and the narcos including frequent flyovers by armed planes and military helicopters the zapatistas and the national indigenous congress have denounced the rising militarization of chiapas and called for a complete withdrawal of the army especially from zapatista territory in light of this record only a few months into his presidency amlo can no longer in good faith be held up as any kind of ally in the struggle against neoliberalism instead we must add our voices to the many in mexico who are fighting against the forces of capitalism and modern day settler colonialism as they resist the devastation of territories and ways of life that hold important

amazon s growth and strategic centrality to contemporary capital presents a unique opportunity for a resurgent labor militancy and a socialist political vision after working at amazon for nearly two years it is abundantly clear that successful organizing will require class conscious militants leading their coworkers neighbors and comrades into sustained struggle to bring dignity respect and better material conditions for the class as a whole the methods used by our unions and current left movements while best intentioned are not capable of building this movement instead we must ask ourselves what kind of organizational forms are capable of organizing the class rather than the shop how can we reimagine and historically reflect upon what unions can do to build a new wave of workplace militancy today why amazon within the circuits of contemporary capital amazon is a strategic fulcrum in an era marked by the concentration and centralization of capital into monopolies amazon is at the forefront accumulating vast surplus value through its control over a growing spread of industries organizing a union at amazon could allow workers to push forward radical demands that are not possible in less profitable industries unlike other major technology monopolies like facebook google and apple amazon depends on extensive investment in fixed capital infrastructure to build its fulfillment network employing hundreds of thousands of workers to make money due to amazon s dependence on maintaining proximity to urban markets in order to deliver in shorter delivery times amazon jobs are not susceptible to offshoring giving workers an opportunity to build power due to the greater interlinking between production and distribution through just in time supply chains strikes at amazon carry ripple effects across the economy increasing the structural power of amazon workers relative to other workers as a result of their position in the social division of labour as a company that expropriates surplus value from the exploitation of skilled and deskilled workers alike there is potential for uniting vast layers of the working class into a more unified movement through the articulation of shared demands finally as a technology company organizing a union at amazon could get at the heart of thorny questions around automation and the social use of technology leveraging demands that seek to leverage technological change to free people from work rather than further enslave them as appendages of the machine it is not just the strategic aspects of organizing a union at amazon that are important amazon workers feel the full brunt of capital s boot bearing down on their back this is experienced in two interlocking ways and can best be seen through ongoing workers inquiry into changes in the technical and social spatial composition of the working class predominantly employed within amazon fulfillment centers from the perspective of capital retail and logistics work is central money invested into commodity production is not realized until the sale of the item transportation time figures crucially in the cycle of capital accumulation the lower the amount of time between the production and the sale of a commodity the quicker capital can be realized into money in its cash form getting commodities to market faster and to customers earlier becomes a crucial area of capital investment with the means of transportation and movement of goods increasingly organized along industrial lines to increase the rate of exploitation amazon as a merchant capitalist earns a portion of its profit from the investment of capital into the new organizational methods and technologies for the circulation and realization of commodities thus lowering the circulation time relative to competitors and increasing market share through the development of fulfillment centers amazon centralizes the labor of retail workers into the factory form developing the standard for industrial retail where retail workers were once dispersed across a broad range of retail stores in a variety of warehouse driving and customer centric roles amazon is a centripetal force by drawing workers into the factory form for the picking packing sorting and delivery of commodities amazon management is extending tighter surveillance and control over the production process this increases the rate of exploitation within the retail sector with capitalists reaping substantial gains through augmenting the extraction of surplus value by reorganizing retail into the factory form amazon takes what were once geographically dispersed workers and concentrates them into a smaller subset of workplaces outside of most major cities in growing logistics and light manufacturing clusters amazon is building a suite of fulfillment and sortation centers that can employ over 6 000 workers for most mid size cities in larger logistics clusters such as the inland empire east of la the suburbs around houston northern kentucky suburban chicago and suburban new jersey this number can be far higher cumulatively amazon is now the second largest employer in the united states this concentration of workers also drives the socialization of workers in new ways opening avenues for shared experiences of exploitation and domination under the boot of capital from the perspective of the worker engaged in commodity production amazon is a persistent dehumanizing attack in his book on new terrain kim moody argues that it is the intensification of work through increases in the rate of exploitation that is the defining feature of contemporary work amazon fulfillment centers are at the forefront of this change workers must reach punishingly high rates with each act measured for efficiency and quality the impacts of this process on human bodies and minds is horrific joint pain carpal tunnel blown backs anxiety and depression are all common aspects of the work the systematic devaluing of human bodies extends beyond rate into the intensity of management surveillance the mental pressure of achieving unattainable goals cutting safety corners on a regular basis sexism ageism racism xenophobia and religious intolerance all regular day to day experiences of work in hundreds of conversations with coworkers a frequent refrain of why they hate amazon is that they don t feel like a human being and feel like a cog in the machine while the rate of exploitation increases surplus value appropriated by the capitalist class wages remain stagnant relative to other warehouse work amazon wages tend to be substantially less instead promising workers benefit packages such as stock options or tuition help which often cannot be claimed until after 2 years of work with natural turnover people leaving at 2 a week and firing discipline common for fulfillment workers few ever realize these gains instead social wealth gained through the intensification of work is being captured predominantly by jeff bezos the richest man in modern history as well as the managerial class and higher skilled workers within the working class further amazon is at the center of the massive reorganization of urban life that demographers are calling the suburbanization of poverty with corporate campuses amazon s location in downtown seattle was one of the first and a leader in this trend and higher paid members of the working class increasingly moving into urban centers gentrification and the high price of housing are driving low wage workers into the suburbs further due to high rents and chain based migration immigrants increasingly move directly into suburban communities skipping the urban core altogether these communities are increasingly home to large amount of light industrial and warehouse work with amazon often a central employer in the region despite democrats and republicans alike offering expansive tax breaks for amazon fulfillment centers amazon s impact on local labor markets is marked by the downward trend of wages as amazon lowers standards in the warehousing industry and outcompetes many retail competitors that often have higher levels of union density this inversion of urban life operates to decompose the political composition of the working class through the loss of solidarity and communal relationships as entire communities are displaced into new working class suburbs the social composition of working class suburbs is marked by historical layers of demographic transition the first layer are white flight communities white flight is also heavily textured by class differences with petit bourgeois and higher earning workers living in completely different suburbs than members of the lower and middle layers it is into the highly politicized white working class suburbs that a new layer of working class people of color and immigrants are now calling home these layers often mix like oil and water in social and community life but in rental buildings and workplaces alike these groups are increasingly living shared material experiences of exploitation and domination many assume housing to be relatively cheap within the suburbs but this is often not the case still connected to the urban land rents suburban houses and apartment complexes are increasingly being purchased by private equity groups who are pursuing a suburban housing strategy to gouge workers through steep rent hikes a common phenomena is the purchasing of larger suburban complexes within a neighborhood putting up a fresh layer of paint and doubling the rents the market power of large complexes lifts the rent for other buildings thus driving rents skyward while a handful of private equity firms are raking in billions these buildings often have proxy landlords who refuse to invest or manage the property leading to substantial building code violations general building decay and feelings of insecurity despite high rents further as studies on the suburbanization of poverty indicate rapid demographic transition has not been met with rapid transitions in social services for the poor public transit built on a radial model is horrific for suburb to suburb commutes what takes 15 minutes to drive takes 2 hours by bus with poor service for those working overnight or weekend shifts an experience far more common in just in time logistics industries than urban centers subsidized housing charitable organizations basic progressive labor standards and policy victories won by democrat dominated cities rarely extend to the suburbs these lack of basic services for the poor are compounded by criminally expensive child care which further reproduces patriarchal social relations through the brunt of unpaid reproductive labor falling on women underfunded urban services for things as basic as sewer trash and water and often poorer environmental standards due to colocation with polluting industrial and logistics centers the divides within the working class are persistent networks of solidarity are largely isolated within the family or the ethnic immigrant networks and organized on an informal basis most workers depend on these networks of solidarity to live on oppressively small wages and to meet social needs in practice this looks like children living at home at times in conditions that perpetuate oppressive relations inside the family of abuse leave the house or speak up against an abusive parent and that means homelessness dependence on churches and faith based institutions that often lack an active political orientation or overcrowding of multiple families into homes to make ends meet these divides permeate into the workplace cross ethnic or multi racial solidarity are rare and sexism racism ageism and homophobia common despite these differences workers are increasingly experiencing the boot of capital and the capitalist state directly on their necks dehumanization and the commodification of daily life is an everyday reality so while the technical and social composition of the working class within these suburbs points towards militant collective action based on material conditions the lack of trust solidarity and socialization within the class hinders the development of the class for itself as a political entity further rather than transform working conditions at a single employer workers are constantly on the move to slightly better or different work conditions choosing to leave rather than build power in a single workplace further weakens the power of the class displacing the responsibility for better economic conditions on the individual seller of labor power this precludes any movement towards building sustained solidarity further weakening the development of a class for itself to conclude it is clear from sustained inquiry that workers have a deep experiential understanding of capitalist oppression and domination but often lack the political organization to leverage their collective power while many recognize that we are stronger together and that there are more of us than of them trust and solidarity is often organized along familial friendship religious or ethnic lines thus fragmenting the class second most workers have not engaged in meaningful direct action in workplaces or tenant buildings therefore remaining skeptical that collective action can solve any immediate problems the failure of our unions and the left labor unions have largely failed to organize density within the private sector with union density reaching a 70 year nadir while criticism can be extensive and scathing for why business unions fail i want to focus on strategies taken by most active organizing unions teamsters ufcw uh uaw and seiu come most to mind in organizing in the low wage logistics and retail work on a shop by shop basis first we must start with how workers largely experience unions for most workers unions are service based institutions that exist to serve workers rather than as institutions built by workers to meet their material needs through strategic collective action most unions lack a strong internal culture of organizing which dampens not only the possibility of direct action mutual aid and solidarity at the workplace but also fails to cultivate working class members as a whole most importantly unions are localized to shops or employers that have a contract which as a whole is a minimal part of the labor market leave a union shop and the union is no longer part of your life alternative labor institutions like worker centers and tenant unions rarely offer more than bare minimum legal protection and workers rights enforcement and are often so backlogged with even upholding basic labor standards that more progressive desires such as external organizing or worker education are near impossible without developing dues based membership and active social participation they too fall under a similar service based model where unions do things for workers rather than helping workers come together to solve their immediate problems through direct action and mutual aid an internal democratic structure is often entirely missing instead replaced by staff members funded through grants or sponsoring unions when it comes to organizing new workers unions have been struggling to develop successful campaigns organizing in low wage work means confronting what ufcw organizers term the service workers lament that workers would rather change jobs rather than stay at a single job and do the long term work of building power with coworkers this poses a significant problem for organizers when attempting to build union power within these industries unitehere organizers some of the most successful at organizing the unorganized often argue a campaign s success depends on pre existing solidarity and friendship amongst co workers when these networks are most stable workers are more willing to move into struggle together largely because they trust each other through the use of active salting programs to identify leaders and map these social relationships unions seek to actively rely on naturally existing networks of workers to then drive a union campaign forward in conditions where pre existing solidarity is weak due to a variety of factors such as size or turnover the union struggles to build power when organizing is based in a single shop this turnover can prove fatal requiring restarting campaigns with great frequency to summarize successful organizing often relies fundamentally on solidarity and trust as a basis for direct action however these preconditions are rarely given especially in industries with high turnover instead of recognizing the need to cultivate solidarity outside of immediate campaigns usually when a shop is facing a contract unions largely neglect ongoing solidarity based organizing activity from their organizational mandate this has several consequences the first is the ongoing dependence on staff to organize workers through staff drive mobilizing campaigns rather than workers organizing each other while there are exceptions to this rule staff led organizing is increasingly common it is the union that organizes workers rather than workers that organize a union a second is that union staff attempt to develop power for their membership through alternative means than direct action on the shop floor or cultivating an orientation to internal cultural and social organization in her conceptual approach to understanding labor strategy jane mcalevey typifies these approaches as mobilization based approaches these strategies vary but a common tendency is the need to gain the sympathy of various powerful elites or external stakeholders to then put pressure on the target company a consequence is a constant external focus on messaging that resonates sympathetically with a general public or elite group of stakeholders this method requires hand selecting worker leaders who can fit the political messaging of the union strategists using these voices to build some level of sympathy amongst liberals of poor conditions by appealing to liberal interests and use this sympathy to pass legislation forward or pressure companies to lift conditions or refuse entry of a bad employer into an area with higher union density this shortcut method while arguably raising conditions ultimately limits the power of workers by failing to build real solidarity amongst the class based in empathy failing to help workers recognize their power through direct action and failing to cultivate militant leadership in other terms it fails workers in making the leap from a class in itself to a class for itself when it comes to organizing a campaign around amazon these methods are predictable but doomed to fail given the high levels of turnover organizing a representative organizing committee is long work and requires sustained direct action and solidarity however with such high turnover any attempt to organize workers on the shop basis alone would prove fatal a strategy that leverages workers stories to bash the company s image in conjunction with minimally backed campaign strategies to lift conditions for amazon workers through policy or extract concessions from the company is the best this style of campaign could hope for pushing whole worker organizing the question then poses itself what kind of union may be necessary to start organizing the class rather than the shop in working class suburbs we would put forth the idea of regional worker and tenant leagues or associations dues based membership organizations that attempt to build worker and tenant power into a single organization on a regional basis these organizations would have to work on two main axes 1 direct action against the capitalist class in areas where exploitation and domination are daily felt and 2 developing community through mutual aid and cultural social forms these ideas are currently being articulated through the leadership of the base building tendency in the left although there is significant historical precedent the base building tendency is currently being best articulated through left tendencies within socialist political formations in the united states and is based on the idea that a mass workers movement must be built through forming worker led counter institutions capable of directly confronting capitalists where the ruling class appropriates and accumulates social wealth the first would be the development of direct political fights aimed at the capitalist class rather than electoral strategies driven by effective messaging and strategic union heads new unions must be based in direct action that builds working class experience develops new militants and makes clear the axes of oppression two key areas for developing these fights are in areas where workers experience oppression and exploitation on a day to day basis two axes are particularly important here workplaces and rental complexes both workplaces and rental complexes are sites where workers from diverse ethnic and social backgrounds already congregate workplaces and rental complexes already drive the socialization of the working class however unity among members is precluded unless they are engaged in a strategic fight where all members have self interest in collective struggle trump supporting white folks are neighbors and coworkers with undocumented immigrants migrants from east asia and africa and folks of color to combat high rents and low wages unity must be built across these groups overcoming the strong social and cultural differences currently segmenting and dividing the working class will only emerge through struggle against these common sources of oppression workplaces and rental complexes as entities that drive the socialization of the class while also being spaces where victories lead to economic gains for the class and the organization are essential spaces for building power struggle must be the forge of unity seeing self interest in fighting a shared oppressor requires overcoming bigotry for solidarity is necessary for the trust to enter into struggle with others any organizing will have to following the communist organizer william z foster walk on two legs recognizing the specific grievances of workers along difference but also seeking to aggressively foster unity understanding compassion and forgiveness as grounds for building a political class for itself these campaigns against landlords and employers should be based in direct action here organizing techniques and skills should be taught to all who are interested whereby workers can then carry skills learned in struggle with them as they move from workplace to workplace and rental building to building cultivating an organizing spirit across the diverse spaces of exploitation through which workers move cultivating leaders and a spirit around building workplace power could develop into successful campaigns in smaller shops and into longer term minority unionism in large shops such as amazon where any form of recognition will be fought for tooth and nail regional organizing then builds power amongst the class as a whole rather than a shop alone it is only once the working class starts composing itself into a political class for itself that the working class will develop its own leaders capable of leading an onslaught against capital a second axis would be based in driving the socialization of the working class through cultural social activity and mutual aid in other words the socialization of the working class by building true solidarity the idea of whole worker organizing is receiving a resurgence with the works of jane mcalevey and other left unionists whole worker organizing has largely meant the development of strategic political campaigns in spaces of production and reproduction however mike davis historical and theoretical analysis on class formation in old gods new enigmas points towards the vast cultural and social public sphere created by left institutions he argues that the cultural and social sphere within socialist communities became embodied in well organized counter cultures that projected the solidarities of the workplace and neighborhood into all aspects of recreation education and culture shockingly missing from today s socialist movement but certainly a central part of the strategies of the right these must be reprioritized today these range from philosophy reading groups outdoors clubs poetry groups choruses sporting teams botanical societies and the like we can imagine plays put on by workers that reflect their everyday lives botanical gardens that reclaim suburban space for beauty yoga and meditation groups the help bring mindfulness and calm and hiking clubs that bring the outdoors to those who rarely experience it while workers are already doing these things they are often doing them within the confines of capitalist run institutions where these desires are commodified for the accumulation of profit and where a political ideology is limited to consumer choice we must help leaders develop and organize these groups democratically and value them as politically important work organizing clubs helps inculcate leaders facilitates greater organizational capacity and allows for experimentation in new ways of building collectives as davis argues these institutions democratically run have formed the basis of working class unity providing a space for new cultural and social forms to emerge shaping the public sphere based in the ideas and energies of the working class it also meets workers where they already are within their current lives there is a real desire to further the socialization already in progress through workplaces and to build real community based in sharing interpersonal space as organizations get bigger the chance to find and develop meaningful friendships and relationships increases which is joyful while also allowing folks to learn to be together develop empathy and recognize shared interest despite interpersonal differences additionally forms of mutual aid to meet needs not currently met by employers or the state could be essential to building unity working class organization and institutional legitimacy ensuring food at meetings through communal kitchens producing spaces for addressing mental health through group dialogue meeting real education needs through english lessons and basic computer literacy and political education to help workers analyze their own experiences are some examples that can be volunteer driven and member run more ambitiously and certainly most important are the organization of child care circles helping working mothers self organize childcare the burden of childcare punishes the working class as a whole developing tools to further socialize reproductive labor opens up more time to be together and to be actively engaged in strategic and organizing work organizing programming that seeks to build across social difference is particularly important including cross cultural exchanges that builds trust across currently siloed ethnic based groups ages and genders both mutual aid and cultural organizations are based in producing community and via community solidarity and trust while this will not be a panacea for current atomization and alienation within the working class being together and engaging in meaningful work while also having fun together is healing importantly the organizations we seek to build must bring joy they must fulfill our need to be in common and extend and expand our capacities through our being in common a socialist movement must be based in love and care and can t be based in ongoing struggle alone in a more pragmatic sense these organizational forms are mutually reinforcing the lived experience of a workers association that builds true community makes the union part of everyday life it brings real value to workers and helps meet current emotional and material needs dues based membership of such an association becomes a willing contribution rather than a resentful deduction however mutual aid and social cultural work alone is insufficient and ultimately unsustainable without extracting real material gains for the working class mutual aid work must be bolstered through economic power through organizing at workplaces and in rental complexes workers are able to reappropriate material wealth from the capitalist class therefore increasing funding in the institutions they build solidarity based unionism based in direct action mutual aid and community building should be seen as a particular strategy given current material conditions currently marked by high levels of atomization and division within the working class and the full domination of our cultural social and economic institutions by the capitalist class these institutions can be a launching ground for more robust industrial organizing strategies that seek to leverage multiple points of structural power to help realize worker demands building a union at amazon can t be done on the shop alone a union at amazon will be the product of organizing the class down to the neighborhood level and engaging the full person in their political social and cultural life our fights must be fueled by the will to be in common to ultimately work less to be together more and to fully augment our capacities as living collective beings let s build organizations that put this reality at the heart of our efforts for this reason we could imagine the slogan be together fight the power

politicians often like lower interest rates because they can give the economy a lift shoring up voter support but economists say politicized central banks lead to high levels of inflation and erodes trust among investors and creditors trump has nevertheless stepped up pressure on the federal reserve and its chairman jerome powell in recent weeks as his trade policies threaten to hurt the american economy view markets insider s homepage for more stories advertisement in the early 1970s president richard nixon handily won another term in the white house after pressuring his federal reserve chairman to keep interest rates low there was a catch though the american economy entered a decade of turbulence plagued by periods of double digit inflation that cautionary tale has long served to keep those in the oval office publicly mum on monetary policy until recently for evidence of that consider what president donald trump has done in the last year alone he s pressured the fed to slash interest rates reportedly sought to remove central bank chief jerome powell and attempted to install political loyalists on its policymaking board not to mention his ever active twitter account his preferred vessel for delivering stinging messages to the fed specifically powell advertisement the fed interest rate way too high added to ridiculous quantitative tightening trump wrote on twitter in early june they don t have a clue why trump and other politicians favor lower rates politicians often like lower interest rates because it means an expanded money supply that gives people and corporations more purchasing and spending power which gives the economy a lift that in turn shores up voter support on the flipside if the economy is overheating and inflation is threatening to run away the fed will raise rates and constrict the money supply this is what trump is hoping to avoid heading into 2020 even if it s not necessarily the best outcome for the economy at large a bonus just for you click here to claim 30 days of access to business insider prime advertisement but economists say politicized central banks lead to high levels of inflation and eventually erode trust among investors and creditors related stories mr trump has been attacking the fed s actions with more vitriol than any previous president in memory steven rattner a wall street financier who was an obama administration adviser wrote in a recent new york times op ed we need to guard the independence of the central bank the most important government institution that has not been divided by the deep partisanship so evident elsewhere trump continues to butt heads with powell and the fed trump has nevertheless stepped up broadsides on the central bank in recent weeks as his trade policies threaten to hurt the american economy he has even suggested powell and his fellow officials should wield monetary policy to gain leverage in those disputes which have dimmed outlooks for growth at home and elsewhere they devalue their currency they have for years trump said of china in a cnbc interview this month it s put them at a tremendous competitive advantage and we don t have that advantage because we have a fed that doesn t lower interest rates advertisement powell and the fed defied those calls to a degree at the end of a two day policy meeting wednesday but still softened language and signaled trump will get the rate cut he so desires in july that was reflected in its so called dot plot which showed policymakers were split on projections for the year read more the fed just quietly acknowledged that it made a policy blunder last year and escalated the stakes for investors as the next recession looms eight individuals saw at least one cut in 2019 while others thought policy should remain the same or even be tightened aside from below target inflation readings and uncertainty caused by trade tensions many aspects of the economy have held up better than expected a rate cut now would give the perception that it was succumbing to pressure from the white house and enabling trump s trade war said kenneth kuttner a williams college economist and former federal reserve staffer on the other hand standing pat on principle would provoke intensified wrath and potentially delay what would might otherwise be an appropriate response to weakening economic conditions advertisement the market impact of this prolonged battle for the time being trump appears to be winning his battle of wills with powell and the fed and he s getting a little help from both the stock and bond markets which have been increasingly pricing in the possibility of rate cuts in fact stocks reached a new record high last thursday a day after the fomc s latest statement economists surveyed by bloomberg now think with 100 certainty that the fed will cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points at the july 31 meeting the stock market situation is ultimately a tricky one for powell whose hawkish comments in late december 2018 sparked the biggest equity sell off in months and nearly ended the 10 year bull market the fed chair quickly capitulated in early january setting stocks back on a record setting trajectory considering the fed is supposed to be an independent body the fact that stock investors appeared to wield so much influence struck some experts as odd advertisement as it stands the federal reserve s reputation as an independent institution is most at risk with casual observers according to josh wright the chief economist at icims a recruiting software company they see the headlines but they re not picking through the legal arguments about precisely what kind of authority different officials have nor are they picking through the fed s analyses and arguments to determine whether and to what extent its policies are being influenced by politicians he said the risk is that over time that erosion spreads
on may 3rd i wrote an article covering united states steel s nyse x earnings release back then i advised traders to stay away despite a strong earnings beat thanks to higher shipments and better pricing in this article i am going to update my call and tell you why the stock continues to be in a very tricky and dangerous spot this never has been a stock to toy around with especially not given that economic fundamentals have caused the company to come in with weak q2 guidance and bad news regarding steel production source united states steel this could be the next step before i go any further let me quickly tell you why it matters so much to me to discuss united states steel the company is one of the oldest and largest steel producers of the us and one of the most cyclical stocks on the market this stock is one of the most rewarding tools to trade economic trends if done properly unfortunately as i will further discuss in this article we are in the midst of an economic slowdown after the most recent post earnings one day rally the stock declined more than 30 and has recovered 23 since the bottom on the 31st of may a lot has changed between since the start of may let s start with the most important news which more or less applies to the entire economy the graph below was used in my previous article it shows the comparison between the ism manufacturing index and the us steel stock price the ism manufacturing index is one of the most important economic leading indicators which shows why us steel has no chance to rally without support from economic expectations us steel is even so cyclical that all it needs to push this stock lower is the chance of peaking economic growth as the stock went down way before the ism index started to fall source tradingview unfortunately my growth slowing call is entering the next stage as the first regional manufacturing surveys for the month of june are coming in well below expectations both the empire state and philadelphia manufacturing surveys declined way more than expected and are currently implying an ism index below 50 0 as you can see below it is starting to look a lot like 2015 when economic momentum started to accelerate to the downside this is impacting not only the stock price but also the company s guidance in a recently published second quarter outlook the company forecasted lower than expected second quarter profits and said it was idling three furnaces two furnaces in the us and one in europe q2 adjusted earnings are expected to come in at 0 40 per share which is below 0 51 analysts were looking for flat rolled steel adjusted ebitda is expected to be negatively impacted by falling steel prices and softening market demand also shipments are expected to be lower due to flooding in the southern united states the great lakes b2 blast furnace is expected to remain idled after the completion of current planned outages the company will also temporarily idle the south blast furnace the idling of a blast furnace in europe is the result of increasing level of steel imports and continued market headwinds related to raw material costs and demand all the company can do at this point is to further focus on its efficiency measures as the company has no way of dealing with external steel demand and input inflation that s the hard reality of macro factors while market conditions have softened we remain focused on executing the value creation strategy that is underway we believe that the investments being made to improve costs and expand product capabilities will create a more differentiated and agile company combining our competitive advantages with state of the art sustainable steel technology to create long term value for our stockholders customers and employees while the stock went up immediately after the bad news the stock is currently down 4 1 on a day when the market continues to rip higher 06 20 along with basic materials note that this is happening on another bad day for the us dollar which is generally speaking quite good for domestic steel producers a lower dollar can be seen as an unofficial tariff as it makes exporting steel to the us more expensive source finviz and speaking of the dollar i will be watching it closely as i expect this to be the part of a major bull case for us steel all we need is a further dollar decline and an economic bottom to get a 2016 style recovery unfortunately at this point it seems like we are still in a 2015 like situation where economic growth has not yet bottomed extra if you want to know all details about my dollar thesis i highly recommend you to spend a few minutes reading this article all things considered us steel is not yet out of the woods as economic growth has more than likely entered the next stage of the slow down if regional indicators are right growth slowing could very soon turn into real contraction us steel is already taking measures by idling furnaces in both the us and europe due to falling demand i expect the stock price to continue to be a volatile casino and i won t be buying until i see signs of an economic bottom at that point i will start buying this stock aggressively until then i think it s best to stay on the sidelines stay tuned thank you very much for reading my article feel free to click on the like button and don t forget to share your opinion in

finance is fundamental to the fabric of the domestic economy and its businesses though for much of the time in india it has been swaying to the global trends if it s the socialism and the overreach of the state in 1970s that dominated for nearly two decades thereafter when reforms were introduced in the 1990s it was a major turn towards washington consensus of free markets that became a pivot a comprehensive and consistent policy that was primarily meeting the needs of india in accordance with its basic structure conditions constraints and requirement was however best found only in parts and patches indian finance transitioned from excessive state ownership and control with a plain vanilla system version 1 0 to the state taking a step back to allow more of private and foreign participation version 2 0 that also spawned multi asset classes and alternative markets while issues in allocative efficiency and financial repression were the worries in version 1 0 the next one has brought its fair share of disconnects it s not just the surge of bank npas non performing assets that is scandalous between 2007 and 2018 considered as peak for finance domestic credit gdp ratio barely moved from 61 per cent to 72 per cent bank capital ratios remained below the global benchmarks and deposits and credit grew at an average annual rate of 14 per cent each not exhilarating enough for a vast economy like india governance issues found in some top banks dented the image further imperfections prevailed on the market side too where the private sector tends to raise much of its debt in the private placement window and lack of progress in developing a vibrant corporate bond market the benchmark stock index doubled with not much change in the market capitalisation notional value traded in equity derivatives grew to an unusual high of 32 trillion in 2018 with just one product where punters take positions in nifty fifty index options accounting for 85 per cent against 1 trillion in the cash market only half of the listed stocks come up for trading raising new capital which is the main domain of stock markets too remained subdued during 2006 16 india could manage to raise 46 billion against china s 570 billion and a start up market like vietnam s 26 billion india s sme capital markets reported a mere 1 6 billion market cap in 2018 far lower than the new kid on the block hanoi s 38 billion value traded at 351 million looks far too less against the 7 billion traded in malaysia and 1 trillion in korea growing delinquency of the nbfcs corporate distress pushing mutual funds to delay redemption of fixed maturity plans shortcomings in ratings quality impending corporate stress from external debt becoming due for repayment are further threats looming large a well crafted plan needed all of these make it imperative for india to overhaul its financial system a well crafted plan with a long term perspective and mechanism for effective monitoring and evaluation are vital measures like privatisation of public sector banks at best could be a minor relief rather than a lasting solution a few developments that india needs to track and absorb in its internal dynamics while planning for the future could include rising inequalities in income and earnings globally rise of global value chains and the prospects for surge in corporate economic power declining productivity and stagnation in labour wages rising indebtedness at the corporate and individual levels decelerating trends in global economic growth competing for a dominant share in the shift of global economic power emergence of newer endeavours of economic cooperation such as belt and road initiative restrictions in labour mobility and growing tensions and disputes in world trade apart from political determination and foresightedness a comprehensive and an efficient financial system could come handy in addressing the challenges that emerge from time to time within finance faster pace of developments in fintech and the newer range of technologies need to be managed better to balance the priorities of the geographic divide in addition there could be dramatic changes in the ecosystem of the economy the way businesses are conducted the jobs that they create and the way they are performed along with changing lifestyles of the people in all of which finance will have an important bearing perhaps it s time to do some sketches on the drawing board to begin with revive psbs and make the group into a distinct national brand of banking that stands for efficient and transparent banking as also that shows care and concern towards the society at large its not such a daunting task as not very long ago psbs were major suppliers of money as also hubs for talent and skills for numerous emerging markets leave alone the strong counter cyclical role in providing credit during episodes of slowdown a complete relook at its structure management and engagement is what could revive psbs and make its presence meaningful continuous evaluation equally pertinent is to bring back development banking much of china s development process has largely been driven by institutions like china development bank whereas india s two development banks which converted to commercial banks in the euphoria of universal banking are surviving under different stages of stress a strong code of customer protection is another imperative mis selling hidden charges not enough passing of interest rate reductions etc are rampant in india even an advanced market like the us recently brought a new regulation best interest to further safeguard the interests of investors in securities china has a list of services for which banks are explicitly not allowed to levy charges finance needs a continuous evaluation of its institutions instruments and processes course corrections and distortions could be aptly and adequately addressed by an independent commission through periodic studies india should seriously think of setting an efficient institutional mechanism that does continuous review and assessments while serving the internal purposes evolving a productive state craft would be relevant for indian finance to effectively engage with the outside world too the writer runs the consulting firm growth markets advisory services the views expressed are personal
things are selling really really quickly like in hours or a day said jodi rosko a springboro based real estate agent and co owner of the rosko group at keller williams community partners the region s housing market has largely recovered from the recession which lasted from december 2007 to june 2009 but our investigation found that its lingering repercussions can be seen in fewer homes built some neighborhoods hollowed out by foreclosures and a sellers housing market that has driven up prices the dayton daily news path forward initiative seeks solutions to the most pressing issues in our community including making sure our region is prepared for the economy of the future this story examines the housing industry the hurdles faced by sellers and buyers and how this crucial segment of the local economy has fared since the great recession sent the housing market reeling related you may be surprised to see what homes in your community sell for the biggest problem for the region s housing market right now is inventory simply not enough homes for sale to meet demand in april a total of 3 235 homes were listed for sale at the pre recession inventory high point in april 2007 10 000 homes were on the market according to dayton realtors data from the dayton multiple listing service for montgomery greene preble darke and northern warren counties the economy is better than it has been in a long time and i think the inventory shortage is probably limiting how active we really could be today said frank petrie director of retail mortgages for wright patt credit union so more inventory would certainly continue the expansion of the market but it s been very solid around here when the real estate market crashed in the recession new home construction plunged and remains below pre recession levels part of our lack of inventory issue has to do with the fact that when we did have the market downturn building stopped pretty much for a while rosko said so all those houses that would have been built weren t homeowners displaced by memorial day tornadoes that destroyed or damaged thousands of homes and other structures across the dayton region are likely to have a hard time finding new homes to buy so they might need to rent as they await something more permanent said jan leverett president of dayton realtors which represents 3 000 area real estate agents related tornado survivors seek help at fema center in trotwood it s going to take a full year to really recuperate and it s going to take a year to rebuild these houses leverett said it s the whole range of houses that were impacted related ohio realtors and dayton realtors offer aid for tornado victims with home damage decline and recovery despite rising home sale prices the overall valuation of montgomery county residential commercial industrial and agricultural property has not fully recovered from the great recession montgomery county auditor karl keith said in 2011 the county saw its first decline in overall property valuation since the great depression between 2010 and the lowest point in 2015 the county lost 13 percent of valuation nearly 3 6 billion the total valuation has ticked up since then to 26 1 billion but remains below the 2010 peak of 28 3 billion related see how property values in your community have declined since recession based on preliminary numbers keith said it s likely the 2020 property revaluation will put the county back to pre recession levels if you go back to the great depression it took something like 14 years for the county to recover the loss of value keith said we ve really rebounded quicker than i would have imagined you ve got a variety of housing stock here that has helped us to stabilize values and helped us to recover local sales and construction statistics show how the region s housing market has recovered and where it still struggles the dayton daily news investigation found the market hit bottom in 2010 when home sales dropped by nearly a third to 9 785 compared to 2005 in the five county dayton mls by 2018 sales of single family homes and condos rebounded to 15 955 average sale prices hit a low of 114 496 in 2011 prices rose steadily since then climbing to 164 566 last year a 22 percent gain over the pre recession high in 2005 new listings of homes for sale have not recovered from the great recession with 20 629 homes newly listed last year a third fewer than at the high point for new listings of 30 602 in 2006 home sale prices vary widely in the region from an average of 318 495 in springboro clearcreek twp to 65 439 in trotwood according to the dayton realtors 2018 annual survey of 30 communities in montgomery greene preble and warren counties the value of new residential construction in 2018 was 68 3 million in montgomery county 77 percent lower than it was when it peaked at nearly 301 million in 2005 according to keith s office permits for new residential building units plunged 52 percent between 2006 and 2010 last year they remained 22 percent below 2006 levels in greene montgomery and warren counties according to data compiled by npg dataquest for the home builders association of dayton we are doing quite well recovering from the foreclosure crisis because we see year after year of equity gain in the homes on the market said anjanette frye president of ohio realtors and former president of dayton realtors dayton s doing a great job on moving and dollar volume and sales price sales across the state in april were robust as the traditional spring home buying season kicked off she said and the average sale price statewide ticked up 5 2 percent to 179 958 for the first four months of the year compared to the same period last year but even with the good april numbers homes sales statewide remained flat for the first four months of the year compared to the same period last year according to the ohio realtors home sales in the dayton mls also stayed flat but still better than columbus and cincinnati which saw 1 6 percent declines over the same period last year the dayton mls had a 6 1 percent increase in sales dollar volume and average sale price outstripping those two cities and the statewide sales data the profession is hopeful that we ll see an uptick in the number of homes being marketed for sale a key factor in ensuring that the momentum we ve attained continues frye said dayton s neighborhoods and downtown one way to relieve the inventory crunch could be to redevelop vacant and dilapidated homes in older neighborhoods but that can be challenging especially where widespread blight makes it difficult to recover the rehab cost said darrin carey owner of dayton capital partners a real estate investment lending and redevelopment company related how these cities are fighting blight putting more homes on the market a dilapidated house on a block also makes it hard for neighbors to sell their homes said aisha ahmed a realtor at bella realty group of bellbrook if there is a nice home in that neighborhood they get appraised lower she said sometimes some of those homes should be just pushed down you are not going to bring it to life those neighborhoods are particularly prevalent in dayton which was among the hardest hit in the state by the foreclosure crisis but city leaders hope the recent success of downtown housing will spread outward related many owners of abandoned homes escape responsibility the number of single family townhomes and condos on the market has grown in downtown dayton part of the national trend toward urban walkable living the number of market rate housing units increased by 57 percent to 1 585 since 2010 said sandy gudorf president of the downtown dayton partnership occupancy of owner occupied and rental units is at 97 5 percent as home developers we are always taking risks but we are always going where we think the market is telling us to go said charlie simms recalling his decision in 2010 to take the city up on its offer of the former sears parking garage land to build 18 townhomes all my friends families and business associates told me i was crazy to build next to a four story parking garage in downtown dayton he said related see where millions have been spent to improve downtown dayton the townhomes sold out in 10 months his charles simms development has since built and sold 118 units in six different downtown projects sale prices for his townhomes range from 160 000 to 660 000 simms success along with tax incentives and taxpayer funded amenities like riverscape and the dayton dragons fifth third field sparked a downtown residential construction boom companies bars restaurants and brew pubs followed as demand remains strong for the unique downtown lifestyle gudorf said as long as we continue to do what we are doing which we are definitely heading in the right direction eventually the downtown will fill up all its housing area and it will filter out to the surrounding areas north south east and west simms said i think those neighborhoods will be revitalized related simms looks at new homes in wright dunbar that is exactly what dayton city manager shelley dickstein said the city is betting on with a strategy of focusing on historic neighborhoods and the neighborhoods closest to downtown credit handout credit handout it s a gut feeling and a market reality that we are starting to see because downtown is performing so well we think now we can do the same thing we did in 2010 incentivize and create public private partnerships dickstein said so that we can drive investment into these inner ring neighborhoods where i believe the market is ripe for development hot market frye a real estate agent at rcf properties inc in washington twp said she and other agents have to be fast on their feet to get the homes their clients want to buy in this sellers market on a recent night she arrived at 6 p m to show a house and before her client could even get upstairs she said three more agents came in the door with their clients she wrote nine offers on homes for another client before the woman snagged one in the franklin middletown area for the approximately 150 000 she wanted to spend we get outbid for homes we can afford ahmed said it s such a discouraging process because you have individuals who are excited who are interested who can afford it can put down the 20 percent and yet you get outbid she said one client offered the asking price but lost to a person offering more for the house that had been on the market for a day we are a little more skeptical of getting in a bidding war because we want the houses to appraise leverett said some buyers might have cash to pay more than the bank is willing to loan she said but the typical buyer needs to pull out of the deal or renegotiate if the appraisal falls short of the bid agents said people are sometimes going to extremes to get houses we wrote contracts for houses we never even walked into ahmed said no one should ever feel pressure to write a contract for a house they ve never even been to people even have offered to buy without inspections petrie said something that can leave the new homeowner with expensive surprises d related 5 things to know about the dayton region s housing market the speedy timeline means buyers don t have time to think about it or even to get there to look at it if it sells in a day or two rosko said it s challenging to walk through a house one time for a few minutes and then decide to buy it it s a big investment rising prices the dayton region has a wide range of home prices of the 30 communities the dayton realtors surveyed 13 had average sale prices that were less than 151 000 in 2018 and eight of them were less than 135 000 eleven communities had average sale prices exceeding 200 000 houses here are affordable said julie deacon executive director of the homeownership center of greater dayton so unlike bigger cities on the coast you can still buy a home and typically you re going to pay less for your mortgage payment than a rent payment in the dayton area explore real estate agents say the inventory crunch drives up sale prices which is good for sellers that s especially true for those whose values dropped during the recession and put some people in a position of being under water owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth now most of the people that i talk to that are listing their home are not having to bring money to the table to pay off mortgages anymore rosko said i feel like we have recovered finally from when we took the fall last time in 2018 average sale prices rose by 25 percent in jamestown cedarville 17 percent in waynesville and 12 6 percent in dayton according to the dayton realtors survey only yellow springs had a decline with its 251 260 average sale price a decline of 3 5 percent compared to 2017 housing price increase is indicative of a robust economy and that is what we are looking for especially in the midwest when we have had our share of economic difficulties said james thurston vice president of public relations for the ohio bankers league by and large the state housing market has made a good recovery related luxury apartments townhouses carriage homes coming to huber heights the rising prices are not necessarily good news for buyers some people might have lost good jobs during the recession or grapple with bad credit making it difficult to afford to buy a home deacon said we still have a lot of people in the dayton area that are under employed or unemployed said jackie easter a home ownership adviser at the homeownership center there are people still not making enough money for their home to be affordable and they are still struggling with foreclosure issues related how do we get the economy to boom for all the nonprofit center serves an 11 county area providing homeownership counseling credit counseling financial education and foreclosure aid it also distributes down payment assistance through partnerships with dayton kettering and montgomery county last year its 107 clients bought 8 7 million worth of homes according to deacon the center s clients might have difficulty getting a home loan due to college loan and credit card debt medical bills loan defaults court judgments or liens that have hurt their credit easter said the goal is to help people work through those issues and deacon said if people follow the action plan they will be mortgage ready in the wake of the foreclosure crisis new state and federal laws eliminated some predatory lending practices required that mortgage brokers be licensed and added more rules to protect consumers but deacon leverett and rosko said they have seen some worrisome practices returning including loans requiring no income verification i am hearing that these loan products are back and people are getting qualified for a mortgage that they should not be qualified for deacon said good investment the post recession years have brought an era of low interest rates that have lasted far longer than anyone expected rates fluctuate but a 30 year fixed rate was 3 75 percent on thursday and the rate on a 15 year loan is 3 375 percent according to eric bugger chief lending officer at wright patt credit union rates have been this low for a long time and honestly many people didn t grow up on the rates of 18 to 20 percent petrie said that 28 30 crowd is a bigger buying group now than the baby boomer group as the economy is changing and growing the millennials are going to be the buying force for the foreseeable future a common myth is that people need a 20 percent down payment to buy a house he said while 20 percent is necessary for buyers wanting to avoid paying private mortgage insurance petrie said an fha loan requires 3 5 percent down fannie mae 5 percent and a conventional loan 3 to 5 percent related how the next recession could affect dayton depending on loan terms petrie said the monthly mortgage payment taxes and home insurance on a 130 000 to 140 000 home is about the same as the 850 the average renters pays in the dayton region that was a big issue for erin mills 42 who used kettering s first time homebuyers down payment assistance program to buy a home on keswick lane for 75 000 in july 2017 she had rented a home in clarksville for many years we paid 725 in rent and it was going up and going up i was like we live in clarksville ohio it shouldn t cost this much said mills who now pays 597 monthly for her mortgage home insurance and private mortgage insurance when you are on a tight budget like i am every little bit helps like many americans mills said owning a home has been a long time goal it s pretty awesome mills said i already told my son you know you ll

cnn business the federal reserve is known for being slow and deliberate but over the last six months it s moved at lightning speed going from forecasting a steady increase in interest rates to openly indicating possibly one maybe two cuts by the end of this year what s changed the central bank s modus operandi president donald trump the president has waged an unprecedented public pressure campaign on his handpicked fed chairman jerome powell he s called him loco in interviews asked if he could be fired and on sunday he again said he has the right to demote powell and criticized past interest rate hikes but the real game changer has been the rest of trump s actions specifically his multi front trade wars which come just as growth was is tapering off globally i m sure things will change before the next meeting powell said this past week at his now regular press conferences another departure from the tradition of only occasionally answering questions about rate decisions set by his predecessors under trump the fed has had to adapt to both a faster moving economy and a president who has ripped up the usual washington playbook in favor of more unorthodox approach where the economy is always uncertain there are always surprises said david wessel director of the hutchins center on fiscal and monetary policy at the brookings institution the president of the united states is not usually adding to the confusion as he is now the president has made everything harder buoyed by a strong job market and steady growth powell stepped into his role in 2017 pledging to slowly bring interest rates back up from historically low levels where they ve languished since the great recession a decade ago but while the economy has remained steady trump has injected an element of uncertainty since 2018 imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as well as on billions of dollars of chinese goods markets shuddered last winter as the fed continued raising rates but recovered as trump appeared to move toward reaching a settlement with his chinese counterpart xi jinping his surprise decision in early may to abandon talks and threaten additional tariffs on china after negotiators changed the landscape capsizing confidence that policymakers let alone markets and investors could confidently predict the future trump s twitter threat shortly after to impose tariffs on mexico over immigration just as he was trying to convince democrats to accept the replacement he negotiated for the north american free trade agreement further fueled concerns fed officials the board reserve presidents staff they are conditioned to think of politicians acting in certain ways in certain parameters and president trump has clearly discarded the normal way of doing business said brian gardner director of washington research at the investment bank keefe bruyette woods they are used to operating in a certain environment and that certain environment doesn t exist anymore it s that uncertainty that drove the fed to leave all options on the table including possible rate cuts as early as july though policymakers declined to vote for a shock rate cut at their june meeting keeping with their habit of painstakingly signaling their intentions to markets to avoid flash crashes or spikes it s ironic they took the word patience out of their statement said nathan sheets a former treasury undersecretary who served in the obama administration this was a meeting where patience was the best approach and that s precisely what they did powell at his press conference on wednesday stressed the importance of not reacting to one single data point or one event rather wanting to ensure that developments and trends are genuine we d like to see more going forward he said but the challenge facing the fed is distinguishing between signal and noise and moving too fast risking overheating the economy if trump pulls back the fed has got to stay focused on where is the economy and what are the implications of the trade war on the economy said sheets now chief economist and head of global macroeconomic research at pgim fixed income maybe they ll respond aggressively to get ahead of the economic effects but trying to preempt the next move by trump and xi you just can t do it it s not knowable
the trump taxscam was supposed to create jobs by handing 1 trillion in cuts to multinational corporations and one percenters who we were promised would put that money into r d business development and other job creating initiatives instead more than 800b of the windfall went to stock buybacks in which companies literally devour themselves to enrich their major shareholders texas instruments is a great case study of how the taxscam works after the bill passed ti s effective tax rate fell from 39 to 17 and the company celebrated by doubling its budget for buybacks spending 5 1 billion on its own shares more than any other texas company it added 51 million to its r d budget a budget that clocks in at one third the size of the buyback budget though texas instruments has enough cash to squander billions on buybacks it is still pleading poverty with local governments demanding and receiving hundreds of millions in subsidies from local governments in exchange for deigning to manufacture its products there many experts doubted that corporate tax cuts would result in big increases in r d and capital expenses that s because many companies were already cash rich and with low interest rates they could access cheap debt if they believed an investment was justified said steven rosenthal a senior fellow at the urban brookings tax policy center what have we truly seen from the tax cuts a lot of stock buybacks rosenthal said the market is acting efficiently and rationally by taking these surplus profits and sending them to shareholders it s a demonstration that companies didn t really have much use for the money there are costs from cutting the corporate tax rate so sharply last year federal taxes on corporate income fell by nearly 120 billion a decline of 35 according to the u s bureau of economic analysis that contributed to a rising deficit even during a booming economy the annual shortfall which was 442 billion in 2015 approached 800 billion last year it s projected to top 1 trillion by 2022 thanks uncle sam after tax cuts texas instruments spent 5 billion on stock three times more than r d image jacob jose cc by trump s hair via late stage capitalism
by barani krishnan investing com one week ago we were talking about an iranian attack on oil tankers this week s conversation was dominated by iran s downing of a u s drone and how president donald trump almost retaliated before standing down in the final minutes it wouldn t be too surprising if next week brings another provocative iran attack of some kind to push the president s button again as olivier jakob founder of swiss energy consultancy petromatrix commented wryly on friday in view of the 2020 elections president trump is facing a formidable challenge to address the military provocations of iran while avoiding a spike in gasoline prices and a correction of the stock market trump spoke of major additional sanctions against iran on saturday before being holed up at camp david to plan his next move against the islamic republic last week s 9 jump in u s was its biggest since nov 2016 5 weekly gain was the most since the week ended feb 15 on the precious metals front bullion and futures of gold breached the magical 1 400 mark hitting near six year highs with 1 500 being touted as the next target of gold bugs some wonder if the yellow metal is better positioned than oil to benefit from the war cries in the middle east as well as the federal reserve s widely expected rate cut energy review there was no weekend short covering for iranian risk in the previous week despite the attack on the oil tankers after this week though we can t be sure that risk traders can ignore iran anymore the faa has ordered u s airlines to stay clear of the skies of iran and it is likely that others will follow suit military escalation is a weekend risk as jakob of petromatrix noted the u s president first called out iran on making a very big mistake on the drone strike before pinning blame on an iranian general who was loose and stupid trump clearly does not want to engage in a middle east war but it will be harder and harder for the white house to leave the momentum to iran without any u s response price wise brent s backwardation has eased further and wti is almost out of contango despite high cushing stocks gasoline has also seen strong support after a fire at the pes philadelphia refinery crude s rally could extend into the coming week if the u s energy information administration issues another strong dataset on crude stockpiles and gasoline demand like in the just ended week next week will be the final stretch before the july 1 2 meetings of opec and its key non members alliance led by russia typically it is a time when opec ministers are most energetic in talking up oil prices and the debate before them on extending production cuts by another six months will be rich for rhetoric adding to that will be g20 in osaka where the star billing is trump s highly anticipated meeting with chinese leader xi jinping oil prices could also see another sharp upside if the u s president and his team hold as he has promised positive talks with china s president xi jinping and negotiators from beijing at the g20 meeting next weekend all these are hypothetical by the way as a fall through in any could result in a fresh tumble in oil prices energy

chuck todd mr president welcome back to meet the press president donald trump thank you chuck todd let me start right in what happened last night president donald trump well you had a situation that was very bad because the night before they shot down an unmanned drone and the unmanned is a very big factor the fact that there was not a person on it a u s person on it or anybody and that had an impact on me i said well you know we got a little problem and i think they did that on purpose because they understand that they will be hit very hard if that were a plane with a person in it and i think they knew that there was nobody there so we had a very you know modest but pretty pretty heavy attack schedule chuck todd and this is a pre plan that you had something that if they did something you had something president donald trump yeah we had it chuck todd these were sort of ready made plans president donald trump sure we have many of them chuck todd to use if necessary right president donald trump oh i have so many targets you wouldn t believe chuck todd right president donald trump we have targets all over chuck todd so did you green light something or had you said president donald trump nothing s chuck todd if we do it i ll do this what was what was the order you gave president donald trump nothing is green lighted until the very end because chuck todd ok president donald trump things change right chuck todd so you never gave a final order president donald trump no no no no but we had something ready to go subject to my approval and they came in and they came in about a half an hour before they said so we re about ready to go i said i want a better definition chuck todd planes in the air were planes in the air president donald trump no no we re about ready to go no but they would have been pretty soon and things would have happened to a point where you wouldn t turn back or couldn t turn back so they came and they said sir we re ready to go we d like a decision i said i want to know something before you go how many people will be killed in this case iranians i said how many people are going to be killed sir i d like get back to you on that great people these generals they said came back said sir approximately 150 and i thought about it for a second and i said you know what they shot down an unmanned drone plane whatever you want to call it and here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after i said go ahead and i didn t like it i didn t think it was i didn t think it was proportionate now that doesn t mean chuck todd so what should the response be right now president donald trump i think the response should be well first of all as you know we ve done very massive sanctions we re increasing the sanctions now but the response is always going to be very strong i built up a lot of capital i ve had a lot of people that aren t trump fans saying i can t believe you know a lot of them said we re going to be in world war iii the first week didn t work out that way we re doing great in north korea we re doing great in a lot of different places we knocked out the caliphate in syria we knocked out 100 remember i was going to leave it chuck todd it s not 100 not everybody says it s 100 even president donald trump no no no the caliphate chuck todd ok president donald trump no the caliphate which is the land chuck todd the land president donald trump the area chuck todd fair enough president donald trump is 100 you never knock these people out chuck todd no you won t president donald trump these people are stone cold crazy and they walk into a store and they ll be wired up for bombs and they ll blow it s a horrible thing so i never say that i don t want to do what other presidents have done or other people have done saying we won because you don t win so conclusively i would love to have the day where we can win you know i remember when i was young i d go on airplane and i d walk up i d buy a ticket i d go on a plane nobody thought about bombs and nobody thought about security you d walk in you d give the ticket to the person at the gate and you d walk into a plane today it s like a big deal so what happened is i said i m not going to do it i ll save it if they do something else it ll be double chuck todd you think they were trying to provoke you president donald trump no i don t think so and i think it was very important that they to them don t forget their economy chuck todd they don t they they you don t think they intended to get you to respond militarily president donald trump no their economy is shattered shattered chuck todd so what s the message you think they re sending president donald trump their inflation is through the roof they ve never had the highest in the world right now worse than any place they re they re living not well chuck todd so put yourself in their shoes what do you think the message they re trying to send you with this with this drone president donald trump i think they want to negotiate and i think they want to make a deal and my deal is nuclear look they re not going to have a nuclear weapon this isn t about the straits do you know that china gets 91 of its oil from the straits we don t even need the straits we have we are now because of since i came in we re the number one energy producer in the world okay actually by far and if i get the pipelines approved through the environmental process which i will in texas we ll go up by another 25 but we re way ahead of russia we re way ahead of saudi arabia and i think that they want to negotiate i don t think they like the position they re in their economy is is absolutely broken chuck todd so you sent a letter to the ayatollah via prime minister abe and the ayatollah seemed to say i m not talking to you president donald trump i didn t send a letter no chuck todd what was the president donald trump i didn t i didn t send a letter no no chuck todd was it a verbal message what did prime minister abe carry on your behalf president donald trump prime minister abe s a great guy he s a friend of mine and he obviously is close to them i think he was their their largest buyer of oil from before chuck todd but did he did he deliver a message from you to them president donald trump no he wanted to do something chuck todd ok president donald trump according to prime minister abe they went to him it s according to the prime minister and they said what do we do with trump can we make a deal is there something that can be done that s what prime minster abe told me i said do you mind if i say that if i have to and he said not particularly so they came to prime minister abe he then called me i said send the following message you can t have nuclear weapons and other than that we can sit down and make a deal but you cannot have nuclear chuck todd no other president donald trump weapons chuck todd conditions other than that president donald trump you cannot have nuclear weapons and they would have had them with president obama he gave them 150 billion chuck todd what is your deal president donald trump remember this chuck todd i understand but what is your deal president donald trump but chuck you have to remember this chuck todd going to look like with them president donald trump let me explain something number one you have to look at the sites some of the most important sites we weren t even allowed to look at or inspect okay number two the term was not long enough chuck todd ok president donald trump there s like a short number of years left after a very small number of years he s talking about a country after a very small number of years they have a free pass to nuclear weapons you can t do that so i want to be able to inspect all sites they cannot have ballistic missiles which under the agreement isn t even covered and as you know that agreement wasn t even approved by congress a lot of people don t know that that was an agreement that he couldn t get through congress he was not authorized really to do that deal chuck todd congress did give him some authorization to do that it gave him the power to cut the deal president donald trump it wasn t ratified by congress chuck todd it wasn t a it wasn t a treaty president donald trump it was very very short of what it should have been you know that chuck todd don t you think though does it at all tell what does it tell you that the iranians haven t violated the agreement yet that they are trying hard not to violate this agreement president donald trump well you see i think they have violated the agreement because i think in the areas that we re not allowed to inspect they re doing things and i think they have been for years chuck todd europeans don t think they re violating the agreement president donald trump well i don t care about the europeans the europeans are going out and making a lot of money the europeans are fine but they re going out and making a lot of money they re selling in france they re selling cars to iran they re doing other things and let me tell you we re very good to europe we take care of them nato we spend a tremendous amount a disproportionate amount on trade the european union s taken really they have really taken advantage of us for a long time just to finish we have great relationships with europe i don t mind europe getting in the middle europe wants to make a deal too europe would love to see a deal be made chuck todd are these going to be separate deals president donald trump by the way europe chuck todd do you want to do a separate deal with iran or do you want to get everybody involved in the same deal get the russians get the chinese president donald trump i don t care which what kind of a deal it can be separate or it could be total chuck todd but it s one on one talks you and the ayatollah president donald trump all it is all it is chuck todd is it one on one talks you and the ayatollah or you and the president president donald trump it doesn t matter to me here s what i want anything that gets you to the result they cannot have a nuclear weapon it s not about the straits you know a lot of people covered it incorrectly they re never mentioned they cannot have a nuclear weapon they d use it and they re not going to have a nuclear weapon chuck todd did you send a message president donald trump and it s not about the oil chuck todd last night you know reuters is reporting that you sent a message to the iranians saying i don t want war i want to talk president donald trump wrong it s wrong i did not send that message i did not send that message i don t know who chuck todd ok president donald trump i don t know who would have said that chuck todd send a message right now to the ayatollah president donald trump i mean it s fake news chuck todd then send a message right now to the ayatollah president donald trump wouldn t be much different than that message chuck todd which is president donald trump i m not looking for war and if there is it ll be obliteration like you ve never seen before but i m not looking to do that but you can t have a nuclear weapon you want to talk good otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next chuck todd no pre conditions president donald trump three years not as far as i m concerned no pre conditions chuck todd and you ll talk anywhere president donald trump here it is look you can t have nuclear weapons and if you want to talk about it good otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come chuck todd if you are you do you feel like you were being pushed into military action against iran by any of your advisors president donald trump i have two groups of people i have doves and i have hawks chuck todd yeah you have some serious hawks president donald trump i have some hawks yeah john bolton is absolutely a hawk if it was up to him he d take on the whole world at one time okay but that doesn t matter because i want both sides you know some people said why did you put you know i was against going into iraq for years and years and before it ever happened i was against going into iraq and some people said oh i don t know i was totally against and i was a private citizen it never made sense to me i was against going into the middle east chuck we ve spent 7 trillion in the middle east right now chuck todd why is this our problem this is a proxy war iran and saudi arabia are in a fight to the death out there president donald trump yeah you re right you re right and that s another thing i ve done chuck todd candidate trump candidate trump for years would have said not our fight why are you involved president donald trump because of nuclear weapons it has nothing to do with oil chuck todd so the minute you get them to do nuclear weapons you want out of the middle east president donald trump that s all i care i don t care about well we re going to protect israel but i have nothing to do absolutely nothing and we re going to protect saudi arabia look saudi arabia is buying 400 billion worth of things for us that s a very good thing chuck todd you used to say we don t get anything in return president donald trump we are now chuck todd for protecting saudi arabia president donald trump you know that this chuck todd you feel like they re now paying for president donald trump this morning chuck todd the american protection president donald trump i spoke to the crown prince this morning and we had a great conversation i said this is a very expensive operation you and the other nations that we re protecting have to pay chuck todd did you talk president donald trump and he said yes chuck todd did you talk to him about the u n report about jamal khashoggi president donald trump i did not because it really didn t come up in that discussion i called about one reason chuck todd i understand president donald trump i called about one i didn t call about that i called about one reason there s a very expensive operation unlike president obama and unlike everybody else i ll say others too not just president obama you ve got to pay for it we cannot we we just don t want to go in and and protect the middle east and protect saudi arabia and everyone else and not get reimbursed chuck todd so this is why you re overruling congress and and letting all these weapon sales happen in saudi arabia president donald trump economic development and that but economic development chuck todd never mind the humanitarian disaster president donald trump a million jobs chuck todd that s taking place in yemen president donald trump a million jobs no it s going to end it s going to end by the way who s causing it though if you look at it iran goes into yemen they start firing rockets at saudi arabia saudi arabia has to protect themselves chuck but it s it s a million jobs and probably more they buy massive amounts 150 billion worth of military equipment that by the way we use we use that military equipment and unlike other countries that don t have money and we have to subsidize everything so saudi arabia is a big buyer of america product that means something to me it s a big producer of jobs chuck todd it makes you overlook some of their bad behavior president donald trump no chuck todd i mean president donald trump i don t like anybody s bad behavior chuck todd are you going to the united nations said they d like the united states to order the fbi to investigate jamal khashoggi s death and possibly mbs president donald trump well i think it s i think it s chuck todd involvement in it will you allow the fbi to do that president donald trump i think it s been heavily investigated chuck todd by who president donald trump by everybody i mean chuck todd by the fbi president donald trump i ve seen so many different reports chuck todd what about the fbi president donald trump here s where i am you ready chuck todd uh huh president donald trump iran s killed many many people a day other countries in the middle east this is a hostile place this is a vicious hostile place if you re going to look at saudi arabia look at iran look at other countries i won t mention names and take a look at what s happening and then you go outside of the middle east and you take a look at what s happening with countries okay and i only say they spend 400 to 450 billion over a period of time chuck todd so president donald trump all money all jobs buying equipment chuck todd that s the price as long as they keep buying president donald trump no no chuck todd you ll overlook some of this behavior president donald trump but i m not like a fool that says we don t want to do business with them and by the way if they don t do business with us you know what they do they ll do business with the russians or with the chinese they will buy we make the best equipment in the world but they will buy great equipment from russia and from china chuck chuck todd yeah alright president donald trump take their money take their money chuck chuck todd what would a candidate trump have said about a president who on his watch had iran shooting down a drone a venezuelan dictator thumbing his nose at you obamacare still on the books and no results yet on the border the border getting tough president donald trump well let s let s take a look let s take a look chuck todd i just say what would candidate trump have said about that president donald trump okay let s take a look the border s doing great mexico s been fantastic they ve been trying to get a deal with mexico for 45 years right so for 45 years they couldn t get a deal i got one in one day i said we re going to put tariffs on and we re going to either have a deal or not we agreed in one day mexico just moved 6 000 people to their southern border 6 000 troops to their southern border the border s working out well and the wall is being built i mean a lot of people don t like to talk about it we re building the wall we will have 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and that s hard because the democrats don t want to approve it we just beat them in a big lawsuit as you know in washington in d c we just beat them in a very big lawsuit chuck todd but does it frustrate you that your border numbers are worse than obama s president donald trump no because the people are coming up because our economy is so good they re pouring up because the economy is so good obama had a lousy economy it was a dead economy chuck todd can i ask you about that president donald trump our our economy is good chuck todd let me show you this chart do you see that chart president donald trump yeah chuck todd it s the unemployment rate from the peak of the recession president donald trump right chuck todd your economy is great i m not saying it s not great but this recovery started and in the 28 months that you ve been president and the last 28 months of obama s presidency he averaged more new jobs than your first 28 president donald trump that s because he started off with a with such a bad base i mean he hit chuck todd ok but it is is it not a continuation president donald trump yeah but chuck you have to understand nobody was working the whole place was a disaster and i don t i d never take that away chuck todd ok president donald trump but it s very easy chuck todd alright president donald trump because when that turned around they pumped a tremendous amount of money into the economy he also had a federal reserve person who kept the interest rates low i don t i don t have that privilege chuck todd sounds like you do now do you feel like you have president donald trump no no no chuck todd do you feel you have sent president donald trump he raised them far too fast chuck todd the threat president donald trump he raised them far too fast chuck todd your threat to demote him do you think that s had an impact president donald trump i didn t ever threaten to demote him chuck todd there s been some talk that you might demote him to the number two slot president donald trump well i i i d be able to do that if i wanted but i haven t suggested that i mean chuck todd that s not a threat president donald trump no it s not chuck todd that s just a reminder that you can president donald trump no no i have the right to do that but i haven t said that what he s done is 50 billion a month in quantitative tightening that s ridiculous what he s done is he raised interest rates too fast chuck todd do you worry it s going to hurt president donald trump i ve been proven right chuck todd your reelection president donald trump i think the economy s so strong we re going to bull through it but i m not happy with his actions no i don t think he s done a good job i think this if he didn t raise rates obama had very low rates so obama was playing with funny money i wasn t i m playing with the real stuff chuck todd let me ask you this president donald trump wait wait obama had somebody that kept the rates very low i had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly too much he made a mistake that s been proven and yet my economy is phenomenal we have now the best economy maybe in the history of our country one just to finish off when i took over this country the economy was ready to collapse you take a look at the numbers it was ready to collapse and if i didn t win chuck todd i just showed you the numbers it was not ready to collapse president donald trump no no no that s you showed me unemployment numbers chuck todd that was unemployment it was not ready president donald trump excuse me chuck todd to collapse president donald trump excuse me take a look at your gdp take a look at your jobs take a look at your optimism chuck todd ok president donald trump take a look at all of the charts when i took over from election day on i mean you show me one chart which where i did chuck todd it was the unemployment rate president donald trump well in that too but i m not chuck todd ok president donald trump talking about that take a look at some of the optimism charts and everything else it went from 57 to 92 nobody s ever seen anything that chuck todd you re right you re right president donald trump right after i won chuck todd the optimism you re right president donald trump well optimism is a big part of success in business okay chuck todd you were always hard on obama you thought he wasn t enough of a cheerleader president donald trump he was not a cheerleader chuck todd if you could have one do over as president what would it be president donald trump well it would be personnel chuck todd who is it president donald trump i would say if i had one do over it would be i would not have appointed jeff sessions to be attorney general that would be my one chuck todd that s your in your mind that s your worst mistake president donald trump yeah that was the biggest mistake chuck todd is bill barr your roy cohn president donald trump he should ve never i think he s a very talented very chuck todd but do you know what i mean by that you ve always said president donald trump no no look chuck todd where s my roy cohn is he your roy cohn president donald trump you have to understand roy cohn but i had many many lawyers i mean a lot of lawyers roy was one of them he was a tough guy bill barr is a first of all bill barr chuck todd is he cut from the same cloth do you think president donald trump bill barr is a very he s equally tough he s a fine man he s a fine man the job he s done is incredible he s brought sanity back i think he s real i don t think i know he s respected you know he loves the department of justice he saw what was happening he has done a spectacular job now he s in the process of doing something and i stay away from it i really i stay away from it but i think he feels that what s happened in this country was a very bad thing and very bad for our country chuck todd i want to ask what s going down with the these the children in these migrant camps the stories are horrible mr president you have children without their parents you have kids taking care of kids president donald trump yeah chuck todd you ve you ve read these reports i know people are coming to you i know you think this is the democrats problem president donald trump well it chuck todd forget it president donald trump it was chuck todd why aren t you doing something president donald trump are you ready chuck todd they re in terrible shape down there mr president down in homestead florida that s where i grew up it s the conditions are terrible president donald trump i agree and it s been chuck todd do something president donald trump that way for a long time chuck todd do something president donald trump and president obama built the cages remember when they said that i built them and then it was 1914 chuck todd do two wrongs president donald trump excuse me chuck todd make a right president donald trump it was 2014 chuck just listen for one second chuck todd ok alright president donald trump separation president obama i took over separation i m the one that put it together what s happened though are the cartels and all of these bad people they re using the kids they re they re it s almost like slavery chuck todd but let s not punish the kids more president donald trump no this has been happening chuck todd aren t you the kids are getting punished more president donald trump you re right and this has been happening long before i got there what we ve done is we ve created we ve we ve ended separation you know under president obama you had separation i was the one that ended it now i said one thing when i ended it i said here s what s going to happen more families are going to come up and that s what s happened but they re really coming up for the economics but once you ended the separation but i ended separation i inherited separation from president obama president obama built they call them jail cells they were built chuck todd let s talk about what s happening now president donald trump by the obama chuck todd your administration and president donald trump i m just telling you chuck todd you re not doing the recreation you re not even schooling these kids anymore you ve gotten rid of all that stuff president donald trump we re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances the democrats aren t even approving giving us money where is the money you know what the democrats are holding up the humanitarian aid chuck todd it looks like these kids are being used as as some sort of is it hostages they re being held president donald trump well they are being used chuck todd hostage president donald trump they are being used by very bad people on the other side where they actually get chuck todd but now they re politically being used president donald trump paid where money is being made using them because our laws are so bad because if you have a child you have an advantage you know that better than anybody and what should happen chuck chuck todd but why let the political debate hurt these children president donald trump chuck we could chuck todd they could be impacted for years president donald trump if the democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes which they refuse to do because they think it s good politics everything would be solved immediately but they refuse to do it they refuse to do it chuck todd let me ask you this president donald trump you know what if they change those i say i used to say 45 minutes it s 15 minutes if they changed asylum and if they changed loopholes everything on the border would be perfect chuck todd let me ask you this why do you think nancy pelosi has held off her impeachment caucus president donald trump because i think she feels that i will win much easier i mean i ve been told that by many people chuck todd do you think impeachment s good politics for you president donald trump i think i win the election easier but you know i m not sure that i like having it look i did nothing wrong i was spied on what they did to me was illegal it was illegal on the other side i did nothing wrong so impeachment s a very unfair thing because nothing that i did was wrong and if you look at the mueller report there was no collusion this was all about collusion chuck todd nowhere in the mueller report president donald trump this was about conspiracy chuck todd by the way mr president you say no collusion there is not a single i ve read this mueller report both both parts of it president donald trump use the word collusion or use chuck todd there s not one place it says nothing happened president donald trump use the word collusion use the word conspiracy chuck todd it never says no collusion president donald trump i ll be honest with you nobody even mentions russia anymore since the mueller report they don t mention it in all fairness chuck todd i president donald trump nobody mentions russia anymore and it was about russia it was a hoax chuck todd let me ask you this president donald trump wait a minute chuck todd during the campaign president donald trump wait wait we ll give you the time that you need chuck todd what hoax it was president donald trump it was a hoax the russian hoax with me chuck todd you don t believe it happened president donald trump i had nothing to do chuck todd you don t believe the russians interfered president donald trump what they did with chuck todd in our election president donald trump respect to the election is different we re not talking about that we re talking about chuck todd the idea that you were conspiring president donald trump my campaign working is a hoax chuck todd fair enough president donald trump okay good chuck todd but going back on wikileaks knowing now that that was stolen foreign material do you regret using it president donald trump well i i wouldn t have but this was well known i think it was in papers and again i m going back now a long ways but chuck todd it was all rumored to be russian stolen property president donald trump wait a minute but chuck todd so why d you use it president donald trump but how would i even know that i made a speech it was in there about wikileaks i m not a chuck todd right but i m saying knowing now president donald trump wikileaks person chuck todd knowing that they are a russian intelligence president donald trump hey chuck chuck todd asset president donald trump ok chuck todd do you regret it president donald trump let me tell you wikileaks et cetera that s not my deal in life you know in other words i don t know about wikileaks it was a strange name but there were stories about something wikileaks that they had information and i say it in a joking manner at a speech joking everybody laughing everybody having a and they made it like it was serious no i don t want anything bad to happen to our country anything bad happens to this country i will end it and i ll end it fast i don t want any of that to happen chuck todd there s one part in the mueller report your your son donald trump jr did cooperate and appear before the senate intelligence committee president donald trump right that s right chuck todd in the mueller report it says that he did not voluntarily sit for an interview with mueller s team and then there s a redaction a grand jury redaction did he involuntarily sit president donald trump i don t know i can only tell you this chuck todd is it possible he was president donald trump my son chuck todd subpoenaed by the president donald trump i i really don t know chuck todd you don t know if he was subpoenaed president donald trump but let me tell you what i do know chuck todd so did you not read the mueller report president donald trump let me tell you i read much of it chuck todd the unredacted version or no president donald trump i read no i didn t chuck todd ok president donald trump i didn t but let me just tell you chuck todd so if he was subpoenaed president donald trump you know what i read i read the chuck todd if he was subpoenaed you wouldn t know president donald trump i read i read the conclusion chuck todd ok president donald trump well he was subpoenaed ultimately he was subpoenaed to sit before the senate intel chuck todd but was he president donald trump and he did that chuck todd was he subpoenaed by mr mueller president donald trump i don t know but i don t think so chuck todd if he was subpoenaed was he going to appear before the grand jury or was he president donald trump i don t know chuck todd just going to plead the fifth president donald trump i really don t know but you can certainly ask him i just chuck todd but you don t know president donald trump don t know it was it was he sat my son he s been treated so unfairly he sat for many many hours before these committees i think my impression is that mueller took all of the information from the committees and he used that information how much how much can you talk about something remember the phone calls the three phone calls it was such a big deal three phone calls that were made to a special type number chuck todd yeah president donald trump okay and everybody said oh he called his father that went on for a year in other words before this so called meeting and after the meeting he called his father the biggest story headlines all over the place and then it turned out and i give mueller credit because mueller was the one that found out through i guess the phone companies or whatever somebody found out maybe through the fbi big investigation on who the calls were made if they were made to me it would have sounded like you wait a minute they turned out that it wasn t to me it was to a real estate person and a nascar person two great people have nothing to do with russia have nothing to do and you know what people hardly even put the story in my son was treated unfairly my son he spent 20 some odd hours and then he went back again chuck todd but he never president donald trump he was a very innocent young man and he was treated very badly chuck todd you re going to see vladimir putin in a week president donald trump yes i m going to see many people chuck todd are you going to address him directly about interference in 2020 president donald trump i may chuck todd are you going to tell him president donald trump i may chuck todd not to do it president donald trump i may if you d like me to do it i ll do that chuck todd because some well some people think that your answer president donald trump you know what here s what you do chuck todd that your answer last week invited him to do it again president donald trump oh that s not true that s not true chuck todd are you going to tell him not to and what are the consequences president donald trump my answer last week was both i said both i d do both except they didn t put it on and when they did put it on people understood but they didn t put it on because they put a different segment on so they ask me a question but when i said yeah i d do both people saw that in the last version of it because the thing played like all weekend and on friday so it s just more fake news chuck there s so much fake news it would be so good if chuck todd that s why i m interviewing you one on one president donald trump that s fine that s why i like chuck todd let me ask you this president donald trump that s why i like doing chuck todd do you think you ve been president donald trump but i like live interviews better you know why because you can t cut the answers chuck todd guess what i m not you re going to enjoy the fact that i m not going to over edit this interview that i promise you president donald trump ok good president donald trump do you think you ve been more successful in business or the presidency president donald trump i think well i can t be more successful in politics i mean i ran once and i m president right so you have to say that s about there s nothing it s never happened before right so i m one for one and i hope to be two for two but my business has been a tremendous success i actually said to the lawyers i d like to show my financial statement my financial statement s great i built a great business chuck todd you could release your tax returns any day you want president donald trump i actually don t believe you don t learn from tax returns and i m under audit chuck i ve been saying it i m under audit but you don t learn from tax returns chuck todd i was under audit president donald trump but you would learn from a financial chuck todd i had my tax returns president donald trump statement and i would like to release it i ve built a great company they like to for instance banks banks i could have borrowed from banks but i didn t need to because i had money i did things in fact a lot of people over the last couple of years were really surprised he paid all cash he didn t use banks i think i ve been tremendously successful in business i think i ve been tremendously successful in show business with the apprentice i mean i did one show and it was a great hit as you know from nbc chuck todd yes sir president donald trump and i guess you have to say i ve been really successful at politics chuck todd the republican party has changed in your image do you think you caused that change or do you think the party was changing and you were the leader they selected president donald trump i think common sense caused it you know i m about common sense people say are you conservative i guess i m conservative but i m about common sense i m about we need borders we re going to have borders and we have strong borders and by the way mexico has done a great job it s slowed down so much but we have an amazing economy and people want to come up but it s slowed down so much but i m about borders i m about great health care obamacare is a disaster i got rid of the individual mandate chuck todd by the way why is the economy doing so well if obamacare is still law of the land you had said in 2011 president donald trump we are managing chuck todd obamacare s going to destroy the economy obamacare s still here and president donald trump because i ve managed it great chuck todd the economy s great president donald trump i had a choice i could have let it implode and killed it or i could have managed it chuck todd you re still trying to kill it president donald trump no no chuck todd why are you still trying to kill it with the getting rid of preexisting if you this lawsuit that the department of justice joined it could get rid of president donald trump i am in favor chuck todd coverage of preexisting conditions president donald trump i am in favor of preexisting conditions i am fighting chuck todd so get rid so drop the lawsuit president donald trump we will chuck todd so drop your aspect of the lawsuit president donald trump it has nothing to do with it the lawsuit is one thing we are going to put in a bill total preexisting conditions and the republicans are in favor of preexisting conditions chuck todd mr president you had full republican control and they couldn t pass anything president donald trump chuck are you ready chuck todd what makes you think you re going to get it done this time president donald trump we had a negative vote from john mccain it was a surprising vote but i got rid of the worst part of obamacare which was the individual mandate chuck todd ok president donald trump we will always protect pre existing conditions and the reason obamacare continues is my decision wait i made a big decision chuck todd ok president donald trump we have a man named azar our secretary he s fantastic man alex a total pro i could have managed obamacare so it would have failed or i could have managed it the way we did so it s as good as it can be not great but it s as good it s too expensive and the premiums are too high i had a decision to make i could have politically killed obamacare i decided not to do it but still it s not good we re going to come up with great health care if we win the house the senate and the presidency chuck todd are you prepared to lose president donald trump no probably not probably not chuck todd very hon i mean you joke president donald trump it would be much better it would be much better if i said yeah chuck todd you re you re president donald trump it would be much easier for me to say oh yes no i m probably not too prepared to lose i don t like losing i haven t lost very much in my life chuck todd you didn t like the fact that you lost the popular vote that bothered you didn t it president donald trump well i think it was a i mean i ll say something that again is controversial there were a lot of votes cast that i don t believe i look at california chuck todd mr president president donald trump excuse me chuck todd but that s a president donald trump take a look at judicial watch take a look at their settlement where california admitted to a million votes they admitted to a million votes chuck todd a million votes of what president donald trump take a look at judicial chuck todd what are you talking about president donald trump judicial watch made a settlement there was there was much chuck todd about what president donald trump there was much illegal voting but let me tell you about popular vote do you have a second chuck todd yes because you were you were a big fan of it president donald trump there are two chuck todd until you weren t president donald trump well i like popular vote chuck todd yeah president donald trump i think i do better with a popular vote but i didn t campaign for the popular vote chuck todd you re right i president donald trump you didn t see me campaigning in california or new york if i if it was up to the popular vote i would have been i think even better i won 306 to 223 which was a lot in the electoral college but it s like you re training for the 100 yard dash versus the mile chuck todd yep you re you re totally right president donald trump it s totally different chuck todd if it s the popular vote you campaign differently president donald trump i went to wisconsin chuck todd i don t disagree president donald trump she forgot i went to michigan she didn t go to michigan enough i won michigan wisconsin pennsylvania i won places that she didn t do a good job what can i tell you no maybe i did a great job you know i never get credit for that they always say she was a lousy candidate i actually think that hillary clinton was a great candidate she was very smart she was very tough she was ruthless and vicious chuck todd you d rather run against her again wouldn t you president donald trump no chuck todd you only talked about her in your announcement speech president donald trump no chuck todd you spent a lot of time talking about her president donald trump no i would actually rather run against biden chuck todd than hillary president donald trump i think that would be my preference chuck todd why president donald trump sleepy joe he s sleepy she was not sleepy let me just tell you something the electoral college is tougher for a republican to win than the popular vote at least me i feel that i go to three places i went to 19 or 21 states i went to maine four times because i wanted to get one and i did get it and that s the beauty of the electoral college chuck todd right president donald trump you know i ve been a proponent of the other sometimes and i change but i will tell you the electoral college brings you to many of the states in this country chuck todd you you have joked about a third term you ve joked about these things president donald trump i only joke chuck todd okay president donald trump i joke and i say watch i will drive chuck todd crazy chuck todd you will you will accept the re ok you will president donald trump yes there won t be a third term chuck todd you will accept the results president donald trump 100 sure chuck todd and you will accept whatever happens in 2020 president donald trump sure chuck todd you lose you ll be like you re not going to like it but you walk out president donald trump in fact i said at a speech recently i said watch we ll drive the media crazy let s go for a third time and then a fourth and some of the media said he s going to do it chuck todd speaking of driving people crazy when you were asked about mike pence in 2024 and you and you and you paused a minute about endorsing him as your successor that got a lot of people going is mike pence 100 on your ticket in 2020 president donald trump well look look 100 yes chuck todd 100 president donald trump oh yeah chuck todd there is no wiggle room president donald trump he s been he s been a terrific vice president he s my friend and chuck todd ok president donald trump a lot of things no zero zero chuck todd so why d you hesitate in endorsing him in being succeeding you president donald trump because it was a surprise question chuck todd you hadn t thought about it president donald trump i mean you know i m not even thinking of it it s so far out i mean it s so far out that would be the only reason now what happens in 2024 i don t know that mike is going to run i don t know who s running or anything else i will say this i think it s a tremendous embarrassment to joe biden that obama has not that president obama i like to say that because it s respect for the office and respect for him chuck todd do you speak to any of the former presidents president donald trump yes chuck todd who s the last one you did president donald trump well i speak to bush chuck todd with president bush president donald trump i speak to jimmy carter chuck todd you do what about president obama president donald trump i have not spoken to him chuck todd but george w bush you do president donald trump pretty much from the beginning chuck todd and jimmy carter president donald trump i have spoken to bush i have spoken to jimmy carter yes chuck todd do you get president donald trump i like jimmy carter you know jimmy carter s oftentimes come to my defense i don t necessarily agree with the way he ran things and that s okay and he understands that and so do i but he came to my defense on numerous occasions and he thinks that i was treated the worst of anybody he s ever seen by the press chuck todd during president donald trump i don t think he s including you chuck todd every new season every new season of the apprentice you had something new to roll out what s your big new idea for your re election president donald trump i think that the economy has tremendous upward potential despite the fact that we re doing really well i think when we really unleash some of the things chuck todd but what s your new idea president donald trump that we re going to do chuck todd what is the new big idea president donald trump i also think that health care is going to be very important for me i will tell you if we win the house the senate and the presidency i will get tremendous health care because chuck todd do you think democrats president donald trump obamacare is a disaster chuck todd do you think democrats won the house because of health care president donald trump i think they won because of preexisting condition chuck todd yeah president donald trump nothing to do with me because if you know almost every race that i campaigned for somebody they won but i couldn t devote too much time to the house there s too many people but if you look at some of the congressmen that i did go for and went for they won like in kentucky et cetera et cetera chuck todd so your one new idea is going to be health care president donald trump just one thing ohio governor he was behind great guy chuck todd he was president donald trump mike won georgia president obama was there oprah was there michelle obama was there it was going to be a big celebration she was the star of the party i went there for brian brian kemp brian kemp won florida ron desantis chuck todd he ran as you president donald trump he was going to lose he was low in the polls i endorsed him he went up 60 points after i endorsed him ron won and he s been a great governor of florida you know i ve always heard that an endorsement is nice to have but it doesn t mean anything i m driving people up 30 40 50 60 chuck todd well when you show up you bring a lot of people president donald trump we bring something very good chuck todd i m curious did you see jon stewart s pretty passionate plea on behalf of 9 11 responders in front of congress president donald trump i was very impressed yes chuck todd are you going to he s frustrated with mitch mcconnell he feels like mitch mcconnell s the guy standing in the way of this bill you re a new yorker first i know that in you i ve got to think jon stewart got to you president donald trump yeah well chuck todd are you going to tell mitch mcconnell to president donald trump i liked what jon stewart did i actually did and i actually have a meeting on that subject next week so we ll see what happens chuck todd so you think you will president donald trump you know it s a very complicated subject for a lot of reasons chuck todd i understand that it is but president donald trump but i have a meeting chuck todd do you think that jon stewart had a point that congress hadn t done enough president donald trump i have a meeting with that on that subject with well when you say congress billions of dollars has been passed chuck todd i understand that president donald trump okay billions chuck todd right but the fund was about to

trump said that laffer proved the best way to grow the economy and raise government revenue was not to increase tax rates but to adopt strong incentives washington president donald trump awarded the presidential medal of freedom on wednesday to economist arthur laffer whose disputed theories on tax cuts have guided republican policy since the 1980s laffer 78 advised trump during his presidential campaign and co wrote a flattering book trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy laffer says lower tax rates change people s behavior and stimulate economic growth creating more tax revenue for the government not less allies credit laffer with helping to spur income tax reductions around the world and boosting national economies as a result critics say the tax cuts he has espoused over the years have not produced the promised results and have instead contributed to growing income inequality and soaring budget deficits trump said that laffer proved the best way to grow the economy and raise government revenue was not to increase tax rates but to adopt strong incentives that unleash the power of human freedom few people in history have revolutionized economic thought and policy like dr art laffer trump said during a ceremony in the oval office trump used the ceremony to highlight the state of the economy under his watch the president credits his 1 5 trillion tax cut package for boosting the economy which sported a 3 6 percent unemployment rate in may and has u s stock markets standing near record highs but the federal deficit also soared it s up nearly 40 percent through the first eight months of the budget year he did not address that aspect of the tax cuts many republicans justified their vote for the tax cuts by saying they would grow the economy to the extent that they would not increase the national debt jared bernstein who served as an economic adviser to vice president joe biden said laffer is probably the most influential economist living today he said his biggest accomplishment is convincing politicians that tax cuts will pay for themselves he had consistently espoused that tax cuts for the wealthy will generate significant growth thereby helping pay for themselves and boosting the incomes of low and middle income people none of that has occurred said bernstein now a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities a liberal think tank laffer was also an adviser to president ronald reagan he is sometimes referred to as the father of supply side economics and his philosophy on taxes became known as the laffer curve he said he did not invent the laffer curve and quoted economist john maynard keynes in summarizing it given sufficient time to gather the fruit a reduction of taxation will run a better chance than an increase of balancing the budget trump recounted how the laffer curve came into being during a 1974 dinner with dick cheney donald rumsfeld and wall street journal reporter jude wanniski art drew on his napkin a series of lines and a curve that changed history trump said art showed that if tax rates are too high people stop spending and they stop investing the result is less growth and lower tax revenue on the other hand at a certain point in the curve lower tax rates spur investment economic growth and raise government revenue laffer also advised then gov sam brownback of kansas on income tax cuts that state s conservative legislature approved in 2012 and 2013 but the economic boom envisioned did not pan out rather persistent shortfalls prompted lawmakers to raise the state s sales tax divert funds from highway projects reduce contributions to public pensions and tighten spending on social services voters came to view the republican governor s experiment as a failure and bipartisan supermajorities repealed most of the tax cuts in 2017 over brownback s veto trumponomcs whose co author is stephen moore describes trump as a gifted orator shrewd and open minded writing in foreign affairs a former economic adviser to president george w bush described trumponomics as the voice of rah rah partisans the book s over the top enthusiasm for u s president donald trump s sketchy economic agenda is not likely to convince anyone not already sporting a make america great again hat wrote n gregory mankiw now a professor of economics at harvard university trump considered nominating moore to the federal reserve s board of governors but moore withdrew from consideration last month after losing republican support in the senate largely over his past inflammatory writings about women moore described laffer as the most persuasive voice among trump s advisers for cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent though the final verdict of how well this works remains unknown the bump in growth and wages in our country along with the record 7 million unfilled jobs has provided vindication of the power of the laffer model moore wrote in the hill

for decades economists and health care experts have warned about flawed incentives and rising costs in america s system for employer sponsored health insurance that system through which more than 150 million americans get their coverage has proven difficult to reform until now last week the white house finalized a new rule that allows employers to fund health reimbursement arrangements hras that can be used by workers to buy their own coverage on the individual market this subtle technical tweak has the potential to revolutionize the private health insurance market today employer based health coverage is a defined benefit if and only if an employer buys group coverage for its employees the value of that benefit is excluded from taxation the joint committee on taxation estimates this tax break is worth more than 300 billion a year a big tax break may sound good but this one creates perverse incentives in the employer based market not only is a third party the insurer paying for health care but another third party the employer is choosing and funding the insurance plan call it ninth party health care in this system workers almost entirely lack the tools they need to shop for low cost high quality health care services for the typical worker 80 percent of health care is paid for through insurance without transparency into the price of health insurance workers lack transparency into the price of health care the employer tax exclusion is also highly regressive because those in higher tax brackets receive a larger benefit from the rule than those in lower ones silicon valley programmers and manhattan lawyers get a far bigger tax break for health insurance than do cashiers or truck drivers in 2008 gop presidential nominee john mccain proposed replacing the tax exclusion for employer sponsored health insurance with a fixed 2 500 credit with which to buy coverage on the open market the idea was pilloried by then sen barack obama who said it would tax health benefits for the first time ever meaning higher income taxes for millions in reality it was obama s affordable care act that introduced the first tax on employer sponsored health insurance in the decade since the cost of employer based coverage has continued to rise deductibles have more than tripled since 2008 a new study from the rand corp finds that on average hospitals charge those with private insurance 2 4 times what they charge medicare for the same services enter president trump and his team at the national economic council led by larry kudlow the council found an elegant way to give employers the opportunity to voluntarily convert their health benefits from a defined benefit into a defined contribution for example an employer could fund an hra for each worker and their family which they could then use to shop for a plan that best suits their needs the administration estimates that as many as 800 000 employers mostly smaller businesses will choose this option expanding health care choices for 11 million workers in the next decade these employers will benefit from having fiscal certainty over their health expenditures and workers will benefit from being able to choose their coverage and take it from job to job furthermore if those estimates are right the new rule could dramatically expand the market for individually purchased health insurance encouraging more plans to enter the market and lowering premiums for all participants the white house estimates that the rule could expand the number of americans with health insurance coverage by as many as 800 000 the trump hra rule should be seen as the beginning not the end of reforms to improve the quality of private health insurance congress also needs to repair the individual market for health insurance by reforming obamacare era regulations that punish young and healthy people for buying coverage and the white house should consider building on the hra rule by requiring that all newly incorporated businesses seeking the tax break for employer coverage do so through hras such a reform would preserve traditional employer based group health insurance for those who have it while ensuring that start ups that evolve into the googles and apples of the future deploy the new model together over time these changes would give workers more transparency into and more control over the health care dollars that are now spent by other people on their behalf that transparency and control in turn would create a powerful market incentive for health care payers and providers to lower prices and increase quality some in washington want to take health insurance choices away from workers and replace them with the diktats of politicians the trump initiative moves in the opposite direction placing health care choices right where they have always belonged in the hands of hard working americans roy president of the foundation for research on equal opportunity and a former policy adviser to mitt romney rick perry and marco rubio

college and the elimination of college debt the conservative heritage foundation said in 2017 high college costs exacerbated by overgenerous federal lending policies have encouraged more students to take on high levels of student loan debt as a result graduates often leave college unprepared to pursue their career and life goals and are saddled with a debt burden that limits their upward mobility

brittini ray brittini ray savannahnow com for 39 year old juanita porter the last few weeks have been a juggling act the single mother and grandmother has been struggling to maintain a roof over her family s head while navigating multiple jobs and seeking justice in what she calls an unfair system this is real life she said i believe in god i have faith in god but when you don t know your next move and you have kids to protect it s hard porter says she found bed bug activity and mold in her timberland apartments home but when she complained it led to an eviction forcing her to quickly relocate her children and leave behind most of her belongings she took the apartment complex to court but lost the case i didn t get evicted for not paying my rent she said i got evicted for refusing to pay for an infestation that was already there porter a recent graduate from phoenix university said the apartment complex exhibited predatory behavior because she received housing assistance the apartment complex declined to comment on the matter people don t understand porter said they thought that because of my looks and because i m on section 8 that there wouldn t be a fight i was supposed to walk across the stage the day before i got evicted but i took all of my graduation money and put it into this and officials with step up savannah say porter s story is a common one in the city of savannah where about one in four residents live in poverty and are susceptible to under banking predatory lending and other predatory behavior people take advantage of others because they are desperate said alex kopp of step up savannah a look at savannah savannah s most recent rate of 24 percent living in poverty is slightly down from the pre recession number of 26 percent but it s still nearly double the national rate of 12 3 percent and 10 percent higher than the state level of 15 percent according to the u s census bureau savannah has intergenerational poverty said step up savannah executive director jen singeisen it s not reflective of the way of the rest of the economy has bounced back we see better gains in other areas if you look at the stock market the stock market is at record highs you see unemployment at historic lows and yet our poverty rate hasn t moved that much the percentage of savannah s population living below the poverty level was almost 27 percent in 2015 up from almost 22 percent in 2000 the increase occurred as the city invested 2 7 million in general funds in anti poverty programs between 2011 and 2016 and another 1 1 million was spent supporting step up savannah s job training and anti poverty initiatives and 981 304 went toward various social service agencies it s not just one thing that creates poverty singeisen said so it s not just one thing that s going to fix it you have to wrap around those services and resources for individuals they want to take care of themselves they want to take care of their families and they want to live with dignity but there are systems that make it really difficult defining the problem when a family s income fails to meet a federally established threshold the family is considered to be living in poverty poverty thresholds are the dollar amounts used to determine poverty status they re calculated using income numbers such as wage earnings unemployment social security and other sources the calculation doesn t include non cash benefits such as food stamps and housing subsidies typically it is measured with respect to families and not the individual and is adjusted for the number of persons in a family but poverty goes beyond income singeisen says the factors of poverty require a holistic view of basic needs and the identification of a local living wage she said what we know is that in savannah an individual with no kids needs to make working full time a little over 13 an hour to make a living wage in georgia the minimum wage is 5 15 compared to the federal wage of 7 25 in cases of states with minimum wage laws employers are required to pay the higher of the two the living wage model is an alternative measure of basic needs it is a market based approach that draws upon geographically specific expenditure data related to a family s likely minimum food childcare health insurance housing transportation and other basic necessities such as clothing and personal care item costs the living wage draws on these cost elements and the rough effects of income and payroll taxes to determine the minimum employment earnings necessary to meet a family s basic needs while also maintaining self sufficiency the reason why those factors come into play is because if you have small children and both parents are working then your child care goes up she said we know that one of the barriers for individuals living in poverty is child care it s so expensive that you start to question are you working just to pay your childcare a need for education and like with any problem the first step to solving it is understanding it last year the city of savannah hosted a summit to take a deeper look at the issue of poverty the connect the dot initiative was launched after the savannah city council adopted a strategic plan in 2017 that included poverty reduction as a priority the goal set by the mayor and aldermen was that by 2021 the poverty rate will be reduced by 1 percent every four years until the rate is at or below the statewide level the summit was designed to bring together service providers government and public institutions private sector employers faith based organizations and community organizations to develop solutions for assisting savannah s impoverished population many times because we work in silos we may not realize what someone else is doing singeisen said taking education a step further step up savannah hosted a poverty simulation in may to help explain to the public the other factors in tackling poverty a poverty simulation is a tool that helps participants rethink the challenges that millions of low income individuals must face each and every day managing your financial situation while running your household can overwhelm your day to day said kopp who helped run the may 8 simulation it s a lot of work and it s a tough situation that millions of americans have to deal with every day for two hours participants spent their time living in the shoes of those living below the poverty level all while navigating available resources and challenges including homelessness and food insecurity some experienced situations similar to porter s which can be cyclical leading to health issues which in turn affects the ability to bring in income participant mary beth hannan got the chance to step into the shoes of 19 year old joyce jacobi jacobi although fictional represents a large number of struggling parents living within savannah s roughly 103 square miles she struggles prioritizing food clothing and shelter for herself and her one year old son her household sees a weekly income of about 128 thanks to the help of her live in boyfriend but basic expenses usually exceed income she s looked for jobs in the past but being a high school dropout her options are limited for employment and then of course there s the cost of childcare if she chooses to work she s looked into social service programs but the wait for help is often long and navigating the process tends to be too confusing so she just avoids it altogether and hopes for a better future it s exhausting because that s all you can think of said mary beth hannan a simulation participant it s all consuming it s how am i going to do this where am i going to go and what am i going to have to do and volunteers helped to simulate predatory behavior by those looking to take advantage of desperate situations yolandra shipp served as a payday lender we cheated everybody she said after the simulation this was an observation that i had because they were so stressed out trying to figure things out that they did not pay attention everyone was so desperate and that was the point according to kopp the simulation was organized to illustrate the harsh reality faced by those 1 in 4 looking to improve their situations she said there are a lot of people who go to services like payday and quickcash and even pawn shop because they are desperate and have no other alternatives she said key problems at the heart of savannah s poverty problem is a widening wealth gap coupled with underemployment and lack of resources wealth inequality or the wealth gap is the unequal distribution of assets among residents of the united states wealth differing from income includes the values of homes automobiles personal valuables businesses savings and investments wealth is what you have saved singeisen said it s the money in the bank that you re not using its owning your home you re building equity in your home it s what s been passed down from generation to generation that wealth gap i think is probably one of the biggest challenges our community and our country is facing right now the reasons for the wealth gap are many and complicated including racially discriminatory housing and lending policies of the past the great recession triggered a sharp prolonged decline in the wealth of american families and an already large wealth gap between white households and black and hispanic households widened further in its immediate aftermath the difference between what minority americans earn and hold in wealth compared to white americans has increased significantly since the onset of the great recession according to a study released by the national bureau of economic research in 2018 and the gap is on track to continue widening according to singeisen we have to look at that because when that wealth is transferred from one generation to another that helps that next generation get further ahead she said as we re tracking now households of color are tracking to eventually have zero wealth and that s disturbing because if there is no wealth transfer to the next generation how does that next generation do better they re just struggling more so when we talk about intergenerational poverty we really have to look at that wealth gap and what can we do to shrink that gap experts say the average savannahian would have to work about 2 5 jobs as a single person to at least 2 080 hours in a calendar year to equate to a full time job at a living wage so if your cobbling together three jobs the question we have to ask is are you actually working that 2 080 hours singeisen said also if you have three part time jobs and your average is 10 then that s what you re really making and even when employment can be found and public assistance is available people have to weigh the costs and benefits of climbing the economic ladder say i m a mom with two kids and i have public housing she said i ve got peachcare for my kids and a job my boss says i m doing great and he wants to give me a raise on the surface that sounds great but now if i start making a little more an hour i could lose my benefits and that increase won t cover the costs of what i m losing a benefits cliff is what happens when public benefit programs taper off or phase out quickly when household earnings increase the abrupt reduction or loss of benefits can be very disruptive for families because even though household earnings increased they usually have not increased enough for self sufficiency that s not the positive reinforcement that we want when you re pulling yourself up from your bootstraps she said that system isn t working to encourage people to want to progress in their work life looking forward moving forward a continued conversation and a holistic approach is needed to solving savannah s crisis singeisen said we have to take a holistic approach because it s not just one thing that creates poverty she said and we have to work together targeting workforce development and affordable housing are good places to start she added step up savannah sponsors the chatham apprentice program which is dedicated to helping unemployed and underemployed chatham county residents find or create career paths that offer family sustaining wages and opportunities for advancement we re really focused in our workforce development and working with employers to find ways to push that hourly wage up she said last year the chatham savannah authority for the homeless hosted a public forum in june for elected leaders and the public to discuss the need for affordable housing and how to reduce the homeless population about 44 percent of savannah families can t afford quality housing and last month city council followed up on its effort by considering affordable housing initiatives including a 20 million investment to acquire redevelop and sell 1 000 blighted properties over a 10 year period

recently republican congressman sean duffy from wisconsin in an interview with msnbc s chris hayes framed the looming prospect of donald trump s impeachment as ridiculous his reason the economy is supposedly booming he told hayes they have higher wages lower unemployment we re killing it in wisconsin you want to impeach that guy hayes of course challenged duffy by pointing out that the performance of the economy and whether or not trump committed impeachable offenses are independent matters that a booming economy does not excuse the commission of high crimes and misdemeanors as independent as these issues might be however democrats need to be careful not to buy into the myth that trump has created a high functioning economy it simply isn t true the economy is in fact hurting rather than helping most americans despite indicators that measure economic performance as i ve argued elsewhere in the pages of politicususa in ways that really bear no relation to how the majority of americans are actually faring in the trump economy to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily democrats tend to pivot to issues of morality and criminality just as republicans divert attention to trump s putative economic successes democrats exercise this pivot at their own risk and ignore a key opportunity for political analysis and education of the american public by letting this erroneous narrative of trump s economy go unchecked take duffy s claim that we re killing it in wisconsin what the republicans and trump are killing in wisconsin is the american farmer trump s tariffs are devastating american farmers the trade wars trump has instigated has not only led to the lowest incomes american farmers have experienced in years but also caused a record number of bankruptcies for midwest dairy farms over the past two years 1 200 dairy farms have stopped producing milk and another 212 have simply disappeared these effects have been especially felt in wisconsin democrats would benefit from highlighting and understanding themselves how out of touch trump and the republicans are when it comes to the economy and how ordinary americans are suffering extraordinarily and how about the fact that trump just took 16 billion of taxpayers money to bailout farmers from the crisis he created i m confident many americans could think of a better way to spend that 16 billion if trump s mismanagement of the economy had not destroyed the global market relations for farmers and yet a great deal of common wisdom being forwarded on all sides is that the supposedly strong economic numbers bode well for trump s re election and that if he were to focus in a more disciplined way on the successful economy and not distract americans with his petulant and petty tweets his chances for re election would be heightened after trump s recent rally in florida in which he played to his base by recycling the hate speech of his 2016 campaign railing against illegal immigrants calling for the imprisonment of hillary clinton and so on ronald brownstein observed in the atlantic trump attempted to pump up his base by acting in exactly the manner that pushes away so many voters who are content with the economy but disenchanted with his behavior brownstein himself recycled the hackneyed story of it s the economy stupid writing given the low unemployment strong stock market and steady growth in total economic output the country is experiencing some election forecasting models specifically those that emphasize the economy s performance predict an easy reelection in 2020 for trump and yet an astounding percentage of those working in the wealthiest nation on earth live on the edge one third of all workers make less than 12 per hour and 42 make less than 15 per hour a third of the population has no savings and another third has less than a 1 000 in savings leaving little to no wiggle room for any unexpected expense such as medical expense or routine car repair fourteen percent of americans live in poverty as reported by forbes a publication far from being a liberal rag we must not see trump s lack of moral compass as distinct from his economic policies he has been waging an immoral assault on america s middle and working classes take his tax cuts companies like at t wells fargo and general motors lobbied for them promising to re invest their tax savings in their workers and companies to the benefit off the nation as a whole and yet all of these companies have engaged in massive layoffs or plant closings at t has eliminated over 23 000 jobs since the tax cuts went into effect despite receiving a 21 billion windfall from the tax cuts with the prospect of cashing in an additional 3 billion annually in tax savings in november 2018 gm announced it would be closing five plants eliminating 14 000 jobs in communities across ohio maryland michigan and ontario canada while buying back 10 billion in stock and earning a net profit of 8 billion on which the company paid no federal tax wells fargo did raise the minimum wage of its employees though the tax savings for the company were 47 times larger than the cost of that pay raise to the company and the company announced its plans in september 2018 to eliminate 26 000 jobs at the same time that it has raised health insurance costs for its employees the international monetary fund recently issued a study declaring once and for all what many of us already knew that trickle down economics was a bad joke the study highlighted that economic policies that boosted the earnings of the top 20 percent did not help the economy overall but that boosting conditions for bottom 20 provided a substantial stimulus democrats need to tell this story of the economy and economic policy because it s true if we define economic success by current conditions we re all in trouble americans will continue to suffer while trump s immorality is rampant democrats must recognize it extends to his economic policies including his attacks on healthcare higher education funding and environmental destruction all of which hit americans in the pocketbook and keep the majority living in economic precarity
what s to like and not like about the social network s plans to enter the cryptocurrency business a thumb s up welcomes visitors to facebook s headquarters in menlo park california facebook s plan to create a digital currency used across the world is already raising concern with financial regulators and privacy experts marcio jose sanchez associated press file photo by jay l zagorsky for the conversation facebook is joining the cryptocurrency craze should we be concerned the social network site on june 18 said it s launching a new cryptocurrency called libra with the help of 27 partners including mastercard visa ebay and uber in simple terms libra is meant to replace the paper bills in your wallet or purse with a digital equivalent but unlike other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin libra will be directly backed by assets the white paper describing the vision for this new currency is filled with laudable goals such as creating economic opportunity and advancing financial inclusion but it will take time to completely understand the ramifications of libra which facebook hopes to launch in 2020 as a macroeconomist i believe there are economic benefits to facebook s cryptocurrency but also some big potential downsides the benefits of libra existing cryptocurrencies are not tied to physical assets this makes them immune to the whims of national governments but also makes them prone to speculative bubbles and flash crashes libra on the other hand is going to be 100 percent backed by assets every unit of libra currency will be backed by an equivalent basket of bank deposits and short term government securities in various major currencies as a result libra will not suffer wild price fluctuations and since it will be backed by a collection of international currencies and assets it won t be tied to the fortunes and policies of one country either another effect of being backed by assets is that it may help lower the risk of high inflation in countries across the world nobel prize winning economist friedrich hayek made this very point in his book the denationalisation of money hayek believed everyone would be better off if people could pick among different types of private money like libra instead of using government issued money hayek believed issuing private money would banish inflation from the world since people would only use the currency most stable in value a second economic benefit of libra is that it will likely reduce the cost of transferring money around the world because the marginal cost of using it will be so low and facebook is so prevalent with about 2 4 billion users travelers and migrants often pay excessive fees to move money from one country to another in a testament to the expected impact of libra on the average cost of sending money facebook s announcement sent the stock of western union a major mover of money internationally plummeting the risks of a cash free society if libra is a success it will surely speed up the movement toward more countries becoming cashless societies while some such as facebook founder mark zuckerberg may favor this outcome i believe there are two important downsides to going cash free one is that it disenfranchises the poor elderly and unbanked who would be pushed further to the margins of society and possibly become unable to take part in modern commerce although the price of an individual virtual currency transaction may be lower there are still many nontrivial costs necessary to connecting to the digital society for starters you will need a smart phone and an internet connection to use libra both of which come with regular costs and fees concerns over disenfranchisement have lead to places like philadelphia san francisco and the state of new jersey passing laws to ban cashless stores second a cashless society makes a country s entire economy more vulnerable to disruptions that s because a cash free economy depends on several things always working a stable supply of electricity constant communications networks and robust security if one fails digital transactions won t work two recent news stories impressed on me just how vulnerable the power grid is the u s government recently acknowledged that it s deploying malware and viruses inside russia s electrical grid that could cripple it that s because the u s believes the russians are already inside america s power grid of course there doesn t need to be nefarious intent to see widespread power outages recently the entire power grid collapsed in argentina uruguay and paraguay tens of millions people were without power for hours and some had no power for a day the same thing has happened in parts of the united states software viruses or accidents that shut down the electrical grid may not be lethal to humans but they can kill a cashless economy will libra lives up to zuckerberg s lofty economic goals and empower billions of people time will tell but meanwhile call me a skeptic the consequences of one day relying entirely on ones and zeroes to power our economies is worrisome jay l zagorsky is an associate professor at boston university this article is republished from the

business economy economic managers would need to do more to raise the current levels of capital inflows into the country write kunle aderinokun and james emejo apparently signifying a rare demonstration of the increasing confidence of international investors in the country the central bank of nigeria cbn last week disclosed that total foreign capital flows into the country stood at 14 2 billion between january and may 2019 it further explained that foreign direct investment fdi accounted for 2 87 billion representing 20 18 per cent of the total amount according to cbn director corporate communications mr isaac okorafor in a statement the increased capital importation for the period was contrary to a reuters report which had indicated that the country s fdis slumped last year but reuters had quoted the world investment report 2019 recently released by unctad on foreign direct investment fdi to african countries the attention of the central bank of nigeria cbn has been drawn to the news item on reuters quoting world investment report 2019 recently released by unctad on fdis to african countries the statement said the unctad report had alleged a decrease of over 40 per cent in fdi inflows to nigeria in 2018 according to the apex bank while the cbn is not privy to the methodology used in arriving at the figures we wish to state that available records show a significant increase in fdi in nigeria during the period 2018 contrary to the reuters report for instance in 2018 the total capital inflows to the country stood at 19 07 billion out of which fdi accounted for 7 78 billion furthermore total capital flows to nigeria from january to may 2019 stood at 14 2 billion of which fdi accounted for 2 87 billion representing a 20 18 per cent of the total amount the country continues to enjoy steady capital flows due to the prevailing stable macroeconomic environment and sustained investors confidence in the economy against this background we wish to urge the public to take advantage of several publications by the cbn and the national bureau of statistics nbs which give adequate and accurate statistics on the subject matter although the cbn announcement was positive for the economy not many analysts expected an improved inflows in the period under review this is partly because of the general election which was conducted within the quarter as investors had pulled out their funds for fears of uncertainty as well as the investment appetite created the us federal reserves which had raised lending rates billions of naira had reportedly lost in the nation s capital market in the build up to the elections as well as post elections particularly as investors await the economic direction of president muhammadu buhari following his re election for a second term the capital importation report for the first quarter of the year is yet to be released by the national bureau of statistics nbs however compared to inflows in 2018 the results appeared to be significant going by the cbn disclosure according to the nbs the total value of capital importation into the country in 2018 stood at 16 81 billion compared to 12 22 billion 2017 representing 37 49 per cent growth year on year portfolio investment which accounted for 70 20 per cent 11 80 billion of total capital importation for 2018 followed by other investment which accounted for 22 69 per cent 3 81 billion of total capital while foreign direct investment fdi accounted for 7 11 per cent 1 19 billion of total capital imported last year earlier in may the executive secretary chief executive nigerian investment promotion commission nipc ms yewande sadiku had disclosed that about 90 9 billion worth of investments were recorded in the country last year adding that there were 92 existing projects covering 23 states and the fct she however cautioned that the investment announcements were not actual investments but nevertheless give us direction and a sense of investor interest in nigeria according to her 33 per cent of the investments came from nigerian investors which according to her was consistent with government s efforts to get nigerians to invest in their own county other investment sources according to her included the uae france and uk she said we actually track it so that at the end of the quarter half year month or full year we can say this is the total value of investment announcements that were made we look at where the investments are supposed to be coming from remember they are announcements and not investments the announcements related to mining and quarrying and oil and gas manufacturing construction transportation and storage interestingly sadiku had joined other top government officials to draw attention to the fact that investor interest in the first quarter of 2019 could be less than the same period in 2018 because of election concerns this same concern was re echoed by the former minister of budget and national planning senator udoma udo udoma who also warned that first quarter growth estimates could be disappointing as it is often a difficult period for the economy nonetheless some analysts who spoke with thisday found the news that foreign capital inflows picked up in the first quarter difficult to digest while others played down the figures commenting on the development founder chief executive officer global analytics consulting limited mr tope fasua said the cbn claim is untenable because if we all agree that the period of politics in any country is a period for investor caution then it s unlikely that investor confidence returned even as the elections went on the elections are even still in contention so the explanation for increased capital inflow is political and not economic the macroeconomic environment is certainly not yet stable except we ignore our low gdp growth rate and rising inflation in the face of a healthy population growth the government is only now just speaking about our out of school children he said however i am not doubting that capital flow may have spiked in the period a singular transaction may have skewed the statistics in that manner the inflows could also have gone into portfolio investments which are fleeting in nature the cbn should try and be more intellectual in theory pronouncements and not be drawn into the politics of the day as we all work together to find an economy that truly works also economist and former director general abuja chamber of commerce and industry acci mr chijioke ekechukwu said the cash inflow was not as a result of increase in direct foreign investments but inflow of funds for the purpose of funding and executing the elections recall that 2018 ended with nigeria having up to 36 per cent decline in dfis this was as a result of uncertainty of the economic and political space of the country having a total capital inflow of 14 2 billion in the first five months of 2019 is not anything to celebrate our contemporaries in west africa ghana did more than that in investments as against mere inflow also speaking to thisday director union capital market limited egie akpata said the capital inflows quoted by cbn on the surface look very impressive particularly in the context of the pre election uncertainly in q1 however the cbn would need to disclose the amount that was long term fdi and short term fpi 1 year treasury bills were yielding over 17 per cent until the march elections so it is easy to see why fpi would rush into this market to earn such rates when coupled with the drop in us interest rates driven by the federal reserve change in outlook it is not surprising that fpi would flow into nigeria where rates are over 10 per cent higher than similar tenor in usa the real test is to see what the inflows look like in the current lower interest rate environment judging by the trend of cbn foreign reserve movements it is unlikely that the data of the first 5 months of 2019 would be repeated however professor of economics and public policy at the university of uyo akwa ibom state prof akpan ekpo said while the accretion was positive for the country efforts should be intensified to boost domestic production he said i suspect that for a while now the exchange rate has been quite stable and the cbn opened another window for importers and exporters and there has been a lot of activities in the foreign exchange and that must have been responsible for the increased capital inflow
oil s recent spike is an end product of a series of events that took place earlier this week first the mounting tension between the united states and iran reached a new high after the latter shot down a drone of the former also opec and its allies decision to meet next month fed s signal of a rate cut and optimism around u s china trade talks in the upcoming g20 summit boosted oil prices significantly in such a scenario investing in energy mutual funds seems prudent oil prices jump on rising us iran tension oil prices climbed on jun 20 after an iranian surface to air missile shot down a u s military surveillance drone above the strait of hormuz according to a cnbc report while u s officials said the drone was in international airspace iran claimed it was over iranian territory on jun 20 the u s west texas intermediate wti rose 2 89 or 5 4 to settle at 56 65 marking the biggest daily gain since december the global benchmark brent crude surged 4 5 to settle at 64 61 a barrel the highest since may 31 and biggest one day jump since jan 9 this incident comes amid ongoing tensions between the united states and the middle eastern country which largely arises from u s sanctions aimed at reducing iranian oil exports to zero level recent incidents such as the united states blaming iran of attacking oil tankers in the gulf of oman have also put the two countries in a precarious situation this tense situation in the middle east could drive oil prices higher in the coming weeks this is because one fifth of the world s oil output comes from the region and the strait of hormuz which is a crucial waterway for the free passage of oil likely fed rate cut u s china trade talks could push oil federal reserve s signal of a rate cut and u s china s upcoming trade talks during the g20 summit also helped oil prices move north federal reserve chairman jerome powell signaled earlier this week that the central bank may cut benchmark interest rates in the weeks ahead if the economic outlook resulting from u s china trade tensions doesn t improve the rates are in a range of 2 25 2 50 at present a rate cut would boost growth in the united states which could lead to higher energy consumption story continues also the fact that president donald trump and his chinese counterpart are set to discuss trade issues extensively in japan next month raises optimism around the prospect of a favorable trade deal this could boost oil prices as well opec could keep output cuts intact finally the opec and its allies which produce more than 50 of crude worldwide have finally concluded on a date for their next meeting the oil producing countries will meet in vienna on july 1 2 to discuss if their output curbs will be extended till the end of 2019 an extended production cut would reduce inventories at the rate of about 500 000 barrels a day in the latter half of the year which could further push oil prices higher our choices as oil prices are widely expected to move higher in the

the public policy institute of california ppic estimates there is a 75 percent probability that the state s next recession will result in a severe financial crisis ppic was established 25 years ago by william hewlett co founder of hewlett packard to provide nonpartisan research regarding the state s population economy governance and public finance issue responding to gov gavin newsome s may revised 147 billion california for all general fund budget ppic s independent analysis warns we estimate that a relatively mild recession would produce a drop in total general fund revenue between 28 billion and 36 billion spread over three years should the state experience a moderate recession revenue declines would range between 69 billion and 100 billion over four years and finally in a severe recession declines would be even deeper between 173 billion and 185 billion over five years california has a very volatile revenue stream as evidenced by the severe last recession that began in 2008 and persisted for five years saw state revenues fall by an average of 26 percent or about 37 billion annually revenues in the mild three year dot com bust suffered a 6 percent annual decline the two prior recessions are considered moderate with the 5 year early 1990s slump experiencing a 14 percent annual revenue declines and the early 1980s oil shock seeing 12 percent annual declines ppic highlights that as california general fund spending grew at over twice the rate of inflation the source of state budget revenue shifted dramatically over the past 60 years in 1960 state revenues were broadly distributed with sales and use taxes accounting for 55 percent of revenue and pit adding about 20 percent but the 2019 2020 general fund relies on personal income tax for over 70 percent of revenues california s dependence on pit is the result of regularly steepening the progressive income tax rate structure that increases as taxpayer s income rises in 2016 the top 1 percent of california income earners accounted for just 23 percent of reported state adjusted gross incomes but paid 46 percent of all california personal income taxes any upward spikes or downward plunges in income experienced by this wealthy subsection of californians population is directly magnifies surpluses and deficits in the state s total revenue the biggest annual income variability for the 1 percent comes from u s stock market capital gains or losses especially from silicon valley tech stocks in the last recession capital gains taxes fell by 80 percent california has reserve funds but state law mandates the legislature and the governor must produce a balanced budget although spending cuts were enacted during the past four recessions a variety of constitutional constraints federal regulations and court decisions have increasingly restricted the number of items that can legally be cut as a result of california slashing and deferring spending in prior recessions voter initiatives increased the share of spending supported by special funds such as gasoline and diesel taxes that goes into a lockbox to only pay for road building and maintenance california has also been able to balance its budgets during recessions by engaging in short term borrowing from certain special funds and convincing voters in 2004 to pass proposition 57 that approved borrowing 15 billion in economic recovery bonds from investors but ppic revealed it took 19 billion and 11 years to pay off the debt ppic states that california engaged in highly questionable small dollar actions in the last recession that included shifting state employee pay dates accelerated taxpayer withholding dates and moved a quarterly public pension payment from june to july the u s federal government s share of california state spending spiked during the last recession from under 30 percent in 2009 to about 45 percent in 2010 and continues to hover at about 35 percent but with the national debt more than doubling over the last decade california is at risk from efforts to cut unsustainable federal spending ppic predicts that california is likely to experience a recession in the near future and given the state s volatile tax structure even a mild economic downturn will have a significant fiscal impact with only one of the last four recession considered mild there is a high probability the next california recession will cause a financial crisis

disenfranchises the poor elderly and unbanked who would be pushed further to the margins of society and possibly become unable to take part in modern commerce although the price of an individual virtual currency transaction may be lower there are still many nontrivial costs necessary to connecting to the digital society for starters you will need a smartphone and an internet connection to use libra both of which come with regular costs and fees concerns over disenfranchisement have lead to places like philadelphia san francisco and the state of new jersey passing laws to ban cashless stores vulnerable economy second a cashless society makes a country s entire economy more vulnerable to disruptions that s because a cash free economy depends on several things always working a stable supply of electricity constant communications networks and robust security if one fails digital transactions won t work two recent news stories impressed on me just how vulnerable the power grid is the u s government recently acknowledged that it s deploying malware and viruses inside russia s electrical grid that could cripple it that s because the u s believes the russians are already inside america s power grid of course there doesn t need to be nefarious intent to see widespread power outages recently the entire power grid collapsed in argentina uruguay and paraguay the consequences of one day relying entirely on ones and zeroes to power our economies is worrisome tens of millions of people were without power for hours and some had no power for a day the same thing has happened in parts of the u s software viruses or accidents that shut down the electrical grid may not be lethal to humans but they can kill a cashless economy will libra lives up to zuckerberg s lofty economic goals and empower billions of people time will tell but meanwhile call me a skeptic but the consequences of one day relying entirely on ones and zeroes to power our economies is worrisome this article

for decades economists and health care experts have warned about flawed incentives and rising costs in america s system for employer sponsored health insurance that system through which more than 150 million americans get their coverage has proven difficult to reform until now last week the white house finalized a new rule that allows employers to fund health reimbursement arrangements hras that can be used by workers to buy their own coverage on the individual market this subtle technical tweak has the potential to revolutionize the private health insurance market today employer based health coverage is a defined benefit if and only if an employer buys group coverage for its employees the value of that benefit is excluded from taxation the joint committee on taxation estimates this tax break is worth more than 300 billion a year a big tax break may sound good but this one creates perverse incentives in the employer based market not only is a third party the insurer paying for health care but another third party the employer is choosing and funding the insurance plan call it ninth party health care in this system workers almost entirely lack the tools they need to shop for low cost high quality health care services for the typical worker 80 percent of health care is paid for through insurance without transparency into the price of health insurance workers lack transparency into the price of health care the employer tax exclusion is also highly regressive because those in higher tax brackets receive a larger benefit from the rule than those in lower ones silicon valley programmers and manhattan lawyers get a far bigger tax break for health insurance than do cashiers or truck drivers in 2008 gop presidential nominee john mccain proposed replacing the tax exclusion for employer sponsored health insurance with a fixed 2 500 credit with which to buy coverage on the open market the idea was pilloried by then sen barack obama who said it would tax health benefits for the first time ever meaning higher income taxes for millions in reality it was obama s affordable care act that introduced the first tax on employer sponsored health insurance in the decade since the cost of employer based coverage has continued to rise deductibles have more than tripled since 2008 a new study from the rand corp finds that on average hospitals charge those with private insurance 2 4 times what they charge medicare for the same services enter president trump and his team at the national economic council led by larry kudlow the council found an elegant way to give employers the opportunity to voluntarily convert their health benefits from a defined benefit into a defined contribution for example an employer could fund an hra for each worker and their family which they could then use to shop for a plan that best suits their needs the administration estimates that as many as 800 000 employers mostly smaller businesses will choose this option expanding health care choices for 11 million workers in the next decade these employers will benefit from having fiscal certainty over their health expenditures and workers will benefit from being able to choose their coverage and take it from job to job furthermore if those estimates are right the new rule could dramatically expand the market for individually purchased health insurance encouraging more plans to enter the market and lowering premiums for all participants the white house estimates that the rule could expand the number of americans with health insurance coverage by as many as 800 000 the trump hra rule should be seen as the beginning not the end of reforms to improve the quality of private health insurance congress also needs to repair the individual market for health insurance by reforming obamacare era regulations that punish young and healthy people for buying coverage and the white house should consider building on the hra rule by requiring that all newly incorporated businesses seeking the tax break for employer coverage do so through hras such a reform would preserve traditional employer based group health insurance for those who have it while ensuring that start ups that evolve into the googles and apples of the future deploy the new model together over time these changes would give workers more transparency into and more control over the health care dollars that are now spent by other people on their behalf that transparency and control in turn would create a powerful market incentive for health care payers and providers to lower prices and increase quality some in washington want to take health insurance choices away from workers and replace them with the diktats of politicians the trump initiative moves in the opposite direction placing health care choices right where they have always belonged in the hands of hard working americans roy president of the foundation for research on equal opportunity and a former policy adviser to mitt romney rick perry and marco rubio
cleveland ohio chris alvarado likes to joke that when he became executive director of slavic village development he thought the full name of the neighborhood was slavic village the epicenter of the foreclosure crisis because that is so often how people refer to the neighborhood but it s true alvarado said we had the highest number of foreclosures of any zip code in the country 44105 back in 2008 2009 the neighborhood has come a long way since then housing sales are up home values are up too bringing a restoration of wealth to a predominantly african american community that saw values plummet in the foreclosure crisis alvarado credits much of this progress to his organization s partnership with the cuyahoga county land reutilization corp the land bank that formed 10 years ago this month in response to the foreclosure crisis as it marks this anniversary the land bank is evaluating the impact of its first decade in operation and preparing for its next chapter that impact according to a recent study is 1 43 billion a figure that takes into account the organization s role in restoring property values by demolishing and rehabilitating distressed structures returning properties to cuyahoga county s tax rolls and bolstering the local economy with the money it has spent and private sector investments it has spurred the land bank s biggest impact has come from the program that represents the bulk of its work to date demolition of vacant and abandoned properties but with demolition funds dwindling and significant progress made on tearing down the county s most blighted properties the organization is preparing to pivot including expanding its roles in rehabilitation and both residential and commercial development stopping the hemorrhaging the county treasurer s office had seen an uptick in foreclosures for several years in the mid 2000s but by 2008 the county had a full blown crisis on its hands the properties were coming through tax foreclosure like a firehose vacant and abandoned properties recalled gus frangos land bank president and general counsel at the time he worked for then county treasurer jim rokakis what became very clear especially in 2008 was ok now we need a responsible repository that can triage these properties and at least try to manage this chaos rokakis spearheaded the effort to create an organization that could work seamlessly with government agencies but that would have the teeth needed to operate speedily frangos helped write the legislation that created the land bank in 2009 it was set up as a nonprofit entity that would act as the clearinghouse for vacant and abandoned properties shepherding the properties through the foreclosure process and then putting them back to some kind of productive use it would be supported by a reliable funding source 7 million set aside each year from the penalties and interest on delinquent taxes the county collected supplemented by government grants and the proceeds from properties it sold the theory behind it was to have a nimble transactional entity outside of government that was properly funded that could try to stabilize the real estate market frangos said and back then we could not really stabilize anything until we stopped the hemorrhaging for much of the last decade that meant the land bank s primary objective was tearing down vacant abandoned properties that were depressing real estate values initially there was some pushback from some who were concerned about such drastic changes to neighborhoods and who wanted to see more structures preserved but ultimately stopping the bleeding became the first priority by the end of this summer it will have completed approximately 8 000 demolitions it has been aided in this work by a 50 million demolition fund established by the county in 2014 for many cuyahoga county communities the program was a lifeline community leaders in the city and suburbs alike say they benefited from the expertise of the land bank s staff relied on them to come up with plans to address thousands of problem properties and appreciated the land bank s streamlined process the land bank has really been our partner in recovering from the housing crisis in northeast ohio said jennifer kuzma director of the first suburbs consortium an advocacy group representing 18 cleveland suburbs without them i don t know what some of my cities would have done they were able to come in and assist in a very capable and efficient way to make headway through the problem housing that many of my cities had in their stock following the foreclosure crisis of 2008 cuyahoga county council president dan brady points to the breadth of support the land bank has won over the years i think it s one of the most positive things we can point to in the last 10 years in the region for economic development and what i call community development he said it s been a remarkable achievement moving the needle to quantify what its impact over the last 10 years has been the land bank commissioned a study from dynamo metrics a michigan based firm that uses data to evaluate public sector investments the land bank will share the results wednesday at an event at cleveland state university s maxine goodman levin college of urban affairs the analysis is based on a model built with data from case western reserve s center on urban poverty and development dynamo calculated that cclrc spent approximately 79 million on nearly 7 000 demolitions from 2009 to january 2019 breaking down to an average of 11 380 spent per unit on average each demolition resulted in nearly 60 000 in property value benefit to neighboring homes or about 5 26 for every 1 spent on demolition the total impact was 415 3 million on the property rehab side the study puts the land bank s spending at about 56 3 million over the same time period or 26 535 per rehabilitation on average the total property value affected was 320 6 million and on average a rehabilitation had an impact of 151 105 in restored property value according to dynamo s analysis additionally the study attributes to the land bank 18 5 million in tax revenue generated by 11 500 distressed properties that were returned to the tax rolls since 2009 305 5 million in economic impact from the land bank s expenditures and 57 3 million from the impact of private sector rehabilitation expenditures spurred by the land bank nigel griswold an economist and co founder ceo of dynamo metrics also pointed to another highlight of his team s findings while previous research suggested that demolitions and rehabilitations in the county s weakest markets did not affect neighboring property values that is now changing this is the first study where there s enough value in the weakest areas where we re starting to see an impact he said that alone is a huge needle moving for cleveland and for cuyahoga county what s next with the number of vacant and abandoned homes now at pre 2008 levels and county demolition dollars running out the land bank is shifting its focus frangos the land bank s president detailed a long list of priorities and goals including an expanded role in home rehabilitation providing access to capital to low and moderate income people who are having trouble getting home loans or closing the gap between their loan and the home price an expanded role helping local social service organizations fulfill their housing needs land assembly for economic development projects building homes in areas where housing markets do not currently exist experimenting with development concepts such as container homes investing in catalytic community development oriented projects expanding its role in real estate development providing code enforcement services to local municipalities the move away from demolitions has some concerned particularly because most of the remaining blighted properties are concentrated in east side neighborhoods and suburbs there are so many abandoned structures still sitting out there that are in need of demolition and where s the money going to come from said ward 8 cleveland city councilman mike polensek who represents north shore collinwood collinwood village and part of glenville especially on the east side we re going to be left with a major problem the city has its own demolition program that will continue with its work but polensek expressed doubt about its capability to pick up the slack the cuyahoga land bank has taken down more derelict structures than the city has at least in my ward to me that says a whole lot about the city s ability to take down structures others say that the worst of the worst have already been torn down and they are now comfortable turning their attention to structures that can be saved plus the land bank will still have funds available for targeted demolitions for example it may tear down a blighted property near a home that is being rehabilitated many of the land bank s partners have also expressed a desire to see it expand its role in rehabilitation and development the county for example approved a new six year 30 million housing program in which the land bank will take a leading role the program which starts in 2020 has three components home renovation which will have the land bank getting vacant properties up to code homeowner assistance for which the county is setting aside about 1 million a year for home loans and other forms of assistance and a future markets initiative which will focus on restoring and creating real estate markets in areas that have not yet recovered from the foreclosure crisis the land bank is already starting this work such as with a planned project to build six to eight homes behind the greater cleveland fisher house in glenville right now there are no there frangos said our job is to try to go into places where there is a difficult market and jump start it while the land bank has played a critical role in several large scale economic development projects already such as assembling the land required to convert the former randall park mall into an amazon fulfillment center some see an opportunity for it to take on a larger role the amazon site in north randall is pictured while it was under construction google earth google earth the land bank helped assemble the land needed to build this amazon fulfillment center in north randall where randall park mall once stood jordyn grzelewski there s more opportunity on the horizon for the land bank to be involved in those commercial economic development opportunities said nate kelly cushman wakefield cresco managing director and a land bank board member our clients that are here or the ones that want to be here need sites to expand they re not experts in site assembly or clearing title but the land bank is they ve generated so much credibility in being able to identify development opportunities on the residential side kelly added expanding that further on the commercial side is a natural next step alvarado too would like the land bank s help building new homes on vacant land in slavic village and revitalizing the neighborhood s commercial district hopefully in the next couple of years we ll have several businesses that will have opened shop on property that came through the land bank he said
seoul jun 23 korea bizwire south korea s finance ministry is expected to slightly cut its growth estimate for the year in the face of a delayed recovery in chip prices and the escalating trade dispute between the united states and china sources said sunday the south korean government has been adhering to the stance that asia s fourth largest economy will gather pace during the second half of the year on the back of an improvement in prices of chips a major export item for the country and expanded fiscal spending but a decline in chip prices is not showing signs of a let up and the american sino trade war is forecast to last longer than expected they said the finance ministry has been expecting the economy to grow between 2 5 percent and 2 6 percent this year and it would cut the range by 0 1 percentage point or more they said most think tanks and global institutes have already sharply trimmed their outlook for the economy the bank of korea bok trimmed its estimate to 2 5 percent from 2 6 percent the state run korea development institute put its estimate at 2 4 percent foreign investment banks put out an average estimate of 2 3 percent growth for the south korean economy with nomura being the most pessimistic with a forecast of 1 8 percent expansion more recently global credit appraiser fitch ratings substantially slashed its growth outlook for south korea s economy this year to 2 percent from its earlier 2 5 percent estimate citing weaker underlying momentum global investment bank goldman sachs also revised down its growth outlook for south korea s economy this year to 2 1 percent from its previous forecast of 2 3 percent the south korean economy expanded 2 7 percent in 2018 down from a solid 3 1 percent the previous year seoul s exports have been on the decline since december amid the escalating trade tensions between the world s two largest economies shipments to china the world s single largest importer of south korean products have also been on the wane since november exports of semiconductors the bellwether for the country s exports continued to decline last month outbound shipments of chips reached us 7 53 billion in may falling a whopping 30 percent from a year earlier and shipments of petrochemical products also nose dived 16 2 percent over the period to 3 66 billion on weaker demand from china government data showed south korea s exports fell 10 percent in the first 20 days of june from a year earlier on weaker global demand for semiconductors heralding that this month s outbound shipments would not be good as well the economy unexpectedly contracted 0 3 percent in the first quarter of the year from three months earlier marking the worst performance in a decade due to a sharper than expected dip in exports and facility investment in a bid to buttress the economy against a slowdown the government front loaded its budget spending with the goal of implementing 61 percent of its annual budget in the first six months of the year in april the government also proposed a 6 7 trillion won 5 6 billion extra budget but it is still pending at the national assembly due to a political standoff against this backdrop the bok is increasingly facing calls to cut its policy rate currently at 1 75 percent to help the economy stay on a growth track amid low inflation the central bank has kept the rate unchanged since november but it is widely expected to cut the benchmark rate next month at the earliest the bank is also set to release its revised growth forecast in mid july meanwhile the finance ministry is set to unveil its economic policy plans for the second half of the year early next month which center on measures to boost business spending and private spending amid flagging exports the measures may include a wide range of tax incentives to encourage corporate spending the sources said earlier finance minister hong nam ki stressed that more bold action is needed to kick start corporate capital spending and private spending as well yonhap

the new york times asked all 23 democratic presidential candidates for their views on the best ways to improve the health care system we received responses from 19 of them the first three questions asked whether the candidates supported three possible routes for changing how americans receive health insurance by creating a medicare for all system that would eliminate private insurance by providing a choice between a public option health care plan run by the government and private insurance or by making more modest changes to the affordable care act candidates could indicate support for more than one option but in the fourth question we asked which of the three options would be the best way to improve the health care system and that is where a split in the field was revealed the survey also included several other questions about health insurance and coverage how the candidates would finance their plans and other matters like prescription drug prices
a part from being an economist and columnist for this paper i am also a business owner of a medium sized food group and a country head of an american multi national firm like many involved in the food business and investments 2017 and 2018 were good years for us the favorable business conditions in our industries is something we are grateful for and do not take for granted suffice to say that we have outgrown our two rented offices in the ortigas center and must now look for bigger spaces to accommodate our expansion this time we are contemplating investing in the property instead of just renting it after all it will look better on our balance sheet if our office space forms part of our asset account rather than a monthly operating expense the idea of purchasing office space prompted me to look deeper into the real estate industry is the property market facing a bubble is it the right time to buy are property values seen to increase in the medium term how strong is demand in the re sale market will it be easy to rent if ever we decide to do so the collective industry reports from the country s three experts colliers international jones lang lasalle and leechiu consultants provided me the answers fortunately they all tell the same story lets talk about the worst case scenario first is the property market in the midst of a price bubble it will be recalled that the steep rise in property prices in metro manila over the last seven years raised rumors of a bubble last year with all factors taken to account the three property experts refute the idea saying that if one compares property prices today versus what it was in 1997 the year of the financial crisis you will find that current prices are still 20 cheaper than it was back then when adjusted for inflation besides the experts argue the majority of buyers today acquire property to use not to speculate the price increases are justified by the spike in demand four sectors are driving demand for office spaces in metro manila the largest is still the it bpo industry although growth in this sector decelerated from double digits to just seven percent this year it still comprises 41 of total take up offshore gaming operations from china is another driver comprising 28 of take up growing rapidly too are flexible workspaces such as wework kmc penbrothers and regus who collectively lapped up four percent of all available office spaces in the city other large consumers of space are the finance insurance industry tech companies and multinational companies as of the end of 2018 metro manila had an inventory of 11 01 million square meters sqm of grade a and b office space with 2 88 million sqm more coming on line between 2019 and 2023 the bulk of new office spaces 725 000 sqm to be exact is presently being built in the ortigas pasig mandaluyong corridor makati bgc quezon city and the bay area each have between 400 000 to 580 000 sqm in the pipeline alabang and las piñas have 192 000 sqm under construction what is interesting is that out of the 2 88 million sqm under construction 28 is already pre leased or pre sold this is a strong indication of strength in demand it is therefore safe to assume that prices will continue to climb in the medium term there has been a mad rush for peza certified buildings since the investment agency stopped awarding new certifications in the national capital region region a few years ago from 2019 to 2023 only 19 buildings were awarded peza certifications leaving in limbo 48 other application peza hopes that limiting the number of peza certified buildings in metro manila will induce developers to expand outside the city center thereby paving the way for development and employment opportunities in provincial areas it is also a way to shore up generous incentives given to it bpo companies these companies need to be located in peza certified buildings to qualify for a package of fiscal incentives hence having the opportunity to invest in a peza building will ensure easy rentals at premium rates and tremendous value appreciation as far as vacancies are concerned unsold or unleased properties were lowest in the bay area alabang and makati at one percent two percent and three percent of total inventory respectively as of the end of 2018 vacancy rates stood at six percent in ortigas pasig mandaluyong and seven percent in bgc it was highest in quezon city at 15 the nature of our business requires us to be in the center of the financial district hence we are looking at properties in the fort makati and ortigas areas we do not require the building to be brand new but we factored out those that are seven years or older also important is for the developer to have a good track record in construction maintenance and management in bgc we looked at the new finance center building for a 245 sqm space the asking price is p61 2 million or roughly p250 000 per square meter in ortigas there are no new grade a buildings for sale the new bdo towers above the podium mall are exclusively for lease the next best option is the 25 year old tektite tower whose office space goes for p73 000 per sqm in makati we are looking into the stiles enterprise plaza for which the going rate is p250 000 per square meter our analysis would not be complete without looking into lease rates we found that lease rates for grade a office spaces in makati is most expensive at p1 300 to 1 600 per sqm depending on the age of the building this represents a 100 increase from rental rates in 2010 rates in bgc range from p1 000 to p1 400 per square meter a 140 increase from what it was nine years ago having the lowest rise in least rates is quezon city whose rental costs stand at p600 to p800 per sqm a mere 40 uptick from a decade ago alabang properties command between p650 and p750 per sqm while those in ortigas pasig mandaluyong go for as low as p500 per sqm taking all the information into consideration my board and i concluded that the office property market in metro manila is in the midst of a long road of growth which will ride in tandem with the economy for as long as the economy grows at its current pace the momentum of the property market will follow in fact studies show that office space value will spike anew in 2022 when demand outstrips supply several analysts equate the manila property paradigm to that of hong kong in the early 1980s so what can foil the otherwise rosy picture of the property market eco political turbulence these include uncertainty brought about by shifting tax laws the specter of federalism and the uncertainty it brings government s pro china foreign policy backfiring and a deteriorating current account deficit so in the end we conclude that the risks to the property market are not due to weaknesses from within nor demand supply issues the risks are external far as long as one has confidence in the government and the policies it espouses then investing in property is a safe bet andrew j masigan is an economist

has actually imposed have been modest 25 percent on 250 billion in chinese imports to the u s and some steel and aluminum imports his threats are anything but currently in play are 25 percent on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports and about 275 billion in vehicle imports businesses appear spooked by the president s capricious trade policy moody s analytics global business confidence survey which asks respondents nine questions about their operations is as weak as it has been since the economy began its ascent out of the financial crisis a decade ago duke university s quarterly survey of cfos is even more pessimistic with about two thirds of respondents saying a recession is likely by the end of 2020 and morgan stanley s business conditions index which is designed to capture turning points in the economy suffered its largest one month decline on record in may recession angst is also evident among investors in treasury bonds long term treasury yields have fallen sharply since last fall as investors are strongly betting the fed will lower the federal funds rate several times by the end of the year to ward off an even weaker economy the treasury yield curve as measured by the difference between 10 year and three month treasury yields is firmly inverted that is 3 month yields are higher than 10 year yields i won t explain why but this rarely happens and when it does it has presciently signaled a recession about a year later the curve is not predicting recession yet but it is awfully close it s only consumers that s you who remain seemingly oblivious to the possibility of recession at least so far both the conference board and university of michigan surveys of consumer sentiment are off their highs registered during this expansion but they are still high by historical standards recession will remain at bay as long as consumers stay upbeat and continue spending however consumer confidence is fickle and can evaporate quickly historically all it has taken was a softer job market with job growth slipping to a point where unemployment increased it s not that consumers vigilantly monitor the employment statistics but they quickly sense the weaker job growth the fewer number of open positions and the mounting layoffs it s often not clear what causes consumers to hit the panic button but when they do sentiment falls sharply and recession hits a few months later recessions are the result of a collective loss of faith in the economic future everyone runs for the proverbial bunker to be sheltered from the coming economic storm and by so doing creates the storm investors generally lose faith first selling stocks real estate and riskier bonds businesses follow cutting investment and ultimately pulling back on their payrolls consumers are generally the last to pack it in but when they do it happens quickly there are times when the collective psyche is more vulnerable than others when a thin line separates the optimism that characterizes an expanding economy and the pessimism that pervades a downturn this generally happens well into an economic expansion when imbalances have developed labor markets are overly tight underwriting is too easy leverage is high and liquidity weak asset prices are overvalued and real estate markets overbuilt the line is crossed when something almost anything goes wrong this appears to be one of those times although the imbalances that undermine economic expansions are not fully evident today faith in the economy is fragile president trump s trade war is creating an increasing amount of angst as it clearly could go very wrong recession risks are uncomfortably high
burning trash has a long history in the united states and municipal solid waste incinerators have sparked resistance in many places as an environmental justice scholar who works directly with low income and communities of color i see incineration as a poor waste management option although these plants generate electricity from the heat created by burning trash their primary purpose is waste disposal emissions from burning waste worsen environmental inequalities create financial risks for host communities and reduce incentives to adopt more sustainable waste practices i recently co authored a report that describes signs of decline in the u s waste incineration industry due to many factors they include a volatile revenue model aging plants high operation and maintenance costs and growing public interest in reducing waste promoting environmental justice and combating climate change nonetheless 72 incinerators are still operating today in the u s most of them 58 or 80 are sited in environmental justice communities which we defined as areas where more than 25 of residents are low income people of color or both incinerators worsen cumulative impacts from multiple pollution sources on these overburdened neighborhoods environmental justice flashpoints waste incinerators are heavily concentrated in northeast states and florida areas with high population densities and limited landfill space some of these states also provide favorable economic incentives such as allowing incinerators to earn renewable energy credits for generating electricity in the past year environmental justice advocates have successfully shut down incinerators in detroit michigan and commerce california the detroit incinerator was built in the 1980s and received more than us 1 billion in public investment borne by local taxpayers groups such as breathe free detroit and zero waste detroit rallied residents to oppose the public financing and health burdens that the facility imposed on surrounding environmental justice communities the plant closed in march 2019 the california plant closed in june 2018 after a yearlong campaign by two community based organizations east yard communities for environmental justice and valley improvement projects to prevent incineration from qualifying for state renewable energy subsidies the facility ultimately closed when a 30 year power purchase agreement with the local utility expired leaving it without a sufficient revenue stream aging facilities incineration plants average life expectancy is 30 years three quarters of operating waste incinerators in the united states are at least 25 years old these facilities revenues come primarily from tipping fees that waste haulers pay to dump trash and secondarily from generating electricity these revenue streams are volatile and can undermine the industry s financial stability at least 31 incinerators have closed since 2000 due to issues such as insufficient revenue or inability to afford required upgrades operations and maintenance costs typically increase as plants age and their performance decreases upgrades such as installing new pollution control equipment can cost tens of millions of dollars and sometimes more than us 100 million these large capital expenditures represent risks for host communities which often provide public financing through bonds or tax increases such measures are risky because the waste service and energy contracts that generate revenue are increasingly shorter term and vulnerable to fluctuating market and regulatory conditions as plants age their environmental performance may also degrade over time posing increasing risks to the environment and public health what incinerators burn the composition of municipal solid waste has changed over the past 50 years synthetic materials such as plastics have increased while biogenic compostable materials such as paper and yard trimmings have decreased plastics are particularly problematic for waste handling because they are petroleum based nonbiogenic materials they are difficult to decompose and release harmful pollutants such as dioxins and heavy metals when they are incinerated waste management trends today thanks to the evolution of waste handling options a majority of the materials in municipal solid waste can be composted or recycled this reduces impacts on the environment including air soil and water contamination and greenhouse gas emissions as cities like new york and san francisco adopt zero waste policies that create incentives for diverting waste from landfills or incinerators burning trash will increasingly become obsolete many u s cities and states are adopting aggressive climate change and sustainability goals waste reduction and diversion will play a critical part in meeting these targets the public is increasingly demanding more upstream solutions in the form of extended producer responsibility bills plastic bans and less toxic product redesign there is also a growing movement for less consumptive lifestyles that favors zero waste goals heavy polluters incinerators release many air pollutants including nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxides particulate matter lead mercury dioxins and furans these substances are known to have serious public health effects from increased cancer risk to respiratory illness cardiac disease and reproductive developmental and neurological problems according to recent figures from the waste industry incinerator plants emit more sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide per unit of electricity generated than power plants burning natural gas research on direct health impacts of waste incineration in the united states is limited but a handful of studies from asia and europe where waste incinerators are prevalent offer some insights for example a 2013 study in italy analyzed the occurrence of miscarriages in women aged 15 49 years residing near seven incinerators in northern italy s emilia romagna region and found that increased particulate emissions from the incinerators was associated with an increased risk of miscarriage a single incinerator may burn anywhere from a few hundred tons to several thousand tons of waste per day smaller incinerators typically have lower absolute emissions but can emit more hazardous pollutants for each ton of waste they burn plant emissions also can vary widely based on the heterogeneous composition of municipal waste the age and type of emissions control equipment and how well the plant is operated and maintained over time
