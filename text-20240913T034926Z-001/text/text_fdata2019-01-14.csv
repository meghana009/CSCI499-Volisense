here like most things in this country the dual cuban currency seems impossibly complicated how much money should i take to cuba can i use us dollars can i use the atms in cuba what about tipping in cuba i get so many questions about money in cuba that i wanted to share everything i know about getting money spending money and losing money i ve been based in havana for a year so i wanted to share what i ve learned about the cuban currency it s not as complicated as other people make it appear cuban currency 101 there once was two official currencies in cuba the peso cubano cup which is sometimes called moneda nacional mn and the peso convertible cuc or the cuban convertible peso pronounced cooke or say ooh say 1 cuc 24 cup two decades ago only cubans used cup and tourists used usd and cuc but then everyone started using both and the government finally moved to a one currency system the cup when they did this people also started using usd in cuba in fact there were dollar stores in cuba that only accepted american dollars but in june 2021 the cuban government announced us dollars would no longer be accepted anywhere and you couldn t even deposit them to cuban bank accounts this means tourists coming to cuban resorts who want to tip in international money should use canadian dollars british pounds or euros bills only not coins cuc vs cup why were there two cuban currencies if you re nosey like me i always want to know but why was the cuban currency this way after the collapse of the soviet union which had been cuba s biggest source of revenue cuba entered a special period this is a nice way to say the country was broke and the average cuban lost 12 pounds because there were massive food shortages the country didn t have money and went back to what it knew well tourism it invested in infrastructure and opened to foreigners more about cuba how to find the best tour internet in cuba best havana restaurants 30 cuban foods to try however the cuban government didn t want to return to the time before communism when americans ran the country so the intent was to keep tourists separated and the outside would not contaminate cuba because of this cuba was accused of tourism apartheid cubans were not allowed to enter hotels or tourist areas like varadero in fact cubans were not even allowed to be seen with tourists cuban money was once different from tourist money initially the us dollar was also used in tourism it was technically an illegal cuban currency until 1993 but then in 1994 the cuc was introduced and cuba pegged 1 usd 1 cuc no matter what was happening with the cuban economy in theory cup was used to buy things cubans could afford cuc was used to take advantage of the wealthy things were priced in cup or cuc but not both products quoted in cuc were more expensive and only available to tourists and rich cubans it was essentially a luxury tax against the rich there were special stores where you could buy household items like a pressure cooker or toaster not available elsewhere but the price was always several times more than it would cost outside cuba but it was also a way that the government would regain some money from tourists and affluent cubans today everyone agrees there should only be one cuban currency the cuban government long has promised to do away with the dual currency system as there is no longer a need for separate tourist currency in cuba but combining two systems of money in cuba isn t easy it s similar to germany when they combined the west german and east german mark it is a logistic nightmare to remove one currency printing more of the second currency and to deal with converting debt cadeca in old havana where to get cuban currency cuba has a closed currency it is illegal to take cuban currency out of the country you also cannot get cuban money outside cuba in advance of your trip if you re flying into havana or varadero there is a cadeca or cuban currency exchange office in the airport the cadeca at the airport is open until well after the last flight at night and before the first flight in the morning in havana there are two cadecas outside arrivals but if there is a long line head up to departures as the line is usually smaller you can exchange these currencies at a cadeca canadian dollar cad swiss frank chf euro eur pound sterling gbp japanese yen jpy mexican peso mxn us dollar usd you can also exchange money in cuba here banco metropolitano or bfi banks you ll need basic spanish to tell them where you are staying you will also need your passport you ll need basic spanish to tell them where you are staying cadeca in town if you don t speak spanish just hand them your money and your passport they will give you a receipt and make sure you count the money if you don t speak spanish just hand them your money and they will give you a receipt and make sure you count the money hotels the rate isn t as good but it can be done in english and you probably won t wait in line the rate isn t as good but it can be done in english and you probably won t wait in line black market international dollars always get a better rate on the street however the risk is higher for counterfeit or cuban currency out of circulation many airbnb or casa particular hosts will offer this service it s much safer than a stranger approaching you on the street some cadecas and banks have long lines as cubans also use them to exchange cuban currency do not wait until the last minute to change money should americans bring us dollars euros or canadian dollars all foreign exchange in cuba has a 3 exchange fee so you ll lose an additional 3 on top of the official exchange rate the exchange rates for all foreign currencies is posted here daily new rules on us dollars as of june 2021 it is no longer beneficial for cubans to use us dollars as they cannot deposit them into a bank account or use them at stores the only way they can use it is when they go abroad some cubans go to panama to buy clothing and other goods to return to cuba to sell on the black market but this is a small group of people so if you are canadian european or from the uk tip you can tip in your own currency but usd is not useful atms in havana usually disperse 10s but also sometimes 20s or 5s using an atm in cuba my first visit to cuba i had no idea what the country would be like everything i read made it seem like a country frozen in time wouldn t have atms but cuba isn t frozen in time they have banks and atms my second visit i brought money but also tried using my atm card and it worked when i travel to cuba i do not bring money and exchange it i use atms most atms in cuba only allow a 40 bill max withdrawal so that means if the atm is dispensing 5s you may only be able to get 200 at a time however machines dispensing 20s could give you 800 the airport atms often use higher bills and you can avoid the crowded cadecas atms in havana getting money mid week is best as i find many run out of cuc on fridays and saturdays but overall i have discovered some atms work for me and others don t the atm in the focsa building in vedado works for me as well as the one around the corner at street m and linea for some reason others don t even though they are the same bank in old havana obispo street main tourist street has 2 atms i go to the one attached to a bank across from the free pharmacy museum however using the atm doesn t mean you bypass the 3 currency exchange fee at the cadecas cuba atms charge a 3 fee on top of what your bank charges for international withdrawals also i would never visit a city outside havana without bringing lots of cuban money my debit card may work in havana but there s always a chance in won t work in another town unfortunately american debit and visa cards do not work in cuba it s not cuba s fault it s the american embargo blocking the transaction canadian bank cards that work in cuba other canadians have told me that the following bank debit cards have worked in cuba rbc royal bank of canada td bank only canadian accounts us dollar credit cards issued by td canada trust can no longer be used in cuba scotiabank visa debit cibc debit and visa card bmo mastercard desjardins prepaid visa debit card but not regular debit cards pc financial mastercard triangle canadian tire also read using your phone and internet in cuba note both cibc and td bank have a fraud prevention system where a transaction is first declined and then you will receive a text confirming whether it was you or not you ll need to have your phone roaming in order to either confirm the text or call the bank to confirm it was you british bank cards that work in cuba there are no reported problems using bank cards

commonwealth other international banks that work in cuba the following banks has been confirmed bunq netherlands norwegian bank norway dnb norway mbank slovakia čsob slovakia using credit cards in cuba cuba is a cash based country most places do not have the capacity to take credit cards visa is the most common then mastercard american express does not work in cuba often hotels and resorts will accept credit cards but you will need to show identification instead of carrying your passport out when you travel just take a photo of it on your phone and show it when presenting identification my friends and i negotiated a 2 hour pink convertible tour for 40 cuc how much money will you need in cuba despite all of the economic problems in cuba it is not a cheap country it s not cheap for cubans and it s not cheap for tourists while cuba is known to have some of the cheapest all inclusive packages in the caribbean it is quite expensive to travel independently remember tourism was introduced in the 1990s and independent travel is developing with the possibility of casa particulares paladares and independent tour operators the rule of thumb is 100 per person per day of course you can spend much more than this on luxury hotels and restaurants and on the flip side you can stay in cheap casa particulares drink rum at the malecon and eat peso pizza basic costs in cuba transportation is one of the most expensive aspects my friend is a taxi driver who owns a modern suv and charges 140 180 to drive from havana to varadero on the flip side the viazul bus takes twice as long but is only 10 person you can eat traditional cuban food at a local joint for under 5 or you can eat lobster tail in a restaurant in old havana for 20 the most famous paladar is la guarida in havana which costs roughly 40 cuc per person this is why you rarely see cubans eating here the same is true for drinking a bottle of rum at a store costs 5 and beer are 1 25 1 50 at the stunning hotel packard bar beer is a whopping 6 whereas most other hotels sell it for 3 4 old havana has the most tourists and is the most expensive to get the famous cuba libre cocktail something i ve never seen a cuban actually drink i hate it when i m there and i have to buy water as it can be double the price of my neighbourhood vedado it also tends to have the pricest drinks unless it s happy hour if you want to follow hemingway in cuba you ll find overpriced mojitos and daiquiris step out a bit farther to vedado or centro and you ll still find nightlife but with more cubans and a cheaper price plus some of the best bars in havana are in vedado what if you run out of cuban money the biggest fear for americans is not budgeting enough money and running out without access to cuban atms it s a possibility that you could run out of money there are three ways around it western union americans can send money online you ll need a vpn more here other travelers will need a loved one to do it one hitch it can only be sent to a cuban so you ll need someone you trust to put it in their name airbnb hosts can charge you for additional services the fee appears on your credit card and they can give you the cash find a foreign friend who you can either send money by electronic bank transfer venmo or paypal and then ask them to take out money you ll need to download these apps before you arrive in cuba tip your server well at hotel bars like xanadu in varadero tipping in cuba standard tipping is 10 at restaurants in tourist restaurants feel free to tip more in cuban restaurants my friends usually just leave whatever change is left from their bill at resorts tip your maid 1 per person per day ten cents is acceptable for washroom attendants some people have issues paying to go to the bathroom but it s a voluntary tip if you don t want to pay don t take the toilet paper however keep in mind these people aren t employees they usually buy the toilet paper themselves and keep the bathroom clean instead of looking for a handout they have found a way to earn money if you don t want to pay don t take the toilet paper however keep in mind these people aren t employees they usually buy the toilet paper themselves and keep the bathroom clean instead of looking for a handout they have found a way to earn money you likely won t be driving but cubans pay parqueadores or parking attendants my friend usually pays 25 cents to 1 depending on where we are to make sure no one steals his electric motorcycle musicians you ll find them in bars restaurants on the streets and along the malecon they ll take a few song requests and giving them 1 should you bring gifts for cubans this is a very complicated topic most travelers are told to bring baseballs hats cookware and toiletries to give to cubans there are two issues with this most of the cubans that tourists encounter waiters airbnbs owners taxi drivers are the most well off in cuba you can buy most of these items in major cities the best thing to do is give cuban money instead of gifts tip well so people can buy what they want people in rural areas do not have the same access to every day items but you likely won t encounter them to ensure your gifts are sold leave them at a place of worship both the beth shalom synagogue in vedado on calle j and linea will distribute to needy families as well as st elvira s church in varadero and ministerio jireh cuba in holguin at budget cuban restaurants prices are often on a board and in cup but you can also pay cuc money scams always count your change when i m with cuban friends they always check the restaurant bill and they always count their change about 25 of the time there is a mistake make sure to check your bills and or coins to ensure that you re getting the right cuban currency as change i had a mental block when i first arrived of not wanting to offend people by counting change in front of them that was stupid everyone does it paying for drinks and food if you re ordering a drink at the bar get a menu or first ask how much it is sometimes bartenders like to take advantage of this it happened to me once at a really nice bar two drinks cost me 10 when i gave my cuban friend my drink and complained about the price he was furious i was charged so much he immediately went to see the bartender who did not give us money back but did give us each a second cocktail although tipping is generally 10 some tourist restaurants include a mandatory service charge yet at the famous semi state owned restaurant los nardos our server told us that they don t get those tips i don t know if that was true or not regardless i would not recommend los nardos for its food alone finally i have heard some restaurants have tourist menus and local menus with different prices if you understand spanish always ask for the cuban menu i always just say i m trying to learn more cuban spanish which is true the ché banknote in less than a day you ll notice that ernesto ché guevara is everywhere he was a hero of the revolution and he was also briefly in charge of the central bank for this reason he is also on the three peso nacional banknote and the three peso coin although it is technically worth 15 cents it has a higher street value as tourists love to have them as souvenirs many vendors sell them for 1 3 it s not a bad price for a souvenir however if you re somewhere that has cup just ask if they have one and you can get it for much less cuban slang words for money dinero moneda dolars there are always a million ways to say cuban currency but on top of that cuba has so many slang words for money that do not exist elsewhere also read cuban slang essentials you may also hear these cuban slang words for cuban currency devisa one of the most common terms for cuc

briefing highlights housing downright ugly newmont to buy goldcorp goldcorp rises in premarket markets at a glance lululemon raises outlook brexit bank earnings in spotlight citigroup posts jump in profit what to watch for this week from today s globe and mail some kind of ugly tuesday s report on home sales and prices won t just cap a tumultuous year for canada s housing markets it ll be downright ugly bank of montreal expects the canadian real estate association report to show sales tumbled 16 per cent in december from a year earlier with average prices down 4 per cent the mls home price index though which is considered a better reading is still expected to show a rise of 2 per cent you ve got to keep in mind that the december sales measure is being compared to a year earlier period that saw canadians scrambling to buy a home before the federal bank regulator s new mortgage qualification rules came into effect at the beginning of 2018 december home sales are going to look ugly compared to a year ago as buyers rushed to beat new mortgage rules in the late stages of 2017 said benjamin reitzes bmo s canadian rates and macro strategist mr reitzes who has already seen several local real estate board reports also expects to see that sales fell about 11 per cent in 2018 as a whole which would be the worst showing in a decade as in since 2008 when the financial crisis set in unfortunately 2019 isn t likely to see much of a bounce though sales should be generally steady instead of the sharp pullback seen last year mr reitzes said indeed the big declines in the year over year pace of sales should largely reverse by the end of he added despite the expected chunky year over year decline in december sales still look to be up decently on a seasonally adjusted basis from the prior month separately the teranet national bank home price index released today showed a slump of 0 3 per cent in december marking the third drop in a row over the course of the year prices rose 2 5 per cent the slowest pace since 2009 higher mortgage rates and tougher qualification rules are causing the cooling in most major home resale markets in canada national bank senior economist marc pinsonneault said in releasing the numbers the recent increase in vacant new dwellings may also add to downward price pressure in some markets he added at this juncture we continue to expect a soft landing of the canadian home resale market remember too this is a policy engineered slowdown aimed at cooling inflated markets such as the vancouver and toronto areas and preventing a debt bubble from popping the b c and ontario governments acted first with tax measures on foreign buyers of local property followed by the federal bank regulator the office of the superintendent of financial institutions the goal of course was a soft landing and policy makers seem to have pulled that off at least at this point the bank of canada though noted last week that the adjustment is taking longer than expected possibly because of provincial or local measures or it may be that the economy is more sensitive to the combined effects of the new mortgage underwriting guidelines and higher interest rates central bank governor stephen poloz said as he and his colleagues held interest rates steady where they re expected to stay for some time yet having increased earlier homebuyers are adapting by seeking smaller lower priced homes home sellers are offering lower prices and home builders are adapting to a growing demand for smaller homes he told reporters these adjustments are taking time so we need to continue to monitor the situation carefully but we must keep in mind that the markets in toronto and vancouver were exhibiting a degree of froth and it is always difficult to judge where the market will stabilize once froth has been removed open this photo in gallery bank of canada governor stephen polozchris wattie reuters the other part of all this of course is as mr poloz noted the impact on construction of new homes in fact the bank of canada said in its accompanying monetary policy report last week that it will continue to monitor developments in housing markets to assess how construction is adjusting to the shift in demand toward lower value units factor in too the hit to oil prices which are so key to the fortunes of alberta and others because of the recent fall in oil prices income growth in these provinces is expected to continue to lag the rest of canada the central bank said in addition inventories of vacant new homes in these areas have risen markedly over the past several years and this latest episode could lead to further increases you can see it playing out in the building industry look for example at canada mortgage and housing corp s latest housing starts numbers the total of 214 000 doesn t really tell the story down only a wee bit from 2017 s strong 220 000 but the breakdown sure does as bmo senior economist robert kavcic noted one of the clearest themes was the split between single and multi family construction mr kavcic said the latter referring largely to condos single family starts averaged just 54 900 for all of 2018 the lowest annual total for detached home construction since the depth of the mid 1990s downturn mr kavcic added in a report on the flip side multis ran at a record high 138 800 for the year he added the difference in new supply between these two segments couldn t be starker and various factors such as urban job growth intensification requirements and greenbelts will likely keep this theme in play affordability obviously is also an issue mr kavcic added in an interview though he stressed the demand is there just not the supply read more newmont to buy goldcorp newmont mining corp has struck an

have lost not that the postponement is expected to have made any difference because she s expected to lose this one too open this photo in gallery prime minister theresa maydaniel leal olivas afp getty images the vote was postponed last month to buy the pm some time to convince lawmakers to back the deal she made with the eu but i don t think the result will be any different said bmo senior economist jennifer lee the majority won t pass the deal as is but it will be interesting to see how wide the margin will be she added perhaps the fear of the unknown will push more members of parliament to support her a couple of major brexit supporters seemed to throw in the towel on friday saying that they now believe that brexit will not actually happen the big question of course said ms lee is what happens after and the scenarios abound mrs may will have exactly three days to return to parliament with her plan b as she is legally unable to wash her hands of the situation if when she loses the vote ms lee said noting that labour leader jeremy corbyn has said he ll seek a no confidence vote at some point and then bargain for a sweeter deal with the eu did he ask the eu if they were agreeable to that last i heard pm may s deal was the deal we ve had two and a half years of this no more changes i m paraphrasing and it won t end this week there will be more to ing and fro ing and we will likely see pm may return to brussels to make some tweaks then return to london to share it with her colleagues then go back to brussels and so on so watch the pound as the week wears on and the impact of the currency s fortunes on british stocks although recent brexit developments have led us to abandon our central view that pm may s deal will be ratified when we weigh up the possible brexit outcomes we still think that there is more upside than downside risk for sterling said liam peach of capital economics sterling s recent resilience following a number of defeats over brexit in parliament for the government suggests that a lot of bad news has already been discounted arguably the only uncertainty over tuesday s parliamentary vote on may s brexit deal is the size of the government s defeat over the longer term mr peach said we think that investors will rediscover their appetite for risk in 2020 and that over the course of the next two years as a whole sterling will still be driven up by tighter than expected monetary policy and stronger than expected growth in the u k across the pond as they say the ceos of the major u s banks roll out their fourth quarter

numbers in the eu showed consumer price growth slipping to 1 6 per cent from 1 9 per cent with so called core prices holding at 1 per cent noted cmc s mr hewson against this type of deflationary backdrop it is hard to imagine a scenario where the ecb can credibly conceive of any sort of rate rise this year or any year for that matter particularly at a time when economic growth in europe appears to be stalling friday economists expect statistics canada to report that consumer prices dipped again in december on a monthly basis by 0 3 or 0 4 per cent as prices at the gas pump eased they peg the headline annual inflation rate at 1 7 per cent the same as in november or possibly 1 8 per cent going forward even with oil prices stabilizing in january the headline rate of inflation will decelerate further as a strong reading is set to fall out of the annual calculation said cibc world markets senior economist royce mendes given the low starting point though even just a partial rebound in oil prices could have inflation running near 3 per cent by the end of the year if only for a very short while more news from today s globe and mail

to 40 million higher than outlined in the april 2017 preliminary economic assessment pea given the significant growth in mineral reserves and resources outside of the pea expansion area the company is accelerating underground development to bring these new mineral reserves and resources into the mine plan as well as support mining rates above 1 100 tpd lateral exploration development has also been increased to support the expanded exploration program given the mineral reserve and resource growth to date and ongoing exploration success the company believes the mine life will be more than double the pea as a result the company is investing in surface infrastructure camp kitchen offices and warehouse in 2019 to support the growing mine life phase ii phase iii expansions the phase i expansion was completed in september 2018 expanding the mill to a design capacity of approximately 1 200 tpd the current mine infrastructure can support similar mining rates however the operation is currently

declining rate of production through 2019 mine site all in sustaining costs are expected to average 1 200 per ounce in 2019 with approximately 25 of those costs having been previously spent and incurred as a result the company expects a stronger impact on cash flow given the long leach cycle at el chanate residual leaching could continue beyond 2019 however the company will monitor costs to identify when it does not become economically viable to continue recovering gold accounting rules require that a company assess the recovery of inventory at each period end based on the costs included in inventory as at december 31 2018 and the planned spending in 2019 the company does not expect to be able to profitably recover all of the remaining ounces in inventory on the leach pad as a result

the majority of this spending will be focused on construction of the kirazlı project with the bulk of the remainder comprised of capitalized exploration at island gold and exploration permitting and development activities at lynn lake kirazlı development budget the company has been granted the three major permits required for the start of construction of kirazlı including the environmental impact assessment forestry permits and gsm business opening and operation permit there are several additional permits required prior to the start of gold production at kirazlı which the company expects to receive in due course as disclosed in december 2018 the next permit required to meet the construction schedule is an operating license which allows for the start of earthworks on the future open pit the company expects to receive the operating licence during the first quarter of 2019 following receipt of the operating license the company expects to ramp up major construction and earthworks activities putting initial production from kirazlı on track for the second half of 2020 the company spent approximately 17 million of kirazlı s initial capital of 152 million in 2018 with road construction complete and the water reservoir and power line 50 and 85 complete respectively the 2019 budget of 75 million will be focused on completing work on the water reservoir and ramping up

a new day for mexican workers latin america january 14 2019 david bacon nafta had been in effect for just a few months when ruben ruiz got a job at the itapsa factory in mexico city in the summer of 1994 itapsa made auto brakes for echlin a u s manufacturer later bought out by the huge dana aftermarket group in the factory asbestos dust from brake parts coated machines and people alike ruiz had hardly begun his first shift when a machine malfunctioned cutting four fingers from the hand of the man operating it it seemed clear to ruiz that things were very wrong so he went to a meeting to talk about organizing a union when itapsa managers got wind of the effort they began firing the organizers nevertheless many of the workers joined stimahcs an independent democratic union of metalworkers itapsa workers filed a petition for an election but then discovered that they already had a union a unit of the confederation of mexican workers ctm they d never seen the union contract in essence a protection contract which insulates the company from labour unrest the plant s hr manager told ruiz that echlin management in the u s said any worker organizing an independent union should be immediately fired he told me my name was on a list of those people ruiz recounted and i was discharged right there nevertheless there was a vote in september 1997 to decide which union workers wanted but before the election a state police agent drove a car filled with rifles into the plant two busloads of strangers arrived armed with clubs and copper rods during the voting workers were escorted by ctm functionaries past the club and rifle wielding strangers some workers were forcibly kept in a part of the factory to keep them from voting at the polling station employees were asked aloud which union they favored in front of management and ctm representatives stimahcs tried to get the election canceled but the government body administering it the conciliation and arbitration board jca went ahead even after thugs roughed up one of the independent union s organizers predictably stimahcs lost business unions in mexico for 20 years the itapsa election has been a symbol of all that s gone wrong with mexico s labour law which provides protection on paper for workers seeking to organize but which has been routinely undermined by a succession of governments bent on using a low wage workforce to attract foreign investment dana corporation was just one beneficiary itapsa has been the norm not the exception in 2015 thousands of farm workers struck u s growers in baja california instead of recognizing their new independent union however growers signed protection contracts with the ctm which were certified by the local jca strikers were blacklisted later that year workers tried to register an independent union in four juarez factories some 120 workers making ink cartridges for lexmark were fired as were another 170 at adc commscope and many more at foxconn and eaton the labour board declined to reinstate the fired workers in juarez and baja following the pattern it had set at itapsa two decades earlier indeed the jncs have been key to the defeat of workers attempts to form democratic unions invariably protecting employers and corporate friendly unions no more protection contracts the new mexican government headed by president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo says that s all over deputy secretary of labour in the new administration alfredo dominguez marrufo promises that after all these struggles we can finally get rid of the protection contract system we can make our unions democratic choose our own leaders and negotiate our own contracts this government will defend the freedom of workers to organize that right has existed in theory but we ve had a structure making it impossible this will change that could have a big impact on political life in mexico where corporate union leaders have had an inside track to political power and corruption it could change the dominating role u s corporations have played in the mexican economy and affect relations between workers in both countries most of all it would raise a standard of living for workers that lópez obrador has called among the lowest on the planet in his speech to the mexican congress during his december 1 inauguration the new president charged that 36 years of neoliberal economic reforms had lowered the purchasing power of mexico s minimum wage by 60 per cent today on the border that wage comes to a little above 4 per day according to university of california professor harley shaiken the mexican government created an investment climate that depends on a vast number of low wage earners this climate gets all the government s attention while the consumer climate the ability of people to buy what they produce is sacrificed protecting corporations from demands for higher wages has made mexico a profitable place to do business big auto companies the world s major garment manufacturers the global high tech electronic assemblers all built huge plants to take advantage of mexico s neoliberal economic policies starting more than two decades before the negotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta that wild west climate for investors produced more than low wages however between 1988 and 1992 163 juarez children were born with anencephaly without brains an extremely rare disorder health critics charged that the defects were due to exposure to toxic chemicals in the factories or their toxic discharges the chilpancingo colonia below the mesa in tijuana where the battery plant of metales y derivados was located experienced the same plague as the companies came south the people came north during the neoliberal period we became the second country in the world with the highest migration lópez obrador charged they live and work in the united states 24 million mexicans they are sending 30 billion a year to their families the greatest social benefit we receive from abroad in his six year campaign for office in which he spoke in practically every sizeable town in the country lópez obrador repeated what he later told the congress that only development to combat poverty and marginalization as has never been done in history would provide an alternative to migration we will put aside the neoliberal hypocrisy he announced those born poor will not be condemned to die poor we want migration to be optional not mandatory happy where they were born where their family members their customs and their cultures are criticizing neoliberal articles of faith in his speech lópez obrador criticized two other neoliberal articles of faith that privatization of the state owned section of the mexican economy would lead to economic growth and that pro corporate changes in its labour law would create jobs and higher incomes starting before nafta was passed mexican president carlos salinas de gortari rammed through the congress changes in the constitution s guarantees of land reform to make private land ownership easier many of the communal lands ejidos created in previous decades were dissolved and their lands sold to investors farmers became wage workers on land they d previously owned subsequent land reforms led to granting foreign mining companies concessions on over a third of mexico s territory allowing them to develop operations even in the face of local opposition prices on basic goods were decontrolled and government subsidies on food were cut back or ended altogether in 1998 the government dissolved conasupo a system of state run stores selling basic foodstuffs like tortillas and milk at subsidized low prices at the same time price supports for small corn growers were also ended as nafta allowed u s corporations to flood the mexican market with cheap subsidized imported corn millions of farmers were displaced no longer able to sell their corn at a price that paid for growing it mexico is the origin of corn that blessed plant lópez obrador noted bitterly and now we are the nation that imports the most corn in the world he announced that a conasupo like subsidized food production and distribution system would be reestablished privatization marked a 180 degree change in the direction of mexican economic policy after its 1910 20 revolution nationalists believed that to be truly independent mexico had to ensure its resources were controlled by mexicans and used for their benefit the route to this control was nationalization to stop the transfer of wealth out of the country and to set up an internal market in which what was produced in mexico would be sold there as well mexico therefore guaranteed rights to workers that u s unions and workers could only dream of severance pay was mandatory and workers had a right to profit sharing during legal strikes companies had to shut their doors until the dispute was resolved on paper the government acknowledged the right of all people to education and housing in return however mexican unions gave up autonomy and control of their own affairs the government registered unions and oversaw their internal processes and choice of leaders it never tolerated independent action by workers and unions outside its political structure when the government changed its basic economic policy using low wages to attract foreign investment and producing for the u s market instead of for mexico the government could and did punish resistance severely under presidents salinas de gortari and zedillo 1988 2000 privatization reforms became a whirlwind among the companies and industries affected were the aeromexico airline the telephone company the petrochemical industry dependent on the state run oil company the sicartsa steel mill the railroad network many mexican mines and the operation of the country s ports the leader of the union at aeromexico was imprisoned after he refused to accept the company s privatization and the layoff of thousands of workers the head of one of the largest sections of the union for employees of the social security system imss also spent months in jail in 1995 for denouncing government plans to privatize the enormous federal pension and healthcare agency in 1991 the mexican army took over the port of veracruz disbanded the longshore union and installed three private contractors to load and unload ships hourly wages of veracruz longshoremen fell from about 7 00 to 1 00 even as productivity rose from 18 to over 40 shipping containers handled per hour when the sicartsa steel mill was privatized in 1992 wages were cut in half and 1500 of the mill s 5000 workers were laid off they were then rehired as temporary labour under 28 day contracts the mexican government sold the cananea and nacozari copper mines among the world s largest to german larrea s grupo mexico at a fraction of their book value in 1997 larrea bought the 4052 mile pacific north railroad in partnership with pennsylvania based union pacific workers throughout northern mexico mounted a series of rolling wildcat strikes over cuts in its workforce of 13 000 by more than half they lost thirteen mexican financiers became billionaires during the salinas administration and larrea was one of them grupo mexico forced cananea s miners union to go on strike in 2009 a conflict that is still unresolved after 65 miners were entombed by an explosion in grupo mexico s pasta de conchos coal mine in 2006 the union s president napoleón gómez urrutia was forced into exile in canada he d accused larrea of industrial homicide for giving up rescue efforts after only three days this october gómez urrutia was elected senator in sonora on the morena ticket lópez obrador s party in formation and finally returned from canada to take office the harshest privatization came in 2009 when president felipe calderon dissolved the state owned power and light company of central mexico in firing all its 44 000 workers calderon hoped to destroy one of mexico s oldest and most democratic unions the mexican electrical workers sindicato mexicano de electricistas sme the company s operations were folded into the federal electricity commission private electrical generation was already permitted by salinas and zedillo and lópez obrador s immediate predecessor enrique peña nieto had set up plans for private power sale to consumers meanwhile the federal electricity commission itself was slated for elimination peña nieto pushed a constitutional reform through congress to reverse the guarantee of national ownership of both the oil and electrical industries far from increasing productivity and investment however the damage caused to the national energy sector during neoliberalism is so serious lópez obrador charged that we are not only the oil country that imports the most gasoline in the world but we are now buying crude oil to supply the only six refineries that barely survive humberto montes de oca foreign secretary of the sme union says the country is bankrupt before we can redistribute wealth we have to recover it we know the banks will act against reversing the energy reform along with the others we will all have to participate in order to defend any changes this new government tries to make the sme has established a cooperative and has regained control of seven power generation stations along with other property that formerly belonged to the old company the hallmark of neoliberalism is corruption lópez obrador charged privatization has been synonymous with corruption in mexico the robbery of the goods of the people and the riches of the nation has been a modus operandi in the last three decades the highest authorities have dedicated themselves to giving concessions to the territory and transferring companies and public goods even functions of the state to national and foreign individuals the government will no longer facilitate looting and will no longer be a committee in the service of a rapacious minority to date only one economic reform enacted by lópez obrador s predecessors has been repealed outright the education reform that mandated standardized testing for students and testing and firing of teachers themselves mexico s teachers have a long history of resistance and radical politics more than 100 teachers in the state of oaxaca alone were killed during their struggle over control of their union and in defense of the indigenous communities in which they lived years of massive teacher strikes against the government s education reform eventually led to a massacre in nochixtlan in june 2016 in which nine people were gunned down by federal and state police the disappearance and murder of 43 students from the ayotzinapa training school in september 2014 was also an indirect product of the corporate education reform program their school had a reputation for turning out radical teachers as do many rural training schools like it and their students came from some of the poorest families in the countryside claudio x gonzález guajardo cofounder of the televisa foundation and the mexicanos primeros corporate education reform lobby called such public schools a swarm of politics and shouting he demanded the government replace them with private institutions following lópez obrador s speech to the congress gonzalez tweeted trump style amlo against the free market against the energy reform a retrograde statist interventionist stagnant vision the markets will react negatively it will go very badly with us very badly a shame in his address lópez obrador had promised the so called education reform will be canceled the right to free education will be established in article 3 of the constitution at all levels of schooling and the government will never again offend teachers the disappearance of ayotzinapa s youth will be thoroughly investigated the truth will be known and those responsible will be punished in meetings with the democratic teachers caucus he also promised free elections in their union the largest in latin america eliminating the authoritarian group that has held power in the union for decades could shift the balance between the left and right in mexico s institutional politics reforming mexico s labour laws despite the move against education reform most mexican unions do not expect the new government to reverse the privatizations that have already taken place at least not for the first three years of lópez obrador s six year term instead they have concentrated on winning a basic reform of mexico s labour law which has changed radically during the past two decades in may 2000 the world bank made a series of recommendations to the mexican administration an integral agenda of development for the new era the bank recommended rewriting mexico s constitution and federal labour law by eliminating its requirements that companies give workers permanent status after 90 days limit part time work and abide by the 40 hour week pay severance when they lay workers off and negotiate over the closure of factories the bank called for ending the law s ban on strikebreaking and its guarantees of job training healthcare and housing the recommendations were so extreme that even some employers condemned them president vicente fox 2000 to 2006 embraced the proposal but it failed to pass the congress after further attempts however president felipe calderon 2006 to 2012 did get a similar reform adopted in 2012 it allows companies to outsource or subcontract jobs which was previously banned it allows part time and temporary work and pay by the hour rather than the day workers now can be terminated without cause for their first six months on the job arturo alcalde one of mexico s most respected labour lawyer and past president of the national association of democratic lawyers called the reforms an open invitation to employers and a road to a paradise of firings as he predicted subcontracting proliferated with disastrous results in just one instance grupo mexico replaced strikers at the cananea mine by contracting out their jobs inexperienced replacements died in mine accidents and allowed a huge spill of toxic mine tailings into the sonora river contaminating communities and sickening residents according to benedicto martinez co president of the authentic labour front the union federation to which stimahcs belongs the motivation of the government assisted by corporate unions was to encourage the layoff of longtime employees who could be replaced by subcontracted workers there are companies now where all the workers are subcontracted who have no employees of their own at all the conditions are very low just slightly above the legal minimum and sometimes below last year under pressure from the european union which sought a free trade agreement with mexico the peña nieto administration had to agree to reform some of the pro corporate labour practices the government was forced to ratify convention 98 of the international labour organization ilo guaranteeing freedom of association something the united states has not done peña nieto then got the mexican congress to pass a constitutional reform embodying these changes corporate unions like the ctm clearly feeling threatened by the reform introduced their own legislation in 2017 to nullify its effect they couldn t get it passed however as it became evident that lópez obrador would be elected the next president in martinez eyes the constitutional reform is the most advanced proposal that you could imagine it includes union democracy and the disappearance of the conciliation and arbitration boards which have always been complicit with the bosses and the corporate unions in some states a union contract is treated like a state secret that no one is allowed to see martinez believes the reform was the fruit of many years of groups like his fighting the government it was like talking to a wall he recalls we were accused of being traitors to the country because we organized international pressure with unions all over the world denouncing the practices here in mexico domingues marrufo lópez obrador s deputy labour secretary agrees if it were not for that support from the united steelworkers and other unions it would have been impossible to achieve the constitutional reform but changing the constitution does not change the particular laws that govern labour activity implementing legislation must be passed to define rights and procedures and set up the structure for enforcing the reform after lópez obrador won the election in july but before he took office in december mexican unions and labour lawyers set up a discussion group the citizens labour observatory and debated how far the new changes should go some wanted to undo calderon s 2012 reform completely by reversing for instance the reform laws that now allow subcontracting and temporary employment in the end though the consensus among the democratic unions was to limit the proposal to the implementing legislation that gives workers the right to vote for the union and union leaders of their choice and to approve their contracts it was clear this was lópez obrador s favored choice as mexico city mayor in 2000 he had appointed another dean of mexican labour lawyers jesus campos linas as head of the city s labour board campos linas then made public an estimated 70 80 000 protection contracts whose contents had never been released to the workers they covered two days before christmas deputies from lópez obrador s morena party in formation introduced their labour reform bill into the chamber of deputies it will abolish the jcas and substitute an independent system of labour tribunals unions will be independent of the government and business and leaders must be elected by a majority of the workers union contracts will be public and must be ratified by the majority of the workers in a free and secret vote sweeping though it will be the new labour law is just a beginning on taking office lópez obrador appointed maria luisa alcalde the new labour secretary she is a former legislator daughter of labour lawyer arturo alcalde and at 31 the youngest person in amlo s cabinet she is very clear that the democratization of the unions will create a new situation and our society will have a much better chance to raise living standards dominguez says but he warned we aren t accustomed to organizing ourselves we re used to waiting for some powerful person to come from above to help us and while waiting for unions and workers to use the new law the government is still faced with many legacy strikes and fights inherited from 36 years of neoliberal administrations the telecommunications reform for instance mandated the breakup of telmex the old telephone monopoly sold to billionaire carlos slim in february it is set to be divided in two a move the telephone workers union bitterly opposes they are threatening to strike if it isn t stopped in the mid 1990s the telefonistas together with the authentic labour front fat and two other unions formed the national union of workers an independent labour federation they supported lópez obrador very strongly our corporate elite had to respond to the fact that the vast majority of mexicans voted for him and were unable to use their electoral fraud strategy to deny him victory as they had in the past says victor enrique fabela vice president of the union but he doesn t believe that lópez obrador will simply do what unions ask pointing out that the new president invited carlos slim to hear his inaugural speech to the congress an invitation not extended to the union s general secretary francisco hernandez juarez further long term operating concessions have been renewed for televisa and teleazteca two media giants with a record of rightwing politics we have to be critical he cautioned while understanding that we have to support the direction amlo is moving the strike in cananea has yet to be settled and in nacozari two of the world s largest copper mines the miners union was forced out by previous jca decisions favoring the ctm and grupo mexico the communities on the rio sonora are still suffering the health effects of the toxic spill three years later and on november 29 at the giant pkc wire harness plant in ciudad acuña just two days before lópez obrador was sworn in ctm thugs marched into the facility shouting mineros afuera as workers were about to vote on the miners union as their representative they overturned ballot boxes the election was canceled and the miners say its representatives were beaten we all want a change charged moises acuña the miners political secretary we have a chance to move forward now and we have to use it meanwhile a new federation of independent unions in the auto industry has also been formed and plans to fight with the ctm over the right to negotiate contracts with the industry s giants in dealing with the workers upsurge and the emergence of new unions however lópez obrador s government faces a complex situation the jcas will disappear and the new tribunals will be formed but there are no judges yet and they won t be in place for the first three years the tribunals have to be funded and judges and personnel trained in administering a completely new law but during that time in order to represent workers and negotiate a union still has to be certified by the authorities martinez says there must be some way to ensure that the workers have approved this union and this approval must take place before any negotiation begins plus who are the inspectors now responsible for investigating the outsourcing to make sure it s legal we need an army of them and there s no money to hire them despite the institutional challenges dominguez believes that the time has arrived when mexican workers may be able to reshape their nation today many workers live in poverty on one or two dollars a day this is the fundamental problem but we re not just fighting for an economic goal not just for decent wages but for the revitalization of the democratic life of workers of our unions and the organizations we belong to

and fees and difficulties in financing gong yuhang dean of the china enterprise finance research institute told the media to boost market confidence the priorities chinese policymakers unveiled at the economic conference included improving countercyclical adjustments cutting taxes and fees and supporting private enterprises since small micro and private enterprises play a key role in propelling economic growth and employment such companies will be offered more access to funds so that their debt default risks can be reduced the central bank said financial institutions will support privately owned small and micro companies through a range of financial tools including bonds bank lending and equity before the rrr announcement it already eased evaluation rules on january 2 to encourage inclusive financing for small and micro enterprises rural residents and low and middle income urban groups financial institutions can deposit less in the central bank as reserve money if they lend a certain share of their loans to small and micro firms each borrowing less than 10 million yuan 1 46 million the threshold was previously set at 5 million yuan 730 000 according to lian ping chief economist of the bank of communications bocom one of china s largest commercial banks more efforts are needed to make inclusive financing more effective the most prominent problem of inclusive financing in china is that the financial structure is not full fledged the direct financing system and banks targeting small and micro enterprises need to be improved lian told beijing review the central bank will continue to tighten its regulation on financial holding companies this year to defuse risks caused by shadow banking and internet financing in 2018 measures to regulate shadow bankingâ lending and other financial activities by unregulated institutions or under unregulated conditionsâ saw initial achievements in deleveraging and risk control but there was a downside as well small and private businesses funding resources became constrained since the shadow banking sector provides easier financing the authorities have now recognized the role of shadow banking and are trying to develop it under regulations the sector has facilitated the financing of private enterprises in recent years making it deserve more room to develop as long as appropriate regulation is in place xu xueming vice president of the postal savings bank of china said at a forum on december 23 2018 positive signals in 2018 the pbc cut rrr four times injecting a total of 2 3 trillion yuan 337 8 billion into the market the cuts this year a follow up move still focus on boosting the real economy while avoiding over escalation of monetary easing the rrr cuts were mostly launched later in the previous years boc s zong said but the early move this year signals determination to resolve prominent economic problems and boost the confidence of private enterprises laying a solid foundation for steady economic performances in 2019 he added besides supporting the private sector the move can also help ease the real estate market the fundamental policy of controlling speculation will remain consistent said yan yuejin research director of the e house china r d institute a property research agency bocom s lian said the rrr cuts this year may see a smaller margin and lower frequency than in 2018 and the possibility of cutting rmb benchmark interest rates for deposits and loans is slim as trade talks between china and the united states progress and the momentum of the dollar s strengthening weakens the depreciation pressure on the renminbi will ease a report by the guanghua school of management of peking university on january 3 said the central bank is expected to reduce rrr by around 2 percentage points altogether in 2019 and adopt various monetary policy tools to adjust liquidity with a focus on improving the monetary transmission mechanism to smooth funding channels lian said greater focus is needed to ensure capital flow into the real economy since large scale monetary easing may not exert considerable effect due to adequate liquidity in addition to the targeted rrr cuts measures such as improving the supply of low cost loans can be adopted to cut financing costs for domestic enterprises to inject more capital into the real economy the financial structure needs to be improved mainly in terms of direct financing especially boosting the stock market while stability of the domestic market needs to be maintained he added copyedited by sudeshna

5 approach to ftas of other countries a lessons from india eu fta negotiations it is good for sri lankan negotiators to learn from their counter parts in india and eu this is an exemplary occasion where negotiators from both india and eu showed their commitment to the cause of each country at the negotiating table and how eu india trade negations ended up abruptly according to times of india a well respected newspaper in india negotiations on india s fta with the eu had started in 2007 and since then 16 rounds of discussions have been held at the chief negotiator level however since 2014 when the 16th round was held the negotiations have been suspended as the negotiators were not able to arrive at a compromise solution to address the eu s key demands as of today neither party has shown any interest to resume negotiations what are the reasons for the standoff on negotiations according to informed sources says it happened due to the eu s demands for india to eliminate duties on dairy automobiles wines and spirits while india s main demands included those on data security status which are key for india s information technology sector india had also sought easier temporary movement of professionals in the services sector india was of the view that the eu was being rigid in giving access to services while new data security and transparency laws would affect many indian companies for many scholars and experts the india eu fta is on the verge of death it is widely believed that the formal announcement on closure of business on trade negotiation is expected in the near future this is an excellent example that if negotiators feel that fta negotiations cannot bring the expected benefits to their respective countries they should not be afraid or hesitate to pull out of trade negotiations b lessons from usa in this context we draw the example from us process adopted at nafta negotiations the us government with a view to expediting negotiations under nafta north american free trade agreement used the fast track approach but only after getting the approval from congress what is fast track authority in the usa if the president negotiates a trade agreement that requires changes in us tariffs or in other domestic laws that trade agreement s implementing legislation must be submitted to congress or the president must have congress advance approval of such changes fast track authority is given by congress to the president with a view to expedite the negotiation and finalise the tradeagreement it requires congress to approve or disapprove the trade agreement without reopening any of its provisions or changing negotiating points ultimately fast track gives the president credibility to negotiate tough trade deals while ensuring congress a central role before during and after negotiations the authority puts america in a strong position to negotiate major trade agreements and maintains a partnership between the president and congress that has worked for more than 20 years however even after introducing this fast track model still the trade negotiations for nafta passed through the times of three presidents ronald reagan george h w bush and bill clinton c sri lankan experience it is evident that the practice adopted in sri lanka clearly deviates from the standard practice and accepted norms of trade negotiations though such practices can vary from country to country certain minimum standard practices should be maintained during the slsfta sri lanka singapore fta negotiations the government introduced a similar model of fast track to finalise fta however in the case of sri lanka s fast track model for fta negotiations has there been an accepted mechanism on the part of the government to grant such approval in the first place as per the presidential committee of experts to evaluate the slsfta it should be remembered that negotiations on slsfta were begun even without a proper cabinet approved mandate fccisl learns that in the case of sri lanka s fta negotiations with singapore the gosl exerted pressure on the negotiating committee to work according to a tough set of dates to conclude negotiations this unusual practice of setting a tight time schedule for completion of negotiation without giving breathing space for any preparatory process or to formulate a rational strategy for negotiating such an fta may have certainly put sri lanka at a disadvantage according to informed sources sri lanka seems to have agreed to a cut off date to conclude negotiations to divulge or disclose the end date for negotiations is not an accepted principle when a country is negotiating for a fta with another country because of this unwanted disclosure sri lanka s chances of negotiations and bargaining power were considerably reduced the since other party singapore was sure that agreement would follow by the due date for signing of agreement in whatever form we have reasons to believe that there would have been more unresolved issues than solved issues in the fta though it was signed on the due date according to informed sources the negotiating committee had to merely engage in a time bound exercise and was not guided by the implications of binding commitment which should have been thoroughly understood perhaps with the backing of sectoral studies these require in depth understanding of implications and hence hard negotiation to gain tangible benefits and promote trade and economic interest of the country it is no doubt these deviations from the standard practice and accepted norms of trade negotiations had been more advantageous to singapore today slsfta stands as a controversial fta with more questions than answers to trade and with less credibility finally it s now seen by majority of the business community as a fta hostile to sri lankan business interest d the level of transparency and practice in the uk the uk government ensures publishing scoping assessments before entering into negotiations with partner countries and publishes an impact assessment later in the process at an appropriate time source an information pack for the consultation relating to a bilateral free trade agreement between the united kingdom and the united states by the department for international trade in the uk sri lankan case even though the chief negotiator of the fta with singapore had several rounds of discussions with trade chambers the business community was not informed of the impact assessment on tariff liberalisation the next section of this article is focused on unrealistic benefits expected through ftas without the backing of analytical studies we deal with two such justifications used by policymakers to promote ftas 6 are there prospects for sri lanka to enter into global value chains gvc through ftas one of the main justifications for sri lanka to enter into ftas often quoted by politicians and policymakers is that sri lanka would be able to enter into the global value chain using ftas in this case fccsl would like to know whether there has been any prior analytical study evaluation or identification to understand where exactly and in which industries sri lanka has such opportunities ft link fccisl on government s road to ftas how rational part 1 was published in the daily ft of 14 january and can be seen at do sri lanka s manufacturing and or services sectors possess the capacity or a completive advantage or way forward to enter into this much talked gvc through liberalisation of products services and investments how can sri lanka engage in dismantling its regulations across a broad spectrum of products services investments intellectual property it etc when it has not done a due diligence study or assessment on its preparedness or prospects for gvc linkages in ftas all these questions not only remain as unanswerable to date but also will remain as an index of wisdom of our policymakers who strongly advocate for ftas and trade liberalisation in the country in a haphazard way fccisl accepts the fact that integrating into regional or global gvcs is undoubtedly a desirable goal of sri lanka yet it seems that this wishful expectation of the pro fta camp based on textbook theory is not realising realities such as bottlenecks exist at our own backyard in this regard the global value chain development report 2017 by world bank group measuring and analysing the impact of gvcs on economic development offers some valuable insights on the conditions criteria or economic infrastructure required for successful integration in gvc accordingly there are a host of factors that sri lanka should first check on its wishful thinking before its entry into the gvc through a fta these factors range from comparative advantage network and connectivity and to neighbourhood partnering etc a chinese approach in this regard it is very useful to learn from the chinese approach before making a decision on selection of countries to enter into preferential free trade agreements an analysis of china s free trade agreements reveals that the selection of countries is primarily decided on the basis of a country s gvc position particularly its comparative advantage amongst other factors moreover factors as to the depth of the fta whether it is a shallow or deep agreement what kind of partnering fta countries the agreement is entered into all these factors stated above have a strategic role to play in determining whether these so called gvc linkages will take place generally an approach to ftas begins in china with its assessment about the country s gvc position in the market this is in contrast to the sri lankan government s position that by signing ftas it will naturally promote country exports through its value chain b productivity improvement for export competitiveness of sri lankan products going for ftas without addressing productive capacities and productivity improvement seems like putting the cart before the horse this is because most of our products have perennial productivity issues coupled with sri lanka s high interest rates and lack of efficiency directly affecting the competitiveness of sri lankan exports and eventually the gdp of the country industrial sectors across the board are faced with acute productivity issues that make our products uncompetitive in the world market while there are micro level or firm level issues of productivity much of these issues are beyond firms and industry levels it is the widespread opinion of the sme community that without adequate measures to address productivity and competitiveness issues sri lanka s attempts to enter into free trade agreements with other developed countries such as singapore korea and china that maintain very high productivity level across their industries could make the situation worse it is also noteworthy to mention that sri lanka has still not been able to reap expected benefits from the ftas signed so far or unilateral tariff concessions granted by eu under the gsp and in reality many smes face extinction low priced often substandard imports from the indian sub continent have flooded the sri lankan market when sri lanka s leading exports such as apparel tea rubber and spices to the indian subcontinent have faced non tariff barriers and other trade obstacles c is there a link between ftas and fdis this is yet another justification that ftas promote fdis this justification is also somewhat exaggerated as the flow of fdi into the country is determined by a host of other factors this is well evident in annual business surveys conducted by unctad this business survey is done based on factors influencing future global fdi activity and in 2017 the business survey was done using top class corporate executives it can be observed from the diagram extracted from this survey that various factors which consist of range of macro economic corporate and external factors that may affect world investments and the intensity level of each factor in deciding future fdis according to this survey it s evident that signing a fta is just one factor out of many factors influencing fdis and even the fta factor is not considered positively by a majority of executives who took part in the survey in effect fta is not a key driver of investments into a country and this is in contrast to sri lanka s position where it s often said that ftas will pour fdis into the country however in the recent past the sri lankan government took some commendable actions such as getting back gsp launch of trade information portfolio tip and national export strategy nes to facilitate exports with the technical support of itc and world bank the designing of national single window nsw is another positive step taken by gosl to facilitate trade and we believe this integrated platform is expected to reduce the transaction cost of our imports and exports giving advantages especially to the sme sector fccisl fully support the efforts of gosl in achieving the wto trade facilitation process under each category a b c and hopes once implemented sri lanka will get some advantages over some of its competitors in the region 7 challenge of dealing with bigger and incomparable economies for trade defending sri lanka s right to guard its national interest against substandard goods likely to come through ftas and unfair trade practices of exporters from other countries definition of market economy a market economy is an economic system in which economic decisions and the pricing of goods and services are guided solely by the aggregate interactions of a country s individual citizens and businesses there is little government intervention or central planning consequences of non market economy are as follows a under the legal structure of the wto the designation of a particular country as a non market economy nme allows importing countries to use a special framework to determine whether the exporting country is selling its products at unfairly low prices and if that is found to apply special anti dumping duties above normal tariffs on imports that are sold at less than the price in the exporting country less than the cost of production or in certain circumstances less than third country prices the purported goal of anti dumping duties is to reduce the impact of artificially low pricing of exported goods on domestic manufacturers in the importing country b wto law further allows consideration of third country prices when attempting to determine whether a country with nme is dumping its goods in to the importing country under this an importing country has greater flexibility to use arbitrarily selected high third country prices as a reference for determining dumping by exporters from nmes than it does for exporters from market economies this greater flexibility makes the comparison with import prices more likely to result in a higher dumping margin and consequently allow for a higher anti dumping duty c case of china as of 2017 china has been the sri lanka s second largest import destination after india it has a massive production capacity supported by government subsidies and a large workforce it is a very interesting topic to study as it also covers the ongoing trade dispute between usa and china in this context it is important to understand the concept of market economy the crux of the matter for the trade dispute between usa and china china has become the world factory and has become the leading sourcing destination for most of the countries this is a great achievement for china after opening its economy in 80s china joined the world trade organization wto in 2001 under article 15 of the protocol and has been subject to a special presumption that it is a non market economy nme under this arrangement china committed to undertake several reforms regarding for example subsidies management of state owned enterprises soes and liberalisation of its banking system etc to show that china is transforming the economy into a market economy acceptable to wto member states however there is strong evidence to the effect that even after 16 years accession china still has not completed its transition process the world bank has published a study about china where it affirms that the government continues to dominate key sectors and that close links between the government big banks and state enterprises have created vested interests that inhibit reforms and contribute to continued ad hoc state interventions in the economy in truth china still relies heavily upon soes to implement public policies conceived by the chinese government however this special presumption that china s non market economy nme status by wto expired on 11 december 2016 and china argued that it must now be accorded with market economy status d usa s stand on china the us department of commerce argued that a 1930 tariff law in the us requires some criteria convertibility of currency bargaining right for wages permitting joint ventures or other investments by firms of foreign countries non government control production and resource allocation non governmental administering authority to grant the market economy status to a country based on these criteria department of commerce of usa has determined that china still does not meet any of these factors and therefore cannot be granted market economy status e sri lanka s stand on china and implications sri lanka has obviously conceded market economy status for china in the wto by desisting from objecting to the lapse of the protocol in 2016 by doing so we seem to have given away the rights to establish a viable anti dumping duty mechanism on chinese goods if found guilty for exporting through fta or outside which more developed countries as usa eu and also india are retaining to date this would severely hamper the effectiveness of the sri lankan government s much hailed legal enactment the imposition of anti dumping law to prevent imports coming to sri lanka from a country like china at unbelievable low prices now the question is what is the possibility or quantum of anti dumping duty that sri lanka could ever impose on undervalued imports from china anti dumping duties investigations are by no means easy or always possible to impose because the difficulties arising in proving that the goods are being dumped as per the wto prescribed legislation therefore the status of market economy conceded to china by sri lanka puts certainly sri lanka at a disadvantageous position further sri lanka will also lose the right to compare chinese export prices with prices of a third country sri lanka will have to accept the subsidised domestic prices given by chinese companies given the chinese system within the country the lack of transparency language barriers and the centralised protectionist system in china will work against the interest of sri lankan domestic manufacturers finally it is noteworthy to say that china is the country which has the highest anti dumping cases against its exports see diagram the trade remedy law in sri lanka often touted as the great protector of the local industry against ill effects of ftas and unfair business practices of importing countries is now broken at the stem and the question is how can sri lanka withstand the onslaught of chinese products if priced unreasonably under the proposed fta to sri lanka the writer is secretary general ceo of fccisl he was a member of the ntfc study tour to australia in 2018 organised by itc eu to be continued
turkey iran energy economy politics in the face of sanctions turkey and iran have had a long history of political rivalry that dates back to the ottoman and safavid empires however economic opportunities have even back then superseded political animosity allowing for mutually beneficial trade to flourish when it comes to the contemporary energy trade turkey has prioritized its relationship with iran because it benefits economically from purchasing oil and gas from iran turkey has a history of prioritizing energy relationships that benefit its economy over its political relationships with neighbors this can be seen today in its ongoing relationship with the kurdistan regional government krg in iraq turkey has long sought to counter the krg s attempts at autonomy because of the political threat it poses to turkey however despite the central iraqi government s desires turkey has allowed the krg to export oil from kirkuk through turkey this energy trade has proved lucrative for both turkey and the krg even though facilitating the krg s oil trade has helped the krg s bid for an independent kurdistan turkey has continued to maintain trade and profit from it advertisement the national gas company of trinidad and tobago limited ngc ngc s hsse strategy is reflective and supportive of the organisational vision to become a leader in the global energy business ngc co tt turkey s energy trade with iran has traced a similar path in which turkey ignored politics and favored the economic benefits of a robust energy trade with iran even when iran was considered a pariah country for its support of terrorism and its nuclear weapons ambitions it was only when turkey faced economic sanctions that it withdrew its energy trade with iran turkey presents a particular problem to the trump administration s efforts to isolate iran and enforce economic sanctions the us relationship with turkey has become strained in recent years over such issues as the conflict in syria and russian involvement in the middle east these relations have grown increasingly antagonistic over the past several months in august 2018 the trump administration authorized tarrifs on turkish steel and aluminum the us is turkey s largest customer for steel and aluminum and the move caused the turkish lira to fall against the dollar the trump administration also imposed targeted sanctions over turkey s detention of american pastor andrew brunson on charges of espionage and terrorism relating to the 2016 failed coup in turkey brunsun was held for two years after being released on 12 october 2018 even though the united states and turkey are nato allies president trump took the extraordinary step on 1 august of imposing economic sanctions on two ministers in the turkish government who were directly responsible for brunson s detention the sanctions were authorized under the global magnitsky act a law that enables the executive branch to issue sanctions on individuals for human rights abuses the severity of the campaign for brunson s release and the new tarrifs on turkish steel and aluminum imports to the united states have rapidly caused a rift between the two countries turkish president erdoğan s rhetoric towards the united states has grown increasingly hostile for example erdoğan has threated to retaliate against us sanctions with boycotts of american products such as the iphone in particular erdoğan has targeted the dollar calling on the turkish public to stand decisively against the dollar the timing of the trump administration s campaign against turkey may prove particularly disadvantageous to us policy aims regarding iran and may incentivize turkey to take a stand against the united states by disregarding us sanctions and continuing to purchase oil and gas from iran although turkey and iran have not often sided with each other politically the two countries have a long history of prioritizing their economic relations over their political relationship this is not to say that turkey s economic relationship with iran has not been fraught with its share of disagreements and conflicts however when it comes to trade and especially energy turkey has sought to engage in advantageous relationships with iran indeed turkey has at times prioritized its economic relationship with iran over its diplomatic relations with the us now as the us seeks to implement new economic sanctions on iran without the backing of european powers or global institutions turkey poses an especially difficult challenge turkey s physical proximity to iran its energy needs its financial situation and its disintegrating relationship with the us all provide incentives for iran and turkey to subvert us sanctions in ways that other countries like china and india cannot turkey s energy situation coal is turkey s primary energy resource as of 2014 turkey generated 30 percent of its total electricity from coal however coal is the least environmentally friendly source of energy and efforts are underway worldwide to reduce the use of coal generated electricity turkish electricity producers have increasingly turned to natural gas in recent years a significantly less dirty fossil fuel however turkey has very little natural gas resources and must import 99 percent of its natural gas supplies turkey is most dependent on russian gas as of 2015 russia supplied turkey with 56 percent of its natural gas needs iran and azerbaijan are turkey s next largest natural suppliers accounting for 16 percent and 11 percent of the turkish market respectively turkey s dependence on natural gas imports will continue to grow as its natural gas demand continues to increase in 2015 turkey consumed an average of 860 000 barrels of liquid fuels per day this includes crude oil and condensates which are very light types of oil that are the byproducts of natural gas production turkey has little in the way of domestic crude oil resources and imported 90 percent of its crude oil and condensates data from the united states energy information agency eia showed that in 2015 turkey imported 41 percent of its crude oil and condensates supply from iraq 20 percent from iran 11 percent from russia and 9 percent from saudi arabia in 2017 however iraqi oil imports to turkey dropped and instead turkey began importing more oil from russia and iran because turkey is so reliant on imports to satisfy its natural gas and oil demand it is especially vulnerable to changes in the global market it requires a diverse and secure mix of suppliers in order to ensure stable and relatively inexpensive sources of energy suddenly eliminating an energy source can have a negative effect on the turkish economy because turkish utilities and refineries will face unforeseen costs and possible shortages turkey and iran s energy relationship turkey and iran have a history of cooperation when it comes to trade this is especially true in the energy sector even though the two countries did not always have positive political and diplomatic relations trade and in particular the energy trade always superseded political religious and cultural differences this is not to say that the energy relationship between turkey and iran has always been smooth the two countries have frequently disagreed on issues related to their oil and gas contracts over the years turkey and iran developed a close energy relationship after 1979 during the iran iraq war turkey increased its imports of iranian oil such that iran became turkey s second largest source of oil imports after iraq in 1996 turkey and iran signed a landmark natural gas agreement worth 23 billion dollars the agreement was designed to reduce turkey s reliance on russian natural gas by increasing the amount of natural gas supplied by iran to the eastern and southern parts of anatolia in 1996 it was projected that iran would come to supply turkey with 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas out of the 27 billion cubic meters of gas that turkey would need in 2000 a natural gas pipeline between turkey and iran was completed in 2001 but it never reached full capacity us officials consistently pressured turkey to cut down on its imports of iranian gas and switch to natural gas from turkmenistan instead in 2002 the flow of gas from iran to turkey was interrupted at turkey s insistence turkey complained about the technical specifications of the gas from iran but in reality sought to renegotiate its agreement with iran in the end turkey negotiated a lower price for the iranian natural gas and several favorable conditions for its utilities the flow of natural gas was interrupted several more times due to similar disputes in 2004 and 2005 in 2006 iran halted natural gas shipments to turkey due to cold weather in iran which necessitated redirection of its natural gas to domestic consumers in 2007 turkey and iran signed a memorandum of understanding that would include turkey in an operation to develop natural gas supplies in the south pars gas field the agreement also called for a new pipeline to bring natural gas to turkey and europe the turkish petroleum company was hoping to produce 16 billion cubic meters per year from this deal which it intended to split between domestic use and sale to europe at that point the sanctions situation and the unfavorable environment for foreign investment in iran were forcing international oil and gas companies to pull out of planned development projects in iran iran employed a system called buy back contracts which are not considered especially lucrative for foreign companies essentially this meant that a foreign company can enter iran and develop an oil or gas resource for export but once development is complete ownership would revert to an iranian national company and the revenues from the project at pre set levels would be paid back to the foreign company the system prevents any modicum of foreign ownership of iranian energy resources which is a constitutional imperative in the islamic republic of iran even though other companies were pulling out of iran in 2008 and 2009 the turkish petroleum company wanted to continue with the project it did not need international financing and so would have been isolated from some sanctions at the time the project was supposed to break ground in november 2009 but did not because the turkish petroleum company and the iranian government could not agree on the terms particularly the stringent buy back terms that prevented the turkish petroleum company from maintaining any partial ownership in the project after its completion although turkey and iran were not able to finalize their plans to ensure greater turkish investment in iranian natural gas turkish imports of iranian natural gas continued turkey and iran during the first sanctions regime during the height of the united states and united nations sanctions regime against iran turkey continued to import natural gas and oil from iran turkish refineries were granted some exemptions from sanctions because they reduced the amount of oil they had been importing from iran significantly however it became difficult for turkey to compensate iran for its natural gas as us and eu sanctions banned the use of dollars and euros in any financial transactions with iran during this time iran accepted turkish lira as payment for the natural gas it provided turkey iran used the turkish lira to buy gold in turkey and then imported the gold through the united arab emirates switzerland the united kingdom and india by courier into iran in 2013 the us instituted additional sanctions designed to curb turkey s gold for gas trade with iran these sanctions targeted the turkish bank that had been facilitating the transfers of turkish lira to gold iran was subsequently forced to prove it was buying food medicine and necessary industrial products with its funds rather than gold or other precious metals iran and turkey s post sanctions energy trade after the signing of the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa otherwise known as the iran nuclear deal sanctions were lifted in january 2016 and turkey s imports of iranian natural gas and oil increased in the first six months of 2016 turkey imported 21 million barrels of oil from iran in 2017 that amount increased to 52 8 million barrels during the first four months of 2018 the share of iranian oil that turkey imported increased by 50 percent iran s natural gas exports to turkey also increased after the sanctions were lifted natural gas delivery to turkey jumped 14 percent in 2017 between january 2017 and february 2018 iran exported 8 billion cubic meters of natural gas to turkey without remuneration this was in response to a 2016 ruling by the international court of arbitration which awarded turkey a 1 9 billion dollar settlement in a suit it brought against iran from 2012 turkey alleged that mahmoud ahmadinejad s government overcharged turkey for natural gas and won its suit the payment was completed at the end of january 2018 turkey maintains a long term supply contract with iran in which turkey has committed to purchasing 9 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas that continues until 2026 the future of turkey and iran s energy trade at the beginning of may us president donald trump s administration announced that the us would be reinstating sanctions against iran these actions would include secondary sanctions against institutions or individuals who did business with the sanctioned iranian institutions the first round of sanctions came into effect in august and included provisions against iran s financial institutions and automobile industries the second round of sanctions come into effect on 4 november and included iran s oil industry initially analysts forecasted that only about 200 000 to 300 000 barrels per day of iranian oil would be impacted by these sanctions however the trump administration s approach to these sanctions is significantly more stringent than the obama administration s approach whereas the obama administration offered waivers to many asian countries and some european countries to continue importing iranian oil as long as they decreased their imports somewhat the trump administration is not offering waivers with nearly the frequency of its predecessor this approach has put turkey in a difficult position economically because it drastically increased the amount of oil and gas that it imported from iran after the sanctions were lifted in 2016 during the first round of sanctions turkey continued to import some oil from iran but looked to iraq to replace the reserves it had stopped purchasing from iran it was only with extreme pressure from the us along with additional sanctions on the precious metals trade with iran that turkey officially halted its gold for oil and gas scheme with iran in 2013 although the trade did continue clandestinely until 2015 the political rift between turkey and the us in 2018 makes it much more unlikely that turkey will seek to halt its oil and gas purchases from iran turkey does have a tendency to prioritize economic benefit even if its political and strategic enemies also benefit however in this case turkey may be able to satisfy its anti american political ambitions and maintain a beneficial economic relationship with iran the problem of currency the primary hurdle turkey faces in continuing to import iranian oil and gas after november 2018 lies in the financial transactions to pay for the oil and gas most of the global oil trade is conducted in dollars however any entity that attempts to conduct financial transactions with iran in dollars especially with regards to the oil industry will be sanctioned by the us government similarly if an entity conducts such transactions in another currency for example the euro and also conducts transactions with the us it will face sanctions therefore the only currency a turkish refiner can use to pay iran for oil and gas would be the turkish lira or iranian rial the iranian rial is a highly unstable currency that has been devalued multiple times in 2018 and thus it is extremely unlikely that a turkish entity would be in possession of enough iranian rials to conduct oil and gas transactions in iranian rials some countries facing this issue have offered to pay iran in their own currencies during the first round of sanctions china paid for oil in its own currency through the bank of kunlun which had no exposure to us entities the us attempted to sanction this bank but it had no effect because the bank was not exposed to us interests following this iran found itself with a great deal of chinese currency which it could use only to purchase goods from china iran did take advantage of this but with limited positive impact on the economy revenues from iran s oil industry are a major component of the iranian government s budget and the chinese yuan is of limited use in most respects when it comes to turkey however there are more options iran can accept turkish lira in exchange for its oil and gas and make use of the lira for more than just purchases of turkish goods in 2012 iran and turkey engaged in an elaborate scheme in which turkey sold gold to iran in exchange for various currencies and smuggled the gold into iran through different countries after that scheme was discovered the us placed sanctions on iran s precious metals trade that effectively halted the scheme in response instead of converting lira to gold iran could simply decide to use turkish lira as currency in iran turkey and iran share a border and this area is largely inhabited by kurds an ethnically distinct population that spans several countries in the region iran could simply put the turkish lira to use in the turkish iranian borderland region this is not an uncommon practice in borderland communities there are many borderland areas around the globe where multiple currencies are accepted for example canadian currency often mixes with american currency in parts of northern new england and there are several central american and caribbean countries that accept american currency turkey s recent currency destabilization also makes this option more attractive from a financial perspective because its utilities and refineries can make purchases of oil and gas without having to use the dollar of course to avoid us sanctions only turkish utilities and refineries that are not exposed to american entities would be able to accomplish this however given that turkey purchases very little oil and gas from the us to begin with cargoes could be rerouted certain refineries and utilities can import only iranian oil and gas while other utilities and refineries use other sources that might expose them to american sanctions this could pose a distinct problem for the trump administration as it pursues its objective of reducing iran s oil and gas exports to zero conclusions historically when it comes to energy turkey has put its economic goals above its political considerations this has included entering into contentious energy deals with its ideological and political adversaries including iran and the kurdistan regional government economically it is in turkey s best interest to continue to import iranian oil and gas despite us imposed sanctions turkey and iran have long term contracts that if broken would impose great expenses on turkey however turkey and iran are also financially incentivized to work together to avoid us sanctions because both of their currencies have been devalued against the dollar it behooves them financially to cooperate in avoiding the use of the dollar in energy trade the development of new hostilities between the united states and turkey and the depreciation of the turkish lira against the dollar also incentivizes turkey to continue to import iranian oil and gas in contravention of american sanctions turkey and iran s geographic proximity and the shared ethnic connections between their kurdish populations mean that iran could potentially use turkish currency within its own borders helping it avoid the need for currency conversations that expose turkish entities to us sanctions dr ellen r wald dr ellen r wald is a senior

liquidity money supply and insolvency liquidity is becoming of central importance once again it is frequently mentioned in mainstream media articles interviews and educational programs it was a central point of discussion during the financial market blowout in 2008 the killing off of a little known until it was dead data series earlier this year by the not so usfed has gotten the beehive buzzing once again about a liquidity crisis or the possible aversion of one in the short term it has also gotten things buzzing about the longer term as well what happened late in 2017 the st louis fed stopped publishing interbank loan data period just prior to that the amount of interbank loans on a weekly basis dropped to zero in typical fashion however the fine folks at the central bank have cleaned up the series and the chart but not totally see below ironically if you search for interbank loans and you pull up the aggregate chart for all us banks you will see that the data ends on 12 1 2017 but the data for small domestically chartered banks ends 1 3 2018 leaving the extremely small blip above is this another m3 deal where a rather important data series was killed off to save the taxpayers money the excuse given for the cessation of m3 or did something fundamentally change in the way banks secure temporary liquidity here s what we think if you look at the chart you can see that interbank loans were dropping pretty steadily one can interpret that as a return to normalcy of sorts after the financial catastrophe in 2008 that interpretation probably isn t that far off there were a couple of periods where loans spiked late 2012 and early 2017 in particular these roughly coincide with the eurozone debt crisis playing out and some of the goings on across the atlantic then all the rumors about deutschebank started we are of the opinion that the not so usfed launched a pre emptive strike on another credit lockup by changing the way that its member banks owners by definition met their temporary liquidity needs it has often been said that the fed is the lender of last resort we believe the us central bank became the lender of all resort that it decided that all interbank loans would go through it rather than banks going to each other this is an important distinction because while banks are certainly good at colluding they are also very much interested in self preservation if there s a rumor that some bank x was in trouble they d turn off the phones when bank x comes calling about a loan think of the cold shoulder lehman s dick fuld got in september 2008 when he spent an entire weekend calling everyone but elvis with regards to securing a venture saving loan he didn t get one not even from the not so usfed we are very sure there was much more to this than was or will ever be told if this is the case why wipe out the data series and trigger a bunch of questions why not just continue the series and plop in the numbers the central bank lends out and leave it at that or just make it up like is done with so many other economic and financial statistics these days the bigger question regardless of why this was handled the way it has been and we readily admit neither us nor anyone else will probably ever know why it was done this way it begs a bigger question which has started to emerge in the minds of many around the globe is it possible for the not so usfed to go broke these questions are being asked for some very good reasons a look at the usgovt debt is the first 22t the debt of the us population is another the total amount varies depending on what sources you use but according to usdebtclock org total consumer debt is almost 19 5t throw in the notional value of that quaking house of cards known as derivatives and that s a whopping 602t again according to usdebtclock org we could keep going but we think you get the point this massive mountain is serviced by an m2 money supply that is reportedly just shy of 14 4t it takes a bit of understanding to get to the fact that money supply is transactional only it is not involved in the storage of wealth a quick example tom buys 100 shares of company x from joe tom transfers the payment through the automated clearinghouse ach joe then takes the payment and buys groceries tom now has 100 shares of stock and joe has groceries but the money is in the hands of the grocer ergo the money supply is lubricant for the economy transactional in nature we don t need hyperinflation just because the national debt is 22t or because a pile of financial derivatives with a notional value of over 600t exists but what about that pile of derivatives certainly it is unrealistic to conjure up a scenario where they all trigger at once many of the derivatives are stacked against each other it s a binary situation this or that not this and that let s say just for kicks that 5 of that pile would trigger and money would have to be paid out now you ve got a problem the 14t worth of us m2 is spread throughout the economy as we described above some of it is cash and that lives in bank vaults people s safety deposit boxes and contrary to the times even in their wallets some of it is probably buried underground remember the dollar is not just currency it is also a unit of account things can be worth so many dollars the net worth of everything in the us is far far in excess of the money supply money is transactional it zips around the economy we economists even measure the velocity at which it zips around it is very non cleverly called velocity of circulation if a 30t transaction would have to take place because 5 of the derivatives pile triggered it simply couldn t non monetary assets would have to be thrown into the mix to settle it because there aren t enough dollars for a transaction that big or alternatively additional dollars would have to be created for the purpose of making that transaction possible this is the sort of thing that keeps central bankers awake in a runaway environment like the world locked into now everyone assumes that the not so usfed can backstop any eventuality it is a weighty assumption present in many economic models and scenarios where different outcomes are gamed by modelers in an attempt to quantitatively assess risk the fed stands out as the lender of last resort this assumption is made because the dollar is the world s reserve currency stay with us here everyone needs dollars and as such it wouldn t be that big of a deal if the fed had to suddenly ramp up the money supply for a single enormous transaction or even a wave of smaller but equally inexecutable transactions below we point out a slight oddity the bulk of monetary inflation is created when new loans are taken out given the propensity of americans and their government at all levels to borrow fresh money on a regular basis monetary growth has settled to a tepid 5 give or take a few basis points we ll get to this point in our next column it is a very dangerous assumption built into it is the assumption that the world not just people in the us doesn t mind being robbed of purchasing power as more money is created it also carries the assumption that the rest of the world wants to exist in an unholy and clearly imbalanced financial relationship with a predatory monetary authority based on the number and frequency of deals being cut to sidestep the dollar it is safe to conclude that at least some of the world s population is no longer comfortable with the prior arrangement lastly there is perception it is the only reason people will accept intrinsically worthless paper tickets or equally worthless digital facsimiles thereof in exchange for goods and services produced with scarce land labor and capital nobody really thinks about it watch a bank robbery in a movie sometime what happens you have a few people convinced that it is worth spending the rest of their life in jail for a bunch of paper why would anyone do that because they perceive it to have value they know they can trade it for a bunch of stuff that really does have value back to our movie some brave individual will often try to take on the robbers usually unsuccessfully in an attempt to stop the robbery why would anyone in their right mind be willing to die for a bunch of worthless paper same answer as before they perceive the paper to be of value and thus the cause is a noble one in the end it s a completely tilted economic arrangement the holders of the dollar assume all risk the issuing authority assumes none of the risk the not so usfed is a glorified paper mill it has paper and digital assets some have value some are completely illiquid think of maiden lane llc 1 2 and 3 at the end of the day the question isn t whether or not the fed can go broke it already is broke it continues to exist based on several factors 1 the cost of unwinding dollar denominated arrangements 2 the difficulty in setting up a new system when there is full awareness that attempts to do so will likely result in sanctions smear campaigns and even military action and 3 people tend to think in the short term while making decisions that impact the long term the path of least resistance is to continue to tolerate the broken system even if all actors are aware that it is predatory thereby ensnaring countless future actors and transactions in the same broken system as mentioned above some countries are starting to buck this trend though and that is the dangerous part every deal that cuts out the dollar makes the news never in the us of course but elsewhere in the world alliances are being made based on a growing resentment of the forced usdollar hegemony that the world has experienced keep in mind every country that has a fractional reserve fiat monetary system is in the same boat as the united states the big difference is the dollar despite all the recent scurrying for the exits is still the reserve currency that will change however and then people will finally realize that the real question that needed asking was not if the fed could go broke but could the fed become irrelevant as we enter 2019 the answer to that questions appears

home search ich placing the usa on a collapse continuum with dmitry orlov by the saker january 14 2019 information clearing house the word catastrophe has several meanings but in its original meaning in greek the word means a sudden downturn in greek katastrophē overturning sudden turn from kata down strophē turning as for the word superpower it also has several possible definitions but my preferred one is this one superpower is a term used to describe a state with a dominant position which is characterized by its extensive ability to exert influence or project power on a global scale this is done through the combined means of economic military technological and cultural strength as well as diplomatic and soft power influence traditionally superpowers are preeminent among the great powers this one an extremely powerful nation especially one capable of influencing international events and the acts and policies of less powerful nations or this one an international governing body able to enforce its will upon the most powerful states i have mentioned the very visible decline of the us and its associated empire in many of my articles already so i won t repeat it here other than to say that the ability to exert influence and impose its will is probably the best criteria to measure the magnitude of the fall of the us since trump came to power the process was already started by dubya and obama but it sure accelerated with the donald but i do want to use a metaphor to revisit the concept of catastrophe if you place an object in the middle of a table and then push it right to the edge you will exert some amount of energy we can call e1 then if the edge of the table is smooth and you just push the object over the edge you exercise a much smaller amount of energy we can call e2 and in most cases if the table is big enough you will also find that e1 is much bigger than e2 yet e2 coming after e1 took place triggered a much more dramatic event instead of smoothly gliding over the table top the object suddenly falls down and shatters that sudden fall can also be called a catastrophe this is also something which happens in history take the example of the soviet union are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter the fate of all empires some readers might recall how alexander solzhenitsyn repeatedly declared in the 1980s that he was sure that the soviet regime would collapse and that he would return to russia he was of course vitriolically ridiculed by all the specialists and experts after all why would anybody want to listen to some weird russian exile with politically suspicious ideas there were rumors of monarchism and anti semitism when the soviet union was an immense superpower armed to the teeth with weapons with an immense security service with political allies and supporters worldwide not only that but all the respectable specialists and experts were unanimous that while the soviet regime had various problems it was very far from collapse the notion that nato would soon replace the soviet military not only in eastern europe but even in part of the soviet union was absolutely unthinkable and yet it all happened very very fast i would argue that the soviet union completely collapsed in the span of less than 4 short years 1990 1993 how and why this happened is beyond the scope of this article but what is undeniable is that in 1989 the soviet union was still an apparently powerful entity while by the end of 1993 it was gone smashed into pieces by the very nomenklatura which used to rule over it how did almost everybody miss that because ideologically poisoned analysis leads to intellectual complacence a failure of imagination and generally an almost total inability to even hypothetically look at possible outcomes this is how almost all the soviet specialists got it wrong the kgb by the way had predicted this outcome and warned the politburo but the soviet gerontocrats were ideologically paralyzed and were both unable and often unwilling to take any preventative action the kerensky masonic regime in 1917 russia the monarchy in iran or the apartheid regime in south africa also collapsed very fast once the self destruction mechanism was in place and launched you can think of that regime self destruction mechanism as our e1 phase in our metaphor above as for e2 you can think of it as whatever small push like event which precipitates the quick and final collapse apparently with great ease and minimum energy spent at this point it is important to explain what exactly a final collapse looks like some people are under the very mistaken assumption that a collapsed society or country looks like a mad max world this is not so the ukraine has been a failed state for several years already but it still exists on the map people live there work most people still have electricity albeit not 24 7 a government exists and at least officially law and order is maintained this kind of collapsed society can go on for years maybe decades but it is in a state of collapse nonetheless as it has reached all the 5 stages of collapse as defined by dmitry orlov in his seminal book the five stages of collapse survivors toolkit where he mentions the following 5 stages of collapse stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost having personally visited argentina in the 1970s and 1980s and seen the russia of the early 1990s i can attest that a society can completely collapse while maintaining a lot of the external appearances of a normal still functioning society unlike the titanic most collapsed regimes don t fully sink they remain about half under water and half above possibly with an orchestra still playing joyful music and in the most expensive top deck cabins a pretty luxurious lifestyle can be maintained by the elites but for most of the passengers such a collapse results in poverty insecurity political instability and a huge loss in welfare furthermore in terms of motion a half sunk ship is no ship at all here is the crucial thing as long as the ship s pa systems keep announcing great weather and buffet brunches and as long as most of the passengers remain in their cabins and watch tv instead of looking out of the window the illusion of normalcy can be maintained for a fairly long while even after a collapse during the e1 phase outlined above most passengers will be kept in total ignorance lest they riot or protest and only when e2 strikes totally unexpectedly for most passengers does reality eventually destroy the ignorance and illusions of the brainwashed passengers obama was truly the beginning of the end i have lived in the us from 1986 1991 and from 2002 to today and there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the country has undergone a huge decline over the past decades in fact i would argue that the us has been living under e1 condition since at least dubya and that this process dramatically accelerated under obama and trump i believe that we reached the e2 edge of the table moment in 2018 and that from now on even a relatively minor incident can result in a sudden downturn i e a catastrophe still i decided to check with the undisputed specialist of this issue and so i emailed dmitry orlov and asked him the following question in your recent article the year the planet flipped over you paint a devastating picture of the state of the empire it is already safe to declare trump s plan to make america great again maga a failure beneath the rosy statistics of us economic growth hides the hideous fact that it is the result of a tax holiday granted to transnational corporations to entice them to repatriate their profits while this hasn t helped them their stocks are currently cratering it has been a disaster for the us government as well as for the economic system as whole tax receipts have shrunk the budget deficit for 2018 exceeds 779 billion meanwhile the trade wars which trump initiated have caused the trade deficit to increase by 17 from the year before plans to repatriate industrial production from low cost countries remain vaporous because the three key elements which china had as it industrialized cheap energy cheap labor and low cost of doing business are altogether missing government debt is already beyond reasonable and its expansion is still accelerating with just the interest payments set to exceed half a trillion a year within a decade this trajectory does not bode well for the continued existence of the united states as a going concern nobody either in the united states or beyond has the power to significantly alter this trajectory trump s thrashing about may have moved things along faster than they otherwise would have at least in the sense of helping convince the entire world that the us is selfish feckless ultimately self destructive and generally unreliable as a partner in the end it won t matter who was president of the us it never has among those the us president has succeeded in hurting most are his european allies his attacks on russian energy exports to europe on european car manufacturers and on europe s trade with iran have caused a fair amount of damage both political and economic without compensating for it with any perceived or actual benefits meanwhile as the globalist world order which much of europe s population appears ready to declare a failure begins to unravel the european union is rapidly becoming ungovernable with established political parties unable to form coalitions with ever more numerous populist upstarts it is too early to say that the eu has already failed altogether but it already seems safe to predict that within a decade it will no longer remain as a serious international factor although the disastrous quality and the ruinous mistakes of europe s own leadership deserve a lot of the blame some of it should rest with the erratic destructive behavior of their transoceanic big brother the eu has already morphed into a strictly regional affair unable to project power or entertain any global geopolitical ambitions same goes for washington which is going to either depart voluntarily due to lack of funds or get chased out from much of the world the departure from syria is inevitable whether trump under relentless pressure from his bipartisan warmongers backtracks on this commitment or not now that syria has been armed with russia s up to date air defense weapons the us no longer maintains air superiority there and without air superiority the us military is unable to do anything afghanistan is next there it seems outlandish to think that the washingtonians will be able to achieve any sort of reasonable accommodation with the taliban their departure will spell the end of kabul as a center of corruption where foreigners steal humanitarian aid and other resources somewhere along the way the remaining us troops will also be pulled out of iraq where the parliament angered by trump s impromptu visit to a us base recently voted to expel them and that will put paid to the entire us adventure in the middle east since 9 11 4 704 439 588 308 has been squandered to be precise or 14 444 for every man woman and child in the us the biggest winners in all of this are obviously the people of the entire region because they will no longer be subjected to indiscriminate us harassment and bombardment followed by russia china and iran with russia solidifying its position as the ultimate arbiter of international security arrangements thanks to its unmatched military capabilities and demonstrated knowhow for coercion to peace syria s fate will be decided by russia iran and turkey with the us not even invited to the talks afghanistan will fall into the sphere of the shanghai cooperation organization and the biggest losers will be former us regional allies first and foremost israel followed by saudi arabia my question for you is this where would you place the usa or the empire on your 5 stages of decline and do you believe that the usa or the empire can reverse that trend here is dmitry s reply collapse at each stage is a historical process that takes time to run its course as the system adapts to changing circumstances compensates for its weaknesses and finds ways to continue functioning at some level but what changes rather suddenly is faith or to put it in more businesslike terms sentiment a large segment of the population or an entire political class within a country or the entire world can function based on a certain set of assumptions for much longer than the situation warrants but then over a very short period of time switch to a different set of assumptions all that sustains the status quo beyond that point is institutional inertia it imposes limits on how fast systems can change without collapsing entirely beyond that point people will tolerate the older practices only until replacements for them can be found stage 1 financial collapse faith in business as usual is lost internationally the major change in sentiment in the world has to do with the role of the us dollar and to a lesser extent the euro and the yen the other two reserve currencies of the three legged globalist central banker stool the world is transitioning to the use of local currencies currency swaps and commodities markets backed by gold the catalyst for this change of sentiment was provided by the us administration itself which sawed through its own perch by its use of unilateral sanctions by using its control over dollar based transactions to block international transactions it doesn t happen to like it forced other countries to start looking for alternatives now a growing list of countries sees throwing off the shackles of the us dollar as a strategic goal russia and china use the ruble and the yuan for their expanding trade iran sells oil to india for rupees saudi arabia has started to accept the yuan for its oil this change has many knock on effects if the dollar is no longer needed to conduct international trade other nations no longer have hold large quantities of it in reserve consequently there is no longer a need to buy up large quantities of us treasury notes therefore it becomes unnecessary to run large trade surpluses with the us essentially conducting trade at a loss further the attractiveness of the us as an export market drops and the cost of imports to the us rises thereby driving up cost inflation a vicious spiral ensues in which the ability of the us government to borrow internationally to finance the gaping chasm of its various deficits becomes impaired sovereign default of the us government and national bankruptcy then follow the us may still look mighty but its dire fiscal predicament coupled with its denial of the inevitability of bankruptcy makes it into something of a blanche dubois from the tennessee williams play a streetcar named desire she was always dependent on the kindness of strangers but was tragically unable to tell the difference between kindness and desire in this case the desire is for national advantage and security and to minimize risk by getting rid of an unreliable trading partner how quickly or slowly this comes to pass is difficult to guess at and impossible to calculate it is possible to think of the financial system in terms of a physical analogue with masses of funds traveling at some velocity having a certain inertia p mv and with forces acting on that mass to accelerate it along a different trajectory f ma it is also possible to think of it in terms of hordes of stampeding animals who can change course abruptly when panicked the recent abrupt moves in the financial markets where trillions of dollars of notional purely speculative value have been wiped out within weeks are more in line with the latter model stage 2 commercial collapse faith that the market shall provide is lost within the us there is really no other alternative than the market there are a few rustic enclaves mostly religious communities that can feed themselves but that s a rarity for everyone else there is no choice but to be a consumer consumers who are broke are called bums but they are still consumers to the extent that the us has a culture it is a commercial culture in which the goodness of a person is based on the goodly sums of money in their possession such a culture can die by becoming irrelevant when everyone is dead broke but by then most of the carriers of this culture are likely to be dead too alternatively it can be replaced by a more humane culture that isn t entirely based on the cult of mammon perhaps dare i think through a return to a pre protestant pre catholic christian ethic that values people s souls above objects of value stage 3 political collapse faith that the government will take care of you is lost all is very murky at the moment but i would venture to guess that most people in the us are too distracted too stressed and too preoccupied with their own vices and obsessions to pay much attention to the political realm of the ones they do pay attention a fair number of them seem clued in to the fact that the us is not a democracy at all but an elites only sandbox in which transnational corporate and oligarchic interests build and knock down each others sandcastles the extreme political polarization where two virtually identical pro capitalist pro war parties pretend to wage battle by virtue signaling may be a symptom of the extremely decrepit state of the entire political arrangement people are made to watch the billowing smoke and to listen to the deafening noise in the hopes that they won t notice that the wheels are no longer turning the fact that what amounts to palace intrigue the fracas between the white house the two houses of congress and a ghoulish grand inquisitor named mueller has taken center stage is uncannily reminiscent of various earlier political collapses such as the disintegration of the ottoman empire or of the fall and the consequent beheading of louis xvi the fact that trump like the ottoman worthies stocks his harem with east european women lends an eerie touch that said most people in the us seem blind to the nature of their overlords in a way that the french with their jillettes jaunes movement just as an example are definitely not stage 4 social collapse faith that your people will take care of you is lost i have been saying for some years now that within the us social collapse has largely run its course although whether people actually believe that is an entire matter entirely defining your people is rather difficult the symbols are still there the flag the statue of liberty and a predilection for iced drinks and heaping plates of greasy fried foods but the melting pot seems to have suffered a meltdown and melted all the way to china at present half the households within the us speak a language other than english at home and a fair share of the rest speak dialects of english that are not mutually intelligible with the standard north american english dialect of broadcast television and university lecturers throughout its history as a british colony and as a nation the us has been dominated by the anglo ethnos the designation ethnos is not an ethnic label it is not strictly based on genealogy language culture habitat form of government or any other single factor or group of factors these may all be important to one extent or another but the viability of an ethnos is based solely on its cohesion and the mutual inclusivity and common purpose of its members the anglo ethnos reached its zenith in the wake of world war ii during which many social groups were intermixed in the military and their more intelligent members fantastic potential was unleashed when privilege the curse of the anglo ethnos since its inception was temporarily replaced with merit and the more talented demobilized men of whatever extraction were given a chance at education and social advancement by the gi bill speaking a new sort of american english based on the ohio dialect as a lingua franca these yanks male racist sexist and chauvinistic and at least in their own minds victorious were ready to remake the entire world in their own image they proceeded to flood the entire world with oil us oil production was in full flush then and with machines that burned it such passionate acts of ethnogenesis are rare but not unusual the romans who conquered the entire mediterranean basin the barbarians who then sacked rome the mongols who later conquered most of eurasia and the germans who for a very brief moment possessed an outsized lebensraum are other examples and now it is time to ask what remains of this proud conquering anglo ethnos today we hear shrill feminist cries about toxic masculinity and minorities of every stripe railing against whitesplaining and in response we hear a few whimpers but mostly silence those proud conquering virile yanks who met and fraternized with the red army at the river elbe on april 25 1945 where are they haven t they devolved into a sad little subethnos of effeminate porn addicted overgrown boys who shave their pubic hair and need written permission to have sex without fear of being charged with rape will the anglo ethnos persist as a relict similar to how the english have managed to hold onto their royals who are technically no longer even aristocrats since they now practice exogamy with commoners or will it get wiped out in a wave of depression mental illness and opiate abuse its glorious history of rapine plunder and genocide erased and the statues of its war heros criminals knocked down only time will tell stage 5 cultural collapse faith in the goodness of humanity is lost the term culture means many things to many people but it is more productive to observe cultures than to argue about them cultures are expressed through people s stereotypical behaviors that are readily observable in public these are not the negative stereotypes often used to identify and reject outsiders but the positive stereotypes cultural standards of behavior really that serve as requirements for social adequacy and inclusion we can readily assess the viability of a culture by observing the stereotypical behaviors of its members do people exist as a single continuous inclusive sovereign realm or as a set of exclusive potentially warring enclaves segregated by income ethnicity education level political affiliation and so on do you see a lot of walls gates checkpoints security cameras and no trespassing signs is the law of the land enforced uniformly or are there good neighborhoods bad neighborhoods and no go zones where even the police fear to tread do random people thrown together in public spontaneously enter into conversation with each other and are comfortable with being crowded together or are they aloof and fearful and prefer to hide their face in the little glowing rectangle of their smartphone jealously guarding their personal space and ready to regard any encroachment on it as an assault do people remain good natured and tolerant toward each other even when hard pressed or do they hide behind a façade of tense superficial politeness and fly into a rage at the slightest provocation is conversation soft in tone gracious and respectful or is it loud shrill rude and polluted with foul language do people dress well out of respect for each other or to show off or are they all just déclassé slobs even the ones with money observe how their children behave are they fearful of strangers and trapped in a tiny world of their own or are they open to the world and ready to treat any stranger as a surrogate brother or sister aunt or uncle grandmother or grandfather without requiring any special introduction do the adults studiously ignore each others children or do they spontaneously act as a single family if there is a wreck on the road do they spontaneously rush to each others rescue and pull people out before the wreck explodes or do they in the immortal words of frank zappa get on the phone and call up some flakes who rush on over and wreck it some more if there is a flood or a fire do the neighbors take in the people who are rendered homeless or do they allow them to wait for the authorities to show up and bus them to some makeshift government shelter it is possible to quote statistics or to provide anecdotal evidence to assess the state and the viability of a culture but your own eyes and other senses can provide all the evidence you need to make that determination for yourself and to decide how much faith to put in the goodness of humanity that is evident in the people around you dmity concluded his reply by summarizing his view like this cultural and social collapse are very far along financial collapse is waiting for a trigger commercial collapse will happen in stages some of which food deserts for instance have already happened in many places political collapse will only become visible once the political class gives up it s not as simple as saying which stage we are at they are all happening in parallel to one extent or another my own totally subjective opinion is that the usa has already reached stages 1 through 4 and that there are signs that stage 5 has begun mainly in big cities as us small towns and rural areas trump s power base by the way are still struggling to maintain the norms and behaviors one could observe in the usa of the 1980s when i have visitors from europe they always comment how friendly and welcoming us americans are true i live in small town in east central florida not in miami these are the communities which voted for trump because they said we want our country back alas instead of giving them their country back trump gifted it to the neocons conclusion connecting the dots or not frankly the dots are all over the place it is really hard to miss them however for the doubleplusgoodthinking ideological drone they remain largely invisible and this is not due to any eyesight problem but due to that drone s total inability to connect the dots these are the kind of folks who danced on the deck of the titanic while it was sinking for them when the inevitable catastrophe comes it will be a total mind blowing surprise but until that moment they will keep on denying the obvious no matter how obvious that obvious has become in the meantime the us ruling elites are locked into an ugly internal struggle which only further weakens the usa what is so telling is that the democrats are still stuck with their same clueless incompetent and infinitely arrogant leadership in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the democratic party is in deep crisis and that new faces are desperately needed but no they are still completely stuck in their old ways and the same gang of gerontocrats continues to rule the party apparatus that is another surefire sign of degeneracy when a regime can only produce incompetent often old leaders who are completely out of touch with reality and who blame their own failures on internal deplorables and external the russians factors again think of the soviet union under brezhnev the apartheid regime in south africa under f w de klerk or the kerensky regime in 1917 russia it is quite telling that the political leader whom the anglozionists try to scare the most simply thinks of them as first rate idiots it is not as for the republicans they are basically a subsidiary of the israeli likud party just take a look at the long list of losers the likud produced at home and you will get a sense of what they can do in its us colony eventually the usa will rebound i have no doubts about that at all this is a big country with millions of immensely talented people immense natural resources and no credible threat to it s territory but that can only happen after a real regime change as opposed to a change in presidential administration which itself is only going to happen after an e2

global economics tend to determine the path banking outlook takes and given that credit cycles tend to dovetail economic cycles looking at the drivers of the global economy is a reasonable starting point in attempting to illuminate the banking outlook the global economy faces certain downside risk factors in 2019 three of which are first the emerging and potential china us trade war with trump and xi in discussions to meet halfway on trade matters by march 1 2019 second brexit with the unfolding events in westminster and brussels and third the us monetary policy stance on where next post the normalization cycle started by janet yellen and continued by the new fed chair jerome powell financial markets are likely to only fully price these risks overtime as they crystallise but it seems the global banking industry has begun to hedge itself of these risks if to go by the continuing balance sheet restructuring and structural adjustment actions that we saw in the latter part of 2018 by major global banks closer home buy side investors seem cautious but optimistic by tanking valuations in emerging markets as we enter 2019 and with global equities having shed off 5 trillion in 2018 and emerging markets asset classes outside equities doing relatively well there s a willingness by investors to take on more frontier risk the capital re allocation out of the emerging markets seen in 2018 as us rates normalised is likely to have largely settled we are seeing signs of excess global liquidity and with a more predictable us rates path we are likely to see funds flow into frontier markets driven by increased investor risk appetite for em s to refinance i remain optimistic of a positive transmission to em s from the macro activity in global markets if only to go by the personal experience i had in the fourth quarter of 2018 i had never seen such a flurry of london and new york based fund managers seeking meetings in an attempt to build investment thesis for the kenyan asset class for instance in equities with approximately 17 per cent or sh420 billion of wealth wiped off the nse in 2018 and with capital flight having led the nse to touch a 10 year low in october 2018 the bear market seems to provide a re entry point for foreign capital kenya s equity markets are likely to rally in 2019 but this is only one side of the emerging story looking at em economies more closely however and analyzing the idiosyncratic factors underpinning the imagined economic outlook one is left to wonder whether a consensus exists on any economic upside in the short term kenya in particular is going to face some mixed economic performance with a potential deceleration going into the medium term kenya has to refinance up to sh900 billion of debt in 2019 of which sh400 billion is domestic debt returns from the prior debt led investment cycle are yet to fully come on stream and whilst debt to gdp ratio remains conservative and debatable it is the structure of kenya s debt repayments and how much of revenue collected goes to repaying debt subject to yield tenure and currency depreciation given the amount of debt held in foreign exchange fx that may be a cause of concern supply side fiscal policy will come under pressure as kenya manages the debt refi and repayment schedules it s either we generate revenue faster from the underlying economic and investment activities or raise taxes or cut expenditure and this is not simply about a debate around debt from china or whether we are comparable to other debt led economies it s simply a unique economic structural problem that kenya has to deal with at this cycle of a debt driven economic expansion that s on the public side on the private side credit supply improved from around 2 percent to around above 4 percent in 2018 but this number remains relatively weak given the 20 percent levels in 2015 and with the effectiveness of monetary policy actions curtailed by the persisting interest rate cap credit expansion remains very much in the woods these among other broad based factors are going to create distributional consequences and a storm cloud for the economy and financial markets in 2019 what we do with monetary policy in particular repeal of the interest rate cap remains the silver lining in july 2017 i published an in depth analysis on interest rate cap elaborating on the complexity of operating a free market economy with some form of price controls in place simply put in free market economics existence of price controls of any form on one side of the market has material unintended consequences on the broad economy the continuing existence of rate cap makes it ineffective for monetary policy actions to be transmitted to the real economy twin deficits when you control interest rates you indirectly control the currency holding it at artificial levels managing inflation pressure becomes complex as the normal understood relationship between rates and inflation doesn t hold banks can t effectively price for risk and credit expansion slows in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy bank deposits move to government paper as the government borrows at artificially low rates on the more passive side to manage the twin deficits as the case of kenya with required foreign exchange reserves to manage the balance of payments like kenya s case this means nominal stability remains artificial banks are going to have to navigate an environment where even assuming a predictable and an aggressive forward guided monetary policy with rate cap the length of time it would take for these macro factors to re balance will be unpredictable for the central bank to deliver its mandate effectively the interest rate cap has to be repealed the mpc cannot keep its most important tool the cbr on a near autopilot mode when we have a market system where every other economic factor is free floating something will have to give in eventually between currency rates and or inflation with any

january the 1st 2019 marked the 60th anniversary of the cuban revolution back in december 1958 the city of santa clara fell to the combined forces of che guevara cienfuegos and revolutionary directorate rd rebels led by comandantes rolando cubela juan el mejicano abrahantes and william alexander morgan upon hearing the news of the defeat of his forces by the fidel castro led revolutionaries batista left cuba and flew to the dominican republic on 1 january 1959 havana october 2018 since then the cuban people have struggled to maintain their independence as allies came and went and enemies tried to reverse the revolution in recent years president obama attempted to normalise relations between cuba and the united states known as the cuban thaw by reducing u s travel and remittances restrictions and reopening the u s embassy in havana and the cuban embassy in washington obama even became the first u s president to visit cuba since 1928 however since the election of donald trump many of these gains have been reversed havana october 2018 in november 2018 the us government reversed the positive changes brought in by obama the trump government will disallow most individual visits and as before obama s changes americans will have to travel in groups licensed for specific purposes most importantly americans will be barred from staying in state owned hotels and frequenting state owned restaurants and stores the plan seems to be to starve the government of revenue while at the same time encouraging the growth of the private sector e g private accommodation and restaurants havana october 2018 a recent article noted the trump administration is adding new names to a list of cuban tourist attractions that americans are barred from visiting the 26 names range from the new five star iberostar grand packard and paseo del prado hotels in old havana to modest shopping centers in beach side resorts far from the capital all are barred because they are owned by cuba s military business conglomerate gaesa santa clara october 2018 che guevara mausoleum adding to these difficulties is the existence of two operating currencies the cuban peso cup and the cuban convertible peso cuc the cuc is pegged to the dollar and is worth 25 times more than the cup one cuban convertible peso cuc is about one euro most cuban citizens are paid in cup but consumer goods are priced in cuc while it was announced a few years ago that this system was going to end it is still going strong havana october 2018 disparity it is a system that could cause major problems for the government while most citizens are paid in cup 1000 2000 pesos 40 80 euros per month those working in the tourism sector can earn cuc one can earn 30 cuc 30 euros driving a tourist from the airport to the centre of old havana or 20 cuc 20 euros a night in a private airbnb room letting the local bars restaurants and even supermarkets all use cuc cigar factory workers are paid in cup yet one cohiba cigar could cost 10 cuc in the factory shop on my recent trip there i asked the bar and restaurant staff in havana for cup notes the three peso note carries a picture of che guevara only to find them asking all their workmates if they had any cup and eventually arriving back triumphantly with the requested notes and handing them to me as a gift demonstrating the growing gap in the value of the two currencies havana october 2018 is it possible that the growing disparity between those who earn cup and those who earn cuc is creating a well off new middle class it is interesting to note that trump s cuban policies seem to be created to ensure the exacerbation of these discrepancies is there a political strategy developing here if we look at the essential elements of recent colour revolutions we generally find the combination of a disgruntled middle class and mobile data access to the internet to avail of the internet in havana most people buy etecsa prepaid internet cards and go to a nearby wifi hotspot usually the local park however data packages are becoming available they are expensive if you are earning only cup and only the relatively well off will be able to afford them e g 4gb of data for 30 a month s wages in cup but for those working in the tourist sector this should be affordable potentially creating the basis for a powerful social media in cuba the growth of the private sector can be seen in the number of new private restaurants bnb pension type accommodation cafes and bars in havana yet many of the cubans i met could not afford to buy even a sandwich in the cafes as they are priced in cuc the collapse of state enterprises already under a lot of stress could lead to cheap real estate being bought up by the cash rich and generally benefit non supporters of castro and left wing ideology politically and financially as it is there is increasing pressure on the government with only 1 2 percent growth in the economy and a 40 percent drop in venezuelan oil deliveries since 2014 in a society where state run companies account for and control most economic activity havana october 2018 embargoes the difficulties for the cuban people are increased by the ongoing united states led embargo against cuba in october 2018 the un general assembly adopted its annual resolution to end the embargo ma zhaoxu china s permanent representative to the united nations stated that the blockade is contrary to the principle of the united nations charter and cause huge financial and economic damage for cuba and hinders cuba s ability to achieve the sustainable development goals for the cuban people it will be a case of resist to exist like the palestinian situation but in cuba one can see frustration and determination for a better life all around the 60th anniversary celebrations of 2019 will be a most important symbolic reminder in the discussions on the differing possible paths for cuba s future all photos by caoimhghin ó croidheáin

action if beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property china has retaliated with tariffs of its own however beijing s export data had been

said xu gao chief economist at everbright securities in an annual meeting of top leaders last month china said it will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments a few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility but most expect beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past due to worries that it could

when the abacha dictatorship in nigeria 1993 98 was facing collapse the nigerian elite backed and advised by imperialism prepared the ground for a transition to a bourgeois democratic regime the various presidents from obasanjo to buhari today have run corrupt regimes doing nothing to alleviate the suffering of the nigerian masses while enriching themselves and their cronies in the process oil accounts for about 90 per cent of the value of nigerian exports but more than 80 per cent of the money generated by those exports ends up in the hands of a mere one per cent of the population according to a 2012 bbc report poverty has risen in nigeria with almost 100 million people living on less than a 1 0 63 a day despite economic growth statistics have shown the national bureau of statistics said 60 9 of nigerians in 2010 were living in absolute poverty this figure had risen from 54 7 in 2004 establishment discredited all this explains the discrediting of the two major parties the pdp in power between 1999 and 2015 and the apc in office since 2015 next month february 2019 presidential elections are being held and there is much speculation about the possible outcome given the discrediting of all the established politicians what we are facing in nigeria is a similar process that we have seen around the world the old established bourgeois parties that have run the system for years have seen their base of support slowly whittled away however the leaders of the labour movement in this case of the nigerian labour congress have failed to offer a credible alternative they do not mobilise seriously and have failed to build a political alternative i e a genuine workers party in this context a huge vacuum has been created on the political front and because the trade union leaders refuse to fill it someone else will do it and that someone else is most likely to be a bourgeois or petit bourgeois populist demagogue it is in this context that omoyele sowore has appeared on the scene his decision to stand in the elections has raised hopes among a layer particularly of the youth that here we have a candidate who can clean up and modernise nigeria therefore it is worth looking at who he is and what he stands for omoyele sowore who is now in his forties lectures modern african history at the city university of new york and post colonial african history at the school of art new york he made a name for himself in 1992 94 when he led the student union at the university of lagos he was violently attacked by armed cultist gangs was arrested and beaten several times after which he left the country for the united states subsequently from his manhattan apartment he launched a website sahara reporters that began to make a name for itself by exposing high level cases of corruption it has become very popular and has turned sowore into a respected opposition figure in nigeria so big is the pressure within society that he even talks about revolution in nigeria what kind of revolution however is not specified sowore s financial backing a layer of the youth and also the working class is looking to sowore in the hope of finding the change they so desperately seek the question we have to ask ourselves as marxists is does sowore have the programme necessary to eliminate poverty create jobs build an efficient infrastructure and modernise nigeria as the millions of nigerian workers youth and poor urgently need and more fundamentally does he represent the interests of the nigerian workers and poor or does he represent other class interests according to pulse the presidential candidate of the african action congress aac omoyele sowore has made n37 6 million 103 045 in campaign donations from his gofundme fundraiser for the 2019 presidential election his aim was to raise us 2million so he is still far from his objective the 100 000 dollars he has raised comes mainly from middle class layers of the nigerian diaspora people who are prepared to make donations to what they believe will be a candidate that can clean up nigeria however it is worth looking at who else backs and finances sowore and his sahara reporters project among his backers are to be found the ford foundation and the omidyar foundation sowore himself stated the following in an interview ford foundation funded sahara reporters until the last general elections of 2015 sahara reporters as a cutting edge digital medium has recently received further funding from omidyar network in california see my sahara reporters story sowore feb 28 2016 we have to ask ourselves why bodies such as the ford foundation would finance the activities of sowore and sahara reporters if we look at what kind of activities they promote it will help us to understand what limitations these bodies would put on sowore s programme the ford foundation does a lot of charitable and philanthropic work around the world and is presented as a force for good but its political agenda is clearly liberal i e based on promoting a free market economy it finances ngos renowned as organisations that are put in place to cut across the process of radicalisation to the left to intercept these processes and channel them down safe roads in the past the foundation was even accused of having connections to cia agents the present president of the ford foundation is darren walker who worked as a lawyer and investment banker in 2006 he was named the rockefeller foundation s vice president for united states and international initiatives omidyar network on the other hand describes itself as a philanthropic investment firm similar in fact to the ford foundation it was established in 2004 and has provided more than 992 million to non profit organizations and for profit companies in a recent video sowore indicates he may hire seun onigbinde as his finance minister a key position in any possible future administration under sowore it is worth listening to this youtube discussion where the whole emphasis is on how to make it difficult even impossible for politicians to steal public funds the idea behind this is that you can have a capitalist nigeria without corruption that is like saying you can have a lion that does not eat meat but more importantly it is worth looking at who seun onigbinde is together with joseph agunbiade in 2011 he set up budgit as a means of publicising government spending and making it available to the wider public interestingly in 2014 the same omidyar network quoted above as a source of funding for sowore invested 400 000 in budgit and in 2015 the governor of kaduna state signed up budgit in an experiment in government transparency then in 2017 budgit received a further 3million from the same omidyar network and also from the gates foundation the gates foundation has among its donors people like warren buffet one of the richest men in the world there is a saying tell me who your friends are and i will tell you who you are or if we want to change that slightly we could say tell me who finances you and i will tell you what you can and cannot do the danger of ngoism foundations like the ford foundation or the gates foundation promote and finance what are known as non governmental organisations or ngos from a political point of view what is the role of the ngos it is to cut across the radicalisation to the left of a layer of the youth and working class around the globe in the 1980s the imf and world bank were promoting saps structural adjustment programmes involving privatisation of state assets and the opening up of the economies of the former colonial countries as opposition to these programmes grew among the workers and students in the early 1980s the us and european union together with the world bank found a useful tool in the ngos and decided to channel a lot of funding to them ngos are to be found promoting gender equality anti racism etc which provides them with a veneer of radicalism they consciously seek out left wing youth and offer them what seem to be practical campaigning activities but with the advantage that they can find paid employment thus they are launched into what becomes a personal career involving their own material improvement it is in effect a way of corrupting the militant youth and turning them into harmless social activists the growth of social movements challenging the impact of the saps was met by a project to subvert them it is not by chance that the ngos tend to be against so called statism and promote the free market economy the imperialist backed regimes such as the ones we have seen in the past twenty years in nigeria proceeded to privatise and carry out the dictates of their masters opening up their national economies to cheap imports and paying out huge sums in debt repayment they also began chipping away at the old labour laws reducing workers rights in the process the cost of labour was brought down and unemployment continued to rise the ngos are useful in this context as they do nothing to stop all this but limit themselves to promoting so called self help projects and job training in the process alleviating the conditions of a very small layer of the poor while corrupting the local leaders and working to undermine any genuine mass movement from below impending revolution and the need for clarity given the vacuum on the left in nigeria and given the seething anger of the masses and the inevitable radicalisation of the youth it is logical that the more farsighted imperialist bourgeoisie and their agents in nigeria will work systematically to divert the youth away from genuine revolutionary politics that is precisely the role of the ngos they will also finance any political project that while seemingly radical does not go beyond the confines of the capitalist system it is abundantly clear that sowore project falls into this category the people behind such operations are bourgeois liberals they do a lot of philanthropic work they fund many activities they even put on a left face promoting anti racism gay rights etc but they remain fundamentally bourgeois therefore the fact that they are prepared to fund sowore and the people around him such as onigbinde says much about the limitations of his policies and the whole project he is promoting if anyone has any doubts about what we are saying here we can quote at length from the horse s mouth sowore gave an interview under the title why i want to be nigeria s president published in sahara reporters on march 28 last year in which he said we helped ensure that obasanjo s third term was scuttled sahara reporters was instrumental in ensuring that we had a constitutional transfer of power to goodluck jonathan when yar adua died and in 2015 our pioneering efforts at the real time reporting of electoral results helped to ensure the sanctity of the electoral process leading to the defeat of an incumbent party we ve done this not just in nigeria but across the african continent in nations like zimbabwe and gambia thus rather than campaigning for a genuine left alternative they limited themselves to making sure democracy works but what benefit was there for the masses in the passage from obasanjo to goodluck none whatsoever it merely served to defuse some of the anger against obasanjo who was trying to stay in office but the essence of the policy carried out at the top did not change sowore promises a lot power supply security and unemployment are major issues there is no reason why nigeria should have an almost 20 unemployment rate we have tens of millions of willing able and competent people who are waiting to be put to work the best way to get them to work will be to provide at least 20 000 megawatts of electricity with the first three years of coming to power i will turn nigeria into a construction site everything from roads hospitals schools modern railways and highways will be built like never before we have massive deficits in housing and infrastructure and my government will immediately move to address those deficits generating jobs at the same time i plan to immediately employ up to 200 000 young graduates as teachers that will be deployed in cities towns and villages and other under served areas they will be trained for six months before they head out to work sowore wants a better kind of capitalism nobody would argue against the fact that the power supply in nigeria needs to be increased massively that an efficient transport system across the whole country must be built and that millions of jobs need to be created in that sense as marxists we enormously sympathise with the aspirations of the workers the poor the youth who look to sowore but we also have to ask the question how is he going to achieve all this how is he going to finance it all his answer is very revealing he says he will do it by promoting business the creation of an enabling business environment will be a major plank of our growth platform my government will work to make it easier for businesses to thrive in nigeria sowore is basically trying to promote a better kind of capitalism and in that sense he falls into the category of bourgeois liberalism he thinks he can develop capitalism in a better way than previous leaders in nigeria he claims that by combating corruption he will allow for development he ignores the fact that corruption is what the whole system rests on you can t have capitalism without corruption his propaganda is in fact very similar to that of the five stars movement in italy that denounced corruption and inefficiency and promised to modernise the country but after the elections the five stars entered a coalition with the far right league and among the many policies they have come up with is a massive pardoning of tax evaders a legalisation of illegal constructions all mixed together with blatant racism and discrimination if sowore were ever to become president he would show in practice as the five stars in italy is doing that you cannot change the monster of capitalism into a gentle guardian angel of the working people let us take one of his promises to massively increase the power supply he says he will achieve this by promoting the private sector in order to fund these projects i will be relying on a more judicious use of our existing resources as well as the judicious use of public private partnerships ppp public private partnerships have been used for years in britain promoted first by the tories in the 1990s and then enthusiastically embraced by tony blair private capital has made huge profits from all this see private finance initiative britain leads the way to disaster for more details on this the old way for a government to build new infrastructure hospitals schools or new roads was to find the finance either through taxation or borrowing and then pay for the project to be carried out this way the new infrastructure would become a state asset with a public private partnership however the asset remains in the hands of the private builder and the state basically leases it over many decades the idea of public private partnership was developed with the excuse that the public debt was already too high and so the state could not afford to directly finance new projects in practice where this has been applied the state has ended up paying far more over a long period than it would have done had it directly built the infrastructure itself thus what sowore is proposing is to create very lucrative projects for the nigerian and foreign capitalists and it would be the nigerian people who would be called on to pay for all this for decades to come it is no accident that the present corbyn led labour party in britain is promising to bring back the pfi projects under state control role of marxists is to warn of limitations of bourgeois populism the role of the marxists is to explain all this patiently and while have a friendly and sympathetic approach warn the workers and youth that the programme sowore stands on cannot solve their problems we need to warn ahead that this project will be used to promote a bourgeois liberal agenda disguised as a revolution of course this means privatisation cuts in social welfare increases in student fees and so on but all covered in the veneer of clean politics of anti corruption etc in the final analysis none of this will be to the benefit of the working masses of nigeria yes we are all against corruption we all want good roads and houses hospitals schools and we all want to massively upgrade the power supply and the distribution network but how is this going to be achieved if it is all based on making a profit for the private companies that would be involved how can the private sector help in this the private sector is dominated by all the major operators who have made a lot of money by holding political power it is not by chance that among the most powerful and wealthiest men in nigeria are to be found former military dictators who became rich on the back of the nigerian people the central question is the following is sowore prepared to go one more step forward and call for the expropriation of these ill gotten riches is he prepared to call for nationalisation and workers control since he is promoting good capitalism a clean capitalism a people s capitalism we strongly doubt if he will do that because there is no such capitalism and it will never be achieved so long as capitalism or the free market economy remains in place it will be its economic laws that will continue to govern nigeria will continue to be at the mercy of imperialist domination profit will remain the driving force and the mechanism of competition means the strong survive and the weak go under there is no way of avoiding this on a capitalist basis marxists bring out the reality of the situation the wealth to carry out what sowore promises is there but it is in the hands of the local rich elite and the multinational oil and gas companies it must be taken out of their hands therefore the expropriation of these corporations is the only concrete demand that would really make available the funding for all the projects sowore promises to carry out for the same reason stated above it is doubtful if sowore will go down this road if he were elected and that is not at all guaranteed considering the many means the ruling elite have to get the election results they want he would proceed to expose his own limitations he would enormously disappoint those honest workers and youth who today in nigeria are in desperate search of a political force that will defend their interests when this happens a genuine mass left alternative must be in place that can offer a way out of the nightmare of nigerian capitalism the reason why a phenomenon such as the movement around sowore can emerge in nigeria is because the working class has been denied its own political voice the reason for this lies fundamentally on the shoulders of the leaders of the nlc nigerian labour congress the trade union leaders such as oshiomhole in the past who had immense authority among the masses but preferred to line up with one wing of the nigerian capitalist ruling class rather than build the workers alternative given this situation today we cannot stop the rise of bourgeois populism in the short term but we can dedicate ourselves to work systematically towards the building of the workers alternative which can only be based on the nationalisation under workers democratic control and management of the key sectors of the economy part of this huge task involves addressing the illusions that many people may have in individuals like sowore he may live a period of popularity and can gather around him a section of the youth who yearn for genuine change and for an end to the rotten system in nigeria however we must tell these youth the truth which is itself a revolutionary act and win the most advanced to the programme of marxism and build the revolutionary alternative that the workers of nigeria so desperately need

will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments a few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility but most expect beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan sources told reuters last week that beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6 6 5 per cent this year after an expected 6 6 per cent in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years
the other main reason why the parallels figure prominently in market commentary is because the fed appears to be in a similar position to the one it found itself early in 2016 then as now the fed raised interest rates in december and signalled further tightening in the coming year in the face of a china driven loss of momentum in the global economy asset prices plunged and as is the case currently the fed swiftly moved to dampen expectations that further rate increases were imminent contributing to a sharp rally in markets the similarities have taken on significance partly because of mounting concerns about the health of the global economy as i argued previously the sharp slowdown in china has become a more important determinant of sentiment in the past several weeks amplified by the recent warning from apple about slowing iphone sales in the world s second largest economy then as now there was a surge in volatility in stock markets then as now china s economy and policy regime were a focal point of anxiety then as now the federal reserve had to reassure investors that it was not hell bent on raising interest rates aggressively other obvious parallels with the start of 2016 include a weakening us dollar a recovery in commodity markets and an improvement in sentiment towards developing economies is this 2016 all over again if international investors are having flashbacks to the early months of 2016 one can understand why many of the drivers of asset prices three years ago are strikingly similar to the ones that are influencing financial markets today the similarities with early 2016 have not been lost on policymakers themselves in remarks at the annual meeting of the american economic association on january 4 fed chair jerome powell cited the china induced shift in us monetary policy in 2016 as evidence that the central bank can react quickly if external headwinds endanger the us economy powell s dovish comments have been the main catalyst behind the sharp recovery in stock markets since the end of last year with the benchmark s p 500 index enjoying its strongest 10 day rally since 2009 according to data from bloomberg the big question however is whether the parallels with 2016 will persist in the coming months which would mean that china s economy recovers the fed keeps rates unchanged and markets enjoy a spectacular rally for the remainder of this year while the fed china nexus will undoubtedly be a key driver of asset prices this year there are reasons to believe that 2019 will not be a repeat of 2016 not only is it unlikely that the two main underpinnings of the 2016 rally a fed that refrains from tightening policy and an aggressive stimulus package that quickly turns around china s economy will fall into place simultaneously once again the geopolitical landscape is quite distinct from the one three years ago first it is still unclear whether the fed will halt its rate hiking cycle this year america s economy although having recently shown signs of slowing is expanding at a significantly faster pace than in 2016 what is more even if the fed does pause it will continue to tighten policy by unwinding its balance sheet a crucial element of stimulus that had yet to be withdrawn in 2016 second china s economy is in a race against time by the spring of 2016 manufacturing activity which had been contracting for several months as part of the fallout from the shock devaluation of the yuan in august 2015 had already begun to recover powered by an aggressive fiscal stimulus package today the deleveraging campaign which began to bite in late 2017 is limiting the scope for more forceful measures china s manufacturing sector moreover only entered contraction territory last month and looks set to decline further increasing the threat of deflation third and perhaps most importantly donald trump is now america s president in 2016 investors did not have to contend with the damaging effects of a full blown trade war while beijing and washington have at least returned to the negotiating table resolving the underlying problems bedevilling us china relations will prove exceedingly difficult what is more america s response to a severe downturn in the global economy is now in doubt not only have trump s protectionist policies and more recently his assault on the fed undermined sentiment his deep hostility towards multilateralism is exacerbating financial tensions three years ago the world economy benefited from a purported shanghai accord this was the apparent quid pro quo that emerged from the g20 summit in february 2016 in which the fed agreed to be patient in raising rates while china launched a major stimulus programme the agreement brought about a sharp fall in the dollar and triggered a fierce rally in markets investors are clamouring for another shanghai accord the absence of one this year is another reason why 2019 is unlikely to be a repeat of 2016 nicholas

when the abacha dictatorship in nigeria 1993 98 was facing collapse the nigerian elite backed and advised by imperialism prepared the ground for a transition to a bourgeois democratic regime the various presidents from obasanjo to buhari today have run corrupt regimes doing nothing to alleviate the suffering of the nigerian masses while enriching themselves and their cronies in the process oil accounts for about 90 per cent of the value of nigerian exports but more than 80 per cent of the money generated by those exports ends up in the hands of a mere one per cent of the population according to a 2012 bbc report poverty has risen in nigeria with almost 100 million people living on less than a 1 0 63 a day despite economic growth statistics have shown the national bureau of statistics said 60 9 of nigerians in 2010 were living in absolute poverty this figure had risen from 54 7 in 2004 establishment discredited all this explains the discrediting of the two major parties the pdp in power between 1999 and 2015 and the apc in office since 2015 next month february 2019 presidential elections are being held and there is much speculation about the possible outcome given the discrediting of all the established politicians what we are facing in nigeria is a similar process that we have seen around the world the old established bourgeois parties that have run the system for years have seen their base of support slowly whittled away however the leaders of the labour movement in this case of the nigerian labour congress have failed to offer a credible alternative they do not mobilise seriously and have failed to build a political alternative i e a genuine workers party in this context a huge vacuum has been created on the political front and because the trade union leaders refuse to fill it someone else will do it and that someone else is most likely to be a bourgeois or petit bourgeois populist demagogue it is in this context that omoyele sowore has appeared on the scene his decision to stand in the elections has raised hopes among a layer particularly of the youth that here we have a candidate who can clean up and modernise nigeria therefore it is worth looking at who he is and what he stands for omoyele sowore who is now in his forties lectures modern african history at the city university of new york and post colonial african history at the school of art new york he made a name for himself in 1992 94 when he led the student union at the university of lagos he was violently attacked by armed cultist gangs was arrested and beaten several times after which he left the country for the united states subsequently from his manhattan apartment he launched a website sahara reporters that began to make a name for itself by exposing high level cases of corruption it has become very popular and has turned sowore into a respected opposition figure in nigeria so big is the pressure within society that he even talks about revolution in nigeria what kind of revolution however is not specified sowore s financial backing a layer of the youth and also the working class is looking to sowore in the hope of finding the change they so desperately seek the question we have to ask ourselves as marxists is does sowore have the programme necessary to eliminate poverty create jobs build an efficient infrastructure and modernise nigeria as the millions of nigerian workers youth and poor urgently need and more fundamentally does he represent the interests of the nigerian workers and poor or does he represent other class interests according to pulse the presidential candidate of the african action congress aac omoyele sowore has made n37 6 million 103 045 in campaign donations from his gofundme fundraiser for the 2019 presidential election his aim was to raise us 2million so he is still far from his objective the 100 000 dollars he has raised comes mainly from middle class layers of the nigerian diaspora people who are prepared to make donations to what they believe will be a candidate that can clean up nigeria however it is worth looking at who else backs and finances sowore and his sahara reporters project among his backers are to be found the ford foundation and the omidyar foundation sowore himself stated the following in an interview ford foundation funded sahara reporters until the last general elections of 2015 sahara reporters as a cutting edge digital medium has recently received further funding from omidyar network in california see my sahara reporters story sowore feb 28 2016 we have to ask ourselves why bodies such as the ford foundation would finance the activities of sowore and sahara reporters if we look at what kind of activities they promote it will help us to understand what limitations these bodies would put on sowore s programme the ford foundation does a lot of charitable and philanthropic work around the world and is presented as a force for good but its political agenda is clearly liberal i e based on promoting a free market economy it finances ngos renowned as organisations that are put in place to cut across the process of radicalisation to the left to intercept these processes and channel them down safe roads in the past the foundation was even accused of having connections to cia agents the present president of the ford foundation is darren walker who worked as a lawyer and investment banker in 2006 he was named the rockefeller foundation s vice president for united states and international initiatives omidyar network on the other hand describes itself as a philanthropic investment firm similar in fact to the ford foundation it was established in 2004 and has provided more than 992 million to non profit organizations and for profit companies in a recent video sowore indicates he may hire seun onigbinde as his finance minister a key position in any possible future administration under sowore it is worth listening to this youtube discussion where the whole emphasis is on how to make it difficult even impossible for politicians to steal public funds the idea behind this is that you can have a capitalist nigeria without corruption that is like saying you can have a lion that does not eat meat but more importantly it is worth looking at who seun onigbinde is together with joseph agunbiade in 2011 he set up budgit as a means of publicising government spending and making it available to the wider public interestingly in 2014 the same omidyar network quoted above as a source of funding for sowore invested 400 000 in budgit and in 2015 the governor of kaduna state signed up budgit in an experiment in government transparency then in 2017 budgit received a further 3million from the same omidyar network and also from the gates foundation the gates foundation has among its donors people like warren buffet one of the richest men in the world there is a saying tell me who your friends are and i will tell you who you are or if we want to change that slightly we could say tell me who finances you and i will tell you what you can and cannot do the danger of ngoism foundations like the ford foundation or the gates foundation promote and finance what are known as non governmental organisations or ngos from a political point of view what is the role of the ngos it is to cut across the radicalisation to the left of a layer of the youth and working class around the globe in the 1980s the imf and world bank were promoting saps structural adjustment programmes involving privatisation of state assets and the opening up of the economies of the former colonial countries as opposition to these programmes grew among the workers and students in the early 1980s the us and european union together with the world bank found a useful tool in the ngos and decided to channel a lot of funding to them ngos are to be found promoting gender equality anti racism etc which provides them with a veneer of radicalism they consciously seek out left wing youth and offer them what seem to be practical campaigning activities but with the advantage that they can find paid employment thus they are launched into what becomes a personal career involving their own material improvement it is in effect a way of corrupting the militant youth and turning them into harmless social activists the growth of social movements challenging the impact of the saps was met by a project to subvert them it is not by chance that the ngos tend to be against so called statism and promote the free market economy the imperialist backed regimes such as the ones we have seen in the past twenty years in nigeria proceeded to privatise and carry out the dictates of their masters opening up their national economies to cheap imports and paying out huge sums in debt repayment they also began chipping away at the old labour laws reducing workers rights in the process the cost of labour was brought down and unemployment continued to rise the ngos are useful in this context as they do nothing to stop all this but limit themselves to promoting so called self help projects and job training in the process alleviating the conditions of a very small layer of the poor while corrupting the local leaders and working to undermine any genuine mass movement from below impending revolution and the need for clarity given the vacuum on the left in nigeria and given the seething anger of the masses and the inevitable radicalisation of the youth it is logical that the more farsighted imperialist bourgeoisie and their agents in nigeria will work systematically to divert the youth away from genuine revolutionary politics that is precisely the role of the ngos they will also finance any political project that while seemingly radical does not go beyond the confines of the capitalist system it is abundantly clear that sowore project falls into this category the people behind such operations are bourgeois liberals they do a lot of philanthropic work they fund many activities they even put on a left face promoting anti racism gay rights etc but they remain fundamentally bourgeois therefore the fact that they are prepared to fund sowore and the people around him such as onigbinde says much about the limitations of his policies and the whole project he is promoting if anyone has any doubts about what we are saying here we can quote at length from the horse s mouth sowore gave an interview under the title why i want to be nigeria s president published in sahara reporters on march 28 last year in which he said we helped ensure that obasanjo s third term was scuttled sahara reporters was instrumental in ensuring that we had a constitutional transfer of power to goodluck jonathan when yar adua died and in 2015 our pioneering efforts at the real time reporting of electoral results helped to ensure the sanctity of the electoral process leading to the defeat of an incumbent party we ve done this not just in nigeria but across the african continent in nations like zimbabwe and gambia thus rather than campaigning for a genuine left alternative they limited themselves to making sure democracy works but what benefit was there for the masses in the passage from obasanjo to goodluck none whatsoever it merely served to defuse some of the anger against obasanjo who was trying to stay in office but the essence of the policy carried out at the top did not change sowore promises a lot power supply security and unemployment are major issues there is no reason why nigeria should have an almost 20 unemployment rate we have tens of millions of willing able and competent people who are waiting to be put to work the best way to get them to work will be to provide at least 20 000 megawatts of electricity with the first three years of coming to power i will turn nigeria into a construction site everything from roads hospitals schools modern railways and highways will be built like never before we have massive deficits in housing and infrastructure and my government will immediately move to address those deficits generating jobs at the same time i plan to immediately employ up to 200 000 young graduates as teachers that will be deployed in cities towns and villages and other under served areas they will be trained for six months before they head out to work sowore wants a better kind of capitalism nobody would argue against the fact that the power supply in nigeria needs to be increased massively that an efficient transport system across the whole country must be built and that millions of jobs need to be created in that sense as marxists we enormously sympathise with the aspirations of the workers the poor the youth who look to sowore but we also have to ask the question how is he going to achieve all this how is he going to finance it all his answer is very revealing he says he will do it by promoting business the creation of an enabling business environment will be a major plank of our growth platform my government will work to make it easier for businesses to thrive in nigeria sowore is basically trying to promote a better kind of capitalism and in that sense he falls into the category of bourgeois liberalism he thinks he can develop capitalism in a better way than previous leaders in nigeria he claims that by combating corruption he will allow for development he ignores the fact that corruption is what the whole system rests on you can t have capitalism without corruption his propaganda is in fact very similar to that of the five stars movement in italy that denounced corruption and inefficiency and promised to modernise the country but after the elections the five stars entered a coalition with the far right league and among the many policies they have come up with is a massive pardoning of tax evaders a legalisation of illegal constructions all mixed together with blatant racism and discrimination if sowore were ever to become president he would show in practice as the five stars in italy is doing that you cannot change the monster of capitalism into a gentle guardian angel of the working people let us take one of his promises to massively increase the power supply he says he will achieve this by promoting the private sector in order to fund these projects i will be relying on a more judicious use of our existing resources as well as the judicious use of public private partnerships ppp public private partnerships have been used for years in britain promoted first by the tories in the 1990s and then enthusiastically embraced by tony blair private capital has made huge profits from all this see private finance initiative britain leads the way to disaster for more details on this the old way for a government to build new infrastructure hospitals schools or new roads was to find the finance either through taxation or borrowing and then pay for the project to be carried out this way the new infrastructure would become a state asset with a public private partnership however the asset remains in the hands of the private builder and the state basically leases it over many decades the idea of public private partnership was developed with the excuse that the public debt was already too high and so the state could not afford to directly finance new projects in practice where this has been applied the state has ended up paying far more over a long period than it would have done had it directly built the infrastructure itself thus what sowore is proposing is to create very lucrative projects for the nigerian and foreign capitalists and it would be the nigerian people who would be called on to pay for all this for decades to come it is no accident that the present corbyn led labour party in britain is promising to bring back the pfi projects under state control role of marxists is to warn of limitations of bourgeois populism the role of the marxists is to explain all this patiently and while have a friendly and sympathetic approach warn the workers and youth that the programme sowore stands on cannot solve their problems we need to warn ahead that this project will be used to promote a bourgeois liberal agenda disguised as a revolution of course this means privatisation cuts in social welfare increases in student fees and so on but all covered in the veneer of clean politics of anti corruption etc in the final analysis none of this will be to the benefit of the working masses of nigeria yes we are all against corruption we all want good roads and houses hospitals schools and we all want to massively upgrade the power supply and the distribution network but how is this going to be achieved if it is all based on making a profit for the private companies that would be involved how can the private sector help in this the private sector is dominated by all the major operators who have made a lot of money by holding political power it is not by chance that among the most powerful and wealthiest men in nigeria are to be found former military dictators who became rich on the back of the nigerian people the central question is the following is sowore prepared to go one more step forward and call for the expropriation of these ill gotten riches is he prepared to call for nationalisation and workers control since he is promoting good capitalism a clean capitalism a people s capitalism we strongly doubt if he will do that because there is no such capitalism and it will never be achieved so long as capitalism or the free market economy remains in place it will be its economic laws that will continue to govern nigeria will continue to be at the mercy of imperialist domination profit will remain the driving force and the mechanism of competition means the strong survive and the weak go under there is no way of avoiding this on a capitalist basis marxists bring out the reality of the situation the wealth to carry out what sowore promises is there but it is in the hands of the local rich elite and the multinational oil and gas companies it must be taken out of their hands therefore the expropriation of these corporations is the only concrete demand that would really make available the funding for all the projects sowore promises to carry out for the same reason stated above it is doubtful if sowore will go down this road if he were elected and that is not at all guaranteed considering the many means the ruling elite have to get the election results they want he would proceed to expose his own limitations he would enormously disappoint those honest workers and youth who today in nigeria are in desperate search of a political force that will defend their interests when this happens a genuine mass left alternative must be in place that can offer a way out of the nightmare of nigerian capitalism the reason why a phenomenon such as the movement around sowore can emerge in nigeria is because the working class has been denied its own political voice the reason for this lies fundamentally on the shoulders of the leaders of the nlc nigerian labour congress the trade union leaders such as oshiomhole in the past who had immense authority among the masses but preferred to line up with one wing of the nigerian capitalist ruling class rather than build the workers alternative given this situation today we cannot stop the rise of bourgeois populism in the short term but we can dedicate ourselves to work systematically towards the building of the workers alternative which can only be based on the nationalisation under workers democratic control and management of the key sectors of the economy part of this huge task involves addressing the illusions that many people may have in individuals like sowore he may live a period of popularity and can gather around him a section of the youth who yearn for genuine change and for an end to the rotten system in nigeria however we must tell these youth the truth which is itself a revolutionary act and win the most advanced to the programme of marxism and build the revolutionary alternative that the workers of nigeria so desperately need

cameroon internationally no single issue or event in recent decades has provoked so much controversy and unified hostility and opposition in the west than china s loans and investments to african countries the intensity and sheer unprecedented scale of both western mainstream and scholarly analysis on this debt trap are not surprising considering that china managed to have 44 heads of state at the same venue during the 7th summit of the forum on china africa co operation during the gathering china s president xi jinping dispersed 60 billion in the form of assistance investment and loans for roads railways ports and other mega infrastructure projects as part of china s one belt one road infrastructure initiative why the sudden interest in african indebtedness to the chinese what about the debt owed western nations and western led lending institutions are these criticisms legitimate considering that since the 1960s western nations and western led international financial institutions such as the international monetary fund and world bank have plundered africa and fostered conditions that made it difficult or impossible for african countries to repay their debts the debt trap narrative which western experts and pundits sought to promote emerged from western nervousness about china africa co operation and was systematically and meticulously planned to discredit chinese economic and political influence there is a multitude of research that illustrates that western nations and western led financial institutions are the major proprietors of african debt not china although at present china is one of the main lenders on the continent and undoubtedly not the only one and its share of the debt is substantially increasing nonetheless it is not the largest in light of these criticisms the trump administration had an opportunity to develop a consistent and long term strategy which clearly states how it intends to deepen and strengthen its multifaceted engagements with the continent and collaborate with africa s global partners in fostering inclusive growth and social and economic development thus on 13 december 2018 john bolton president donald trump s national security adviser revealed the trump administration s new africa strategy at the conservative heritage foundation in washington bolton began the presentation with benevolent grandiloquence by declaring that stability prosperity independence and security on the african continent are in the national security interest of the united states the strategy had nothing to do with africa and was all about countering sub saharan africa s main trading partner and the region s main source of aid and investment bolton went on to point out that the justification for countering chinese influence on the continent and promoting us national security interests is they are deliberately and aggressively targeting their investments in the region to gain a competitive advantage over the united states china uses bribes opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt to hold states in africa captive to beijing s wishes and demands driven by a desire to confront china s growing influence one of the key battlegrounds for global economic contest bolton did not acknowledge africa s own efforts to address myriad challenges such as corruption poverty reduction terrorism trans border crimes illicit transfer of funds over dependence on foreign aid food security urban development and access to finance for infrastructure such as transport roads railways ports energy renewable sources water and sanitation and information and communication technology many scholars researching africa s international relations have emphasised that the trump s administration s african strategy which seeks to counter china and russia s economic and political influence on the continent reveals the re emergence of cold war politics the battle for influence is disguised as being equal partnerships to enhance africa s socio economic development moreover they maintain that africa as a battlefield for influence remains as significant as it was seven decades ago however chairperson of the african union commission moussa faki dismissed these misguided claims and emphasises that africa determines its partnerships narratives in a tweet moussa argues stop this stereotypical idea of africa as a hapless terrain where europe china or others have free rein to battle for influence we choose our partnerships and create conditions based on mutual interest and benefit do not infantilise an entire continent the tweet by faki clearly shows that african countries are willing to offer any country equal opportunities to demonstrate how they intend to partner with them in collective efforts towards socio economic development peace and security african countries are willing to collaborate on the basis of mutual benefits bolton s announcement of the strategy sparked a media frenzy about two core issues is it viable in terms of the merits of opportunities that it will bring to the continent and does this strategy present a paradigm shift in us foreign policy with africa further what does the strategy say about the strategic relevance of the us on the continent does this strategy reflect renewed commitments considering trump s shithole countries remarks the trump administration argues that the focus purpose and motivations of the strategy are new and thus fundamentally different from the engagement of obama s administration with africa there is nothing new about this strategy it is just a simple re orientation of us africa strategy under a regime with a radical nationalistic and anti multilateralism agenda it is just a strategy formulated by a global superpower to cope with and respond to the stiff competition from china for access and control over resources the us seems to be falling behind as china india russia and the european union are deepening and strengthening their engagement with africa africa was never part of the trump administration s national interest and foreign policy it regarded africa not as a terrain of opportunities but another aid burden for us taxpayers and chiefly one of the main contributors of illegal immigrants with the second superpower s increasing influence the administration has become aware of the relevance of africa s strategic resources in the international division of power africa is the largest continent with an estimated 750 million people and rich in natural resources whichever superpower has a coherent long term strategy that emphasises areas for partnerships will definitely tip the scale of global power in its favour post the china africa summit india is considering hosting a similar summit but engaging the private sector as opposed to china s state centric approach in 2019 russia will host its first africa russia summit as it seeks to strengthen existing partnerships and forge new alliances by offering security arms training and electioneering services in exchange for mining rights and other opportunities any country with economic military and political influence in africa will add political leverage and relevance in international affairs the anti chinese sentiments sweetened up as debt trap arise because of the political leverage that china has gained since its engagement within the continent considering these developments the trump administration s africa strategy was in a way something was forced on them to recognise africa s strategic significance after his indifference and neglect which was backed up by the shithole remarks africa will always be of strategic relevance to any global superpower not to feed into the stereotype of a theatre for the battle for influence the us needs to continue engaging with africa through the african growth and opportunity act security issues such as counter terrorism efforts and peacekeeping john stremlau visiting professor for international relations at the university of witwatersrand says that trump s africa strategy should have cast china as a regional partner not a global adversary there is nothing that the us can do about china s growing influence except to work closely with african states in ensuring that they do not fall into a debt trap to begin with the us could be vocal about ensuring chinese projects are negotiated with full transparency or seek to provide viable funding solutions to the infrastructure deficit on the continent bolton highlighted that the us had limited resources to contest with the billions of dollars china is pouring into africa sub saharan africa requires investments to build infrastructure which is necessary for their development and china is willing to give these loans according to the world bank in order to address the infrastructural deficit the sub sahara region would require 93 billion a year until 2030 mckinsey estimates that it will require 1 trillion the trump administration s africa strategy which is not about fostering the socio economic development of africa but to play cold war politics with china and russia will not be viable because it does not seek to address the shortage in the financing of infrastructure the key impediment to infrastructure investments on the continent is not the nonexistence of available financing given the abundant capital in world markets at low long term interest rates the challenge which the us could have sought to recommend in its strategy is how can african countries infrastructure projects be feasible long term investable projects l undertook a course on infrastructure financing management and regulations in 2018 and undoubtedly chinese loans are a debt trap but there is a sense of uneasiness among governments in terms of the growing demand for infrastructure in already under resourced countries for example most african countries are facing a rise in urbanisation and this puts political pressure to deliver on promises and in developing countries the government is perceived as the sole provider at very low cost subsidiser coordinator and or regulator of traditional infrastructure for example transportation systems highway systems railway systems airline systems and ports africa s infrastructure is lagging behind others in the developing world about 60 of the continent s inhabitants lack access to infrastructure which isolates communities prevent access to health care education and jobs and impedes economic growth another challenge is transcontinental infrastructure that will promote intra african trade because this infrastructure has significant spill overs which are being predicted as part of the african continental free trade agreement due to infrastructure deficit and the urgency for mega trans continental to promote regional integration and the realisation of the african free trade agreement china is willing to give away the funds of course with conditions china has the right ingredients in the form of state backed financial lending institutions construction consortiums an indifference to the internal politics of african states and loans gambled against assets with potential to expand its geopolitics strategy for example seaports and land for military purposes whereas almost all asian emerging economies are increasing their commerce and trade related influence the us has a nationalist agenda that argues that we will not fund anything which does not allow us to set up military bases to counter china and russia influence it will be recalled that in 2018 trump threatened to withdraw the us aid it contributes to the united nations peacekeeping missions furthermore he characterised it as ineffective considering that some of these african countries are governed by corrupt or ungrateful authoritarians and when john bolton says that in america s dealings we ask only for reciprocity he means that the administration will not use its taxpayers money to fund african countries that are not willing to co operate in its quest to counter and contain china

if beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property china has retaliated with tariffs of its own however beijing s export data had been

effect on u s treasuries and the s p 500 s p 500 vs two year 10 year 30 year treasury yields highlighting fiscal and monetary actions 2009 to present in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent 50 decline in the s p 500 the federal reserve took unprecedented steps to boost asset prices by lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 0 0 25 and purchasing 4 5 trillion worth of mortgage backed securities and long term u s treasuries the fed announced an end to the quantitative easing program on oct 29 2014 and raised the fed funds rate for the first time on dec 16th 2015 as investors digested the end of expansionary monetary policy and the commencement of contractionary monetary policy the ascent in the s p 500 began to flatten it wasn t until november 2016 when republicans won control of the house senate and presidency that the market began to rally again likely in anticipation of policies that would benefit corporations in the short term the fed took advantage of this to continue interest rate normalization and begin balance sheet normalization the tax cuts and jobs act which went into effect jan 1st 2018 cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and removed the disincentive for u s companies to repatriate their earnings from overseas despite these growth drivers the market began succumbing to the combination of balance sheet normalization and rate hikes in october 2018 rebounding recently as the fed signaled a possible pause heads longs lose on nov 28th 2018 in a speech at the economic club of new york fed chairman jerome powell stated that interest rates are still low by historical standards and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be normal for the economy that is neither speeding up nor slowing down growth in a press conference following the dec 19th fomc meeting and rate hike powell stated that policy no longer needs to be accommodative given the strength of the economy monetary policy has a profound effect on equity valuations federal funds rate hikes and the sale of u s treasuries by the federal reserve lower the yield on short and long term u s treasuries respectively this in turn has the effect of decreasing corporate earnings by increasing the rate at which corporations can borrow money decreasing consumer buying power by decreasing the rate at which consumers can borrow money and making the earnings stream on equities more attractive on a relative basis since u s treasuries are an alternative investment to u s equities the federal reserve has estimated that an increase in the federal funds rate from 2 00 to 3 00 as was anticipated in 2019 at the time the study was released would translate to an increase in interest payments of 37 billion in 2019 for u s non financial corporations equity prices are currently overvalued by virtually any measure except when compared with record low rates on u s treasuries despite the recent sell off the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio shows the s p at the highest level in history with the exception of the market peaks in 1929 and 2000 10 year cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio the fed laid out its concerns about this in a financial stability report released in november of 2018 an escalation in trade tensions geopolitical uncertainty or other adverse shocks could lead to a decline in investor appetite for risks in general the resulting drop in asset prices might be particularly large given that valuations appear elevated relative to historical levels in addition to generating losses for asset holders a significant fall in asset prices would make it more costly for non financial businesses to obtain funding putting pressure on a sector where leverage is already high markets and institutions that may have become accustomed to the very low interest rate environment of the post crisis period will also need to continue to adjust to monetary policy normalization by the federal reserve and other central banks even if central bank policies are fully anticipated by the public some adjustments could occur abruptly contributing to volatility in domestic and international financial markets and strains in institutions given the federal reserve s concern about asset prices relative to valuations and the shift from expansionary to contractionary monetary policy the market is unlikely to appreciate further in our view if it does as a result of the economy doing well the fed will continue to hike the fed funds rate and normalize its balance sheet which will serve as a powerful drag on economic growth equity earnings power and equity valuations tales shorts win the u s economy is long overdue for a recession we are currently in midst of the second longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history recessions are typically preceded by market corrections s p 500 90 year historical chart recessions in grey in its world economic outlook in october 2018 the imf estimated that a full blown trade war would cut the gdp of the u s by 0 9 percent and the gdp of china by 1 6 percent in 2019 even if trade tensions are resolved the imf estimates that u s gdp growth will decline due to the continued normalization of monetary policy and reduced fiscal stimulus growth is expected to soften to 2 5 percent in 2019 and to drop to 1 8 percent in 2020 a slowdown in u s economic growth is both more likely and riskier due to high levels government debt taken on to spark the economy in the last decade and high corporate debt caused by low interest rates total non financial corporate credit 1945 to present from 2010 to present non financial corporate debt grew from 6 trillion to 9 5 trillion a record 2 47 trillion of investment grade corporate debt is rated in the bbb tier this is more than triple the amount in 2008 if a slowdown in economic growth inhibits the ability of these companies to deleverage downgrades to junk status could raise interest rates and lower access to capital for companies on a mass scale the irony is that the deleveraging process itself will slow growth as companies pay down debt rather than making growth investments u s gross federal debt to gdp 1940 to present total u s public debt is over 104 of gdp as of q3 2018 the highest level since the end of world war ii in a recession government spending is typically accelerated the debt to gdp ratio makes that more challenging this time around this is a global issue since 2007 global debt has increased from 167 trillion to 247 trillion and now stands at over 320 percent of gdp the two solutions to high corporate and government debt are deleveraging or growth and inflation deleveraging runs the risk of causing a recession and a sharp market correction as global growth slows the issue with growth is that efforts to spark growth in the global economy have been through an increase in debt growth has been modest while the increase in debt has exacerbated the problem inflation will be met with increased inflation in international currencies which reduces the effectiveness of this option investor takeaway in our view the fed is likely to continue its normalization policy to some degree until and unless the fear of a sharper market correction outweighs the benefit of policy normalization if the economy continues to grow a healthy pace further actions toward interest rate and balance sheet normalization should prevent equity prices from moving higher if economic growth slows and equities decline the fed is likely to pause rate hikes and balance sheet run offs which would provide some relief for the market if economic growth declines and the market corrects significantly the fed is likely to resume quantitative easing which would be bullish for equities s p 500 20 year chart showing technical support and resistance on a technical basis the upper channel of consolidation in the ladder half of 2018 should serve as resistance to the upside given high equity valuations at this level broadly speaking investors would be well advised to sell or short equities at this level a market sell off to the period of consolidation from late 2014 to late 2016 should serve as support on the downside at this level the fed would likely reduce the pace of policy normalization at a minimum in our view investors would be well advised to buy equities at this level if the market were to break through this support level due to a particularly weak economy the highs of 2000 and 2007 should serve as much stronger support if the s p 500 reaches this level the fed would likely resume accomodative monetary policy our best guess is that we are likely to be in a traders market for the foreseeable future as governments and corporations deleverage this is in contrast to the last decade where buy and hold has been the most profitable investment strategy
the rich haven t become too immoral they ve become too rich photo fabrice coffrini afp getty images four decades ago america s rapacious capitalists and conservative moralists were singing in harmony as the former lamented liberalism s assault on free enterprise i e their own power and profitability the latter decried its corruption of the urban poor s moral rectitude in their collective telling the welfare state didn t just crowd out private investment or burden taxpayers it also fostered a culture of single motherhood idleness and instant gratification a k a a culture of poverty thus the goals of revitalizing public morality and liberating private economic power were in perfect concert slashing the safety net would facilitate tax cuts for the rich and a rediscovery of the protestant work ethic for the inner cities indigent curbing inflation would restore capital s profitability and discourage workers profligacy and as poor men returned to work and poor women lost their handouts the patriarchal family would rise from the ashes of the welfare state and social reproduction would once again be financed by women s uncompensated labor instead of the progressive income tax free market dynamism and moral traditionalism would go together like ronald reagan and pat robertson alas the invisible hand had other plans in reality the one percent s ascent coincided with the traditional family s decline deregulated markets didn t reinforce conservative moral values they sucked capital from the most conservative parts of america and concentrated it in coastal gomorrahs breaking inflation broke the labor movement and thus the single income family male wages fell women s liberation continued apace and marriage rates plummeted adding insult to injury the corporate titans of the second gilded age stopped feigning solidarity with the moral majority and started getting woke now the face of the long term underemployed has white skin and a rural zip code and the base of the republican party has grown less affluent and suburban and all of this has led some conservatives to voice a heretical thought if big government can induce moral degeneracy and cultural decline perhaps big business can do the same tucker carlson presented this idea to the fox news faithful last week and an intra right debate over his blasphemy has been raging ever since the stakes of this argument are considerable the notion that economic well being lies downstream of moral health has been indispensable to american conservatism if cultural values determine material conditions then helping the poor requires spreading the gospel if material conditions shape cultural values then helping them requires spreading the wealth around and that is one conclusion that conservative thought was born to avoid reconciling this ideological obligation with rural america s lived reality is no easy task for plutocracy s apologists after all deindustrialization wasn t a product of blue collar workers moral choices but of corporations financial ones and it is hard to argue that the disappearance of stable blue collar employment played no role in reshaping civic culture or depressing labor force participation in the places that market forces left behind but the center right s foremost moralist has found a way to square the circle in a column titled remoralizing the market david brooks defends the primacy of culture and thus the uselessness of class politics by universalizing conservatism s critique of american moral rot whatever unsightly symptoms of late capitalism can t be blamed on the cultural decline of the proletariat can be chalked up to the moral failings of the ruling class brooks s case is unpersuasive but its flaws are illuminating enough to merit examination the columnist opens by signaling his opposition to economic populists on both the left and the right who argue that american elites are using ruthless market forces to enrich themselves and immiserate everyone else brooks derides this idea as tribal emotionalism in his telling the notion that america s economic elite is using its influence over public policy to perpetuate a radically unequal distribution of wealth meaning ordinary workers must check their power through class conscious political organization is a simple narrative that separates the world into the virtuous us and the evil them the bankers in truth the answer to america s plight is neither free market fundamentalism nor economic populism it is moral renewal here s brooks s ostensibly complex and unemotional narrative of middle class decline my story begins in the 1970s the economy was sick corporations were bloated unions got greedy tax rates were too high and regulations were too tight we needed to restore economic dynamism so in 1978 jimmy carter signed a tax bill that reduced individual and corporate tax rates senator ted kennedy led the effort to deregulate the airline and trucking industries when he came into office ronald reagan took it up another notch it basically worked we ve had four long economic booms since then but there was an interesting cultural shift that happened along the way in a healthy society people try to balance a whole bunch of different priorities economic social moral familial somehow over the past 40 years economic priorities took the top spot and obliterated everything else as a matter of policy we privileged economics and then eventually no longer could even see that there could be other priorities a deadly combination of right wing free market fundamentalism and left wing moral relativism led to a withering away of moral norms and shared codes of decent conduct anything you could legally do to make money was deemed o k a billion dollar salary for a hedge fund manager perfectly acceptable the apple corporation exists because of american institutions but apple parked its intellectual property in an irish subsidiary so it could avoid paying taxes in america and support those institutions it saved 9 billion in 2012 alone this is clearly sleazy behavior apple employees should be humiliated and ashamed as we disembedded individuals from traditional moral norms we disembedded companies from social ones human beings are moral animals and suddenly american moral animals found themselves in an amoral economic system which felt increasingly alienating and gross capitalism is a wonderful system but capitalism needs to be embedded in moral norms and it needs to serve a larger social good liberal readers might find themselves nodding along with much of this indeed many of brooks s critiques of modern capitalism echo those of barack obama and elizabeth warren his message to apple is in essence you didn t build that and yet his narrative does less to spotlight the one percent s predation than to obscure the forces that enable it and thus to undermine opposition to it like virtually all conservative appeals to cultural determinism brooks s argument mystifies the causes of our economic problems then locates their solutions outside the political sphere in his account the reagan revolution was commendable in policy terms breaking the unions slashing the safety net deregulating corporations and redistributing income upward worked our problems can t be attributed to the concrete economic changes these policies wrought only to the cultural shifts that somehow accompanied them therefore the answer isn t to curb capital s power but to reject moral relativism the government shouldn t prevent hedge fund managers from making billion dollar salaries by enacting confiscatory top tax rates civil society should discourage such behavior by shaming and humiliating those who engage in it we don t need to embed capitalism within democratic worker controlled institutions but merely within moral norms it is unclear how one is supposed to go about doing this other than by say disseminating david brooks s columns at davos regardless the main problem with brooks s argument isn t that it proposes no straightforward course of action it s that his premises are patently false put simply our corporate elites haven t become too amoral they ve become too powerful the gilded age is not remembered as a time of left wing moral relativism if anything america s moral culture was even less permissive in that era than it was during the postwar period of corporate responsibility that brooks champions and yet the hegemony of traditional christian values did not compel gilded age corporations to put social responsibility above profit maximization on the contrary the barons of industry sent appalachian children into the coal mines until the dust consumed their lungs paid industrial workers sub subsistence wages and then met their strikes with gunfire used their power over the state to preserve a deflationary monetary policy that turned small farmers into ruined debtors and claimed a share of economic growth so disproportionate ordinary americans average height and life expectancy declined during the closing decades of the late 19th century even as the country attained unprecedented prosperity changes in moral norms cannot explain the comparative benevolence of new deal era elites but changes in the balance of power between labor and capital can the great depression wiped out a

expand their membership robust antitrust laws limited the scope of corporate consolidation the bretton woods system constrained capital mobility and confiscatory top tax rates disincentivized the contemporary equivalent of billion dollar salaries meanwhile the emergence of a second great power with a competing putatively egalitarian economic model served as an external deterrent to the one percent s rapacity in other words mid century american corporations didn t funnel a smaller share of their profits to top executives shareholders and overseas tax havens because they were morally superior they did so because they were politically and economically weaker they did not choose to devote a higher proportion of their earnings to labor compensation their workers had the unions and political clout necessary to demand as much these material conditions may have fostered a more communitarian corporate ideology and elite self conception if so such moral norms proved highly

federal reserve chairman paul volcker put it in 1979 the standard of living of the average american has to decline reducing price growth required reducing demand which required reducing working class wages to achieve the latter volcker engineered a recession by raising interest rates to unprecedented heights this policy had its intended effects along with a variety of others the exorbitant price of credit in the early 1980s didn t just drive up unemployment and thus drive down workers bargaining power it also gave large corporations an immense competitive advantage over less creditworthy

china s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in december while imports also contracted pointing to further weakness in the world s second largest economy in 2019 and deteriorating global demand adding to policymakers worries data on monday also showed china posted its biggest trade surplus with the united states on record in 2018 which could prompt president donald trump to turn up the heat on beijing in their bitter trade dispute softening demand in china is being felt around the world with slowing sales of goods from iphones to automobiles prompting warnings from the likes of apple and from jaguar land rover which last week announced sweeping job cuts the dismal december trade readings suggest china s economy may have cooled faster than expected late in the year despite a slew of growth boosting measures in recent months ranging from higher infrastructure spending to tax cuts some analysts had already speculated that beijing may have to speed up and intensify its policy easing and stimulus measures this year after factory activity shrank in december china s december exports unexpectedly fell 4 4 percent from a year earlier with demand in most of its major markets weakening imports also saw a shock drop falling 7 6 percent in their biggest decline since july 2016 analysts had expected export growth to slow to 3 percent with imports up 5 percent today s data reflect an end to export front loading and the start of payback effects while the global slowdown could also weigh on china s exports nomura economists wrote in a note referring to a surge in shipments to the u s over much of last year as companies rushed to beat further tariffs the export growth print also suggests that the recent strength of the yuan might be short lived beijing will perhaps be more eager to strike a trade deal with the u s and that policymakers will need to take more aggressive measures to stabilise gdp growth net exports had already been a drag on china s economic growth in the first three quarters of last year after giving it a boost in 2017 asian shares and u s stock market futures fell as the surprisingly weak chinese data added to fears of weaker corporate profits and investment while the yuan currency gave up some of its early gains higher trade surplus with u s china s politically sensitive surplus with the u s widened by 17 2 percent to 323 32 billion last year the highest on record going back to 2006 according to reuters calculations based on customs data china s large trade surplus with the united states has long been a sore point with washington which has demanded beijing take steps to sharply reduce it washington imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese goods last year and has threatened further action if beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property china has retaliated with tariffs of its own however beijing s export data had been surprisingly resilient to tariffs for much of 2018 possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer u s duties went into effect as many market watchers predicted that boost has faded in the last few months china exports to the u s declined 3 5 percent in december while its imports from the u s were down 35 8 percent for the month china s total global exports rose 9 9 percent in 2018 its strongest performance in seven years while imports increased 15 8 percent but december s gloomy data along with several months of falling factory orders suggest a further weakening in its exports in the near term a trade recession is likely in our view raymond yeung chief economist at anz said in a note predicting a period of export contraction similar to 2015 16 the global electronics cycle remains the key driver of chinese exports a potential downturn in the sector poses the real risk to china s external outlook even if china and the u s reach a resolution on their trade dispute ing said a fall in electronic shipments could be related to foreign companies avoiding using china made electronic components adding that exports and imports of electronic parts and goods will likely shrink this year weak imports highlight softening demand the higher tariffs china levied on u s supplies also hit overall import growth for all of 2018 soybeans the second largest imports from the u s fell for the first time since 2011 even if washington and beijing reach a trade deal in their current round of talks it would be no panacea for china s slowing economy analysts say the import slowdown is consistent with other signs that growth in china s domestic economy continued to weaken said louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics overall economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter and remains under pressure from weaker exports slow credit growth and cooling real estate activity chinese policymakers are widely expected to roll out more support measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate early this month the central bank said it would slash banks reserve requirements the fifth such cut in a year as it tries to encourage more lending and reduce the risk of a sharp slowdown if pressure on the economy is still relatively large in the first half a cut every quarter should be highly likely said xu gao chief economist at everbright securities in an annual meeting of top leaders last month china said it will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments a few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility but most expect beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan sources told reuters last week that beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year after an expected 6 6 percent in 2018 the slowest pace in 28 years

there s no end in sight the damage may need to get significantly worse to break the stalemate economists disagree on what the shutdown has done to broader economic growth so far the rough standard is that every week or two the government is shuttered trims a tenth of a percent from gdp growth but the knock on effects when government contractors or others who rely on federal workers as customers

when it comes to international trade the words of chinese philosopher sun tzu seem more apt today than ever in the midst of chaos there is also opportunity for middle market companies these are chaotic times indeed a great deal is in flux the north american free trade agreement is being recast the united states has placed tariffs on steel and aluminum sparking retaliation and trade tensions with everyone from china to the european union in addition the election of leftist populist andrés manuel lópez obrador as mexico s next president looks certain to shake up regional political dynamics besides political uncertainty and foreign exchange risk middle market executives are increasingly anxious about the domestic economic outlook especially with perennial questions on when the nine year economic expansion will have run its course reviewing the lessons of history seems unlikely to help predict the future at such times sun tzu s the art of war advises us to learn more about our opponent and to become more self reflective too with that in mind executives should take a hard look at their business to fortify themselves in this uncertain environment here are five things i recommend doing 1 turn down business yes that s right not all business is worth keeping or taking especially in a turbulent market using overtime or adding capacity when certain lines aren t profitable is actually adding to your risk profile as the market softens salespeople get worried about backlog and book sales for sales sake but at what cost get granular with your product pricing and look at profitability and cash flow from customers including their average payment terms discounts taken and overhead coverage rate one off customers even long term customers may be costing you more than you are aware have the courage to say no to the business that isn t adding significantly to your results this shows your customers you are serious and may make them willing to make their orders more attractive plus it shows your internal team how serious you are about monitoring costs and profitability in times of uncertainty 2 review your supply chain executives should re examine their supply chain against the latest harmonized tariff codes to understand the potential impact on their business for example under new aluminum tariffs companies can no longer claw back tariffs paid once finished goods are exported such changes can have a dramatic impact on a business companies impacted by tariffs can appeal for an exemption if they cannot source their raw materials elsewhere however that process is a gamble that can be tortuously slow possibly hurting cash flows for a year or longer and such efforts may ultimately fail of roughly 49 000 appeals filed to date since steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect in march about 16 500 have been processed and about 12 000 have been approved sad to say but some executives might conclude that moving some production overseas is the most sustainable solution 3 bolster borrowing capacity the time to apply for financing is when times are good and you don t desperately need the money with interest rates still low but the u s federal reserve gradually raising rates there is an extra urgency to boost borrowing capacity now nevertheless bankers tell me that few businesses are applying to increase their borrowing capacity something they should do now rather than waiting for a possible recession or business slowdown having improved borrowing capacity can be the difference between surviving a recession and going under for example that extra resource can provide the needed extra cash flow should customers start demanding a 60 day window to pay invoices rather than 45 days 4 review foreign currency exposure it s a common fallacy that u s firms don t have fx risk because they only buy and sell in contracts denominated in u s dollars that does not eliminate fx risk in the firm s supply chain where even if contracts are dollar denominated their value can rise and fall with the movement in an fx pairing significantly impacting cash flows lately for example the dollar has weakened against the euro but strengthened against china s yuan only by assessing fx risk can a company develop a plan to hedge against currency fluctuations 5 build relationships this is a time for building relationships with state and local economic development offices and becoming active with trade organizations including chambers of commerce beyond lobbying the government for change and letting elected officials understand the real world impact of trade policy it can help open up new markets for example u s export assistance centers are located in more than 100 cities offering help with exporting issues similarly district export councils can help companies develop export strategies for new markets and can offer new contacts and advice with so much evolving when it comes to trade executives cannot afford to be complacent but should plan now for whatever the future might hold taking the five steps above will leave any business better positioned to weather possible trouble ahead lou longo is

news national by staff reporter get latest news by email subscribe powered by motorists economists opposition parties and the commuting public yesterday reacted angrily to president emmerson mnangagwa s move to hike fuel prices by 150 which triggered a wave of price increases on almost all commodities and services further plunging the populace into poverty there was chaos in most towns and cities around the country as commuters woke up to astronomically high fares following the price increases announced by mnangagwa on saturday night the increases saw the price of diesel jumping from 1 26 to 3 11 a litre while petrol now sells at 3 31 up from 1 34 per litre renowned economist john robertson said although the fuel price increase made economic sense it would bring about some undesired consequences such as increasing the cost of living and pushing up inflation by between 40 and 50 there will be steep increases in other costs increasing prices of fuel was the right thing to do we had a wrong exchange rate fuel was too cheap and people from other countries were refuelling in zimbabwe robertson said this was necessary unfortunately it has side effects this will trigger wage demands inflation 40 and 50 before long the companies are not making money already and they will close down this will lead to serious job losses he said government s 1 1 exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local surrogate currency the bond note was unrealistic they want to run the exchange rate as a privilege to other people this is fuelling corruption he said another economist emmanuel mugadza said the increase was a subtle admission by mnangagwa that the local currency had failed to match the us although the zanu pf leader cannot openly say so this is a step in the right direction but painful because the rising costs are not corresponding with income the fuel hike will trigger price increases and ordinary zimbabweans will suffer he said mugadza said zimbabwe needed a long term solution to the fuel crisis challenging mnangagwa to move fast in ensuring the country revamps its exports to generate more foreign currency for the economy to be stable confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe said the hike in fuel prices was a long overdue move that would however be painful after three years and not a price increase with the distortions in the market it was more necessary but will be painful jabangwe said things could have become worse without the increase right now we will enter into discussions or we can go into other costs

the world is in trouble and china will get sucked in as a bellwether for global trade conditions yet beijing s policy response so far has been to tinker at the margin ending up behind the curve and possibly compromising the country s recovery hopes for years conventional wisdom says china s growth rate for 2019 should only experience a marginal slowdown from 6 5 per cent last year but this grossly underestimates the scale of the problem we are all getting sucked into complacency beijing included negative forces are building and china could hit a brick wall very soon with economic expansion collapsing sinking to as low as 2 per cent in the worst case scenario a hard landing on such a scale would be unprecedented catastrophic and a game changer for beijing a positive result for china s growth this year would be 5 6 per cent but current trends suggest the economy will be lucky to come close to that the trade war with the us is taking its toll consumer confidence and business optimism both look precarious casting a dark shadow over china s domestic demand the external sector is no better off given the sudden downturn in global economic confidence and the damage being wrought on world trade flows source new view economics the worry about china banking on a bigger boost from overseas markets is that its major trade partners are slowing down and some very markedly the omens are poor japan s economy has slumped again while us economic prospects are being dulled by the deepening political impasse in washington and federal reserve tightening germany s economy shrank in the third quarter and could easily flip back into recession again dragging the rest of europe with it the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by the european central bank is not helping matters either a global crash is more than a remote possibility the concern for global markets is that a hard landing in china could be the greatest threat to global recovery investors believe robust growth in china is a talisman for better times ahead in the rest of the world but if china is heading into the doldrums then there is good reason to panic the world is getting into a self feeding negative feedback loop which must be broken very soon in this new age of economic isolationism and the absence of any meaningful multilateral initiatives self help seems to the only way to go the group of seven the g20 and all the other bastions of global policy co ordination are effectively dead in the water china knows it has to go it alone with blockbuster macroeconomic policies necessary to turn the tide domestically regionally and globally leaving micromanagement aside china needs a huge stimulus programme to stave off a deeper meltdown beijing must stop strangling growth with restrictive monetary and fiscal policies interest rates must be cut again money supply expanded dramatically and deficit spending ramped up china needs radical action in exceptional times it must stop the rot soon or 2 per cent growth could become a nightmarish reality this year david brown is chief executive of new view economics this article appeared in the south china morning post print edition as for china nightmarish 2pc growth is a possibility this year
finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube must address existing loopholes if his plans to introduce a local currency within the next 12 months are to succeed economic observers have said they said prof ncube faced a mammoth task to lay the fundamentals for the successful launch of a local currency within a short period prof ncube last friday indicated zimbabwe would introduce its own currency in the coming months addressing delegates at the road to davos townhall meeting in harare minister ncube said government was raising foreign currency to introduce the new currency he ruled out adoption of either the united states dollar or the south african rand which he said would not solve the country s macro economic challenges economic analyst mr persistence gwanyanya said introducing a local currency was good for the economy the current dollarised scenario where we are having to import foreign currency for local use is unsustainable as current forex generation is not enough to meet the country s import demands hence increased reliance on commercial facilities such as the one from afreximbank which is believed to cost around seven percent per annum said mr gwanyanya suffice to mention that reliance on such commercial facilities is unsustainable he said he said launching a local currency would see the reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz assuming its traditional monetary functions if we introduce our own currency the rbz has to go back to its traditional function of inflation management and leave foreign currency allocation to the market which is more efficient and the only intervention will be tolerated in areas where the market is failing mr gwanyanya said the current exchange system was not delivering results it is common cause that the current exchange rate management system where bond notes rtgs usd are at par is no longer delivering expected results as the bond notes and rtgs continue to depreciate on the parallel market on account of excessive money supply he said it is clear for everyone to see that due to the depreciation in local currency the country has largely de dollarised and there is a high risk of re dollarisation which this country cannot afford so the way to go is to introduce our own currency and have the market allocate forex rbz should concentrate on inflation control through managing money supply growth mr gwanyanya warned of inflation risk if government failed to arrest its expenditure however there is still a high risk of inflation if government fails to adjust its expenditure which is largely responsible for money supply growth he said economist and zimbabwe national chamber of commerce chief executive officer mr takunda mugaga said introduction of a new currency needed to be well thought out my greatest fear lies in professor mthuli announcing a wrong flight plan to bring back our currency calls for macroeconomic convergence which manifests itself in a narrow fiscal gap a narrow trade deficit as well as improving market confidence indicators so far are not promising for zimbabwe to have its own currency now said mr mugaga we need to resolve the external debt issue land tenure issue domestic debt as well as re engaging the international community due to perceived high risk in the country university of zimbabwe economics department chairperson professor albert makochekanwa said a lot needed to be done in preparation for the new currency the baseline is that every country would want its own currency but in the case of zimbabwe most people have no confidence in the banking sector he said the introduction of a local currency needs serious production and we are not producing enough let us address fundamentals first and gain confidence in our banking sector the zanu pf youth league supported the introduction of own currency saying authorities were doing everything to ensure it was a success addressing a press conference at the zanu pf headquarters in harare yesterday deputy secretary for youth affairs cde lewis matutu said we are very happy about the announcement that was made by finance and economic development minister professor mthuli ncube that very soon we will be having our own currency it is something that is welcomed and everyone should work towards supporting this vision the government said in the next 12 months and as youth league we feel it is something that should be supported we cannot just wake up tomorrow and have our own currency but we know that the leadership is planning something to make sure there is a smooth landing of the currency as we go forward allafrica

it may be hard to remember but americans once appreciated the government that serves them that s long gone over the last six years according to the pew research center four out of every five or more have said the government makes them feel either angry or frustrated last march the ranks of the incensed included 78 percent of bernie sanders s supporters and a whopping 98 percent of those backing donald j trump more than half of voters including 61 percent of mr trump s supporters feel they are not keeping up with the rising cost of living three quarters of mr trump s supporters feel that life for people like them is worse than it was 50 years ago some of this is caused by irreversible forces the days when white men kept an uncontested hold on political power when young adults without a college degree could easily find a well paid job are not coming back
for most voters the idea of more government borrowing and spending is about as popular as the zika virus and while hillary clinton and donald trump agree on almost nothing mainstream democrats and republicans alike often talk about the national debt the way prohibitionists once discussed booze but among economists the outlook is changing and with interest rates near historical lows and growth stuck in a rut even as the recovery from the great recession moves into its eighth year this summer even some veterans of washington s budget wars are challenging the reigning fiscal orthodoxy that perceives the perennial budget gap as something inherently sinful the views of economists about the deficit are shifting said douglas w elmendorf director of the congressional budget office from 2009 to 2015 and now dean of the kennedy school at harvard if the very low level of interest rates persists for years to come as many experts and analysts think is likely that s a sea change for budget policy more borrowing might actually be healthy many economists say at least in the short term by helping to elevate the economy s long depressed growth trajectory

motorists economists opposition parties and the commuting public yesterday reacted angrily to president emmerson mnangagwa s move to hike fuel prices by 150 which triggered a wave of price increases on almost all commodities and services further plunging the populace into poverty source mayhem over fuel price hikes newsday zimbabwe january 14 2019 by everson mushava stephen chadenga nhau mangirazi brenna matendere there was chaos in most towns and cities around the country as commuters woke up to astronomically high fares following the price increases announced by mnangagwa on saturday night the increases saw the price of diesel jumping from 1 26 to 3 11 a litre while petrol now sells at 3 31 up from 1 34 per litre renowned economist john robertson said although the fuel price increase made economic sense it would bring about some undesired consequences such as increasing the cost of living and pushing up inflation by between 40 and 50 there will be steep increases in other costs increasing prices of fuel was the right thing to do we had a wrong exchange rate fuel was too cheap and people from other countries were refuelling in zimbabwe robertson said this was necessary unfortunately it has side effects this will trigger wage demands inflation 40 and 50 before long the companies are not making money already and they will close down this will lead to serious job losses he said government s 1 1 exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local surrogate currency the bond note was unrealistic they want to run the exchange rate as a privilege to other people this is fuelling corruption he said another economist emmanuel mugadza said the increase was a subtle admission by mnangagwa that the local currency had failed to match the us although the zanu pf leader cannot openly say so this is a step in the right direction but painful because the rising costs are not corresponding with income the fuel hike will trigger price increases and ordinary zimbabweans will suffer he said mugadza said zimbabwe needed a long term solution to the fuel crisis challenging mnangagwa to move fast in ensuring the country revamps its exports to generate more foreign currency for the economy to be stable confederation of zimbabwe industries czi president sifelani jabangwe said the hike in fuel prices was a long overdue move that would however be painful after three years and not a price increase with the distortions in the market it was more necessary but will be painful jabangwe said things could have become worse without the increase right now we will enter into discussions or we can go into other costs including compensation of labour most motorists who spoke to newsday expressed dismay that the prices would push up other costs i have been in the queue since thursday and was hoping to get fuel today only to be told the prices have increased that is insensitive i now need about 200 to fill up my tank when in the past i needed 80 one angry motorist who refused to be named said the percentage increase is just too high we cannot afford it another motorist who only identified himself as patrick said they hiked the prices and yet there is no fuel i think they created a worse situation to justify increasing the prices as if the new 2 tax they levied us is not enough most commuters said they would not be able to report to work in the wake of new fares today they said it was mid month and it was tough to adjust their budgets civil servants who are negotiating for salary increases have threatened to down tools claiming they were now incapacitated to go to work they have rejected a 10 salary hike offer by government we won t manage the new fares some will go to work on foot or even sleep at work and go home on fridays for the weekend the situation is tough cecilia who works as a shop attendant in the capital s central business district said the nelson chamisa led mdc said mnangagwa s fuel price hike was shocking and misguided that the fuel increase will only trigger a wave of price hikes on each and every other item on the shelves is as obvious as the incapacity of zanu pf to govern and lead a prosperous zimbabwe the opposition party spokesperson jacob mafume said instead of accepting its gross failure to turn the economy around the cartel now basks in the pretence of mega deals in curious corners of the forgotten world such as uzbekistan khazakistan and other places you may never have heard of the zimbabwean commuter will starting sunday yesterday fill the pinch of this administration s hopelessness while mnangagwa and his scarfed henchmen will be comfortably flying swiss jets mnangagwa was expected to leave last night on an official visit to five asian and european countries obert gutu deputy president of the thokozani khupe led mdc t said the increase in the prices of fuel would have a ripple effect across all facets of the economy people will have to fork out more money for transport as it is inevitable that kombi and bus fares will rise at least threefold gutu said wages and salaries for the few people who are still lucky enough to be in formal employment are still very low compared to the skyrocketing prices of basic goods and services such that there is a complete and total disconnect between people s earnings and their expenditure added gutu the hike in the price of fuel will trigger a highly inflationary impact on the prices of basic foodstuffs such as bread mealie meal and cooking oil since producers and traders will be paying more for their fuel requirements the national economy is in a total mess and now is the time for all concerned zimbabwean patriots to put our heads together and chart a united way forward as we seek to navigate the treacherous socio economic terrain it cannot continue to be business as usual going forward in karoi yesterday farmers who battled for too long to secure fuel suffered double trouble following fuel price hikes service stations say they do not have fuel besides the hike announced by president this is unbelievable for us as rains are now upon us but fuel remains a big challenge a farmer dennis maramba said as it stands the cash crisis hampered our operations and this hike will affect our projections as we are getting out of budget due to government s lack of better planning in gweru there was chaos at the long distance bus terminus kudzanayi yesterday morning after travellers en route to mutare from kwekwe were introduced to new fares before arriving at their destination the travellers who were boarding a local bus had initially been charged 20 on departure from mbizo shopping centre in kwekwe at around 4am however upon arrival in gweru the bus operator raised the fare to 45 after receiving information of the fuel price hikes hordes of commuters in the midlands capital yesterday walked to the city as they woke up to increased fares as a result of a hike in fuel prices the zimbabwe congress of trade unions the mdc as well as teachers have threatened mass protests today over the hikes and the deteriorating economic situation in the country civic group tajamuka sesijikile s spokesperson promise mkwananzi said they would mobilise motorists on fuel queues for a mass action against mnangagwa s administration we will deploy in all places fuel and bank queues to mobilise people for action against mnangagwa we will roll out the programme tomorrow today he said
after rising for nine years in a so so economy in the belief that prosperity was just around the corner stocks swooned even as growth picked up that left many investors wondering whether the economy is turning another corner into a place where danger maybe even a recession and a prolonged bear market lurk the s p 500 dropped 13 5 percent during the fourth quarter including dividends giving the index a 4 4 percent loss for the year by that measure it was the worst performance since 2008 despite strong corporate earnings and the best readings in several decades in unemployment and consumer confidence as 2019 unfolds and the economic picture becomes clearer it is possible that stocks will have a sustained orderly recovery investment advisers say but achieving that clarity will take time so they encourage investors to demand a lot of evidence that a recession will be avoided before they commit money to stocks or other risky assets a lot of the derating that happened in the second half of 2018 started off being driven by political risk but in the last few weeks it has been driven by concerns about growth and stability said kate moore chief equity strategist at blackrock referring to the decline in stocks i think that s going to go on in the first few weeks of 2019 everyone s focused on economic data moore highlighted surveys showing weaker than expected business conditions and added it s going to take time for that to work itself through the market i would expect more volatility as we take in new data points just how weak those data points are likely to be is hard to predict the underlying fundamentals of the economy certainly have deteriorated said edward yardeni president of yardeni research he noted that the five monthly regional business surveys conducted by federal reserve districts were all extremely weak in december but the latest employment report was not it showed 312 000 net jobs created last month we have a very mixed economic picture right now yardeni said it all adds up to an economy that s slowing but probably still growing if that s true then 2019 may not be so bad for the market stocks are very cheap with one important qualification he said you have to believe the economy is not going to wind up in recession he then offered another qualification about forthcoming corporate earnings reports we still have to curb our enthusiasm because we can t get too excited about the earnings outlook the tax cuts that took effect in 2018 sent earnings up so much for the year the latest estimate for the s p 500 was 20 2 percent according to factset research that a 5 percent rise in earnings in 2019 aided by corporate buybacks is about as much as wall street can expect yardeni said factset s latest forecast is for a 7 3 percent increase despite some good days for the market in january that may have been prompted by signs of flexibility from the federal reserve the way stocks tumbled late in the year hardly inspires confidence with anything like a repeat performance investors will have to hope that other assets provide better protection than in 2018 when there were few places to hide cash was the only major asset class that posted positive returns in 18 according to a bank of america report even the reed thin 1 9 percent return on cash in money market funds was less than the 2 2 percent consumer inflation rate the report said but at least it was a positive number long term government bonds corporate bonds and gold all lost ground although they beat the return of the s p 500 oil and foreign stocks were among the investments that did worse the average domestic stock fund lost 14 2 percent in the fourth quarter with specialists in natural resources technology and financial services leading the way down these funds dropped 6 8 percent during the year according to morningstar international stock funds outperformed during the quarter losing 10 9 percent but trailed badly for the full year down 13 2 percent bond funds lost 0 9 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 2018 high yield portfolios were particularly weak off 4 6 percent for the quarter and 2 8 percent for the year such across the board weakness is rare because what tends to be bad for one asset tends to be good for some other asset somewhere said ben inker head of asset allocation for the investment firm gmo the basic exception is when there is a combination of rising rates and slowing growth risky assets don t like slowing growth and fixed income doesn t like rising rates inker like many is worried that the fed could push a fragile economy into recession that would be fairly ugly for valuations of american stocks he said and he would avoid them even if he were confident that a recession could be skirted he prefers stocks and bonds in emerging markets which are much cheaper than their counterparts in mature economies we re reasonably bullish on our ability to make money in 2019 just not in the assets most people have most of their money in he said one reason for the poor returns on stocks especially in december is that the fed initially had not seemed to share the fear felt on wall street when the fed raised its target for short term interest rates last month the move was almost universally anticipated but the statement about economic conditions and monetary policy made after the increase was not as dovish as the market was hoping for said steve kane a bond fund manager at tcw recent data signals an economic slowdown and not just in the united states kane said surveys confirm a significant drop in manufacturing activity there are also signals that growth in china is slowing dramatically and significantly he said the flattening yield curve with short term interest rates approaching long term rates is consistent with an economy that is running out of steam and a source of concern in itself but recent remarks by jerome powell the federal reserve chairman that the central bank will have patience in deciding whether to raise rates appeared to cheer the markets if rates are priced for a slowdown some corporate bonds are not kane said at least not yet spreads in yields between corporate and government debt have widened taking bond prices down medium term investment grade corporate issues yielded 1 76 percentage points more than equivalent treasury paper as of tuesday according to the federal reserve bank of st louis and an index of high yield debt yielded 4 65 points more a 2 point cushion is roughly where investment grade spreads tend to peak during a slowdown but high yield spreads typically soar to 10 points one should look at the fixed income market as being more attractive to invest in 2019 than 2018 but one must still invest with some degree of caution especially in the high yield market he said there will be better opportunities later in the year in high yield while there is not too much downside to investment grade credit at this point he called it a fairly good asset class if we re in the midst of a bear market in equities stocks that moore at blackrock thinks would do comparatively well against such a backdrop are of companies that are financially strong and able to grow even when economic growth is modest at best health care is her top sector because it has those defensive qualities as well as pockets of innovation such as in medical technology that support high profit margins she said she is not throwing in the towel on tech in general despite plunging share prices in big names like apple and facebook and she said she particularly likes asian tech companies moore also is modestly encouraged about emerging markets in latin america and asia most notably brazil and india brian singer head of dynamic allocation strategies at william blair co has been investing with a greater emphasis on risk management he said he finds american stocks fundamentally less attractive than others such as emerging markets including the two that moore mentioned among mature economies singer likes britain although he would rather wait until the question of its departure from the european union brexit is settled before stepping in and spain markets he is shunning aside from the united states are japan canada mexico and south africa as for bonds he is avoiding the high yield market and he talked up the virtues of another asset class that is often overlooked in this environment cash will be a relatively good alternative he said it won t be a great return generator but being cautious and holding cash is not a bad idea it really is a time to remain defensive and have dry powder on hand with so much up in the air yardeni recommends not getting carried away investors should be selective about stocks and avoid index tracking exchange traded funds this is probably a year for stock pickers he said it s not a year for etfs he would emphasize domestic stocks and limit exposure to emerging markets which may suffer from soft commodity prices and to europe which is dealing with thorny issues like brexit and italy s recalcitrance in reining in government spending the aging population bodes ill for long term growth in europe too yardeni said something that also applies in china he favors industries like technology communications and media which he expects to benefit over the long haul from the impending introduction of 5g the fifth generation of mobile communications technology big banks and health care companies should do well too he said with investors focused on what s going wrong kane recommends that they also keep in mind what s going right in particular the strong job market although he noted that employment is often the last indicator to deteriorate as the economic cycle turns if that part of the economy holds up then this may not be a recession he said you could get a very nice return for stocks if that turns out to be the environment but he acknowledged that it s a big if a crucial question for him is whether the decline will be fairly mild by the time it is over or something more severe as in the 2008 financial crisis for all the talk of recession the losses so far have appeared calm and orderly suggesting to him that too few investors have been asking the same question whether it s a garden variety or end of days bear market he said there s going to be panic and we haven t gotten quite there yet

this however didn t help china make up for the loss of exports to other parts of the world last month even though as whole chinese exports increased 9 9 percent in 2018 the highest in seven years but some experts are hardly optimistic about china s trade prospects unless beijing is able to reach an agreement with the us they suggest the december data could exemplify the upcoming near term developments in chinese trade due to various factors a trade recession is likely in our view raymond yeung of the australian and new zealand bank anz said the global electronics cycle remains the key driver of chinese exports a potential downturn in the sector poses the real risk to china s external outlook even if china and the us reach a resolution on their trade dispute for its part the chinese government could take additional steps to relax monetary policies and support domestic lending by further lowering central bank interest rates and commercial bank reserve requirement ratios if pressure on the economy is still relatively large in the first half a cut every quarter should be highly likely xu gao of everbright securities said others say beijing could increase budget spending and investment in domestic consumer oriented industries in order to stave off the possible negative effects of global headwinds to the national economy the import slowdown is consistent with other signs that growth in china s domestic economy continued to weaken louis kuijs of oxford economics said overall economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter and remains under pressure from weaker exports slow credit growth and cooling real estate activity

2019 world economy is reaching growth limits expect low oil prices financial turbulence financial markets have been behaving in a very turbulent manner in the last couple of months the issue as i see it is that the world economy is gradually changing from a growth mode to a mode of shrinkage this is something like a ship changing course from going in one direction to going in reverse the system acts as if the brakes are being very forcefully applied and reaction of the economy is to almost shake what seems to be happening is that the world economy is reaching limits to growth as predicted in the computer simulations modeled in the 1972 book the limits to growth in fact the base model of that set of simulations indicated that peak industrial output per capita might be reached right about now peak food per capita might be reached about the same time i have added a dotted line to the forecast from this model indicating where the economy seems to be in 2019 relative to the base model 1 the economy is a self organizing structure that operates under the laws of physics many people have thought that when the world economy reaches limits the limits would be of the form of high prices and running out of oil this represents an overly simple understanding of how the system works what we should really expect and in fact what we are now beginning to see is production cuts in finished goods made by the industrial system such as cell phones and automobiles because of affordability issues indirectly these affordability issues lead to low commodity prices and low profitability for commodity producers for example the sale of chinese private passenger vehicles for the year of 2018 through november is down by 2 8 with november sales off by 16 1 most analysts are forecasting this trend of contracting sales to continue into 2019 lower sales seem to reflect affordability issues saudi arabia plans to cut oil production by 800 000 barrels per day from the november 2018 level to try to raise oil prices profits are too low at current prices coal is reported not to have an economic future in australia partly because of competition from subsidized renewables and partly because china and india want to prop up the prices of coal from their own coal mines the significance of trump s tariffs if a person looks at history it becomes clear that tariffs are a standard response to a problem of shrinking food or industrial output per capita tariffs were put in place in the 1920s in the time leading up to the great depression and were investigated after the panic of 1857 which seems to have indirectly led to the us civil war whenever an economy produces less industrial or food output per capita there is an allocation problem who gets cut off from buying output similar to the amount that they previously purchased tariffs are a standard way that a relatively strong economy tries to gain an advantage over weaker economies tariffs are intended to help the citizens of the strong economy maintain their previous quantity of goods and services even as other economies are forced to get along with less i see trump s trade policies primarily as evidence of an underlying problem namely the falling affordability of goods and services for a major segment of the population thus trump s tariffs are one of the pieces of evidence that lead me to believe that the world economy is reaching limits to growth the nature of world economic growth economic growth seems to require growth in three dimensions a complexity b debt bubble and c use of resources today the world economy seems to be reaching limits in all three of these dimensions figure 2 complexity involves adding more technology more international trade and more specialization its downside is that it indirectly tends to reduce affordability of finished end products because of growing wage disparity many non elite workers have wages that are too low to afford very much of the output of the economy as more complexity is added wage disparity tends to increase international wage competition makes the situation worse a growing debt bubble can help keep commodity prices up because a rising amount of debt can indirectly provide more demand for goods and services for example if there is growing debt it can be used to buy homes cars and vacation travel all of which require oil and other energy consumption if debt levels become too high or if regulators decide to raise short term interest rates as a method of slowing the economy the debt bubble is in danger of collapsing a collapsing debt bubble tends to lead to recession and falling commodity prices commodity prices fell dramatically in the second half of 2008 prices now seem to be headed downward again starting in october 2018 even the relatively slow recent rise in short term interest rates figure 4 seems to be producing a decrease in oil prices figure 3 in a way that a person might expect from a debt bubble collapse the sale of us quantitative easing assets at the same time that interest rates have been rising no doubt adds to the problem of falling oil prices and volatile stock markets the gray bars in figure 4 indicate recessions growing use of resources becomes increasingly problematic for two reasons one is population growth as population rises the economy needs more food to feed the growing population this leads to the need for more complexity irrigation better seed fertilizer world trade to feed the growing world population the other problem with growing use of resources is diminishing returns leading to the rising cost of extracting commodities over time diminishing returns occur because producers tend to extract the cheapest to extract commodities first leaving in place the commodities requiring deeper wells or more processing even water has this difficulty at times desalination at very high cost is needed to obtain sufficient fresh water for a growing population why inadequate energy supplies lead to low oil prices rather than high in the last section i discussed the cost of producing commodities of many kinds rising because of diminishing returns higher costs should lead to higher prices shouldn t they strangely enough higher costs translate to higher prices only sometimes when energy consumption per capita is rising rapidly peaks of red areas on figure 5 rising costs do seem to translate to rising prices spiking oil prices were experienced several times 1917 to 1920 1974 to 1982 2004 to mid 2008 and 2011 to 2014 all of these high oil prices occurred toward the end of the red peaks on figure 5 in fact these high oil prices as well as other high commodity prices that tend to rise at the same time as oil prices are likely what brought growth in energy consumption down the prices of goods and services made with these commodities became unaffordable for lower wage workers indirectly decreasing the growth rate in energy products consumed the red peaks represented periods of very rapid growth fed by growing supplies of very cheap energy coal and hydroelectricity in the electrification and early mechanizationperiod oil in the postwar boom and coal in the china period with low energy prices many countries were able to expand their economies simultaneously keeping demand high the postwar boom also reflected the addition of many women to the labor force increasing the ability of families to afford second cars and nicer homes rapidly growing energy consumption allowed per capita output of both food with meat protein given a higher count than carbohydrates and industrial products to grow rapidly during these peaks the reason that output of these products could grow is because the laws of physics require energy consumption for heat transportation refrigeration and other processes required by industrialization and farming in these boom periods higher energy costs were easy to pass on eventually the higher energy costs caught up with the economy and pushed growth in energy consumption per capita down putting an end to the peaks figure 6 shows figure 5 with the valleys labeled instead of the peaks when i say that the world economy is reaching peak industrial output per capita and peak food per capita this represents the opposite of a rapidly growing economy in fact if the world is reaching limits to growth the situation is even worse than all of the labeled valleys on figure 6 in such a case energy consumption growth is likely to shrink so low that even the blue area population growth turns negative in such a situation the big problem is not enough to go around while cost increases due to diminishing returns could easily be passed along when growth in industrial and food output per capita were rapidly rising the figure 5 situation this ability seems to disappear when the economy is near limits part of the problem is that the lower growth in per capita energy affects the kinds of job that are available with low energy consumption growth many of the jobs that are available are service jobs that do not pay well wage disparity becomes an increasing problem when wage disparity grows the share of low wage workers rises if businesses try to pass along their higher costs of production they encounter market resistance because lower wage workers cannot afford the finished goods made with high cost energy products for example auto and iphone sales in china decline the lack of chinese demand tends to lead to a drop in demand for the many commodities used in manufacturing these goods including both energy products and metals because there is very little storage capacity for commodities a small decline in demand tends to lead to quite a large decline in prices even a small decline in china s demand for energy products can lead to a big decline in oil prices strange as it may seem the economy ends up with low oil prices rather than high oil prices being the problem other commodity prices tend to be low as well what is ahead if we are reaching economic growth limits 1 figure 1 at the top of this post seems to give an indication of what is ahead after 2019 but this forecast cannot be relied on a major issue is that the limited model used at that time did not include the financial system or debt even if the model seems to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of when limits will hit it won t necessarily give a correct view of what the impact of limits will be on the rest of the economy after limits hit the authors in fact have said that the model should not be expected to provide reliable indications regarding how the economy will behave after limits have started to have an impact on economic output 2 as indicated in the title of this post considerable financial volatility can be expected in 2019 if the economy is trying to slow itself stock prices will be erratic interest rates will be erratic currency relativities will tend to bounce around the likelihood that derivatives will cause major problems for banks will rise because derivatives tend to assume more stability in values than now seems to be the case increasing problems with derivatives raises the risk of bank failure 3 the world economy doesn t necessarily fail all at once instead pieces that are in some sense less efficient users of energy may shrink back during the great recession of 2008 2009 the countries that seemed to be most affected were countries such as greece spain and italy that depend on oil for a disproportionately large share of their total energy consumption china and india with energy mixes dominated by coal were much less affected in the 2002 2008 period oil prices were rising faster than prices of other fossil fuels this tended to make countries using a high share of oil in their energy mix less competitive in the world market the low labor costs of china and india gave these countries another advantage by the end of 2007 china s energy consumption per capita had risen to a point where it almost matched the now lower energy consumption of the european countries shown china with its low energy costs seems to have eaten the lunch of some of its european competitors in 2019 and the years that follow some countries may fare at least somewhat better than others the united states for now seems to be faring better than many other parts of the world 4 while we have been depending upon china to be a leader in economic growth china s growth is already faltering and may turn to contraction in the near future one reason is an energy problem china s coal production has fallen because many of its coal mines have been closed due to lack of profitability as a result china s need for imported energy difference between black line and top of energy production stack has been growing rapidly china is now the largest importer of oil coal and natural gas in the world it is very vulnerable to tariffs and to lack of available supplies for import a second issue is that demographics are working against china its working age population already seems to be shrinking a third reason why china is vulnerable to economic difficulties is because of its growing debt level debt becomes difficult to repay with interest if the economy slows 5 oil exporters such as venezuela saudi arabia and nigeria have become vulnerable to government overthrow or collapse because of low world oil prices since 2014 if the central government of one or more of these exporters disappears it is possible that the pieces of the country will struggle along producing a lower amount of oil as libya has done in recent years it is also possible that another larger country will attempt to take over the failing production of the country and secure the output for itself 6 epidemics become increasingly likely especially in countries with serious financial problems such as yemen syria and venezuela historically much of the decrease in population in countries with collapsing economies has come from epidemics of course epidemics can spread across national boundaries exporting the problems elsewhere 7 resource wars become increasingly likely these can be local wars perhaps over the availability of water they can also be large international wars the timing of world war i and world war ii make it seem likely that these wars were both resource wars 8 collapsing intergovernmental agencies such as the european union the world trade organization and the international monetary fund seem likely the united kingdom s planned exit from the european union in 2019 is a step toward dissolving the european union 9 privately funded pension funds will increasingly be subject to default because of continued low interest rates some governments may choose to cut back the amounts they provide to pensioners because governments cannot collect adequate tax revenue for this purpose some countries may purposely shut down parts of their governments in an attempt to hold down government spending 10 a far worse and more permanent recession than that of the great recession seems likely because of the difficulty in repaying debt with interest in a shrinking economy it is not clear when such a recession will start it could start later in 2019 or perhaps it may wait until 2020 as with the great recession some countries will be affected more than others eventually because of the interconnected nature of financial systems all countries are likely to be drawn in summary it is not entirely clear exactly what is ahead if we are reaching limits to growth perhaps that is for the best if we cannot do anything about it worrying about the many details of what is ahead is not the best for anyone s mental health while it is possible that this is an end point for the human race this is not certain by any means there have been many amazing coincidences over the past 4 billion years that have allowed life to continue to evolve on this planet more of these coincidences may be ahead we also know that humans lived through past ice ages they likely can live through other kinds of adversity including worldwide economic collapse our finite world blog
the abenomics reform package on which prime minister abe campaigned was the right one to lift japan out of two decades of anemic growth but he hasn t really committed the political capital needed to take on the vested interests for the reforms that matter most he continues to do just enough on the economic front to keep the japanese economy on a stable course but his main political aim is the normalisation of japan s military the mandate that abe gave bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda checked japan s deflation but it hasn t lifted prices to the target 2 per cent a year much of recorded economic growth has come from crude keynesianism fiscal and monetary expansion instead of structural reforms to lift japan s growth potential two big structural challenges still loom over the japanese economy the first is the ageing and shrinking population and the other is the unprecedented gross government debt that is running at 240 per cent of gdp as masahiko takeda explains in this week s lead essay japan s economic conditions continue to be neither too hot nor too cold but nor are they in goldilocks territory quite just right the consumption tax will be raised in september from 8 to 10 per cent and the abe government has formally opened up japan to immigration for the first time both measures involve significant compromise the consumption tax rate will remain at 8 per cent for some food products introducing a serious distortion in consumption and distorting subsidies will also be introduced the same food will be taxed differently depending on where it is eaten it s administratively messy and poor policy the more serious risk is the rushing through of the changes to the immigration law the opening up of japan to foreign labour that de facto can stay indefinitely has rightly been hailed as a watershed for japan a japan whose total refugee intake in 2017 amounted to only 20 people but there will need to be much more change if japanese social cohesion is to withstand the shock foreign labour will be able to enter japan on a five year guest worker visa with family and extend that visa indefinitely but as with any successful immigration program it s what s done behind the border that matters most for foreign born workers to succeed in japan and for japan to be able to attract the best talent from abroad immigrants must be accorded equal rights equal access to services and the chance to succeed in society the risk is that a new foreign born population in japan eventually with japanese born children will be marginalised and discriminated against in society it is widely recognised that third generation koreans or zainichi do not get equal treatment in japan today immigration reform done right would require more preparation for japanese businesses and the community to accept an influx of foreign talent japan is prosperous safe and an attractive destination for migrants but can t expect to attract the best automatically without providing language and other support for assimilation and the chance of success in japanese society the change in japanese migration policy is most welcome but its opportunistic and slapdash implementation could cruel otherwise good reform externally takeda reminds us that the us china trade tensions could also cause strong headwinds for the japanese economy the us approach to dealing with trade problems with china is holding the wto trade regime hostage to having its way with china and threatens japanese prosperity and global trade it may appear that japan is helpless in the external challenge of a us china trade war but japan is president of the g20 at this key moment the g20 communique in argentina late last year opened up the opportunity of reforming the wto japan has assets to deploy in finding ways to resolve the china us tensions in a multilateral setting in a region where leaders are coming and going or challenging the global status quo abe and japan have provided stable leadership that led to the conclusion of the tpp without the united states and has seen a breakthrough in improving the difficult china japan relationship abe s never been shy about his long cherished aim of revising the article 9 peace clause of the japanese constitution to allow for a more normal military but his legacy will be more likely determined by how japan manages its new immigration program and its g20 presidency muddling through on immigration reform and the g20 presidency in full view of the world will hardly be enough the eaf editorial board is located in the crawford school of public policy college of asia and the pacific the australian national university

open pit mining methods with conventional drilling blasting and loading performed on 12m benches autonomous haulage was incorporated to take advantage of the technology s proven productivity improvements and operating cost savings the open pit would have a mine life of 14 years including pre stripping with a life of mine strip ratio of 1 5 1 a maximum mining rate of approximately 65 mt per year including waste is required to provide the nominal 60 000 tonnes per day of ore to the process facility a total of 259 mt of ore is expected to be processed over the life of the mine ore would be trucked from the mine and either stockpiled or direct tipped into the primary crusher the ore would be further crushed through a closed circuit secondary crushing system to a stockpile crushed ore would be processed at an on off heap leach pad where the copper would be leached in acid and then recovered from the leach solution by solvent extraction and electrowinning to produce lme grade copper cathodes metal leaching is expected to span over 13 years once the copper is leached the ore would be rinsed neutralized and removed from the on off leach pad by a bucket wheel reclaimer the material would then be agglomerated using cement and subsequently stacked on a permanent heap leach pad where gold and silver would be leached in a cyanide solution gold and silver would be recovered from the pregnant gold leach solution by a merrill crowe zinc precipitation process gold and silver would then be smelted to produce doré a portion of the barren leach solution following zinc precipitation would be treated to avoid a build up of recirculating copper and cyanide through the gold circuit this treatment is based on the sart process which produces a copper sulphide precipitate which grades approximately 65 copper and recovers cyanide for use in the heap leach the proposed pfs production schedule and metal production profile is shown in the attached figures note the project assumes a 24 month construction period image 2 cu production schedule image 3 au and ag production schedule metallurgy in 2016 and 2017 comprehensive metallurgical test programs were carried out at sgs lakefield on selected samples from the filo del sol deposit these focussed mostly on assessing the feasibility of using heap leaching to recover the copper gold and silver from the various mineralization types identified to confirm these results a sampling campaign was carried out in early 2018 to collect surface samples rc chips and diamond drill core samples a total of more than 3 500 kg of sample was shipped to the sgs facility in lakefield ontario samples were submitted to various physical chemical and detailed mineralogical characterisation tests most of the metallurgical program was devoted to the leaching stage of the process more particularly heap leaching heap leaching was simulated by conducting column leaching tests on material ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 inch crush size and using 50 to 250 kg of sample per column test cyanide column leaching was tested for the gold oxide ore types a total of 11 column tests while sequential column leaching acid leaching followed by washing neutralization and cyanide leaching was used for the copper gold oxide ore types a total of 18 sequential column tests variability and process optimization testing were carried out using bottle roll tests on minus 10 mesh material both cyanide leaching a total of 21 bottle roll tests and sequential leaching a total of 72 sequential leach bottle roll tests were conducted during the 2018 program the results of the test program were used to determine the optimal leach program together with expected leach recoveries for copper gold and silver additionally deductions to the testwork extractions were applied to expected copper gold and silver recoveries to simulate scale up to a commercial production facility infrastructure the major infrastructure items

but although many in the financial world fear a new crisis is looming there is little agreement about what will trigger the shake up or where it will start seven years on from that episode and more than 10 years after the implosion of lehman brothers financial markets have accumulated a whole new batch of excesses that are ripe for correction as well as some old ones that previous crunches failed to correct so for example there were the oil crises of the 1970s the latin american debt crisis of 1982 the black monday stock market crash of 1987 the tequila crisis of 1994 the asian financial crisis of 1997 98 the dotcom bust of 2000 and the worldwide recession that followed the credit crunch and global financial crisis of 2007 08 and the european debt crisis that peaked in 2012 part of the reason is simply the feeling that the world is overdue for another downturn a look at the economic history of recent decades shows that major financial crashes tend to come along every five to seven years after a panicked end to 2018 in the financial markets and a jittery start to the new year an increasing number of investors analysts and economists are beginning to warn about the crisis of 2019 as often as not to be followed by the recession of 2020 others cast a wary eye towards europe where it is likely germany and italy are already in a new recession and where the doom loop between rising italian government bond yields and weakening italian bank capital is stronger than ever threatening a whole new crisis of confidence in the euro zone s single currency but although these concerns are real the probability that the next financial crisis will originate in either china or europe is relatively low that s because crises are not usually triggered by insolvency when liabilities exceed assets but because of illiquidity when institutions run out of ready cash more than 10 years after the implosion of lehman brothers financial markets have accumulated a whole new batch of excesses that are ripe for correction photo afp in china where the state owns and controls the banking system officials have their hands on all the levers necessary to ensure plentiful supplies of liquidity in case of an emergency and in the euro zone the 2012 pledge by european central bank president mario draghi to do whatever it takes to preserve the single currency still stands faced with a new crisis the ecb can once again open the funding taps to avert disaster that will not solve the euro s deep seated underlying problems but it will postpone a day of reckoning for the currency that many believe will be inevitable without far reaching structural reforms of europe s economic governance instead it is more likely that the world s next big financial crash will originate in the united states and while there will be differences from the 2008 crisis there will also be telling similarities history doesn t repeat but it does rhyme in the years before 2008 a protracted period of low interest rates encouraged banks to ramp up lending to risky borrowers and to repackage their loans and sell them on to yield hungry investors back then the risky borrowers were subprime homebuyers this time around they are american companies with benchmark interest rates close to zero for most of this decade us companies have binged on debt many have borrowed ever greater sums not to invest in productive assets like new factories but to buy back their own shares so juicing up their stock prices and generating ever bigger bonus packages for their executives as a result over the last 10 years the value of us corporate bonds outstanding has tripled from about us 2 5 trillion to us 7 5 trillion and of that amount roughly 45 per cent is rated bbb just one grade above junk that s not all since the 2008 crisis there has also been a boom in so called leveraged loans loans to high risk corporate borrowers with the market doubling in size from us 550 billion to around us 1 1 trillion and most of these loans have been repackaged and sold on to investors as collateralised debt obligations just as subprime mortgages were repackaged and sold on in the 2000s but it is in the corporate bond market that there is the greatest cause for anxiety that s because even as the amount of debt outstanding has ballooned new regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis have discouraged banks and brokers from trading the bonds on their own account as a result few wall street finance houses either hold inventories of corporate bonds or are prepared to quote firm prices to investors come what may with benchmark interest rates close to zero for most of this decade us companies have binged on debt photo reuters in short the market has grown in size even as its reservoir of trading liquidity has dried up that is likely to be a problem much of the us corporate debt market is owned by exchange traded funds etfs and foreign institutional investors many of which are prohibited from holding junk bonds and all of which expect to be able to sell their holdings without difficulty should they want or need to it is not hard to imagine that as the us economy slows after its long cycle of expansion and us companies face tightening margins an increasing number are likely to face difficulties servicing the debts they ran up to fund share buy backs sooner or later some bbb rated borrowers will get downgraded to junk status when that happens etfs and institutional investors will attempt to sell the bonds they hold only to find few dealers willing to quote them reasonable prices as investors take fright us corporate bond prices will collapse etfs will rush to liquidate their holdings to meet redemptions worsening the price slump leveraged investors such as hedge funds will face margin calls they will not be able to meet which in turn will cast doubt on the financial integrity of the investment banks that extended them the leverage other banks will stop dealing with the investment banks liquidity in the financial system will dry up and suddenly the world will find itself facing a repeat of the september 2008 death spiral that led to the implosion of lehman brothers all this of course is speculation it may never happen but on the other hand it is a plausible scenario and one that is making investors increasingly uneasy all we can say for sure is that sooner or later the next financial crisis will strike and that it could unfold more or less as described here let s hope it doesn t tom holland is a former scmp staffer who has been writing about

of process parameters delineating more or higher grade material through continued exploration on the company s extensive land package and future exploitation of copper gold sulphide material underlying the identified oxide deposit project description filo del sol hosts a high sulphidation epithermal copper gold silver deposit associated with a large porphyry copper gold system the project is located in the andes mountains on the border of chile and argentina approximately 140 km southeast of the city of copiapó the project is covered under the mining integration and complementation treaty between chile and argentina which provides the framework for the development of cross border mining projects the pfs contemplates that filo del sol would be mined using conventional open pit methods from the open pit ore would be trucked to a conventional two stage crusher designed to process 60 000 tonnes per day of ore crushed ore would be treated by sequential heap leaching to extract copper and subsequently gold and silver from the ore followed by hydrometallurgical processing to produce copper cathodes and gold silver doré groundwater for the process plant would be supplied from nearby aquifers to the plant site and power would be supplied via 127 km of power line construction to connect to the chilean national grid copper cathode and gold silver doré would be transported by truck to puerto caldera which is located approximately 245 km by road from the plant site approximately 60 km of the existing road between site and port would require upgrade to accommodate the truck

mine strip ratio of 1 5 1 a maximum mining rate of approximately 65 mt per year including waste is required to provide the nominal 60 000 tonnes per day of ore to the process facility a total of 259 mt of ore is expected to be processed over the life of the mine ore would be trucked from the mine and either stockpiled or direct tipped into the primary crusher the ore would be further crushed through a closed circuit secondary crushing system to a stockpile crushed ore would be processed at an on off heap leach pad where the copper would be leached in acid and then recovered from the leach solution by solvent extraction and electrowinning to produce lme grade copper cathodes metal leaching is expected to span over 13 years once the copper is leached the ore would be rinsed neutralized and removed from the on off leach pad by a bucket wheel reclaimer the material would then be agglomerated using cement and subsequently stacked on a permanent heap leach pad where gold and silver would be leached in a cyanide solution gold and silver would be recovered from the pregnant gold leach solution by a merrill crowe zinc precipitation process gold and silver would then be smelted to produce doré a portion of the barren leach solution following zinc precipitation would be treated to avoid a build up of recirculating copper and cyanide through the gold circuit this treatment is based on the sart process which produces a copper sulphide precipitate which grades approximately 65 copper and recovers cyanide for use in the heap leach the proposed pfs production schedule and metal production profile is shown in the attached figures note the project assumes a 24 month construction period image 2 cu production schedule image 3 au and ag production schedule metallurgy in 2016 and 2017 comprehensive metallurgical test programs were carried out at sgs lakefield on selected samples from the filo del sol deposit these focussed mostly on assessing the feasibility of using heap leaching to recover the copper gold and silver from the various mineralization types identified to confirm these results a sampling campaign was carried out in early 2018 to collect surface samples rc chips and diamond drill core samples a total of more than 3 500 kg of sample was shipped to the sgs facility in lakefield ontario samples were submitted to various physical chemical and detailed mineralogical characterisation tests most of the metallurgical program was devoted to the leaching stage of the process more particularly heap leaching heap leaching was simulated by conducting column leaching tests on material ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 inch crush size and using 50 to 250 kg of sample per column test cyanide column leaching was tested for the gold oxide ore types a total of 11 column tests while sequential column leaching acid leaching followed by washing neutralization and cyanide leaching was used for the copper gold oxide ore types a total of 18 sequential column tests variability and process optimization testing were carried out using bottle roll tests on minus 10 mesh material both cyanide leaching a total of 21 bottle roll tests and sequential leaching a total of 72 sequential leach bottle roll tests were conducted during the 2018 program the results of the test program were used to determine the optimal leach program together with expected leach recoveries for copper gold and silver additionally deductions to the testwork extractions were applied to expected copper gold and silver recoveries to simulate scale up to a commercial

if a u s recession is around the corner the construction of president donald trump s wall on the mexican border could be an economic godsend last week the world s most powerful central banker u s fed chair jerome powell assured us that economic growth would continue in 2019 bank of canada governor stephen poloz has been similarly optimistic but the forecasts after that are more cloudy the international monetary fund has already warned that the world is unprepared for the next slowdown and the organization for economic co operation and development oecd has recommended countries dust off plans for fiscal spending when recession hits self inflicted illness it may be that for trump if such a slowdown comes it will be an example of economic munchausen syndrome a self inflicted condition caused by his easy to win trade war with china and others but whatever the cause fighting recession with big infrastructure spending projects has a long tradition around the world the creation of the promenade des anglais in the french mediterranean city of nice in the 1800s was an early example when wealthy english residents contributed to build a shoreline walkway to provide jobs for the unemployed and to get beggars off the street in the dirty 30s governments organized similar make work projects including the deepening of regina s wascana lake using shovels wheelbarrows and more than 2 000 labourers an early plan by english architect thomas mawson for a giant park in the centre of regina at wascana lake in the 1930s the lake was deepened and reshaped using shovels as a make work project saskatchewan council for archives and archivists more recent projects have been much bigger before the handover of hong kong to china in 1997 the hong kong government launched a multibillion dollar infrastructure project to build a new airport port and road connections to boost the economy despite uncertainty during the transfer of power and according to canadian research such spending really works in the construction phase alone infrastructure projects multiply the value of the taxpayer money or government borrowing that s spent spent money on infrastructure generates in addition to economic benefits like short term employment and things of that kind in construction positive net flow to the government said michael fenn a visiting fellow at western university s ivey school of business and former head of ontario transport agency metrolinx who has been described as an infrastructure guru the fiscal dividend for infrastructure is something like 1 60 for every dollar spent said fenn that doesn t include such advantages as preventing the dispersion of workers or keeping their skills fresh during a recession and it doesn t include the future stream of benefits to society from the project after it s completed fiscal dividend of the wall even at 1 60 to 1 it s still not clear how much stimulus constructing a wall would add to the u s economy partly because the amount to be spent remains confusingly disputed trump s request of 5 7 billion means it wouldn t make much of a difference to the gigantic u s economy during a recession but then neither would it make much of a wall research by the brookings institute puts the figure as high as 70 billion which really would create plenty of make work jobs hong kong s tsing ma suspension bridge is shown under construction before the 1997 handover of the crown colony to china it s an example of stimulus with a large long term return reuters there are at least two problems with the wall as a make work project one is that if the project really did start soon before recession hit there might not be enough workers to build it the irony of importing labourers from south and central america to do the job would be too much with u s unemployment at the lowest it has been in nearly 50 years building a wall now could very well drive up inflation giving the fed one more reason to raise interest rates the other issue to be considered is long term value creation which studies consistently show can be the biggest payback for infrastructure spending on well chosen projects it dwarfs the immediate 1 60 to 1 ratio of the original stimulus money well spent sometimes the stimulus itself is well worth the money spent the long term benefit as in the esthetic advantage of the promenade des anglais or wascana lake may be hard to measure jackie schmidt president of heritage regina says the beautification of the enormous artificial lake in that prairie city was worth the money i think the product was worth it no matter how you paid for it but it s not clear if anyone would spend the money the same way now the economic payback of hong kong s giant construction project was easier to measure maintaining the former british colony s place as a transport hub even while mainland infrastructure grew up in competition the long term value of a wall trump s belief that it would be a barrier to drugs or terrorism has been widely discredited there might be a certain economic advantage in making trump supporters feel more secure though that is hard to measure and should the existence of a wall prove to be a deterrent to would be border crossers the humanitarian benefit of reducing the number people who die in the desert would certainly have value building a wall along the u s mexico border would create
