here enjoy modern monetary theory the third hand of economics harry truman is famous for requesting a one armed economist when he posed a question to economists answers would all follow the same simple structure on the one hand you ll get this but on the other hand broadly speaking typical discussion of fiscal and monetary policy revolves around two separate trains of thought on one hand you have the orthodox neoclassical approach and on the other hand there are various versions of the heterodox keynesian marxist post keynesian institutionalist modern monetary theory theories the orthodox approach aims to study the allocation of scarce resources among unlimited wants mitchell p 5 guided by adam smith s invisible hand theory this camp seeks to maximize pleasure through self interest and markets unhampered by governmental interference the heterodox camp on the other hand defines economics as the study of social creation and distribution of society s resources mitchell p 7 under this theory government activity impacts the markets to provide resources and stability for the people in this article we will explore a third lesser known heterodox option modern monetary theory mmt overview of mmt while a branch off the heterodox theories the basic tenet of mmt is that in a sovereign nation with a sovereign currency the government can never run out of money or be forced to miss a payment on any payment denominated in its own unit of currency as james juniper describes it full fiscal monetary sovereignty exists when the consolidated government sector treasury and central bank of a country issues a fiat nonconvertible currency and operates with a flexible exchange rate juniper 284 for proof of this you need to look no further than our history of treasury bonds over the last half century according to data from the federal reserve bank of st louis fred the us 10 year constant maturity rate an important measure of borrowing costs are at their lowest levels since the 1960s even when the total public debt has been increasing over the decades it is true that the debt to gdp ratio for the us is high based on data from the orthodox economist carmen reinhart however when taking into account the 10 year constant maturity rate the actual cost of debt in the united states demonstrates nearly the same trends as the aforementioned fred data additionally the cost of debt in the us has never once reached above six percent of gdp which indicates that borrowing costs have never been high at any point in modern us history finally our structural break analysis indicated that the 4th quarter of 1997 was the point where the cost of debt started to see a statistically significant decline compared to the previous time frame consequently borrowing costs have not reached above 3 5 percent furthermore data from reinhart also documented that since its inception the united states has never once had an external default on its debt from this we can make one of the central observations of mmt since the us has a monopoly over the issuing of its own currency it can therefore control its borrowing costs while not aligned with either political party as both democrats and republicans frame the problem of budgets through the wrong mindset mmt has been brought to new light after congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez said it should be a larger part of the conversation we re currently stuck in a system dominated by austerity politics and economics with deficit hawks on the right and the current democratic controlled congress enacting a policy of paygo only enacting policies that will not add to the federal debt we are limiting our ability to pursue ambitious policy changes things like the green new deal medicare for all and tuition free college simply put mmt shows the way we think about budget constraints and deficits are wrong government deficits do have an impact on the economy in the form of non government surpluses using t charts for double sided accounting we can look at it this way aside from taxes every dollar the government spends goes into the hands of the private sector therefore an inverse relationship exists between government deficits and private sector surpluses this is known as the sector financial balances equation private sector surplus government deficit currency account surplus or s i g t x m when the government spends on things like infrastructure healthcare education or poverty alleviating measures the non government sector benefits the inverse is also true when the government runs surpluses the private sector runs deficits this accounting reality means that if the non government sector wants to net save in the currency of issue then the government has to be in deficit mitchell 125 there have been seven times throughout american history where the government has run a budget surplus within five years of each of these surpluses the united states has faced either a recession or a depression the private sector cannot simply keystroke its way into more money the government can hence mmt seeks to dispel the myth that government should treat its budget with similar constraints to a household or a firm through the lens of mmt we will show how large scale transformational policies like the green new deal medicare for all and college free tuition are not only possible they are within reach as dr stephanie kelton one of the leading proponents of mmt explains our first question should not be how are we going to pay for it rather our first focus should be on the policy itself in order to fully understand mmt we must first look at some traits of our current macroeconomic system scott fullwiler calls these operational realities and describes three truths that must be laid out first he says is the accounting of real world transactions banks can create loans and liabilities out of thin air without balances or reserves to fund the loan they can grow their balance sheets through loans and asset purchases the second operational reality is the tactical logic for operations necessary to achieve particular fundamental ends given a particular monetary regime fullwiler notes that different monetary systems have different requirements but for this article we will focus on the united states we use a pure fiat currency with flexible exchange rates hyman minsky referred to the hierarchy of money and as stephanie bell puts it the state determines not only the unit in which all of the monies in the hierarchy are denominated but also influences the positioning of certain monies within the hierarchy as a currency issuing government with flexible exchange rates a country like the u s sits at the top of the hierarchy above other nations that might use a currency union or a gold standard fullwiler looks at what is not possible given the accounting and tactical logic this means that central banks as monopoly suppliers of reserve balances to the banking system must set an interest rate target but can only directly target the quantity of reserves if the target rate is set equal to the central bank s remuneration rate on reserves the only constraints we have on how we spend money are self imposed as fullwiler puts it while the ability to just spend the money is recognized in times of war or when a financial bailout is deemed necessary by politicians at least mmt ers want it to be just as obvious when the issue at hand is involuntary unemployment crumbling infrastructure children or retirees living below the poverty line a major city devastated by natural disaster and so forth please note that this is not to say that such a government should always spend simply because it can operationally that would be ridiculous but rather that there is no such thing as it not being able to afford to put idle capacity to work the appropriate constraint to consider is whether there is idle capacity in the first place while also recognizing the obvious point that not all fiscal actions are equally efficient the real constraint is inflation dr kelton in a lecture about using mmt to address the pay for problem of the green new deal gnd lays out three steps 1 assess resource needs 2 access resource and technological capacity and 3 build in offsets as needed to free up or create resources needed beyond what is currently available she notes that enacting medicare for all will spur development of a gnd first the savings of moving to single payer would be about 200 billion per year these savings would free up resources to use for other needs healthcare accounts for about 18 percent of gdp in the us and making it more efficient would trim that number down allowing us to use those resources in other ways offsets are only needed once society is constrained in resources her lecture notes three offsets specifically the economy currently has about 530 billion worth of slack meaning we could spend this much more without any additional resources or inflationary issues if we add this to the savings from medicare for all and eliminate the 650 billion we currently provide for fossil fuel subsidies as we are moving to a green economy we arrive at 1 38 trillion in offsets in subsequent talks dr kelton has noted that reforms to wall street and criminal justice would also free up real resources she cites senator sanders s proposal to cut incarceration in half by the end of his first term which would free up over one million people who could help fight climate change fiscal versus monetary policy to fully understand mmt we must first look at the role government plays in our economic framework the differences between fiscal policy and monetary policy generally fiscal policy encompasses the methods by which the government taxes and spends money monetary policy which primarily concerns the actions of the federal reserve deals with interest rates and the amount of money in circulation it is important to note that in our current system the power the fed has primarily consists of maintaining the overnight interest rate that banks can lend to each other the fed and the treasury while ultimately independent of each other work partly in tandem to ensure that every payment authorized by congress is carried out this is done with reserves at the central bank and through the sale of treasury bonds the bank accounts of the recipients of government spending are credited changes in monetary policy do little to impact our day to day lives however large changes in fiscal policy are necessary to move progressive policies forward and there are two primary mechanisms to accomplish this first social spending can be used to decrease inequality and consequently eliminate volatility in the financial system this volatility according to drehmann et al 2018 stems from the unsustainable credit driven accumulation of household debt which reduces output in the economy when the debt is no longer able to be serviced there is a clear link between high levels of economic inequality and these cycles of household debt accumulation kumof et al 2015 noted that the rising income shares of high income households were linked to an increase in the household debt to gdp ratio particularly when it relates to poor households which was subsequently linked to an increased risk of recessions id this explains why according to the models of the harvard economist monica prasad in her book america the land of too much a one percent increase in the growth of social spending as a percent of gdp reduces the growth of household debt percent of gdp by 0 473 to 0 581 percentage points yet despite the fact that policymakers have had many chances to fix these problems according to the swid dataset income inequality in the us is at its highest point since the 1960s and according to data from uc berkeley economists gabriel zucman and emmanuel saez wealth inequality is at its highest point since the 1940s in other words spending on progressive policies can eliminate the need of poor and working class americans to access public goods through private sector credit that has been shown empirically to be the wrong approach to ensuring macroeconomic stability the second mechanism to accomplish progressive goals is to utilize progressive taxation to eliminate the imbalance of power between the working class and wealthy this imbalance of power is not only harmful to the working class but also to long term economic growth this idea can be inferred from the link between economic inequality and inequality of opportunity in 2016 researchers at the rand corporation conducted a meta analysis of the literature and found that economic inequality has a negative relationship with opportunity because it creates an unequal playing field between the rich and poor in terms of access to important endowments such as education additionally income inequality can negatively impact political equality which compounds these negative effects by preserving institutions built on this inequality according to a study by martin gilens and benjamin page of princeton university there is a close correlation between the policy preferences of economic elites and the policies of the us government this bias in policy preferences toward wealthy donors has a tangible effect on countercyclical redistributive institutions larry bartels at vanderbilt university found that the political bias in favor of the policy preferences of the most affluent citizens has led to a decline in equilibrium social spending by 10 15 percentage points when reconciling these realities with mmt under this framework fiscal policy is not just about funding social programs it is also about utilizing the power of the state to create an environment of economic inclusiveness for all ethnographic groups in the society orthodox and heterodox views where the system went wrong throughout our nation s history we have seen various interpretations of economic philosophy often inspired by the work of other countries orthodox thinking largely attributed to economists like adam smith f a hayek and milton friedman was the basis on which the us built its economic system before the great depression after the collapse of the stock market in 1929 ideas brought forth by j m keynes were put into action by president franklin d roosevelt as the ideas of neoclassical and keynesian economics merged president hoover in the wake of the great depression maintained that the government should not interfere in markets or provide economic relief more than 20 percent of americans were unemployed at this time president roosevelt enacted sweeping changes after his election in 1932 these included regulating banks and the stock market creating the social security system and forming the new deal the us has primarily relied on methods of keynesian and post keynesian thought post wwii where are we now congress is tasked with budget implementation under the constitution the house senate and white house all propose budgets and joint committees are formed to negotiate discrepancies once an omnibus budget is agreed upon it is presented to the president for signature as mentioned earlier the house has enacted a paygo policy and the senate is prohibited by procedure from enacting anything that will create a budgetary hole within a decade enter austerity politics austerity measures as we know them deal with the system of raising taxes or cutting spending to balance the budget this is where the rubber meets the road for many policy ideas the first question for any politician proposing large scale changes gnd medicare for all etc becomes are you going to raise taxes or cut spending to pay for this program at the state and local level that question makes more sense as state and local governments are constrained by revenue at the federal level we are currently running a trillion dollar deficit so much for the republican tax cuts paying for themselves huh on the right budget slashing is the preferred tool of the trade programs like healthcare education entitlement and welfare programs and criminal justice are first on the chopping block but these programs are essential to a healthy happy and prosperous society the further we dig ourselves into a hole through austerity methods the more poverty crime and societal unrest we will see we must stop using these important programs as wealth transfer springboards for the rich we must stop thinking of government deficits as a fundamental problem and decouple our tax and spending fights paygo intertwines them these need to be separated so we can think about whether we need offsets tax increases or not paygo makes us start with the presumption that all new spending needs to be fully offset that is bad economics and bad public policy conversely on the left a standard response to pay fors come in the form of a wealth tax higher corporate income tax rates or taxing transactions on wall street while these methods could help to shrink the social and racial wealth gap they are not necessary to pay for programs with this in mind let s go back to the original question are you going to fund new programs by raising taxes or cutting spending the short answer is this neither where do we go from here under the theory of mmt we must completely rethink our idea of taxes so long as government can impose and collect taxes it can ensure at least some demand for a nonconvertible currency all it needs to do is to insist that taxes be paid in its own currency this promise to accept in tax payment is sufficient to create a demand for the currency taxes drive money wray 72 taxes are not the method by which the government spends they are merely a way to ensure the stability of a nonconvertible currency indeed government must spend or lend the currency into the economy before taxpayers can pay taxes in the form of currency spend first tax later is the logical sequence wray 141 additionally mmt proponents recognize another reason for taxes to reduce and stabilize aggregate demand taxes reduce private sector purchasing power and consumption of harmful goods and services like tobacco without taxes several macroeconomic problems would come into play including large inflationary pressures we must move past the cognitive dissonance and accept this simple truth taxes do not pay for anything at least at the federal level simple keystrokes on a computer do that explain mmt to a classical economist or a standard citizen and you ll typically get the same response won t more money in the economy lead to inflation this is the million dollar question and it requires a thorough response while some inflation is necessary to increase say a teacher s compensation we always look at ways to limit inflation while increasing employment while no other country has fully implemented a standard mmt approach there are a couple notable examples of expanding the circulation of currency detrimentally zimbabwe and the weimar republic as wray notes zimbabwe was going through a tremendous social and political upheaval with unemployment reaching 80 percent of the workforce and a gdp that had fallen by 40 percent wray 262 further unsuccessful land reform led to the collapse of food production the government then relied heavily on food imports and imf lending ultimately leading to external debts food was scarce and the government and private sector were battling for a small supply of resources pushing prices up this ultimately led to hyperinflation in the weimar republic austerity measures were not feasible to fund reparations from wwi the government believed that it was politically impossible to impose taxes at a sufficient level to free up resources for exports to make reparations payments so instead it relied on spending this meant government competed with domestic demand for a limited supply of output driving prices up wray 261 the domestic producers were forced to borrow abroad in foreign currency to buy necessary imports domestic currency was depreciated in large part due to rising prices and foreign borrowing both examples failed in large part due to social political unrest and an inability for the government to implement policies that would absorb their additional money supply so let s get back to inflation as dr kelton notes any payments authorized by congress will be cleared by the federal reserve what matters is the economy s capacity to safely absorb any increase in spending there are a number of methods to mitigate inflationary concerns with an increase in spending which we will outline further mmt and progressive policies as the overton window shifts and progressive populist ideas become more and more popular we should look at how mmt could impact several of the biggest programs on the national stage federal jobs guarantee a federal jobs guarantee fjg would be an important targeted approach to creating a better income distribution increasing consumption and improving the stability of the us economy pavlina tchernova of the levi economics institute at bard college noted in 2012 that these effects can occur with a universal job guarantee by utilizing an employer of last resort elr approach this would increase macroeconomic stability by targeting spending toward employing everyone that is not able to get a job in the private sector and thus creating true full employment it can also help to reduce the volatility associated with boom and bust cycles by acting as an automatic stabilizer during recessions additionally according to a study by scott fullwiler of the university of missouri kansas city the guarantee can also increase private sector growth through consumer spending and human capital accumulation effects associated with new skills and wage incomes generated from the public sector modern monetary theory can serve as a catalyst for an fjg by providing important justifications for the initial allocation of spending towards those programs that can be tailored to the individual civic and economic needs of the community the main benefit and the reason this would mitigate inflation is that it would essentially create a job buffer that expands or contracts based on economic circumstances federal employment would grow in recession and shrink in expansion which counteracts fluctuations in private sector employment it is estimated that implementation of such a program would put net spending by the government at well under one percent of gdp after its financial crisis in 2001 argentina implemented a program known as plan jefes y jefas de hogar desocupados program for unemployed male and female heads of households daniel kostzer who studied the program noted that it amounted to under one percent of gdp and paved the way for a reduction of the contractionary effects that otherwise would have caused a catastrophic devaluation of the currency the program ultimately employed five percent of the population and successfully found useful work for participants jefes reduced social unrest sic and provided demand for private sector production wray 237 in addition to a job buffer high inflation problems can be decreased by reducing indexing stabiliz production solving supply constraints and quell social unrest wray 262 3 medicare for all medicare for all would greatly benefit from an mmt framework the empirical support for a single payer healthcare system to fix the original deficiencies of the affordable care act is such that it is the unrivaled solution to address the problems of a healthcare system that prioritizes profit over the quality of life by specifying mmt as the economic theory to utilize in funding a single payer system we would erase the need to utilize any form of regressive taxation as a funding source according to an analysis by gerald friedman of the university of massachusetts amherst a medicare for all plan that primarily uses progressive taxation would greatly improve the household income of the bottom 95 percent of americans additionally raising taxes on individual wealth can help to counteract the political and economic fight that has been waged by decades of lobbying against healthcare reforms even though they are typically thought of in different ways a true medicare for all proposal would work hand in hand with the fjg elr component of a gnd in theory under plans where the federal government provides free at point of use single payer healthcare jobs would be lost in insurance medical sales and the pharmaceutical industries any wholescale fjg elr would provide job retraining for those who lost their jobs in these industries or say a coal mine the government would also provide additional training for those in the medical field as we transition to our full population utilizing preventative and chronic care green new deal the green new deal has been talked about in various ways over the past several years resolutions were introduced by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez and senator ed markey h resolution 109 and s resolution 59 respectively these resolutions lay out basic plans to fund green infrastructure create a federal jobs guarantee reduce pollution and emissions guarantee education implement cleaner transportation and a host of other issues within a decade as the 2020 presidential race ramps up more and more democratic hopefuls are establishing their own gnd proposals senator bernie sanders recently released his campaign s gnd platform and it follows many of the previously mentioned prescriptions with more clarity any gnd proposal must include an elr fjg component to offset inflationary pressures and we need to hold politicians feet to the fire to prevent the coming climate disaster under mmt the united states would be able to fully fund and implement all provisions of a gnd we need to shift the way we think about funding a gnd proposal we do not need tax increases or budget cuts we need to find ways to allocate resources where there is room in the economy to accommodate them though it will be difficult to carefully manage the inflation risk as we transform our entire economy within a short timeframe we must restructure our thinking of this issue if we want to enact a fully implemented gnd tuition free college several states have already taken steps to provide free in state or community college tuition to its citizens however with the average cost of college for an in state school at around 25 000 per year and trade programs being decimated in primary schools college is unattainable for a large portion of our population even those who are fortunate enough to get through college are likely to come out with crippling student loan debt federal student loan debt has recently risen to over 1 6 trillion and it is growing by the day this hampers our economy and prevents debt carriers from starting families creating businesses and buying homes a study from the levy institute found student loan debt cancelation could boost gdp over a 10 year period by up to 1 08 trillion reduce the unemployment rate by up to 0 36 percentage points add up to 1 5 million new jobs per year and have an insignificant effect on inflation rates it is nearly impossible to put into context the social benefit of a higher educated population breaking the cycle of poverty and allowing anyone who wants to attend college and create a better life for themselves is one by product an increasingly educated society would inevitably lead to advances in science medicine poverty alleviation healthcare decreases in crime and boost the economy a study by the urban institute found significant reductions for those receiving welfare benefits who have a college education additionally their data show a substantial decrease in unemployment for those with a college degree versus those with a high school degree conclusion in order to facilitate truly transformative progressive policies we need to change the way we look at the federal budget if we can provide policies that include necessary resources to mitigate and cushion inflationary pressures the united states government can fund whatever is needed to usher in programs that combat climate change ensure high quality education provide a full social safety net and universal healthcare and fix our crumbling infrastructure the goal of government is to provide for its citizens the government is not a business and we need to stop thinking of it as one references modern money theory a primer on

kenyan authorities will hold discussions with the international monetary fund imf for a new stand by arrangement early next year the washington based lender has revealed this comes at a time when kenya has aggressively been carrying out a number of reforms aimed at reducing its budget deficit the difference between what it spends and what it earns in taxes besides announcing a raft of austerity measures the government has also repealed interest rate controls in what is aimed at winning over the imf experts have been quick to detect desperation by kenya to get into imf s good books after it fell out with the global lender in june 2017 following a streak of fiscal indiscipline that saw debt levels surge to unsustainable levels kenya requested for extension of the facilities as it embarked on a number of reforms but the stand by arrangement sba amounting to 989 million sh100 billion that the country had with the global lender expired in september 2018 although kenya had not drawn from the precautionary facility analysts insisted the country would have it rough in the international market without it sba is a precautionary credit facility sort of like an insurance cover that a country can draw from in case of an exogenous attack such as drought hike in global prices of oil or changes in the international financial market on friday the delegation from the imf said it will be engaging the kenyan authorities in another round of talks early next year the team led by benedict clements imf s division chief for the fiscal policy and surveillance division of the fiscal affairs department was in the country from november 18 to 22 to discuss recent economic developments and the government s reform plans another mission is planned in early 2020 to hold discussions on a new precautionary stand by arrangement and undertake the article iv consultation discussions said imf in a statement yesterday the delegation met acting national treasury cabinet secretary ukur yatani central bank of kenya governor patrick njoroge and head of the public service joseph kinyua other government officials that the imf team met included the treasury principal secretary julius muia and cbk deputy governor sheila m mbijjewe the imf officials are also said to have met other unnamed senior government and cbk officials kenyan authorities both at cbk and treasury have in the past downplayed the significance of the facility noting that the country has adequate foreign currency reserves to weather any storm the country s reserves of foreign currency as at november 21 stood at 8 779 million enough to cover imports for 5 44 months the imf team said the kenyan economy has continued to perform well noting that most of the macro economic indicators including gdp growth inflation and current account deficit were well anchored real gdp growth averaged 5 6 per cent in the first half of 2019 despite the late onset and below average rainfall that affected agriculture production growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of 2019 and 2020 said the statement inflation has remained within the target band and stood at 5 0 per cent in october year on year the current account deficit has also narrowed and foreign exchange reserves are adequate it added the conversation that has dominated most of the discussions in mainstream and social media offices and streets has been how things are tough for ordinary kenyans the government has since been called into action pushing for the payment of pending bills to stimulate the economy
u s review steady for now minutes from the october fomc meeting indicated the fed is content to remain on the sidelines for the rest of this year as the looser financial conditions resulting from rate cuts at three consecutive meetings feed through to the economy mixed reports this week about the prospects of a phase i trade deal took some of the steam out of the recent market rally we continue to expect a stalemate while recognizing the significant downside risks of a deterioration in trade negotiations housing starts and existing home sales both rose solidly in october as lower mortgage rates boost residential activity steady for now minutes from the october fomc meeting indicated the fed is content to remain on the sidelines for the rest of this year as the looser financial conditions resulting from rate cuts at three consecutive meetings feed through to the economy committee members judged the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate while recognizing that the risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the domestic economy remained prominent the 75 bps of easing has not been unanimous however as some members viewed the latest rate cut as a close call moreover the bar for further easing has been set fairly high the fed would need to see a material deterioration in the economic outlook to ease policy further the outlook at least in the eyes of financial markets did dim slightly this week after reports that the phase i trade deal may not be reached this year our outlook has not changed however as we have stuck to our assumption that additional tariffs will go into effect december 15 equity markets have been keener to buy into rumors of a deal and gave back some gains this week after reaching an all time high on monday financial conditions remain supportive however and markets do not expect another fed rate cut until the second half of next year but with the status of trade negotiations as uncertain as ever we still see scope for a cut in the first quarter with business fixed investment likely to remain weak there is a lot riding on the performance of consumer spending heading into year end yet even if the consumer sector hangs on which we expect it will we recognize the same downside risks as the fed and suspect if it were to cut again it would do so sooner rather than later particularly with the election approaching the fomc also noted that data on construction and sales suggested the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 was starting to show through to housing activity we concur housing starts rose 3 8 in october while permits surged 5 0 to the strongest pace since may 2007 some of the strength was due to a jump in the volatile multifamily segment but single family permits which are less subject to statistical noise and weatherrelated volatility have now risen for six consecutive months pointing clearly to upward momentum in residential construction existing home sales also rose nicely in october climbing 1 9 to a 5 46 million unit pace inventories are running very tight again however particularly for entry level homes where demand is strongest this in turn has pushed price appreciation higher again the median resale price rose 6 2 over the year the strongest pace since july 2017 after a solid contribution in q3 it is already looking like housing will again boost gdp growth in q4 after a year and a half of drag the next few weeks will be instructive as q4 data begin to flow in the leading economic index lei fell in october for the third straight month the first time that has happened since 2009 with trade uncertainty unlikely to be resolved soon impeachment proceedings ongoing and the memory of last year s fourth quarter fresh in mind it will be important to closely monitor incoming economic data for signs of a break in either direction u s outlook consumer confidence tuesday in october 2018 consumer confidence rose to 137 9 marking the highest level of confidence since the exuberance at the tail end of the dot com euphoria in 2000 in that earlier era the bottom fell out under confidence when the tech bubble burst and recession followed this time has been different while confidence has come off the boil since its peak last year it has remained range bound between 121 and 138 over the past 12 months in a typical cycle major drivers of confidence are the unemployment rate the stock market and gas prices the stock market remains near all time highs unemployment is near a 50 year low and gas prices have been trending lower since may it stands to reason we will see an improvement in confidence in october but with ongoing concerns about the trade war we re not banking on a return to last year s record highs previous 125 69 wells fargo 131 3

volatile transport sector we expect a slight rebound after a drop last month jobless claims will come out on wednesday a day early next week we ve seen an uptick the past couple weeks so we ll be closely watching this leading indicator to see if businesses are actually cutting back or if these past two weeks are just a blip previous 1 2 wells fargo 0 7 consensus 0 5 month over month personal

for october similar to the flattening trend seen in consumer confidence spending is still growing but at a slower rate retail sales for october have already been released and retailers reported a 0 3 increase though some of that improvement was attributable to rising prices still a number of retailers have beat expectations in recent corporate earnings reports we are looking for an above consensus gain in spending though the real inflation adjusted spending number will be smaller fed watchers will pay attention to the core pce deflator number which we expect to see come in at 1 4 year over year if realized this would likely not have a meaningful impact on fed expectations we think the fomc will sit tight and leave rates unchanged at its december 11 meeting previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 4

despite an increase in the country s vat the implementation of free preschool education helped offset the vat s upward pressure on the consumer price index as the data continue to come out it appears increasingly likely the fourth quarter will be yet another quarter of weak butpositive economic growth in the u k and the eurozone usmca getting close canadian inflation held steady this week with headline cpi and two of the three core measures tracked by the bank of canada boc all holding steady relative to last month on a year over year basis inflation in canada has held firm in the middle of the boc s target band of 1 3 which has in part explained why the central bank has kept policy rates on hold this year unlike other developed market central banks like the fed and ecb that said economic growth has been wobbly a topic we cover on the next page and trade uncertainty remains a challenge for canada encouragingly the outlook for usmca has improved of late with key democratic leaders in the u s house of representatives signaling that they could sign off on the trade pact soon perhaps even by year end though we doubt it could be voted on that quickly the trump administration can send the legislative text to congress at any time but once it does it will trigger a clock that requires it to be voted on in the house and senate within 90 legislative days thus the trump administration appears to be waiting to start the clock until it has assurances from democratic leaders that the measure will pass the democratic led house once a deal between the two parties is struck the actual vote may not need the full 90 day allotment should the usmca become law the economic and financial market impact would likely be larger for canada and mexico than it would be for the united states in our view core inflation in japan remained tepid in october at just 0 3 year over year while low inflation is nothing new in japan some had expected a bigger jump given that japan increased its value added tax vat to 10 from 8 on october 1 when japan increased its vat to 8 from 5 in 2014 inflation skyrocketed albeit temporarily to its highest level in decades top chart why was there not a similar move this time the tax increase was smaller this time obviously but that still led to some large increases in prices furniture and household utensil prices rose 2 5 over the month for example and clothes and footwear prices rose 1 6 the vat was not the only policy change taking effect on october 1 as free preschool education was also implemented last month in japan accordingly the education component of the japanese cpi fell 8 4 offsetting much of the upward boost from the vat preliminary data on the purchasing managers indices for the eurozone and the u k were released this morning and showed tepid growth environments remained in place in november in the eurozone the weaker manufacturing sector showed some mild improvement as the manufacturing pmi rose to 46 6 from 45 9 in october middle chart the pmi for the larger service sector however dipped to 51 5 the lowest reading since january the story was not much different in the u k the manufacturing pmi rose but remained below 50 while the services component fell to its lowest level since july 2016 when the brexit vote occurred bottom chart as the data continue to come out it appears increasingly likely the fourth quarter will be yet another quarter of weak but positive economic growth in the u k and the eurozone global outlook eurozone cpi friday core inflation in the eurozone continues to muddle along near 1 on the one hand it is encouraging that core cpi inflation has been more or less flat over the past year given the economic weakness across the eurozone over that period but with both headline and core inflation still well shy of the european central bank s 2 target the central bank likely remains far from reversing the extraordinarily easy monetary policy that currently prevails in the eurozone in fact we expect another 10 bps cut from the ecb in december as new president christine lagarde signals her willingness to do whatever it takes to revive growth and inflation across europe in our view a large scale fiscal stimulus led by germany would do more to revive the european economy than additional monetary policy easing at this point in time thus far only modest fiscal easing has been forthcoming in most eurozone countries previous 0 7 consensus 0 9 year over year india q3 gdp friday the indian economy usually one of the world s fastest growing has not been immune to the global growth slowdown real gdp growth in the second quarter was just 5 0 year over year the slowest pace since q1 2013 private domestic demand was relatively weak with consumption and gross fixed capital formation rising 3 1 and 4 0 year over year respectively indian policymakers at both the fiscal and monetary levels have taken steps to stimulate the economy the reserve bank of india has cut its main policy rates 110 bps this year while prime minister modi enacted corporate tax cuts back in september on the spending side fiscal policy is already fairly stimulative government final consumption rose 8 8 yearover year in q2 2019 while growth seems unlikely to improve much in q3 2019 we do expect more central bank easing in the coming quarters and anticipate that the indian economy will accelerate in 2020 previous 5 0 wells fargo 5 2 consensus 4 6 year over year canada q3 gdp friday economic growth in canada was a robust 3 7 on a quarter overquarter annualized basis in q2 but the strength was somewhat misleading exports accounted for essentially all of the gain as some modest growth in consumption was offset by a contraction in gross fixed capital formation at its october 30 meeting the bank of canada said that it expected growth to slow in the second half of the year to a rate below potential blaming uncertainty associated with trade conflicts and continuing adjustment in the energy sector encouragingly the boc also noted that housing activity is picking up in most markets housing is an ever present threat given canada s hot real estate market and high household debt levels in this cycle of late housing starts and resales have been particularly robust in quebec and ontario where labor markets have been strong we expect economic growth to be around 1 5 2 0 over the next few quarters in canada previous 3 7 wells fargo 1 3 quarter over quarter annualized point of view interest rate watch lower maybe negative unlikely minutes released this week for the october fomc meeting underscored the notion that officials are fairly comfortable with the current stance of policy and see no imminent need to adjust rates after 75 bps of easing since july despite some very public pressure from president trump there appears to be a high bar for further rate cuts let alone a foray into negative rates in the near future it was clear that the additional cut in october had less support than the prior two rate reductions while risks to the outlook remained elevated they had diminished to an extent at the same time the stilldecent performance of growth the lagged effect of prior easing and concerns about financial imbalances led some members to favor leaving policy unchanged these factors also contributed to most participants thinking policy is now well calibrated to the current environment and appearing comfortable with keeping policy on hold unless the outlook changes materially as part of the federal reserve s ongoing review of its policy strategy and toolkit participants discussed the potential benefits and risks of negative rates in the united states the minutes showed little appetite for the tool at the moment concerns about distortions to the u s financial system and lending to businesses and households led all participants to consider negative rates an unattractive policy tool at present fed officials did not fully rule out their use in the future however after all they have provided some marginal accommodation in other countries as fed staff noted at the meeting but as we have discussed before negative rates look likely to be employed last among the fed s potential tools come the next downturn while not without their own faults or risks officials viewed the use of forward guidance and asset purchases as having worked favorably since the financial crisis when it comes to new tools capping rates on treasury yields through asset purchases known as yield curve control looked to have garnered more interest and may be tried before pushing the fed funds rate into negative territory credit market insights financial sector appears resilient in its latest financial stability report the federal reserve concluded there were no immediate threats stemming from the u s financial system and that overall risks were fairly moderate vulnerabilities were said to have been little changed since the fed s last assessment in may and the largest risks were cited to be coming from abroad such as brexit and other geopolitical concerns elevated asset prices were identified as a vulnerability particularly for commercial real estate and farmland but after accounting for low treasury yields risk appetite was considered in line with historical norms in terms of debt household borrowing has grown roughly in line with gdp and is considered at only a modest level relative to income but record high levels of corporate debt were identified as a growing concern particularly the runup at the lowest end of the credit spectrum we have shared in the fed s concern about corporate debt and direct interested readers to topic of the week for more detail overall leverage in the financial sector was considered to be low with the largest u s banks strongly capitalized capital is expected to decrease somewhat as some banks have announced plans to distribute capital to shareholders banks remain well positioned to lend and credit quality of bank loans remains strong funding risk also continues to be modest u s financial conditions remain ok with no areas identified as imminent threats to the stability of the economy topic of the week is corporate debt about to rear its ugly head the buildup in debt among companies in the nonfinancial corporate nfc sector has continued to prompt concerns that these firms may threaten the sustainability of the current expansion at 46 7 of gdp non financial corporate debt stands at its highest level on record while increasing leverage does permit some cause for concern large amounts of debt alone are unlikely to tip the economy into recession that being said in the next downturn the burden of high debt levels could stymie the subsequent recovery eye popping debt levels can often grab headlines like the 3 6 trillion in debt added by the nfc sector over the last decade it is companies ability to service this debt however which is arguably more important in a recent special report we provided an update to our corporate financial health index which incorporates eight metrics of financial health for the nfc sector the index has continued to move lower since we first developed it a year ago but looking under the hood one can see why the alarm bells are not sounding quite yet in general companies still appear able to afford their debt load the interest coverage ratio which measures how much cash flow nfcs produce to service their debts has worsened but remains at a decent level furthermore it seems unlikely that it will deteriorate substantially in the near future for this to occur one would need to see a reversal of the fed s recent monetary easing leading to higher interest rates or a meaningful deterioration in corporate earnings which seems unlikely barring a broader economic downturn beyond earnings many companies also have cash on hand that they can use to cover their borrowing costs in fact liquid assets have soared to a record 4 5 trillion over the past decade while this has put companies in a better position than they would be otherwise it has not been able to offset increasing debt looking at the chart on the right one can see that the net debt to ebit ratio has worsened over the past few years altogether these metrics suggest that while the nfc sector may not instigate the next recession they are not in a great position to weather the economic hardship
kenyan authorities will hold discussions with the international monetary fund imf for a new stand by arrangement early next year the washington based lender has revealed this comes at a time when kenya has aggressively been carrying out a number of reforms aimed at reducing its budget deficit the difference between what it spends and what it earns in taxes besides announcing a raft of austerity measures the government has also repealed interest rate controls in what is aimed at winning over the imf experts have been quick to detect desperation by kenya to get into imf s good books after it fell out with the global lender in june 2017 following a streak of fiscal indiscipline that saw debt levels surge to unsustainable levels kenya requested for extension of the facilities as it embarked on a number of reforms but the stand by arrangement sba amounting to 989 million sh100 billion that the country had with the global lender expired in september 2018 although kenya had not drawn from the precautionary facility analysts insisted the country would have it rough in the international market without it sba is a precautionary credit facility sort of like an insurance cover that a country can draw from in case of an exogenous attack such as drought hike in global prices of oil or changes in the international financial market on friday the delegation from the imf said it will be engaging the kenyan authorities in another round of talks early next year the team led by benedict clements imf s division chief for the fiscal policy and surveillance division of the fiscal affairs department was in the country from november 18 to 22 to discuss recent economic developments and the government s reform plans another mission is planned in early 2020 to hold discussions on a new precautionary stand by arrangement and undertake the article iv consultation discussions said imf in a statement yesterday the delegation met acting national treasury cabinet secretary ukur yatani central bank of kenya governor patrick njoroge and head of the public service joseph kinyua other government officials that the imf team met included the treasury principal secretary julius muia and cbk deputy governor sheila m mbijjewe the imf officials are also said to have met other unnamed senior government and cbk officials kenyan authorities both at cbk and treasury have in the past downplayed the significance of the facility noting that the country has adequate foreign currency reserves to weather any storm the country s reserves of foreign currency as at november 21 stood at 8 779 million enough to cover imports for 5 44 months the imf team said the kenyan economy has continued to perform well noting that most of the macro economic indicators including gdp growth inflation and current account deficit were well anchored real gdp growth averaged 5 6 per cent in the first half of 2019 despite the late onset and below average rainfall that affected agriculture production growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of 2019 and 2020 said the statement inflation has remained within the target band and stood at 5 0 per cent in october year on year the current account deficit has also narrowed and foreign exchange reserves are adequate it added the conversation that has dominated most of the discussions in mainstream and social media offices and streets has been how things are tough for ordinary kenyans the government has since been called into action pushing for the payment of pending bills to stimulate the economy
interestingly enough argentina appeared to be falling off a precipice that was more a self inflicted wound than a consequence of broader socio historic tendencies such was argentina s fate that in the early years of mauricio macri s presidency the country was seen as the frontrunner in overturning more than a decade of leftist populism in the region much to the acclaim of the hegemonic western powers as quickly as macri s and argentina s star lit up it fell to the lowest of the low and argentina once again became the laughing stock of the world on the verge of a new sovereign debt default at the hands of the international monetary fund alas as latin america unexpectedly went up in flames in a matter of weeks the nation that will soon be presided by the tandem alberto fernández cristina fernández de kirchner is glowing bright again one of the only countries in the region not in imminent risk of social eruption the us state department has made it clear that despite fernández s characterisations of the global superpower as an old school supporter of military coups in third world countries it considers argentina a strategic democratic ally in the region with which it very much wants to engage with the imf indicating it is willing to play ball some economists are even postulating that under certain conditions including an auspicious renegotiation of argentina s large sovereign debt pile with the imf and private creditors that mainly congregate in wall street the third largest economy in latin amercia could quickly thrive on the back of a social pact which seems to defy the laws of gravity or at least economics yet what argentina faces is much more profound than facing its own internal demons alberto one such minor demon and cristina a queen demon of sorts had already run the show during more auspicious times showing that it is possible to have a nation grow macro economically in this godforsaken land rich with natural resources and educated workers macri a different but equally dangerous type of demon did manage to generate hope and even economic growth through a plan that could have worked but ended up imploding catastrophically together and with the expectations that the renewed pan peronist front generates among pundits at least in argentina they demonstrate that it is not a matter of right or left macrista or peronista but that deeper forces are at work without looking to go into an ontological analysis of latin american political economy it is important to put the recent flare up into context the 2000s saw a consolidation of power in a group of democratically elected leftist populists across the continent leaders who espoused a distrust and even hatred of the united states which they blamed for the spread of a wicked form of capitalism dubbed neoliberalism that exacerbated income inequality these leaders many of whom participated in failed coups in the past others who had been jailed by vicious military dictatorships backed by the us during the cold war and some that simply sat on the sidelines of national politics until it was their time helped raise millions of latin americans out of poverty through the implementation of progressive economic policies including the distribution of social plans and subsidies particularly of transport costs the strong economic growth of several major south american countries in the 2000s such as argentina and brazil both of which had suffered tremendous economic crises and devaluations toward the end of the 20th century was fuelled by a commodities super cycle sparked by china and south east asia with ferocious appetite for raw materials the kirchners and lulas of the continent focused on instant gratification using the billions of dollars reaped from agricultural exports mining duties and other commodities based exploitation to further their own political agendas allowing for the generation of bloated bureaucracies mass corruption and large fiscal deficits eventually cracks in the populist economic model along with intolerance against dissidence and a hatred of the free press by these presidents who sought to perpetuate themselves in power pushed the population to the other side of the spectrum pro market candidates campaigning on deficit correction global integration and a respect for institutions took the continent yet the global dynamics had changed china s growth had already begun to slow down a process which continues as its middle and upper classes evolve while the global financial crisis of 2008 helped cement the financialisation of the global economy with extreme easy money policies in the united states and the european union causing powerful capital flow disruptions across emerging market economies as investors chase yield the decadence of western capitalism has begun to express itself ever more clearly since the 2008 crisis with the thwarting of social mobility and the consolidation of powerful global elites consisting of ultra high net worth individuals and companies on the sidelines remain the majority of the world particularly in poor regions such as latin america today our continent faces the impossible task of becoming competitive on a global scale with an absolute lack of infrastructure limited credit cramped capital investment for decades and galloping inequality that has given birth to a generation of young people stuck in the poverty trap living on the outskirts of our major urban centres inept bureaucracies corruption and retrograde economic schemes incentivise the dollarisation of portfolios before productive investment as jaime durán barba explained in a recent column for perfil smartphones and social networks have given the coup de grace to traditional political analysis based on 20th century categories today s social protests have no real leaders no concrete demands and no easy mechanisms for deactivation they are the expression of diverse groups of people united by the incapacity of their nations and region as a whole to truly improve their lot with chile and bolivia in flames ecuador already having exploded venezuela in a humanitarian crisis that competes with syria the rest of the region is scared colombia is beginning to shake and some question whether jair bolsonaro can conduct brazil through these turbulent seas

the world s fastest growing large economy to something more like a rumbling indian railway train in the quarter to june growth slipped to 5 which is the slowest rate in six years other indicators are more worrying sales of trucks and buses fell 45 in the year to september and even sales of cheap biscuits and soap have contracted the 88 drop in overall credit flows to businesses in the two quarters to september compared with the same period last year suggests a virtual freeze on lending amid the slowdown modi still managed to get himself re elected in may with a huge majority as the summer wore on however it became clearer that the economy had turned against modi even if the electorate had not the big question now is whether the downturn will be bad enough to force the prime minister into some of the much needed reforms that he avoided in his first term some changes have started to be made in the past few months on september 20th the government abruptly decreed a sharp cut in corporate tax from an effective rate of 35 to a far more competitive 25 the move prompted mumbai s biggest stock market leap in a decade the market s instant oversized joy suggests two things one is that there is a great deal of pent up energy in the indian economy waiting to be released by wiser government policies the other is that if modi s government puts in some effort it is capable of coming up with those wiser policies businesses are watching to see what will follow there are rumors of a sweeping privatization drive but it is unclear whether modi s reforming side can override his conservatism which reflexively favors an interventionist state protectionist trade policies the opinions of hindutva trade unions small business lobbies and ideologues during his first term modi has done some welcome reforms which include changes in bankruptcy law and implementation of gst the biggest tax reform since india became independence in 1947 the gst did for all its paperwork abolish absurd

muscat minister of commerce and industry and the deputy chairman of the supreme council for planning he dr ali bin masoud al sunaidi has said that oman s gross domestic product gdp at current prices had crossed omr30 billion by the end of 2018 in an exclusive interview with times and shabiba fm the minister said in 1999 the gdp was about omr4 5 billion where the contribution of oil activities was omr2 15 billion while the non oil contribution was omr2 5 billion in 2005 the gdp was omr11 9 billion and for the first time the contribution of the non oil sectors jumped to omr5 7 billion and from 2010 to 2018 the gdp increased from omr21 9 billion to about omr30 5 billion last year omr20 6 billion came from non oil activities and omr11 billion came from oil based activities non oil activities increased from about omr2 5 billion in 1998 to omr20 6 billion in 2018 within a span of 20 years we hope that in the coming years the contribution of non oil activities will double again which is what has happened during the last 20 years the minister explained that the oil sector contributed about 35 per cent of the gdp while the non oil sectors provided the remaining 65 per cent the most precious product of the sultanate during the past few years has of course been oil and gas therefore the contribution of oil and gas to the gdp is about 30 to 35 per cent previously this contribution stood at about 50 per cent this does not mean that we are satisfied and that the oil sector will continue to remain in this state the oil and gas sector will have price challenges in the future and what we rely on now are the sectors of industry tourism mining fisheries logistics services and e commerce he added media the oil crisis dr ali bin masoud al sunaidi explained that the previous dip in oil prices did have a significant impact on the omani economy the oil crisis had a significant impact in 2014 at the end of 2014 and early 2015 we saw a decline in oil s contribution to the gdp which dropped from omr31 billion to omr26 5 billion in 2015 and this for us was a significant dip the government had no solution but to continue to borrow so that it could complete major projects such as roads airports ports and other such undertakings he added however that other sectors had contributed to help the gdp reach omr30 5 billion by the end of 2018 pointing out that the construction sector especially during the past three years was the most affected but this sector had shown signs of stability during the first half of 2019 and was not expected to incur significant losses the construction sector was affected because it relied on government funding through government projects that are nearing completion by the end of the current five year plan said al sunaidi the construction sector has a close relationship with the real estate sector and a major corrective movement occurred in the real estate sector in the form of decline in rents from commercial and real estate activities international companies looking for warehouses and offices are now looking at oman as a favoured place to set up operations the sector that was not affected by the oil crisis is the commercial sector as well as activities involving hotels and restaurants he went on to say we have noticed the stability and continued growth of these sectors over the last three years the minister pointed out that the recent oil crisis is different from that which took place in 2008 and 1998 while the world was affected by the first downturn the latter led to a global liquidity problem the current crisis is impacting the oil producing countries economic diversification dr al sunaidi however said that the government s economic diversification is not a reaction to the current economic conditions adding that this was a programme that the authorities had been working on for a long time you cannot build a giant city the size of duqm with just a reaction he said the sultanate s decision to establish an integrated city over an area of 2 000 square kilometres and 60 kilometres of duqm s beaches was not a short term one the decision to establish the sohar industrial zone and its nearby free zone the salalah port and raysut industrial zone the expansion of the muscat international airport and the salalah international airport and the construction of an airport in sohar were not a reaction but part of the 2020 plan to further highlight this the minister of commerce and industry pointed out that when compared to the gdp in 1999 which stood at only omr4 5 billion oman s gdp had reached omr30 billion by the end of 2018 of which oil only contributed 35 per cent an indication that economic diversification plans had indeed been in place for a long time the behaviour and reaction of all countries as a result of this great decline in oil prices didn t take into account that the oil sector would not recover in a short time as compared to previous occasions said the minister in addition the alternative sources of energy have become cheaper if you were to look at solar and wind energy there are many modern technologies that help harness this energy a third factor is china s low growth and the unfavourable trade situation between china and america and between america and europe he went on to add exports have not been allowed to expand to aid the recovery of the oil sector therefore now our role is to improve the use of the economic zones in sohar salalah and duqm and to expand the businesses that are owned and managed by young omanis discussing the sultanate s position in international reports that were previously published as well as the global rankings of the country al sunaidi said that there were two important reports to which the government paid close attention as they had been compiled by skilled and competent teams in the latest world bank report the sultanate jumped 10 places and achieved a ranking of 68 out of 190 countries monitored by the world bank he explained the sultanate ranks 47th globally in terms of providing building permits but there are six institutions that must approve these permits and more work needs to be done to reduce the steps in order to receive such a permit but we are ranked 144th out of 190 countries in terms of access to credit in the current financial circumstances therefore this has put pressure on us but if we can jump to 30th or 40th rank and we will continue to progress the pressure will ease if we jump 10 places the sultanate of oman increased its ranking in the world economic forum s 2018 report where it reached 47th place in 2019 we are ranked 53rd out of 140 countries this is unsatisfactory for us but when we look at the reasons that led to this we find that our financial ranking dropped from 60 to 139 this indicator is due to the state of credit and borrowing experienced by the sultanate in contrast we are free of terrorism we are the first in the world in terms of the low rate of inflation we are the sixth in the world in terms of the low impact of organised crime on our actions and we are the seventh in the world in the efficiency of the legal framework in the settlement of disputes and long term planning we have made it easy to invest as it works now through a very large system linked to eight parties even though we have 75 organisations that deal with this with the completion of the entire investment framework all of these parties must provide their facilities through the invest easy programme public debt bill regarding the sultanate s public debt the minister of commerce and industry said that oman s public debt is divided into two parts the first part is the development budget as the sultanate continued to spend omr1 2 billion annually during as part of its development plans in addition to what is spent by government companies while there are still invoices for other obligations needed by the state including salaries and subsidies that are still ongoing in addition there are some services that the sultanate did away with while the real cost of all economic and social programmes must be taken into account he went on to say there are many suggestions provided by the international monetary fund imf but the sultanate selects only those from them that it feels will help the nation not all of the suggestions added al sunaidi the imf looks at the financial details without partiality but when we talk about economic policy we have to take into account the financial side of things as well as other issues oil producing countries rely heavily on government spending and if government spending is lessened it will quickly affect the growth of the economy the latest trends involve partnerships that are made possible internationally due to recent economic laws that get rid of the idea of the government being the sole financier to give way to innovative financing means to replace the government s role in building and financing a lot of projects especially in the service sector said the minister industrial sector regarding the industrial sector ali al sunaidi said the industrial sector contributed more than omr5 5 billion to the gdp by the end of 2018 with its contribution being more than the gdp of the oil and non oil sectors as a whole with it being omr4 5 billion 20 years ago it is one of the five important sectors that the government relies on during the current and the next five year plan but the industrial sector is subject to many problems and hardships because the countries of the world have begun to adopt a protectionist approach there are two problems faced by the industrial sector in any country in the region he said the first is the protectionist approach and non compliance with the wto decisions therefore these industries face great problems when exporting to countries that have adopted protectionism as their method the other concern is the use of dumping as a pricing policy we started to see this behaviour from asian countries when it came to us and the other gcc countries and the gcc countries took some decisions to protect their industries for one or two years unfortunately we are now seeing groups of countries such as the arab countries and the gulf states whose factories have begun to use price dumping for each others products there are factories from one country that sell their products in other countries after lowering their prices by 20 per cent and this is what we refer to as dumping explained the minister now in oman we are looking for a way to protect our factories from this dumping because of its long term damage and the acquisition of a high percentage of the market by these factories we call on the omani consumer to realise that his purchase of the omani product will create direct jobs within the factory and create indirect jobs outside it he said many countries are importing omani products and we need to sell in these markets at very competitive prices in order to acquire stakes in their market talking about industrial diversification ali al sunaidi said the sultanate has been able to make leaps in the petrochemical industry and is expanding in this sector the octal company in salalah for example is producing goods for prestigious companies in new york this industry is based on the value added to other products in the country as for food industries his excellency said food industries for us are strategic and the sultanate s orientation now is to expand significantly its food industries such as meat dates dairy and others production is often costly but beneficial to provide minimum food security and dairy is a very important example of this the quality of our products gives it an additional advantage through which we can sell more volumes of products in many markets such as ethiopia kenya and tanzania the sultanate is among those countries that are very strict in its specifications and standards as well as its veterinary and agricultural quarantine practices oman does good work in the industrial sector and our omani consumers appreciate and value locally made products 4th industrial revolution his excellency reviewed a number of innovative projects for omani youth of both genders he stressed that what would happen to the omani economy over the next 20 years will be different from the experiences of the past because there are now several aspiring young omanis who are currently working on innovative projects that they own an entrepreneurial environment started from the time a meeting was held at saih al shamkhat in bahla where the setting up of the omani development bank was approved with projects such as intilaaqah and riyada being established later in addition there were changes in the country s laws and special provisions for smes in the form of exceptions to certain rules and the provision of financial benefits provided their ceo is a full time omani employee the government also works to provide incubators and accelerators to help these businesses when it came to the cumulative growth of smes registered in 2015 there were 18 597 establishments while in 2019 there were 41 926 enterprises in which about 11 000 people were working full time in addition to 4 100 permanent omani staff at these smes remote working and working online is coming up and what we need is a law that regulates this said al sunaidi there are currently discussions between the ministry of commerce and industry the ministry of manpower and the public authority for social insurance we have taken the experience of morocco and this is now being studied by riyada so that it can be applied in the sultanate to protect those who spend their hours working online there are days particularly during eid and other holidays on which we have ministry of commerce and industry employees working online in the future our skills will be the foundation of all our work he said this is why the sultanate has decided to spend two years as part of a global system led by the world economic forum titled future skills we do not want to be far from what will happen in the world and we must not be afraid of the changes in the future but we must be concerned if we don t do anything to adapt to these changes therefore the sultanate has chosen to be part of this important programme and we will publish the results of our work next january institutions must retrain their employees to do work that will be required in the future because they will lose their previous jobs economic laws his excellency said that the public private partnership law the privatisation law the foreign capital investment law and the bankruptcy law would all bring radical changes to the sultanate the foreign capital investment law will not make it obligatory for investors to have the omr150 000 required in his company s account to set up a business in the sultanate this opens the door for all who wish to establish a business in the sultanate to come here easily explained al sunaidi what these laws will do is protect some of the licences that will be reserved only for omanis there will be a list of these activities that will be determined by the council of ministers and will change when needed and allow foreign investors to come to the sultanate without a broker the foreign capital investment law requires a feasibility study which confirms that the investor is keen and capable for the project he will be undertaking and that licences are granted because he is serious in starting this project this gives the investor some preferential treatment and allows him to use that land which has been allocated to his business which will see him capable of using the land for the long term and will involve the registration of some assets in his company added the minister this is a very important law that will be subject to control during the first years of its implementation to ensure that those who are affected by the law can adjust to it much like the other laws that have been previously brought in the bankruptcy law will lessen the risks because if the trader believes that his business has not succeeded after many years of operation he now has the ability to get rid of that business through the bankruptcy law provided that he has declared bankruptcy for genuine reasons and not just so that he can evade taxes or avoid paying the debts he owes to others said al sunaidi on the partnership and privatisation law the minister said previously there was privatisation in the country and there was a partnership between the government and the private sector but it was based on separate laws namely the telecommunications law or the electricity law or through an advertising agreement this new law will protect the rights of government agencies and investors the consumer is also protected by a clear and explicit law that makes you deal with the state and not one of its institutions he pointed out that the next five year plan would not stop investments in the sultanate s resources in the oil and gas sector with more investment planned as he added if the market is in need of such services projects will not stop just because government funding does not exist the funding instead will come from local and international institutions where the investment law protects international institutions and the partnership and privatisation law protects local and international institutions in their dealings with government institutions the laws will begin to take effect before the start of the tenth five year plan in 2021 where we have an opportunity in 2020 to make sure that these laws and regulations are sound enough to launch the next five year plan said the minister the tenth five year plan his excellency said that the concerned teams had started work on the tenth five year plan in collaboration with many of the government institutions that had allocated two or three individuals each and with omani youth seconded from local and international private institutions he pointed out that the next five year plan would not rely solely on the availability of government funding but will take into account the aspects of innovative financing and thus will use the laws and allocated to projects a large share of non governmental funding he said the five year plan took into account the many governorates and it will create the kind of acceleration required among the governorates because it depends on the outputs as needed for oman s future vision 2040 which was done at the governorate level and depends on urban planning strategies thus each governorate in the sultanate and each minister will have to determine the projects of the ministry in that governorate and mention those that need government support government subsidies may not be provided in the initial investment but will also involve paying the difference between the return provided by that project and the cost that can be paid by the citizen this form of payment will be different from the practices employed in the past and will reflect a change from that mode of operation the privatisation and expansion of some government facilities such as sewage plants will be accelerated said al sunaidi the next five year plan will talk about the transfer and management of certain facilities by the private sector and the investment required therein these are just a few features of this plan which will be announced next year after being approved by the council of ministers it is derived from vision 2040 and takes into account the results of the urban strategy the minister stressed that the sultanate had been able to gradually complete infrastructure projects through the optimal use of its financial resources from the oil and gas sector oil and gas still finances 70 per cent of our needs although the gdp comes from the non oil sector the revenue that serves us comes from oil and gas in the next phase any money we get must go to large projects and pay the debt that the state had to borrow during the current five year plan to meet its obligations in some projects while we are a developing country how could we provide services such as electricity and water during all these years if they were not part of the sultanate s plan he said one of the many things that impressed the united nations about the sultanate is that in 1970 the average life expectancy was about 58 years and in 2018 the sultanate had an expectancy of 78 years this was a result of the development of infrastructure and the sultanate s wise policy of non entry into conflicts and wars from his majesty the sultan came the need to spread hospitals throughout the sultanate improve public hygiene across municipalities bring education clean water and electricity into each house while the gdp doubled between 1998 and 2018 it did not come from a vacuum of nothingness but as a result of the activation of the five year plans over the past years we hope to achieve more than that which the state budget expects to be supported by non oil sectors but we must see exemptions granted in income tax customs and fee exemptions as other productive sectors did not pay royalties and did not pay the fair price of electricity over the years not long ago our factories paid 70 cents per million btus and now they have gradually started paying 3 and 4 gradually in previous years the price of gas was much higher than 70 and there were countries that charged 15 for it but we stayed at 3 these subsidies should stay because the industry sector is estimated to contribute omr5 5 billion in 2018 and this balance is required the next five year plan has many challenges because the competition has become intense and the global economic situation over the next two or three years is unclear explained ali al sunaidi
this pre inauguration series on regional trouble spots is proceeding with the time of origin and the immediacy of the crisis in inverse proportion which is perhaps an indication of how short a fuse these outbreaks often have in the last fortnight we have looked at chile and bolivia both right at the top of the news with ecuador today s subject before turning our attention to uruguay not a trouble spot but well worth a column with tomorrow s run off and concluding with peru in the pre inauguration weekend but the temporal sequence has been the exact opposite of this order this latest spate of crises began in peru in late september when president martín vizcarra dissolved a hostile congress by decree before trouble moved north to ecuador with the backlash against fuel prices hiked at the start of october more on this below on october 6 chile edged up its metropolitan subway fares the catalyst for a protest which mushroomed from a few hundred students to a million people in less than three weeks but before the first mass march in santiago bolivia had already erupted in the wake of its highly suspect october 20 elections put not your trust in princes psalm 146 tells us and perhaps one lesson from ecuador for argentina might be not to put your faith in vice presidents either alberto fernández take note including ones in wheelchairs this in no way refers to the outgoing veep gabriela michetti here but to ecuador s lenín moreno immobilised since being shot by car thieves in early 1998 with irreversible spinal damage vice president for the first six years of rafael correa s decade in power 2007 2017 moreno emerged as the successor rather than then vice president jorge glas because the latter was dogged by corruption charges including the odebrecht scandal extending over the entire region which did not stop correa from installing him as moreno s running mate and watchdog but since becoming president in 2017 moreno has belied his unusual first name by being far more of a counterrevolutionary than a revolutionary in reversing the populist correa decade and just to complete the circle of mistrust in vice presidents he saw glas sent to prison for the next six years on odebrecht related charges within five months of their inauguration in argentine terms moreno would be broadly comparable to 2015 presidential candidate daniel scioli here as the resisted surrogate of a long serving president unable to clinch another term with the difference that he won his run off by 2 3 percent whereas scioli lost his by 2 6 percent as both men had to battle considerable voter fatigue with lengthy regimes such regimes including not only a decade of correa and 12 years of kirchnerism but also over two decades of bolivarian rule in venezuela 14 years of evo morales in bolivia ended for now and of the frente amplio in uruguay at stake tomorrow and 13 years of the partido do trabalho in brazil are often simplistically grouped together under the blanket term of populist but all they really have in common is their length thus we saw last week how the undeniable authoritarian streak of ego morales and his highly populist rhetoric were accompanied by economic and fiscal policies which were far from irresponsible by the same token correa s anti imperialistic posturing becomes relative when it is considered that he maintained the united states dollar adopted at the turn of the century as his country s currency throughout his decade in power his economics doctorate comes from illinois it might be added furthermore no latin american president has done more to upgrade education than correa even if the progress lies more in expanding access than improving quality in the 30 months of his presidency moreno has clashed with the correa heritage from the start confronting first the policies and then the man himself he questioned correa s pursuit of state domination seeking dialogue with opposition leaders the private sector and the press while promoting policies of fiscal austerity and a more open economy moreno gave high priority to fighting corruption which also helped him to dump his pro correa vicepresident quickly apart from general policy two highly symbolic moves flagged the change of direction one was exit from both the venezuelan led alba and unasur in the last 15 months even though quito was the capital of the latter this entailed sending the statue of the late néstor kirchner into storage among other things while seeking entry into the pacific alliance the other was ending seven years of asylum for wikileaks hacker julian assange at ecuador s london embassy last easter almost from the start all this was criticised by correa from the distance of his wife s belgian homeland where he moved in mid 2017 the fuel price hikes sparking last month s unrest need to be placed in a broader context pursuing a broadly similar pro market path to mauricio macri here with the same preference for debt over deficit equally led moreno to the international monetary fund once global credit tightened last february moreno signed an extended fund facility agreement for us 4 2 billion topping us 10 billion with world bank and other loans freeing petrol and diesel prices to approximate international levels last month which had actually started 15 months ago around the time ecuador left alba in august 2018 was thus part of a broader austerity package which sparked the protests not just the withdrawal of fuel subsidies although these alone saved the government some us 1 5 billion at the expense of the consumer the backlash plunged ecuador into total chaos for 10 days or more following hundreds of arrests amid widespread looting moreno decreed a state of emergency on october 4 deploying the army but nothing could restore order and he switched the capital to guayaquil even with more violence there than most cities leaving quito under total curfew for at least five days despite vowing never to yield moreno was obliged to start negotiating with indigenous groups by october 13 finally backtracking on the notorious decree 883 to scrap fuel subsidies today ecuador is off the international radar but these negotiations continue over other austerity sacrifices with decree 883 now repealed these negotiations may not stop at the relationship with the imf but might even challenge a dollarisation now approaching two decades a dollarisation more explicit than argentina s with the greenback actually the currency
executive summary although the eurozone economy has picked up in recent weeks there are still signs that growth remains weak in our view the economy needs to show more concrete signs of stabilization before we call the all clear on recession risks given the overall softness in the eurozone economy we expect the european central bank ecb to cut rates an additional 10 bps to 0 60 at its december policy meeting eurozone economy walking the tightrope market sentiment toward the eurozone economy has slowly started to turn more positive or less negative in recent weeks eurozone gdp rose 0 2 quarter over quarter in q3 more than expected and germany unexpectedly avoided a technical recession while industrial output posted a surprise gain in september however this morning s pmi data for november are a reminder that the eurozone economy remains extremely weak the composite pmi fell to 50 3 amid a drop in the services pmi to 51 5 although the manufacturing pmi edged up to 46 6 these data suggest q4 gdp growth will be quite weak in the eurozone perhaps just barely positive the key issue in our view is still the interplay between manufacturing weakness and resilience in the services sector it is hardly a secret that the manufacturing sector has been the primary source of the eurozone s woes just as we have seen in other major developed economies the scale of the divergence between services and manufacturing has been stark as the manufacturing pmi fell more than six points below the services pmi in october although that gap narrowed a bit in november figure 1 we doubt divergence on this scale will last much longer either the manufacturing sector must recover or the services sector and economy more broadly risks being dragged into recession fortunately there are some tentative signs that the manufacturing sector is stabilizing and for now we expect a manufacturing recovery rather than a services sector collapse for one we have seen an uptick in manufacturing pmi readings for both the eurozone and germany the latter of which has been the primary source of malaise of late we are also encouraged by recent data on new orders for manufactured goods a leading indicator of production while the latest data show that manufacturing orders in aggregate may not have bottomed yet there are more encouraging signs beneath the surface first orders for capital goods which tend to be the most forward looking indicator of demand within total orders have shown more stability in recent months than total orders figure 2 on previous page moreover slicing the data a different way foreign demand for eurozone manufactures has also steadied in recent months a sign that stabilization in global growth more broadly may be starting to feed through to the eurozone economy meanwhile hard data in the services sector continue to show signs of resilience wage growth remains fairly solid and above 2 year over year based on most measures while core inflation has essentially been stuck at 1 year over year for the past few years implying sturdy real income gains to be sure employment gains have slowed meaningfully but the jobless rate has continued on a downward trend throughout the year amid this constructive consumer backdrop retail sales have actually accelerated in recent months despite ongoing weakness in other parts of the economy however our concern is that while the eurozone economy is showing signs of bottoming and seems likely to avoid recession it is also unlikely to stage a quick recovery in our view instead we think eurozone economic growth will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future surviving but not thriving our outlook for continued softness in the eurozone economy reflects a few factors first the domestic policy environment has eased over the course of the year but likely not enough to have a significant positive impact on domestic demand to be sure market interest rates and bank lending rates have moved lower in 2019 however the composite cost of borrowing for non financial corporations has fallen just 10 bps over the past year roughly in line with the drop in three month euribor that is a welcome safety net for an economy that has slowed as much as the eurozone has but is fairly modest considering the extensive package of easing measures that the ecb announced in september and probably not as substantial as the central bank had hoped meanwhile despite the substantial amount of fiscal policy space available for low debt economies in the eurozone particularly germany the willingness to provide substantial fiscal stimulus remains low to be sure germany appears to be on track to run a slightly smaller budget surplus in 2019 relative to 2018 a modest easing of fiscal policy however that may simply reflect cyclical factors such as higher spending on automatic stabilizers including unemployment insurance and lower tax revenues amid slower economic growth even within the current german constitutional rules limiting the extent to which the government can ease fiscal policy maximum structural budget deficit of 0 5 of gdp for the general government policymakers have some room to maneuver but do not seem to be taking advantage of that policy space in our view the fact that the government has been so hesitant is both telling and concerning and we think it might take an outright recession with a meaningful rise in unemployment for germany s government to sanction any sort of large scale fiscal stimulus with fiscal policy support largely absent and past easing measures from the ecb having had a limited positive impact on monetary and financial conditions we anticipate that the ecb will ease policy further in december specifically we think the central bank will cut its deposit rate by an additional 10 bps to 0 60 however we acknowledge that markets are currently pricing essentially no easing in december the december policy meeting could be a wild card given it is newly appointed ecb president christine lagarde s first meeting however ecb chief economist philip lane has recently said that the central bank is not yet at the lower bound and lagarde s comments on policy thus far suggest that she will likely support additional policy easing beyond december we think the ecb will refrain from further rate cuts this reflects our view that stabilizing global growth particularly in the united states will bail out the eurozone economy our forecast calls for u s gdp growth to bottom out in the coming quarters before picking up as 2020 progresses we also expect the u k conservative party to win the december general election and ratify a brexit deal in early 2020 which would probably be a modest positive for the eurozone economy however we reiterate that the eurozone is likely to have a u shaped not a v shaped recovery as mentioned above that partly reflects the weakness of the eurozone policy impulse another key ingredient missing from the recipe for a stronger eurozone rebound is china the chinese economy has continued to slow over the course of the year and we expect it will soften further into 2020 and beyond albeit gradually as authorities refrain from significant big bang monetary and fiscal policy easing an ongoing slowdown in china s economy will likely limit the extent and speed of any eurozone recovery on balance we forecast eurozone gdp growth of just 1 1 in 2019 and 1 0 in 2020 figure 3

latin america is widely recognized by u s investors and businesses as a region for growth due to geographic proximity a growing population abundant natural resources and an emerging middle class latin america is increasingly a choice for u s investors seeking to expand abroad despite recognizing this opportunity the desire to expand often meets reality once financial and accounting due diligence begin how should an investor analyze different reporting methodologies what is the true impact of foreign exchange movements what are the known unknowns financial and accounting due diligence financial and accounting due diligence go hand in hand financial due diligence assesses the investment case including cash flow sustainability capitalization and financial projections accounting due diligence assesses the accuracy of financial data including reporting methodology the audit and accounting procedures and controls while in developed markets seasoned investors are often familiar with standard due diligence of cash flow projections capital expenditure budgets and financing structure with latin american transactions there can be challenges very often historical financial information does not fully adhere to u s generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or international financial reporting standards ifrs this in and of itself may not be an issue but an investor must understand cause and effect in a best case scenario low quality financial reporting may be due to inadequate controls inadequate personnel or a lack of knowledge or expertise in the worst case poor quality financial information may indicate underlying problems with operations for example we have been approached several times by latin american companies seeking strategic advice on approaching investors initially financial results are quite impressive but upon further diligence we find inconsistencies off balance sheet accounts or adjusting items e g unconventional expense allocations that lead to lower ebitda numbers investors should aim to identify such accounting issues as a first step understanding the cause will inform whether to adjust or terminate a deal foreign exchange f x movements need to be considered as well take the example of a manufacturing company that buys raw materials in u s dollars but sells products in the local currency absent price increases any appreciation of the u s dollar will lead to margin compression part of the due diligence must include an evaluation of the ability to pass on these costs whereas competition and increasing customer concentration normally limit a company s ability to pass on these costs under certain conditions i e monopolies or oligopolies high changing costs high barriers to entry there may be an opportunity to pass on price increases maintain margins and preserve value reconciling and normalizing a financial statement to ifrs or u s gaap will likely be required particular attention should be focused on potential adjustments to quality of earnings for related party transactions pension accounting adjustments and consolidation methodologies also assessing transparency and governance factors such as the composition of the board of directors and its independence the quality of the relationships with lenders the credibility of a company s auditors etc will be critical to establishing a true picture of a target s financial profile and deepen an investor s understanding of its assets and liabilities other considerations successful due diligence in latin america entails a review of other non financial matters that are equally important to consider taxes are always a material consideration in an acquisition while tax fraud or tax evasion are obvious areas any investor will investigate the more challenging part of tax due diligence in latin america is assessing the impact of taxes post close successor liability is a constant concern and latin american companies often operate in geographies with convoluted tax regimes and a myriad of reporting requirements even when local tax laws have been adhered to unanticipated liabilities may arise post close for u s investors ensuring the free transfer of assets i e intercompany transfers is often a priority thus tax efficient deal structures such as joint ventures or foreign subsidiary acquisitions may be used finally tax due diligence has both upside and downside and tax attributes such as tax loss carry forwards tax credits e g tax benefits for local investment or tax deductions should be part of the due diligence scope as well when analyzing a latin american target u s investors must be keenly aware of the potential for corruption the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa prevents u s businesses from making payments to foreign government officials in order to obtain business investors in cross border transactions must ensure compliance or risk civil or potential criminal charges by the u s government while the fcpa originally dates to 1977 in latin america there has been a more recent wave of ant corruption enforcement one illustrative example dates back to 2015 grana y montero s a a gym one of the most well respected engineering and construction companies in peru partnered with odebrecht s a odebrecht and enagas s a on gas pipeline in southern peru the gym interest was financed by credit suisse and natixis odebrecht was under investigation for corruption in its home country of brazil and was unable to obtain the required financing needed to continue building the pipeline once construction stalled the gym loan went into default in connection with the odebrecht investigation peruvian officials announced an investigation into payments by gym to former peruvian president alejandro toledo these payments assisted gym in obtaining the pipeline concession as a result between 2015 and 2019 grana y montero equity value has declined approximately 70 from 1 6 billion to 450 million today for investors compliance risk remains a threat to any deal and any lapse may ultimately impact value local labor regulations are another tricky area for foreign investors latin american countries are well known for their strong employment protections and complex labor laws coupled with unions collective bargaining agreements strict requirements for employee termination favorable benefit plans differing pension rules government mandated profit sharing and a host of related issues employee hiring and terminations are challenging however perhaps the most challenging aspect is the cultural differences latin american countries view employment differently and perks such as car allowances or free employee lunches may be viewed as essential by local employees indeed one notable difference that many u s investors may not even be aware of is mandated profit sharing for example in chile a company must distribute 30 of its annual profits to employees and several others including argentina brazil and mexico have profit sharing rules as well the labor environment in latin america can be quite daunting and u s investors that are committed need to be aware of the resources and insights required latin american companies operating in politically sensitive industries i e agriculture oil and gas mining etc must be aware of corporate social responsibility expectations or risk the consequences a notable example is the world s 2nd largest gold mining company newmont mining corp newmont newmont is u s based company with over 7 billion in revenue and a 17 billion market capitalization in 2011 construction on newmont s 5 billion minas conga project in northern peru was suspended due to environmental activists protestors expressed concerns about the impact on local water supplies and challenged claims regarding benefits provided to local indigenous communities by 2016 the company announced it no longer anticipated being able to develop the project due to local opposition latin american countries have unique views of corporate social responsibility and companies operating in political industries may have additional burdens such as local infrastructure investment requirements or reclamation demands u s investors need to review these issues to the extent a company is out of compliance investors may be liable or even put their entire investment at risk finally following due diligence the transaction culminates in a purchase agreement when post closing issues arise it is important to ensure sellers remain committed to a positive outcome as contractual rights are different latin american countries operate under civil law precedent court decisions are not weighed when interpreting contracts proceedings can be time consuming and quite costly and courts typically will not provide the same remedies available in the united states indeed while the world bank ranks the united states 16 globally in contract enforcement it ranks mexico 43 brazil 48 argentina 107 and colombia 177 out of 190 countries financial advisors may provide a solution by negotiating the purchase price downward adding seller financing or utilizing minority equity indeed in the case of post closing risks given the lack of contract enforceability the best defense is a good offense conclusion the importance of working with a trusted advisor in latin america cannot be overstated it is critical to explain the purpose of due diligence to the seller early on in the transaction many latin american conglomerates are family owned and are often not experienced in institutional m a as such they may be surprised at how rigorous the process of due diligence can be and absent proper communication this can cause an erosion of trust additionally while it is possible to negotiate the transaction solely in english key matters operational law etc will need to be in local language i e portuguese or spanish working with dedicated latin america professionals that have the ability to navigate the local terrain can mitigate these risks offering a clear perspective and proper path forward footnotes 1 u s department of justice 2017 february 3 foreign corrupt practices act retrieved from united states

asian markets mostly rose friday as a sense of optimism returned to trading floors after a report said china s point man on the us tariffs talks had offered to host a meeting to help push through their crucial mini pact however investors were nervous that the deal could collapse at any minute after us lawmakers passed a bill supporting hong kong rights causing anger in beijing expectations that the economic superpowers would be able to sign off on the agreement soon has helped fan a rally across world markets for weeks though a lack of detail or signs of progress of late is becoming unsettling for many hopes were given a lift thursday after the wall street journal said top negotiator vice premier liu he had invited his us counterparts for further discussions to haul the deal over the line that came a day after he had expressed confidence they would eventually reach a breakthrough adding to the positivity was a report in the south china morning post that said washington would probably delay imposing fresh tariffs planned for next month even if they have not reached a deal by then the rolling back of levies is a key demand of china s in the talks the market is looking for some bullish signal that things aren t going to get worse and that we re not going to see further deterioration in trade talks between the us and china erin browne at pacific investment management told bloomberg tv they just don t want to see further escalation china not afraid on friday president xi jinping said china wanted to hammer out a deal but was not afraid to fight back when necessary he told former us officials and other foreign dignitaries at a meeting in beijing that he wanted to work for a phase one agreement on the basis of mutual respect and equality the remarks came two days after donald trump complained beijing had not made sufficient concessions so far making him reluctant to conclude a bargain asian investors broadly maintained early gains hong kong added 0 3 percent in the afternoon while tokyo ended up 0 3 percent singapore rose 0 7 percent sydney rose 0 6 percent seoul and bangkok gained 0 3 percent while taipei was up 0 1 percent however shanghai slipped 0 6 percent while wellington manila mumbai and jakarta were in the red eyes are on the white house after congress sent the hong kong bill to trump to sign into law beijing has warned of consequences over the bill and there are fears for the trade talks if trump signs it worries about china s reaction caused a sharp drop on global markets thursday still some observers say that while highly contentious the bill will more likely prevent a more detailed agreement being reached rather than cause the complete collapse of the talks stephen innes at axitrader said the fact that liu had offered the invitation and remained optimistic indicates that china may be willing to compartmentalise this contentious bill away from the broader trade negotiations but he added that this tangled web of trade talk confusion has investors sitting in that all too familiar predicament of trade war limbo and david madden at cmc markets said that thursday was a bit of a downbeat day as stocks lost ground but if traders were genuinely fearful about the trade story stocks would be much lower the broadly upbeat mood provided support to higher yielding currencies such as the south korean won south african rand and mexican peso the chinese yuan was also up against the dollar while the greenback made gains on the yen which is usually seen as a safe asset in times of turmoil afp

update on our key business segments and our view for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions beginning with slide 3 ongoing unfavorable market conditions in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil continued to impact our performance this quarter passenger traffic was up slightly over 1 with over 22 million passengers traveling through our 52 airports in the quarter domestic and international traffic increased nearly 4 and 3 respectively while transit passengers fell 13 impacted by weaker traffic in brazil adjusted ebitda excluding inflation accounting declined 25 year on year with the margin ex ifric contracting to nearly 32 from 41 in the year ago quarter when we had posted a robust margin expansion of over 470 basis points this was mainly due to a bad debt provision in argentina excluding these the adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the quarter would have been 39 down only 170 basis points we saw better margins this quarter in armenia uruguay and ecuador along with relatively stable margin in italy in argentina we continue to experience a mix shift toward more affordable domestic traffic weaker commercial revenues and the translation impact of fx devaluation brazil in turn remains affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil we invested to 120 million in the quarter as we continue to enhance our airport infrastructure with the term goal of further strengthening capacity to capture future growth and add to the passenger travel experience funds were mainly allocated to argentina as we moved ahead with works at ezeiza airport we also made capital investments in ecuador and italy importantly during the quarter the national airports regulatory organization of argentina approved new maximum passenger use fees to be charge effective january 1st 2020 i will discuss more about this in a few minutes turning to slide 4 total traffic growth decelerated to slightly above 1 year on year from 4 in the prior quarter a good performance in argentina armenia and peru was mitigated by weaker traffic in brazil and to a lesser extent in italy and uruguay in argentina traffic was up nearly 8 year on year we saw a continued mix shift toward domestic travel which was up 10 year on year international traffic in turn posted a slight increase in august and september ending the quarter up nearly 1 year on year improving from the 6 year on year drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in brazil remains negatively affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil last may which resulted in a year on year decline of nearly 12 in total traffic on a positive note in september gol launched additional routes in line with its strategy to expand operations at brasilia airport in italy traffic declined slightly over 1 year on year while traffic was up 3 at florence airport fueled by the addition of new airlines routes and frequencies pisa airport posted a decline in a similar magnitude as the quarter remained impacted by a reduction of operations by two low cost carriers our other airports posted a mixed performance passenger traffic was up 17 in armenia benefited from the addition of new airlines and flights while traffic in peru increased over 5 this quarter by contrast traffic in uruguay was down nearly 3 year on year impacted by a temporary cancellation of a route to bogotá colombia which is anticipated to resume in december together with lower traffic flow from argentina in ecuador traffic was temporarily affected by the closure of the airport during september weekend as we renovated the runway and taxiways this resulted in 4 drop in traffic more than offsetting the good performance in july and august driven by new international routes and frequencies i will now hand off the call to raúl francos who will review operations and financial results please raúl go ahead raul francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of the presentation for a bit of understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina starting with revenue on slide 5 adverse macro conditions in argentina continue to impact our top line in this quarter and we are also facing some temporary challenges in brazil and italy on a comparable basis and excluding construction revenues total revenue fell 4 year on year aeronautical revenues declined almost 2 mainly as a result of the mix shift to domestic from international traffic in argentina and the fx regulation impact on domestic revenue from strong currency depreciation in brazil aeronautical revenue were mainly affected by the decline in traffic and lower aircraft fees which more than offset the increase in international traffic in italy while lower traffic was offset by higher tariff revenue growth was impacted by currency depreciation by contrast we delivered a good performance in armenia which posted another quarter of revenue growth due to increased traffic partially offset by euro depreciation moving on to commercial revenues the 8 decline year on year mainly reflected lower cargo activity coupled with lower duty free sale arising from weaker demand in argentina as well as the fx translation impact on local currency revenues to a little extent commercial revenues in brazil were impacted by lower advertising food and beverage and parking revenues while in italy the 5 local currency growth was offset by the euro depreciation armenia continued to perform well posting another quarter of commercial revenue growth supported by higher fuel demand and prices moving to our cost structure on slide 6 during the quarter total operating cost and expenses ex ifric 12 increased 7 5 year on year mainly impacted by 23 million bad debt charge recorded in argentina related to over a year accumulated past due commercial revenues and aircraft fees from a local airline cost of services ex ifric 12 fell 1 year on year mainly due to lower concession fees in our main market partially offset by higher cost of fuel in armenia now please turn to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 25 year on year to 102 million in the quarter the margin contracted to 32 mainly impacted by the bad debt charge in argentina together with lower cost dilution in both argentina and brazil due to softer top line growth this was partially offset by a solid margin improvement in uruguay excluding the bad debt charge adjusted ebitda will have been 125 million and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric would have been 39 as you can see on slide 8 our financial position remains strong as we mentioned in our previous call in august our argentine subsidiary entered into two credit facilities for a total amount of 120 million which will be used to fund our capex program in this country this transaction was particularly important in the current volatile environment as it provide us with enough financial liquidity to support business needs when investing for future growth as a result we ended the quarter with a cash position of 258 million and net debt of 953 million net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda stood at 2 1 times let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance of our key business segments and will comment on our outlook martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you raúl moving on to argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric were down 9 year on year as adverse macro conditions continue to impact our financial performance in this market first we continue to experience a mix shift to more affordable domestic destinations domestic traffic was up 10 reflecting new routes and frequencies operated by low cost carriers and increased promotional activity this compares with a nearly 1 increase in international travel which posted a temporary recovery from the 6 year on year drop observed in the second quarter of 2019 second lower cargo and duty free revenues partially offset by higher vip lounges and advertising revenues resulted in a decline in commercial revenues this quarter and third results were also impacted by the fx translation impact from the peso depreciation which impacted our local currency aeronautical and commercial revenues adjusted segment ebitda fell 42 while adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric 12 contracted to 28 from 45 in the same quarter last year excluding the bad debt charge in the quarter discussed earlier adjusted ebitda margin excluding ifric 12 would have declined only 200 basis points to 43 in the quarter reflecting lower cost dilution during the quarter we invested 104 million in argentina with funds mainly allocated to work at ezeiza and aeroparque airports as well as several other airports in the country note that the opening of the new departure terminal at ezeiza has been delayed due to a construction incident that halted construction while being investigated by the appropriate organizations we expect construction work at ezeiza to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 in the meantime we have progressed with works in adjacent buildings and the multilevel parking at this airport which is expected to be finalized by the end of this month we also advanced on the landfill for the construction of a new car parking facility on costanera avenue at aeroparque airport during the third quarter we also progressed with the construction of the new terminal building at iguazú and jujuy airports the expansion of the terminal buildings at bariloche mar del plata and esquel airports among other investments across our airport network finally a key event in the quarter was the increase of passenger use tariff effective january 1st 2020 as a result of the 2017 economic equilibrium revision the new tariff framework implies a 4 increase in international tariffs to 51 from 49 today and a 162 increase in domestic tariffs to mxn 195 from mxn 74 today in connection with the 2016 economic equilibrium revision we have filed a judiciary claim against the national airports regulatory organization for it to declare that provision null and to redo it in accordance with the applicable regulation please turn to slide 10 looking at italy total passenger traffic was down slightly over 1 year on year florence airport posted a 3 increase in traffic supported by new routes and frequencies these were mainly routes from low cost carrier vueling to several new destinations across europe as well as additional flights to paris by air france and to madrid by iberia good customer response to sas s flight to copenhagen added last april and to new flight to dusseldorf by low carrier eurowings also contributed to higher traffic at florence airport this was more than offset by a 3 decline in traffic and pisa airport as pobeda reduced its operations in the quarter late in the quarter with the launch of new routes to brussels and prague among others we also saw a slight pickup in operations by ryanair this follows the contractions experienced since april revenues ex ifric 12 were down close to 3 year on year impacted by a nearly 5 depreciation of the euro in local currency however aeronautical revenues were flat driven by higher passengers with restricted mobility fees applicable since february offset by the decline in passenger traffic commercial revenues in local currencies were up 5 reflecting new advertising and car rental agreements at florence airport as well as good performance in vip lounge revenues from the opening of new areas combined higher aeronautical and commercial revenue more than offset weaker passenger traffic our italian operations posted solid profitability despite the decline in traffic and the euro depreciation adjusted ebitda margins ex ifric 12 remained stable at 37 year on year turning to capex we invested 3 million this quarter mainly in the master plan development at florence airport preliminary works related to the expansion at pisa airport together with new equipment at both airports now an update on the florence airport expansion program the final audience intervention review by the environmental impact assessment is scheduled for november 28 2019 if the outcome of the hearing audience is favorable we expect to begin work by spring 2020 remember this project has been delayed and we ll file an appeal against the judgment that overturned the favorable environmental impact assessment decree for the project outlined in the 20140 2029 master plan finally our plan to expand the terminal building at pisa airport to accommodate pisa traffic growth remains on track with construction expected to begin during the first half of next year now please turn to slide 11 to review our brazilian operations the cessation of operations of avianca brasil represented a drop in passengers of 15 partially offset by the growth of other airlines resulting in nearly 12 year on year decline in traffic looking to offset this we have remained focused on adding new domestic and international routes for example gol in partnership with passaredo added three domestic routes at brasilia airport latam also just launched a new international routes in chile and is expected to launch two more to neighboring countries before year end we are also making progress at natal airport with latam azul and gol adding a total of nine new routes and frequencies by year end revenues were down 4 against last year impacted by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues while the exchange rate remained stable year on year aeronautical revenues were down 5 impacted by the cessation of avianca brasil s operations and lower aircraft fees partially offset by a 41 increase in higher margin international traffic commercial revenues in turn fell 4 as lower advertising parking and food and beverage more than offset higher revenues from continued good performance of our vip lounges in terms of profitability adjusted ebitda declined 29 to 4 million in the quarter with margin contracting to 16 from 21 in the third quarter of 2018 we saw lower cost dilution as we benefited from a debt recovery in the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by lower concession fee charges we have begun construction of the pick up plaza at brasilia airport which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2020 the plaza will be a central location for car hailing companies in particular uber as well as most of the car rental at the airport with drivers and passengers congregating in one location which gives us the opportunity for a new revenue source particularly for food and beverage and advertising the first starbucks in brasilia will be located here as well now please turn to slide 12 to review our uruguayan operations the cancellation of a daily route to bogotá and weak travel demand from argentina continues to weigh on passenger traffic avianca has indicated it expects the route to resume in december revenues ex ifric 12 were down nearly 4 year on year driven by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues commercial revenues in turn fell 4 reflecting lower duty free and parking revenues resulting from softer demand from argentine passengers coupled with the fx translation impact from the 13 currency depreciation lower cargo activity also contributed to lower revenues higher vip lounge revenues from new commercial agreements signed in the quarter partially offset the decline despite the weaker top line adjusted ebitda was up nearly 1 to 14 million with margin ex ifric 12 expanding 200 basis points to 51 in the quarter higher profitability was supported by lower maintenance costs and sg a expenses now to wrap up turn to slide 13 looking ahead we remain focused on executing on our long term strategy as we navigate in adverse environment in argentina and weak dynamics in brazil in argentina our key markets while we face complex macro dynamics and no near and medium term visibility we have a resilient business with a successful track record of operating in different macro cycles over 80 of revenues are denominated in u s dollars further supported by a solid balance sheet we continue advancing on our investment programs to capture additional growth when the economy recovers in brazil traffic and profitability remain impacted by weak economic growth and cessation of operations of avianca brasil avianca s former capacity at brasilian airport is expected to be gradually restored by the three other carriers with domestic operations in the airport starting toward year end in italy we expect to deliver positive traffic growth this year while we continue to monitor the evolution of alitalia and the development of brexit we have also begun work for the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport which will continue into next year and expect to accelerate investment at florence in 2020 in conclusion while in the near term we continue to face several headwinds in argentina and brazil we remain focused on executing on our investment plans to better position the company to resume growth as micro conditions in argentina improve we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator today s first question comes from ian zaffino of oppenheimer please proceed mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian thanks for taking our questions so just to start off going into the bad debt expense this quarter can you guys provide some more information on exactly how the mechanics of the expense came forward and how it works and are there any additional bad debt or past due fees that we should be aware of going forward thanks operator just as a note to the speaker line your line is unmuted you may be locally muted at your telephone mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hello can you hear me now hello martin eurnekian chief executive officer hello this is martin again here i will ask raúl to intervene if needed the bad debt provision that we have it s an aging issue of unpaid fees aeronautical fees and commercial fees from the main carrier of argentina and the fact that we provisionally said it s a matter of aging and accounting rules basically they started missing a part of their payments since august last year and since it s been a year we had to provision that although this airline is controlled by the state and we believe one way or another this is not going to turn into a real loss mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you and then just a follow on just in terms of are there any updates to negotiations for the aa2000 concessions just given where the election results have come out and then sort of color or incremental detail there would be much appreciated thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you this is martin again as you mentioned we are in the transition to a new government this doesn t change our view regarding the state of the concession and everything that the concession has gone through over the last 20 years basically and although we now have to establish a new relationship with a new team that will come in since a couple of weeks from now starting a couple of weeks from now we still strongly believe that the extension clause will be executed at some point and we are eager to start negotiations with the entering government mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you guys very much operator our next question comes from stephen trent with citi please proceed stephen trent citi analyst thank you everybody and good morning and thanks for taking my question i just had a quick one also relating to aa2000 like the gentleman from oppenheimer i m curious you gave some very helpful color on what s going to happen with aa2000 tariffs starting in january but then you also said that there s a legal dispute that is going on between you and the regulator in argentina and if you could just help me out what exactly you re disputing the tariffs that are going up in january or this is a separate adjustment on the guaranteed irr thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you stephen this is martin again as you know the regulator has to review every year the concession equilibrium during this administration they haven t done it yet so they released the 2016 revision and the 2017 revision very close to each other the 2016 revision did not come with a tariff adjustment so we contested that quite strongly actually because instead of going into the administrative process we went into the judiciary to make a claim for this and then they released the 2017 revision which included 2 addition in international fees and the domestic from mxn 74 to mxn 195 stephen trent citi analyst ok got it so as we and as a quick follow up to that is it fair to say that you are going into the current discussions with some negotiating power considering that you re still owed on the guarantee for some years and the government s flag carrier is maybe still owes you some back payments how should investors think about that martin eurnekian chief executive officer well yes although we do not like to provision for a bad debt the situation we are in as with this bad debt that we have being controlled by the state we believe that it s going to give us room for negotiation in terms of how that is repaid or how is it handled and yes what you mentioned before regarding what could entail the economic equilibrium revisions and the fact that we went over the requirements of investments so far we think that this puts us in a very good position to negotiate the terms of the concession with the government stephen trent citi analyst ok very helpful martin thanks very much operator this concludes our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to martin eurnekian for any closing remarks martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you everybody for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we

nearly a week after iran imposed a near total internet and mobile data blackout amid protests over a rise in gas prices its connectivity to the rest of the world remains limited and reflects what researchers and activists claim disputed by iran is a tool of repression used by regimes from ethiopia to venezuela but the shutdown in iran which began nov 17 and remains below 20 of normal levels according to netblocks a firm that tracks cybersecurity has not only allowed officials in tehran to exert control over information about the unrest it has also cut off iranians from their friends and family abroad seemingly strengthened the trump administration s perception that its maximum pressure policy on iran is working after washington exited the nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions and further obscured what s happening and who s to blame in a middle eastern nation whose political and economic isolation has fluctuated in the four decades since its 1979 revolution that ushered in its islamic republic inside iran america s history in iran leads to mix of anger weariness marcin de kaminski a technology and human rights expert at civil rights defenders a sweden based civil rights watchdog said that internet blackouts are part of a growing trend of governments trying to shut their citizens off from the world during fraught periods they use it to limit freedom of expression or freedom of assembly and quite often it s connected to elections or conflict or to different forms of civil unrest this is happening in many different contexts from uganda to burma also known as myanmar he said ethiopia has been intermittently shutting down internet access since a failed coup in june venezuela periodically blocks access to twitter youtube facebook and other services that require internet or mobile data access as part of an effort to stymie political opposition and prevent the efficacy of mass protests india shut off kashmir s internet access more than three months ago amid political upheaval different causes and aims mass protests from iran to hong kong accelerate the protests in iran accelerated after gas prices were increased by 50 at a time when the sanctions reinstated by president donald trump have contributed to soaring inflation and stagnating salaries the world bank forecasts iran s economy will shrink by 8 7 this year a consequence of plummeting revenues from blocked oil exports and restrictions on its petrochemicals metals and mining sectors some consumer goods and essential medicines can be hard to get when i was in iran in march there were people standing in lines to buy government rations and subsidized meat said hoda katebi a chicago based iranian american writer and community organizer who has published a book about iran s underground fashion industry nothing s coming in the currency is worthless she said iran s currency has lost more than half of its value against the dollar since the trump administration reimposed sanctions katebi spoke to usa today on the sidelines of voices an annual gathering for fashion industry leaders and trailblazers that takes place near oxford england at the event katebi appeared on a panel with shirin and shiva vaqar iranian sisters who had traveled from tehran to talk about their eponymous fashion label it s very hard for us not just as emerging designers but as iranians said shiva vaqar we face lots of sanctions and restrictions sourcing fabrics finding production houses convincing them to make our pieces we have problems sending our products outside iran we don t have fedex the banking system is on lockdown still she said we try to make it katebi and the vaqar sisters who are longtime friends had not been able to communicate with each other ahead of the event because of iran s internet crackdown katebi said she has not been able to reach her family in iran iran student leader i regret 1979 attack on u s embassy in tehran amir rashidi an internet security specialist said iran has previously weighed the idea of creating different levels of access to the internet he pointed to a nov 1 interview with hamid fatahi a senior official in iran s ministry of information and communications technology in which fatahi discusses the possibility of partitioning access based on social class or occupational needs it was not immediately clear if iran is still considering such an initiative which could be used to suppress dissenting voices china and russia have either taken steps or are experimenting with ways to route internet traffic through state controlled channels iran s domestic banks hospitals government agencies and other major state infrastructure and services such as the police have remained connected to the internet during the blackout according to digital security experts and iranians contacted by usa today over the course of the last week demonstrators in iran set fire to banks and police stations and ransacked public office buildings and blocked roads according to rights groups amnesty international has said that at least 100 iranians have been killed in the protests as security services have sought to disperse crowds by firing live ammunition some iranians have found workarounds for limited internet access photos and video footage that have trickled out of iran have appeared to corroborate the claims of violence but iran has dismissed amnesty s death figures as propaganda amnesty s report is based on anti iranian sources and those sources are not reliable mohammad farahani the editor in chief of the mizan news agency an official news site that covers iran s judiciary told usa today in a direct message via social media people in iran have the right to protest just like anywhere else but those who burn banks and stores are not protesters they are rioters iranian authorities have sought to blame the unrest on agitators with ties to foreign governments iran s semi official fars new agency reported that thugs arrested during the recent riots confessed they received 60 for each place set on fire the fars report did not say who may have been behind the payments but sina toossi a researcher at the national iranian american council a washington d c based group that seeks to promote links between americans and iranians said the the iranian government does not tolerate peaceful assembly for ordinary people to air their grievances if the iran is sincere about making a distinction between protests and rioters it should at the minimum facilitate this first step in allowing people to air their grievances publicly toossi said his whatsapp groups with family and friends in iran that were always a feed of pictures and messages have since nov 17 fallen ominously silent an iranian diplomat in europe who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue said the internet was disconnected to ensure iranians weren t misinformed and bombarded with fake news whither the nuke deal iran starts injecting uranium gas into centrifuges included in this fake news according to iranian officials but also many iranians who would like closer relations with the west and don t necessarily sympathize with their government or its heavy handed tactics but who nevertheless object to interventions by officials in the trump administration is an effort to frame every protest in iran as a sign the regime is about to be toppled in a popular uprising there s just so much more to it said masoud golsorkhi a london based iranian born magazine editor who was at the voices event in oxford this week still late thursday trump himself tweeted that iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system adding they want zero transparency thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the iranian regime is causing that same day the u s s top diplomat secretary of state mike pompeo said he asked the iranian protestors to send us their videos photos and information documenting the regime s crackdown on protestors the u s will expose and sanction the abuses and on friday the u s imposed sanctions on iran s information minister mohammad javad azari jahromi for his role in wide scale internet censorship yet toossi cautioned that u s officials shouldn t conflate iranians expression of their legitimate grievances and anger with their own government as a welcoming of new u s interference in iran s internal affairs the high water mark of which was a 1953 cia orchestrated coup that unseated iran s democratically elected prime minister u s intervention in iran s domestic affairs has a long ugly history and has only made matters worse for the iranian people and regional stability

our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and our view for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions beginning with slide 3 ongoing unfavorable market conditions in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil continued to impact our performance this quarter passenger traffic was up slightly over 1 with over 22 million passengers traveling through our 52 airports in the quarter domestic and international traffic increased nearly 4 and 3 respectively while transit passengers fell 13 impacted by weaker traffic in brazil adjusted ebitda excluding inflation accounting declined 25 year on year with the margin ex ifric contracting to nearly 32 from 41 in the year ago quarter when we had posted a robust margin expansion of over 470 basis points this was mainly due to a bad debt provision in argentina excluding these the adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the quarter would have been 39 down only 170 basis points we saw better margins this quarter in armenia uruguay and ecuador along with relatively stable margin in italy in argentina we continue to experience a mix shift toward more affordable domestic traffic weaker commercial revenues and the translation impact of fx devaluation brazil in turn remains affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil we invested to 120 million in the quarter as we continue to enhance our airport infrastructure with the term goal of further strengthening capacity to capture future growth and add to the passenger travel experience funds were mainly allocated to argentina as we moved ahead with works at ezeiza airport we also made capital investments in ecuador and italy importantly during the quarter the national airports regulatory organization of argentina approved new maximum passenger use fees to be charge effective january 1st 2020 i will discuss more about this in a few minutes turning to slide 4 total traffic growth decelerated to slightly above 1 year on year from 4 in the prior quarter a good performance in argentina armenia and peru was mitigated by weaker traffic in brazil and to a lesser extent in italy and uruguay in argentina traffic was up nearly 8 year on year we saw a continued mix shift toward domestic travel which was up 10 year on year international traffic in turn posted a slight increase in august and september ending the quarter up nearly 1 year on year improving from the 6 year on year drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in brazil remains negatively affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil last may which resulted in a year on year decline of nearly 12 in total traffic on a positive note in september gol launched additional routes in line with its strategy to expand operations at brasilia airport in italy traffic declined slightly over 1 year on year while traffic was up 3 at florence airport fueled by the addition of new airlines routes and frequencies pisa airport posted a decline in a similar magnitude as the quarter remained impacted by a reduction of operations by two low cost carriers our other airports posted a mixed performance passenger traffic was up 17 in armenia benefited from the addition of new airlines and flights while traffic in peru increased over 5 this quarter by contrast traffic in uruguay was down nearly 3 year on year impacted by a temporary cancellation of a route to bogotá colombia which is anticipated to resume in december together with lower traffic flow from argentina in ecuador traffic was temporarily affected by the closure of the airport during september weekend as we renovated the runway and taxiways this resulted in 4 drop in traffic more than offsetting the good performance in july and august driven by new international routes and frequencies i will now hand off the call to raúl francos who will review operations and financial results please raúl go ahead raul francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of the presentation for a bit of understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina starting with revenue on slide 5 adverse macro conditions in argentina continue to impact our top line in this quarter and we are also facing some temporary challenges in brazil and italy on a comparable basis and excluding construction revenues total revenue fell 4 year on year aeronautical revenues declined almost 2 mainly as a result of the mix shift to domestic from international traffic in argentina and the fx regulation impact on domestic revenue from strong currency depreciation in brazil aeronautical revenue were mainly affected by the decline in traffic and lower aircraft fees which more than offset the increase in international traffic in italy while lower traffic was offset by higher tariff revenue growth was impacted by currency depreciation by contrast we delivered a good performance in armenia which posted another quarter of revenue growth due to increased traffic partially offset by euro depreciation moving on to commercial revenues the 8 decline year on year mainly reflected lower cargo activity coupled with lower duty free sale arising from weaker demand in argentina as well as the fx translation impact on local currency revenues to a little extent commercial revenues in brazil were impacted by lower advertising food and beverage and parking revenues while in italy the 5 local currency growth was offset by the euro depreciation armenia continued to perform well posting another quarter of commercial revenue growth supported by higher fuel demand and prices moving to our cost structure on slide 6 during the quarter total operating cost and expenses ex ifric 12 increased 7 5 year on year mainly impacted by 23 million bad debt charge recorded in argentina related to over a year accumulated past due commercial revenues and aircraft fees from a local airline cost of services ex ifric 12 fell 1 year on year mainly due to lower concession fees in our main market partially offset by higher cost of fuel in armenia now please turn to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 25 year on year to 102 million in the quarter the margin contracted to 32 mainly impacted by the bad debt charge in argentina together with lower cost dilution in both argentina and brazil due to softer top line growth this was partially offset by a solid margin improvement in uruguay excluding the bad debt charge adjusted ebitda will have been 125 million and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric would have been 39 as you can see on slide 8 our financial position remains strong as we mentioned in our previous call in august our argentine subsidiary entered into two credit facilities for a total amount of 120 million which will be used to fund our capex program in this country this transaction was particularly important in the current volatile environment as it provide us with enough financial liquidity to support business needs when investing for future growth as a result we ended the quarter with a cash position of 258 million and net debt of 953 million net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda stood at 2 1 times let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance of our key business segments and will comment on our outlook martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you raúl moving on to argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric were down 9 year on year as adverse macro conditions continue to impact our financial performance in this market first we continue to experience a mix shift to more affordable domestic destinations domestic traffic was up 10 reflecting new routes and frequencies operated by low cost carriers and increased promotional activity this compares with a nearly 1 increase in international travel which posted a temporary recovery from the 6 year on year drop observed in the second quarter of 2019 second lower cargo and duty free revenues partially offset by higher vip lounges and advertising revenues resulted in a decline in commercial revenues this quarter and third results were also impacted by the fx translation impact from the peso depreciation which impacted our local currency aeronautical and commercial revenues adjusted segment ebitda fell 42 while adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric 12 contracted to 28 from 45 in the same quarter last year excluding the bad debt charge in the quarter discussed earlier adjusted ebitda margin excluding ifric 12 would have declined only 200 basis points to 43 in the quarter reflecting lower cost dilution during the quarter we invested 104 million in argentina with funds mainly allocated to work at ezeiza and aeroparque airports as well as several other airports in the country note that the opening of the new departure terminal at ezeiza has been delayed due to a construction incident that halted construction while being investigated by the appropriate organizations we expect construction work at ezeiza to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 in the meantime we have progressed with works in adjacent buildings and the multilevel parking at this airport which is expected to be finalized by the end of this month we also advanced on the landfill for the construction of a new car parking facility on costanera avenue at aeroparque airport during the third quarter we also progressed with the construction of the new terminal building at iguazú and jujuy airports the expansion of the terminal buildings at bariloche mar del plata and esquel airports among other investments across our airport network finally a key event in the quarter was the increase of passenger use tariff effective january 1st 2020 as a result of the 2017 economic equilibrium revision the new tariff framework implies a 4 increase in international tariffs to 51 from 49 today and a 162 increase in domestic tariffs to mxn 195 from mxn 74 today in connection with the 2016 economic equilibrium revision we have filed a judiciary claim against the national airports regulatory organization for it to declare that provision null and to redo it in accordance with the applicable regulation please turn to slide 10 looking at italy total passenger traffic was down slightly over 1 year on year florence airport posted a 3 increase in traffic supported by new routes and frequencies these were mainly routes from low cost carrier vueling to several new destinations across europe as well as additional flights to paris by air france and to madrid by iberia good customer response to sas s flight to copenhagen added last april and to new flight to dusseldorf by low carrier eurowings also contributed to higher traffic at florence airport this was more than offset by a 3 decline in traffic and pisa airport as pobeda reduced its operations in the quarter late in the quarter with the launch of new routes to brussels and prague among others we also saw a slight pickup in operations by ryanair this follows the contractions experienced since april revenues ex ifric 12 were down close to 3 year on year impacted by a nearly 5 depreciation of the euro in local currency however aeronautical revenues were flat driven by higher passengers with restricted mobility fees applicable since february offset by the decline in passenger traffic commercial revenues in local currencies were up 5 reflecting new advertising and car rental agreements at florence airport as well as good performance in vip lounge revenues from the opening of new areas combined higher aeronautical and commercial revenue more than offset weaker passenger traffic our italian operations posted solid profitability despite the decline in traffic and the euro depreciation adjusted ebitda margins ex ifric 12 remained stable at 37 year on year turning to capex we invested 3 million this quarter mainly in the master plan development at florence airport preliminary works related to the expansion at pisa airport together with new equipment at both airports now an update on the florence airport expansion program the final audience intervention review by the environmental impact assessment is scheduled for november 28 2019 if the outcome of the hearing audience is favorable we expect to begin work by spring 2020 remember this project has been delayed and we ll file an appeal against the judgment that overturned the favorable environmental impact assessment decree for the project outlined in the 20140 2029 master plan finally our plan to expand the terminal building at pisa airport to accommodate pisa traffic growth remains on track with construction expected to begin during the first half of next year now please turn to slide 11 to review our brazilian operations the cessation of operations of avianca brasil represented a drop in passengers of 15 partially offset by the growth of other airlines resulting in nearly 12 year on year decline in traffic looking to offset this we have remained focused on adding new domestic and international routes for example gol in partnership with passaredo added three domestic routes at brasilia airport latam also just launched a new international routes in chile and is expected to launch two more to neighboring countries before year end we are also making progress at natal airport with latam azul and gol adding a total of nine new routes and frequencies by year end revenues were down 4 against last year impacted by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues while the exchange rate remained stable year on year aeronautical revenues were down 5 impacted by the cessation of avianca brasil s operations and lower aircraft fees partially offset by a 41 increase in higher margin international traffic commercial revenues in turn fell 4 as lower advertising parking and food and beverage more than offset higher revenues from continued good performance of our vip lounges in terms of profitability adjusted ebitda declined 29 to 4 million in the quarter with margin contracting to 16 from 21 in the third quarter of 2018 we saw lower cost dilution as we benefited from a debt recovery in the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by lower concession fee charges we have begun construction of the pick up plaza at brasilia airport which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2020 the plaza will be a central location for car hailing companies in particular uber as well as most of the car rental at the airport with drivers and passengers congregating in one location which gives us the opportunity for a new revenue source particularly for food and beverage and advertising the first starbucks in brasilia will be located here as well now please turn to slide 12 to review our uruguayan operations the cancellation of a daily route to bogotá and weak travel demand from argentina continues to weigh on passenger traffic avianca has indicated it expects the route to resume in december revenues ex ifric 12 were down nearly 4 year on year driven by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues commercial revenues in turn fell 4 reflecting lower duty free and parking revenues resulting from softer demand from argentine passengers coupled with the fx translation impact from the 13 currency depreciation lower cargo activity also contributed to lower revenues higher vip lounge revenues from new commercial agreements signed in the quarter partially offset the decline despite the weaker top line adjusted ebitda was up nearly 1 to 14 million with margin ex ifric 12 expanding 200 basis points to 51 in the quarter higher profitability was supported by lower maintenance costs and sg a expenses now to wrap up turn to slide 13 looking ahead we remain focused on executing on our long term strategy as we navigate in adverse environment in argentina and weak dynamics in brazil in argentina our key markets while we face complex macro dynamics and no near and medium term visibility we have a resilient business with a successful track record of operating in different macro cycles over 80 of revenues are denominated in u s dollars further supported by a solid balance sheet we continue advancing on our investment programs to capture additional growth when the economy recovers in brazil traffic and profitability remain impacted by weak economic growth and cessation of operations of avianca brasil avianca s former capacity at brasilian airport is expected to be gradually restored by the three other carriers with domestic operations in the airport starting toward year end in italy we expect to deliver positive traffic growth this year while we continue to monitor the evolution of alitalia and the development of brexit we have also begun work for the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport which will continue into next year and expect to accelerate investment at florence in 2020 in conclusion while in the near term we continue to face several headwinds in argentina and brazil we remain focused on executing on our investment plans to better position the company to resume growth as micro conditions in argentina improve we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator today s first question comes from ian zaffino of oppenheimer please proceed mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian thanks for taking our questions so just to start off going into the bad debt expense this quarter can you guys provide some more information on exactly how the mechanics of the expense came forward and how it works and are there any additional bad debt or past due fees that we should be aware of going forward thanks operator just as a note to the speaker line your line is unmuted you may be locally muted at your telephone mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hello can you hear me now hello martin eurnekian chief executive officer hello this is martin again here i will ask raúl to intervene if needed the bad debt provision that we have it s an aging issue of unpaid fees aeronautical fees and commercial fees from the main carrier of argentina and the fact that we provisionally said it s a matter of aging and accounting rules basically they started missing a part of their payments since august last year and since it s been a year we had to provision that although this airline is controlled by the state and we believe one way or another this is not going to turn into a real loss mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you and then just a follow on just in terms of are there any updates to negotiations for the aa2000 concessions just given where the election results have come out and then sort of color or incremental detail there would be much appreciated thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you this is martin again as you mentioned we are in the transition to a new government this doesn t change our view regarding the state of the concession and everything that the concession has gone through over the last 20 years basically and although we now have to establish a new relationship with a new team that will come in since a couple of weeks from now starting a couple of weeks from now we still strongly believe that the extension clause will be executed at some point and we are eager to start negotiations with the entering government mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you guys very much operator our next question comes from stephen trent with citi please proceed stephen trent citi analyst thank you everybody and good morning and thanks for taking my question i just had a quick one also relating to aa2000 like the gentleman from oppenheimer i m curious you gave some very helpful color on what s going to happen with aa2000 tariffs starting in january but then you also said that there s a legal dispute that is going on between you and the regulator in argentina and if you could just help me out what exactly you re disputing the tariffs that are going up in january or this is a separate adjustment on the guaranteed irr thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you stephen this is martin again as you know the regulator has to review every year the concession equilibrium during this administration they haven t done it yet so they released the 2016 revision and the 2017 revision very close to each other the 2016 revision did not come with a tariff adjustment so we contested that quite strongly actually because instead of going into the administrative process we went into the judiciary to make a claim for this and then they released the 2017 revision which included 2 addition in international fees and the domestic from mxn 74 to mxn 195 stephen trent citi analyst ok got it so as we and as a quick follow up to that is it fair to say that you are going into the current discussions with some negotiating power considering that you re still owed on the guarantee for some years and the government s flag carrier is maybe still owes you some back payments how should investors think about that martin eurnekian chief executive officer well yes although we do not like to provision for a bad debt the situation we are in as with this bad debt that we have being controlled by the state we believe that it s going to give us room for negotiation in terms of how that is repaid or how is it handled and yes what you mentioned before regarding what could entail the economic equilibrium revisions and the fact that we went over the requirements of investments so far we think that this puts us in a very good position to negotiate the terms of the concession with the government stephen trent citi analyst ok very helpful martin thanks very much operator this concludes our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to martin eurnekian for any closing remarks martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you everybody for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we look forward to meeting more of you over the coming months and providing financial and business updates in the next quarter in the meantime our team remains available to answer any questions that you may have thank you again and enjoy the rest of your day bye bye operator duration 40 minutes call participants gimena albanesi investor relations martin eurnekian chief executive officer raul

in europe who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue said the internet was disconnected to ensure iranians weren t misinformed and bombarded with fake news whither the nuke deal iran starts injecting uranium gas into centrifuges included in this fake news according to iranian officials but also many iranians who would like closer relations with the west and don t necessarily sympathize with their government or its heavy handed tactics but who nevertheless object to interventions by officials in the trump administration is an effort to frame every protest in iran as a sign the regime is about to be toppled in a popular uprising there s just so much more to it said masoud golsorkhi a london based iranian born magazine editor who was at the voices event in oxford this week still late thursday trump himself tweeted that iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire internet system adding they want zero transparency thinking the world will not find out the death and tragedy that the iranian regime is causing that same day the u s s top diplomat secretary of state mike pompeo said he asked the iranian protestors to send us their videos photos and information documenting the regime s crackdown on protestors the u s will expose and sanction the abuses and on friday the u s imposed sanctions on iran s information minister mohammad javad azari jahromi for his role in wide scale internet censorship yet toossi cautioned that u s officials shouldn t conflate iranians expression of their legitimate grievances and anger with their own government as a welcoming of new u s interference in iran s internal affairs the high water mark of which was a 1953 cia orchestrated coup that unseated iran s

nearly a week after iran imposed a near total internet and mobile data blackout amid protests over a rise in gas prices its connectivity to the rest of the world remains limited and reflects what researchers and activists claim disputed by iran is a tool of repression used by regimes from ethiopia to venezuela but the shutdown in iran which began nov 17 and remains below 20 of normal levels according to netblocks a firm that tracks cybersecurity has not only allowed officials in tehran to exert control over information about the unrest it has also cut off iranians from their friends and family abroad seemingly strengthened the trump administration s perception that its maximum pressure policy on iran is working after washington exited the nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions and further obscured what s happening and who s to blame in a middle eastern nation whose political and economic isolation has fluctuated in the four decades since its 1979 revolution that ushered in its islamic republic inside iran america s history in iran leads to mix of anger weariness marcin de kaminski a technology and human rights expert at civil rights defenders a sweden based civil rights watchdog said that internet blackouts are part of a growing trend of governments trying to shut their citizens off from the world during fraught periods they use it to limit freedom of expression or freedom of assembly and quite often it s connected to elections or conflict or to different forms of civil unrest this is happening in many different contexts from uganda to burma also known as myanmar he said ethiopia has been intermittently shutting down internet access since a failed coup in june venezuela periodically blocks access to twitter youtube facebook and other services that require internet or mobile data access as part of an effort to stymie political opposition and prevent the efficacy of mass protests india shut off kashmir s internet access more than three months ago amid political upheaval different causes and aims mass protests from iran to hong kong accelerate the protests in iran accelerated after gas prices were increased by 50 at a time when the sanctions reinstated by president donald trump have contributed to soaring inflation and stagnating salaries the world bank forecasts iran s economy will shrink by 8 7 this year a consequence of plummeting revenues from blocked oil exports and restrictions on its petrochemicals metals and mining sectors some consumer goods and essential medicines can be hard to get when i was in iran in march there were people standing in lines to buy government rations and subsidized meat said hoda katebi a chicago based iranian american writer and community organizer who has published a book about iran s underground fashion industry nothing s coming in the currency is worthless she said iran s currency has lost more than half of its value against the dollar since the trump administration reimposed sanctions katebi spoke to usa today on the sidelines of voices an annual gathering for fashion industry leaders and trailblazers that takes place near oxford england at the event katebi appeared on a panel with shirin and shiva vaqar iranian sisters who had traveled from tehran to talk about their eponymous fashion label it s very hard for us not just as emerging designers but as iranians said shiva vaqar we face lots of sanctions and restrictions sourcing fabrics finding production houses convincing them to make our pieces we have problems sending our products outside iran we don t have fedex the banking system is on lockdown still she said we try to make it katebi and the vaqar sisters who are longtime friends had not been able to communicate with each other ahead of the event because of iran s internet crackdown katebi said she has not been able to reach her family in iran iran student leader i regret 1979 attack on u s embassy in tehran amir rashidi an internet security specialist said iran has previously weighed the idea of creating different levels of access to the internet he pointed to a nov 1 interview with hamid fatahi a senior official in iran s ministry of information and communications technology in which fatahi discusses the possibility of partitioning access based on social class or occupational needs it was not immediately clear if iran is still considering such an initiative which could be used to suppress dissenting voices china and russia have either taken steps or are experimenting with ways to route internet traffic through state controlled channels iran s domestic banks hospitals government agencies and other major state infrastructure and services such as the police have remained connected to the internet during the blackout according to digital security experts and iranians contacted by usa today over the course of the last week demonstrators in iran set fire to banks and police stations and ransacked public office buildings and blocked roads according to rights groups amnesty international has said that at least 100 iranians have been killed in the protests as security services have sought to disperse crowds by firing live ammunition some iranians have found workarounds for limited internet access photos and video footage that have trickled out of iran have appeared to corroborate the claims of violence but iran has dismissed amnesty s death figures as propaganda amnesty s report is based on anti iranian sources and those sources are not reliable mohammad farahani the editor in chief of the mizan news agency an official news site that covers iran s judiciary told usa today in a direct message via social media people in iran have the right to protest just like anywhere else but those who burn banks and stores are not protesters they are rioters iranian authorities have sought to blame the unrest on agitators with ties to foreign governments iran s semi official fars new agency reported that thugs arrested during the recent riots confessed they received 60 for each place set on fire the fars report did not say who may have been behind the payments but sina toossi a researcher at the national iranian american council a washington d c based group that seeks to promote links between americans and iranians said the the iranian government does not tolerate peaceful assembly for ordinary people to air their grievances if the iran is sincere about making a distinction between protests and rioters it should at the minimum facilitate this first step in allowing people to air their grievances publicly toossi said his whatsapp groups with family and friends in iran that were always a feed of pictures and messages have since nov 17 fallen ominously silent an iranian diplomat

the city railway of berlin in germany october 7 2017 after three decades of worsening economic inequality advanced country populations are angry and they are taking their grievances to the ballot box or the streets but credibly addressing inequality also demands action regarding a less discussed facet of this trend declining intergenerational social mobility nowadays parents cannot assume that their children will be better off than they are on the contrary a 2018 oecd report concluded that in the average developed country it would take 4 5 generations for children from the bottom earnings decile to reach the mean earnings level the more unequal the country the longer upward mobility takes inequality and lack of social mobility are closely linked to geography with urban areas typically doing much better than rural ones in the united states the brookings institution reports that cities with more than one million residents have contributed 72 percent of total employment growth since the 2008 financial crisis compared to just six percent for cities with populations of 50 000 250 000 since 1970 wages in the top two percent of us metropolitan areas have risen by nearly 70 percent compared to 45 percent in the rest of the country likewise in france s île de france region which includes paris the per capital gdp per capita rose from 148 percent of the national average in 1975 to 165 percent in 2010 whereas in the less developed lorraine that figure fell from 95 percent to 76 percent over the same period this divide can also be seen in germany though one major city berlin does lag behind the rest in 2016 per capita gdp in germany s poorest state mecklenburg vorpommern was just 29 133 us dollars 60 percent lower than hamburg s 69 719 us dollars the national average was 43 110 us dollars a study by the uk 2070 commission shows that from 1971 to 2013 northern england s cumulative output growth fell by 17 percentage points whereas london s rose by 12 this has important implications for social mobility a child who is poor enough for free school meals in hackney one of london s poorest boroughs is still three times more likely to attend university than an equally poor child in the northern town of hartlepool these trends can be traced back to the 1980s when us president ronald reagan and uk prime minister margaret thatcher began to pursue structural reforms that aimed to boost competitiveness by rebalancing their economies away from manufacturing and curbing the power of unions but while those reforms were in some ways warranted recall the stagflation of the 1970s little was done to mitigate their social consequences this policy failure exacerbated by the effects of technological progress led to what the economist dennis j snower calls as the decoupling of economic and social trajectories even as gdp grew real wages and prospects for advancement stagnated or deteriorated for large swaths of the population for example the economic policy institute reports that from 1979 to 2018 net productivity in the us rose 70 percent but real hourly wages increased by only 12 percent today 14 percent of americans more than half of whom are people of color are working poor full time workers with incomes that are less than 200 percent of the poverty line with low paying jobs and little hope of getting ahead a growing share of people are stuck in a kind of limbo earning too little to make ends meet but too much to qualify for government support over time they become economically socially and culturally isolated increasingly resentful of the prosperous elites and vulnerable to appeals by neo nationalist populists and aspiring authoritarians this dynamic is most pronounced in the us where it contributed to the election of president donald trump and in the uk where it fueled support for brexit but with much of the western world having followed thatcher and reagan s example it is now afflicting all developed economies dividing societies and stunting their development none of this should be surprising in 1995 the sociologist ralf dahrendorf described the perverse choices demanded by globalization to become and remain competitive in international markets he observed countries had to use resources in ways that threatened social cohesion and political freedom these choices led for example to a new form of inequality that dahrendorf called inequalization building paths to the top for some and digging holes for others creating cleavages splitting he presciently predicted that the emergence of an underclass excluded and insecure both economically and socially would give rise to authoritarian temptations the advanced economies overriding task for the subsequent decade dahrendorf wrote was to get as close to possible to the circle of wealth creation social cohesion and political freedom yet more than two decades later most have not even attempted that feat instead following the logic of neoliberalism they focused on economic growth it is time to heed dahrendorf s call this does not mean implementing protectionist policies which would not only undermine economic growth but also potentially reinforce authoritarian temptations given such policies link to identity politics instead it requires a comprehensive program comprising proven measures for increasing economic security and social and political engagement for starters countries should reform their tax systems with an eye to reducing wealth disparities and encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation at the same time following the example of california where post world war ii investment in public universities were pivotal to its subsequent economic success they should foster social mobility through investment in education and skills training social protections targeting those who are most vulnerable to globalization are also needed as are policies to compensate for regional disparities including managed migration both domestically and internationally in the 1930s us president franklin d roosevelt s new deal which lifted the us out of the great depression included such measures as did similar programs in europe finally to counter social exclusion and fragmentation efforts must be made to strengthen civil society and to encourage sustained credible and respectful public debates it may take decades to heal social and cultural divides but it can be done the question is whether leaders will do what is needed copyright project syndicate 2019
canada has been a primary target for short sellers since 2013 the principal reasons are the country s very expensive housing particularly in toronto and vancouver and consumer debt levels that are among the highest in the world canada also has an expansive private mortgage market that supplies credit when banks won t it is hard to argue with the vulnerabilities and yet the canadian housing market hasn t collapsed i have been a very vocal short seller of canada and i am not ready to declare the trade officially over even though the stock market has reached new highs and the local currency has strengthened but i do acknowledge the big reason why the trade hasn t worked out as planned immigration canada has a very liberal immigration policy that doesn t seem to be as controversial as it would be in the u s canada allows 250 000 to 300 000 immigrants to enter the country legally every year which is about one per cent of the population no matter where you go in the country society is exceptionally diverse complaints like those recently from hockey commentator don cherry are pretty rare immigration works and it s a huge economic engine in simplest terms gross domestic product is output and if you have more people working at a constant level of productivity you have more output billy ray cyrus holds up a canadian flag during the 2019 canadian country music awards at scotiabank saddledome on september 8 2019 in calgary alberta getty images north america derek leung sure canada has a few economic issues besides a heated housing market its most important industry energy is in a sort of perma recession the government refuses to allow the construction of pipelines and prime minister justin trudeau s carbon taxes are a drag on growth still population growth mostly through immigration is strong and have made up for those negatives various economic studies have shown that countries where the population is declining suffer from low growth and low inflation conversely those with growing populations have faster growth and positive inflation the economic riddle that is japan is pretty easy to figure out deflation won t reverse until the population decline reverses japan s fertility has declined for cultural and technological reasons if japan continues to restrict immigration it will continue to experience deflation no matter how much currency they print demographics are the primary driver of inflation and interest rates and nothing else attracting talent from around the world should be a top priority for just about any country it has pretty much prevented canada from doing lasting economic harm to itself after some questionable decision making immigration alone is the primary reason that the famed canada housing short trade hasn t worked the number of people in canada rose 1 4 per cent in july from a year earlier the biggest increase since 1990 and the fastest growth among the group of seven countries according to bloomberg news canada s consumer debt problem is a different issue altogether canadians have a comfort level with debt that americans no longer do so they never really deleveraged following the global financial crisis as for real estate it was an obsession in canada for a while and i still hear crazy stories though most of the madness seemed to have happened in 2017 when home capital group needed a bailout from warren buffett and pitbull and tony robbins were hawking properties at something called the real estate wealth expo in toronto don t forget the money from china flowing into west vancouver houses for various reasons for a while people were of the belief that the bank of canada was going to boost interest rates and pop the housing bubble but now it seems like governor stephen poloz is acknowledging the risks to the canadian economy or at least realizes that he can t have too much an interest rate differential with the u s if the central bank cuts rates it is unlikely housing will go down this has been going on for more than six years it is expensive to finance a losing trade for six years you either have to declare the idea a failure or put it in the too hard pile and given that correlations across countries is pretty high the downturn in canada will probably be synchronous with the u s and the rest of the world so it s all the same trade there are still risks debt is still high and a second trudeau term is not going to make things any easier for the albertans secession is being discussed openly but population growth can cover up a lot of mistakes i m still not crazy about canada but i think any short seller at this point has to admit that this is going to happen on a timeline that is too long for most people to endure jared dillian is the editor and publisher of the daily dirtnap investment strategist at mauldin economics and the author of street freak and all the evil of this world he may have a stake in the areas he writes about

our financial results afterwards i will provide an update on our key business segments and our view for the remainder of the year we will then open the call to your questions beginning with slide 3 ongoing unfavorable market conditions in argentina our largest market and to a lesser extent in brazil continued to impact our performance this quarter passenger traffic was up slightly over 1 with over 22 million passengers traveling through our 52 airports in the quarter domestic and international traffic increased nearly 4 and 3 respectively while transit passengers fell 13 impacted by weaker traffic in brazil adjusted ebitda excluding inflation accounting declined 25 year on year with the margin ex ifric contracting to nearly 32 from 41 in the year ago quarter when we had posted a robust margin expansion of over 470 basis points this was mainly due to a bad debt provision in argentina excluding these the adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric for the quarter would have been 39 down only 170 basis points we saw better margins this quarter in armenia uruguay and ecuador along with relatively stable margin in italy in argentina we continue to experience a mix shift toward more affordable domestic traffic weaker commercial revenues and the translation impact of fx devaluation brazil in turn remains affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil we invested to 120 million in the quarter as we continue to enhance our airport infrastructure with the term goal of further strengthening capacity to capture future growth and add to the passenger travel experience funds were mainly allocated to argentina as we moved ahead with works at ezeiza airport we also made capital investments in ecuador and italy importantly during the quarter the national airports regulatory organization of argentina approved new maximum passenger use fees to be charge effective january 1st 2020 i will discuss more about this in a few minutes turning to slide 4 total traffic growth decelerated to slightly above 1 year on year from 4 in the prior quarter a good performance in argentina armenia and peru was mitigated by weaker traffic in brazil and to a lesser extent in italy and uruguay in argentina traffic was up nearly 8 year on year we saw a continued mix shift toward domestic travel which was up 10 year on year international traffic in turn posted a slight increase in august and september ending the quarter up nearly 1 year on year improving from the 6 year on year drop experienced in the prior quarter traffic in brazil remains negatively affected by the cessation of operations of avianca brasil last may which resulted in a year on year decline of nearly 12 in total traffic on a positive note in september gol launched additional routes in line with its strategy to expand operations at brasilia airport in italy traffic declined slightly over 1 year on year while traffic was up 3 at florence airport fueled by the addition of new airlines routes and frequencies pisa airport posted a decline in a similar magnitude as the quarter remained impacted by a reduction of operations by two low cost carriers our other airports posted a mixed performance passenger traffic was up 17 in armenia benefited from the addition of new airlines and flights while traffic in peru increased over 5 this quarter by contrast traffic in uruguay was down nearly 3 year on year impacted by a temporary cancellation of a route to bogotá colombia which is anticipated to resume in december together with lower traffic flow from argentina in ecuador traffic was temporarily affected by the closure of the airport during september weekend as we renovated the runway and taxiways this resulted in 4 drop in traffic more than offsetting the good performance in july and august driven by new international routes and frequencies i will now hand off the call to raúl francos who will review operations and financial results please raúl go ahead raul francos chief financial officer thank you martin good day everyone as gimena noted at the beginning of the presentation for a bit of understanding of our performance we will discuss our results excluding the impact of hyperinflation in argentina starting with revenue on slide 5 adverse macro conditions in argentina continue to impact our top line in this quarter and we are also facing some temporary challenges in brazil and italy on a comparable basis and excluding construction revenues total revenue fell 4 year on year aeronautical revenues declined almost 2 mainly as a result of the mix shift to domestic from international traffic in argentina and the fx regulation impact on domestic revenue from strong currency depreciation in brazil aeronautical revenue were mainly affected by the decline in traffic and lower aircraft fees which more than offset the increase in international traffic in italy while lower traffic was offset by higher tariff revenue growth was impacted by currency depreciation by contrast we delivered a good performance in armenia which posted another quarter of revenue growth due to increased traffic partially offset by euro depreciation moving on to commercial revenues the 8 decline year on year mainly reflected lower cargo activity coupled with lower duty free sale arising from weaker demand in argentina as well as the fx translation impact on local currency revenues to a little extent commercial revenues in brazil were impacted by lower advertising food and beverage and parking revenues while in italy the 5 local currency growth was offset by the euro depreciation armenia continued to perform well posting another quarter of commercial revenue growth supported by higher fuel demand and prices moving to our cost structure on slide 6 during the quarter total operating cost and expenses ex ifric 12 increased 7 5 year on year mainly impacted by 23 million bad debt charge recorded in argentina related to over a year accumulated past due commercial revenues and aircraft fees from a local airline cost of services ex ifric 12 fell 1 year on year mainly due to lower concession fees in our main market partially offset by higher cost of fuel in armenia now please turn to profitability on slide 7 adjusted ebitda ex ifric declined 25 year on year to 102 million in the quarter the margin contracted to 32 mainly impacted by the bad debt charge in argentina together with lower cost dilution in both argentina and brazil due to softer top line growth this was partially offset by a solid margin improvement in uruguay excluding the bad debt charge adjusted ebitda will have been 125 million and adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric would have been 39 as you can see on slide 8 our financial position remains strong as we mentioned in our previous call in august our argentine subsidiary entered into two credit facilities for a total amount of 120 million which will be used to fund our capex program in this country this transaction was particularly important in the current volatile environment as it provide us with enough financial liquidity to support business needs when investing for future growth as a result we ended the quarter with a cash position of 258 million and net debt of 953 million net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda stood at 2 1 times let me now turn the call back to martin who will go over performance of our key business segments and will comment on our outlook martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you raúl moving on to argentina on slide 9 revenues ex ifric were down 9 year on year as adverse macro conditions continue to impact our financial performance in this market first we continue to experience a mix shift to more affordable domestic destinations domestic traffic was up 10 reflecting new routes and frequencies operated by low cost carriers and increased promotional activity this compares with a nearly 1 increase in international travel which posted a temporary recovery from the 6 year on year drop observed in the second quarter of 2019 second lower cargo and duty free revenues partially offset by higher vip lounges and advertising revenues resulted in a decline in commercial revenues this quarter and third results were also impacted by the fx translation impact from the peso depreciation which impacted our local currency aeronautical and commercial revenues adjusted segment ebitda fell 42 while adjusted ebitda margin ex ifric 12 contracted to 28 from 45 in the same quarter last year excluding the bad debt charge in the quarter discussed earlier adjusted ebitda margin excluding ifric 12 would have declined only 200 basis points to 43 in the quarter reflecting lower cost dilution during the quarter we invested 104 million in argentina with funds mainly allocated to work at ezeiza and aeroparque airports as well as several other airports in the country note that the opening of the new departure terminal at ezeiza has been delayed due to a construction incident that halted construction while being investigated by the appropriate organizations we expect construction work at ezeiza to be completed during the second quarter of 2020 in the meantime we have progressed with works in adjacent buildings and the multilevel parking at this airport which is expected to be finalized by the end of this month we also advanced on the landfill for the construction of a new car parking facility on costanera avenue at aeroparque airport during the third quarter we also progressed with the construction of the new terminal building at iguazú and jujuy airports the expansion of the terminal buildings at bariloche mar del plata and esquel airports among other investments across our airport network finally a key event in the quarter was the increase of passenger use tariff effective january 1st 2020 as a result of the 2017 economic equilibrium revision the new tariff framework implies a 4 increase in international tariffs to 51 from 49 today and a 162 increase in domestic tariffs to mxn 195 from mxn 74 today in connection with the 2016 economic equilibrium revision we have filed a judiciary claim against the national airports regulatory organization for it to declare that provision null and to redo it in accordance with the applicable regulation please turn to slide 10 looking at italy total passenger traffic was down slightly over 1 year on year florence airport posted a 3 increase in traffic supported by new routes and frequencies these were mainly routes from low cost carrier vueling to several new destinations across europe as well as additional flights to paris by air france and to madrid by iberia good customer response to sas s flight to copenhagen added last april and to new flight to dusseldorf by low carrier eurowings also contributed to higher traffic at florence airport this was more than offset by a 3 decline in traffic and pisa airport as pobeda reduced its operations in the quarter late in the quarter with the launch of new routes to brussels and prague among others we also saw a slight pickup in operations by ryanair this follows the contractions experienced since april revenues ex ifric 12 were down close to 3 year on year impacted by a nearly 5 depreciation of the euro in local currency however aeronautical revenues were flat driven by higher passengers with restricted mobility fees applicable since february offset by the decline in passenger traffic commercial revenues in local currencies were up 5 reflecting new advertising and car rental agreements at florence airport as well as good performance in vip lounge revenues from the opening of new areas combined higher aeronautical and commercial revenue more than offset weaker passenger traffic our italian operations posted solid profitability despite the decline in traffic and the euro depreciation adjusted ebitda margins ex ifric 12 remained stable at 37 year on year turning to capex we invested 3 million this quarter mainly in the master plan development at florence airport preliminary works related to the expansion at pisa airport together with new equipment at both airports now an update on the florence airport expansion program the final audience intervention review by the environmental impact assessment is scheduled for november 28 2019 if the outcome of the hearing audience is favorable we expect to begin work by spring 2020 remember this project has been delayed and we ll file an appeal against the judgment that overturned the favorable environmental impact assessment decree for the project outlined in the 20140 2029 master plan finally our plan to expand the terminal building at pisa airport to accommodate pisa traffic growth remains on track with construction expected to begin during the first half of next year now please turn to slide 11 to review our brazilian operations the cessation of operations of avianca brasil represented a drop in passengers of 15 partially offset by the growth of other airlines resulting in nearly 12 year on year decline in traffic looking to offset this we have remained focused on adding new domestic and international routes for example gol in partnership with passaredo added three domestic routes at brasilia airport latam also just launched a new international routes in chile and is expected to launch two more to neighboring countries before year end we are also making progress at natal airport with latam azul and gol adding a total of nine new routes and frequencies by year end revenues were down 4 against last year impacted by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues while the exchange rate remained stable year on year aeronautical revenues were down 5 impacted by the cessation of avianca brasil s operations and lower aircraft fees partially offset by a 41 increase in higher margin international traffic commercial revenues in turn fell 4 as lower advertising parking and food and beverage more than offset higher revenues from continued good performance of our vip lounges in terms of profitability adjusted ebitda declined 29 to 4 million in the quarter with margin contracting to 16 from 21 in the third quarter of 2018 we saw lower cost dilution as we benefited from a debt recovery in the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by lower concession fee charges we have begun construction of the pick up plaza at brasilia airport which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2020 the plaza will be a central location for car hailing companies in particular uber as well as most of the car rental at the airport with drivers and passengers congregating in one location which gives us the opportunity for a new revenue source particularly for food and beverage and advertising the first starbucks in brasilia will be located here as well now please turn to slide 12 to review our uruguayan operations the cancellation of a daily route to bogotá and weak travel demand from argentina continues to weigh on passenger traffic avianca has indicated it expects the route to resume in december revenues ex ifric 12 were down nearly 4 year on year driven by lower aeronautical and commercial revenues commercial revenues in turn fell 4 reflecting lower duty free and parking revenues resulting from softer demand from argentine passengers coupled with the fx translation impact from the 13 currency depreciation lower cargo activity also contributed to lower revenues higher vip lounge revenues from new commercial agreements signed in the quarter partially offset the decline despite the weaker top line adjusted ebitda was up nearly 1 to 14 million with margin ex ifric 12 expanding 200 basis points to 51 in the quarter higher profitability was supported by lower maintenance costs and sg a expenses now to wrap up turn to slide 13 looking ahead we remain focused on executing on our long term strategy as we navigate in adverse environment in argentina and weak dynamics in brazil in argentina our key markets while we face complex macro dynamics and no near and medium term visibility we have a resilient business with a successful track record of operating in different macro cycles over 80 of revenues are denominated in u s dollars further supported by a solid balance sheet we continue advancing on our investment programs to capture additional growth when the economy recovers in brazil traffic and profitability remain impacted by weak economic growth and cessation of operations of avianca brasil avianca s former capacity at brasilian airport is expected to be gradually restored by the three other carriers with domestic operations in the airport starting toward year end in italy we expect to deliver positive traffic growth this year while we continue to monitor the evolution of alitalia and the development of brexit we have also begun work for the expansion of the terminal building at pisa airport which will continue into next year and expect to accelerate investment at florence in 2020 in conclusion while in the near term we continue to face several headwinds in argentina and brazil we remain focused on executing on our investment plans to better position the company to resume growth as micro conditions in argentina improve we are now ready to take questions operator please open the line for questions questions answers operator today s first question comes from ian zaffino of oppenheimer please proceed mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hey good morning guys this is mark on for ian thanks for taking our questions so just to start off going into the bad debt expense this quarter can you guys provide some more information on exactly how the mechanics of the expense came forward and how it works and are there any additional bad debt or past due fees that we should be aware of going forward thanks operator just as a note to the speaker line your line is unmuted you may be locally muted at your telephone mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst hello can you hear me now hello martin eurnekian chief executive officer hello this is martin again here i will ask raúl to intervene if needed the bad debt provision that we have it s an aging issue of unpaid fees aeronautical fees and commercial fees from the main carrier of argentina and the fact that we provisionally said it s a matter of aging and accounting rules basically they started missing a part of their payments since august last year and since it s been a year we had to provision that although this airline is controlled by the state and we believe one way or another this is not going to turn into a real loss mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you and then just a follow on just in terms of are there any updates to negotiations for the aa2000 concessions just given where the election results have come out and then sort of color or incremental detail there would be much appreciated thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you this is martin again as you mentioned we are in the transition to a new government this doesn t change our view regarding the state of the concession and everything that the concession has gone through over the last 20 years basically and although we now have to establish a new relationship with a new team that will come in since a couple of weeks from now starting a couple of weeks from now we still strongly believe that the extension clause will be executed at some point and we are eager to start negotiations with the entering government mark zhang oppenheimer and company analyst ok great thank you guys very much operator our next question comes from stephen trent with citi please proceed stephen trent citi analyst thank you everybody and good morning and thanks for taking my question i just had a quick one also relating to aa2000 like the gentleman from oppenheimer i m curious you gave some very helpful color on what s going to happen with aa2000 tariffs starting in january but then you also said that there s a legal dispute that is going on between you and the regulator in argentina and if you could just help me out what exactly you re disputing the tariffs that are going up in january or this is a separate adjustment on the guaranteed irr thank you martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you stephen this is martin again as you know the regulator has to review every year the concession equilibrium during this administration they haven t done it yet so they released the 2016 revision and the 2017 revision very close to each other the 2016 revision did not come with a tariff adjustment so we contested that quite strongly actually because instead of going into the administrative process we went into the judiciary to make a claim for this and then they released the 2017 revision which included 2 addition in international fees and the domestic from mxn 74 to mxn 195 stephen trent citi analyst ok got it so as we and as a quick follow up to that is it fair to say that you are going into the current discussions with some negotiating power considering that you re still owed on the guarantee for some years and the government s flag carrier is maybe still owes you some back payments how should investors think about that martin eurnekian chief executive officer well yes although we do not like to provision for a bad debt the situation we are in as with this bad debt that we have being controlled by the state we believe that it s going to give us room for negotiation in terms of how that is repaid or how is it handled and yes what you mentioned before regarding what could entail the economic equilibrium revisions and the fact that we went over the requirements of investments so far we think that this puts us in a very good position to negotiate the terms of the concession with the government stephen trent citi analyst ok very helpful martin thanks very much operator this concludes our question and answer session at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to martin eurnekian for any closing remarks martin eurnekian chief executive officer thank you everybody for joining us today we really appreciate your interest in our company we look forward to meeting more of you over the coming months and providing financial and business updates in the next quarter in the meantime our team remains available to answer any questions that you may have thank you again and enjoy the rest of your day bye bye operator duration 40 minutes call participants gimena albanesi investor relations martin eurnekian chief executive officer raul

by frank holmes ceo and chief investments officer for u s global investments quick what do hong kong chile ecuador and lebanon all have in common with one another the answer i happen to be looking for is that these countries among others are seeing mass protests at the moment hong kong appears to be the longest running at five straight months now with so many of them happening around the world all at once it raises the question are they related that depends on who you ask if you get your news from the mainstream media you re probably being led to believe that the protests are all about income inequality and that protesters are laying their grievances solely at the feet of the wealthy although this may be part of it the inequality narrative completely ignores the fact that the demonstrations are at the end of the day in response to government incompetence and failed socialist policies if you look across the spectrum of global unrest you ll find that the common denominator is not billionaires and other successful people but corrupt power hungry bureaucrats and politicians in hong kong for instance residents are demanding democratic reforms and greater autonomy in lebanon it s corruption a lack of accountability and bank secrecy laws that allow officials to steal tens of billions of dollars in public funds the protests in chile were sparked by a hike in subway fare in santiago the nation s capital reinforcing peoples confirmation bias sadly but not surprisingly all of this is downplayed in the media corruption and mismanagement don t get the blame for the unrest instead it s the rich who are cast as the villains suppressing the masses why because it reinforces some people s confirmation bias against millionaires and billionaires without the inequality narrative far left lawmakers in the u s have no other grounds to raise taxes and push for more government control and socialist policies all in an effort to solve inequality but this is faulty thinking what s more it adds fuel to the anti business anti wealth sentiment that s destroyed otherwise thriving economies such as cuba venezuela and others in some cases the bias only seems to be getting nastier last week progressive presidential candidate elizabeth warren s website began selling 25 mugs that have billionaire tears written in bold text on them savor a warm slightly salty beverage of your choice in this union made mug as you contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do the website reads such disdain for the most successful among us is a slippery slope that leads only to economic and financial stagnation not to mention mediocrity headwinds to junior miner speculation socialist policies that punish entrepreneurialism and innovation have created additional uncertainty for explorers and producers of metals and other materials that all of us depend on a couple of weeks ago i was in lima peru attending the mining investment latin america summit i heard from a number of industry leaders that mining in south america has become more challenging in recent years one of the biggest reasons why is that the burden for taking care of local communities has in many cases fallen on the miners shoulders venezuela s corrupt socialist president nicolas maduro continues to destabilize and finance radicalism throughout the continent using revenue from narcotics and mining companies often end up having to pay the price chilean lawmakers for instance are considering a new tax on mining and mineral extraction to address the country s social unrest i described earlier as you can imagine this could discourage speculation in the junior mining area think of it this way what if your gambling or lottery winnings were taxed at 50 percent or higher i suspect there would be fewer people headed to las vegas or buying lotto tickets but latin america isn t the only region causing uncertainty for miners late last month british columbia bc became the first canadian province to pass legislation based on the united nation s declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples or undrip intended to end discrimination and conflict and ensure more economic justice and fairness undrip has some bc based mining companies wondering if their rights to extract minerals on lands once inhabited by native peoples could be undermined bullish on metals and minerals be that as it may i m still extremely bullish on metals and minerals every year some 140 million people are born and each one of them will need a fresh supply of commodities for their homes automobiles appliances smartphones and more it s been estimated that each american requires an average 38 449 pounds of various minerals every year also driving my bullishness right now is the likelihood that the global manufacturing purchasing manager s index pmi looks to have either stabilized in advanced economies or begun to recover in emerging economies as i ve explained many times before the pmi is a leading indicator of commodities demand from factories and manufacturers in a research note dated november 10 cornerstone macro founder and economic analyst nancy lazar writes that the firm s model suggests a pmi upturn is underway supported by lower global interest rates and the modest improvement in china a sign that reports of china s slowdown have been overdone includes the news that sales of excavators by chinese manufacturers hit a record high this year as hopes escalate that the government will stimulate the economy by boosting infrastructure spending according to caixin global chinese manufacturers sold 196 222 of the earth moving machines essential for large construction projects almost 90 percent of these excavators were purchased by domestic firms investors have a serious case of fomo to nancy s point i might also add that progress in the u s china trade dispute has been constructive for commodities demand expectations not to mention trade this has helped spark a year end stock rally as investors catch a case of fear of missing out or fomo fund managers cash levels have dropped in november to their lowest since june 2013 on improved optimism according to bank of america merrill lynch s most recent survey of managers overseeing more than 500 billion in assets cash levels fell from 5 percent in october to only 4 2 percent this month that s the biggest one month drop since donald trump was elected president safe haven assets including gold u s treasury bonds and the japanese yen have normally receded in risk on environments and this cycle has been no exception gold prices have fallen around 6 3 percent from their six year highs of more than 1 565 an ounce in early september consequentially investors have been taking money out of gold backed etfs at a rapid pace in the week ended november 8 as much as 620 7 million was withdrawn from spdr gold shares gld the world s largest etf backed by physical gold that amount was the most for a single week since october 2016 i see this decline as a healthy correction and i urge investors to consider taking advantage of the discount after all we wait to buy certain items until black friday or cyber monday when they go on sale and are more affordable we should have the same buying habits with regard to gold and other assets thinking about buying the dip in gold watch my interview with kitco s

bloomberg that demand has really gone up since the late summer storing large sums of cash in safe deposit boxes demands a checklist of tasks those include arranging transport of the money and keeping detailed records of its location to avoid raising suspicions over money laundering if the cash ever returns to a bank account moreover failing to strictly adhere to a safe deposit firm s protocols may result in being rejected as a customer last week we reported that according to a new analysis by ubs wealth management the wealthiest investors around the world are preparing for a significant market crash by the end of next year and while that may be fine and good after all after all if the crash is great enough not a single risk asset will retain its value while a dm sovereign collapse could promptly render paper money is worthless as for gold retaining its value yes maybe but only if one owns far more lead to defend it the answer is to be found at 46 park lane a few blocks from grosvenor square in mayfair which initially resembles a private club with wood paneled walls and an ornate fireplace dating back to britain s victorian era but down a flight of stairs is one of the most secure rooms in london built by ibv international vaults the steel walled vaultand will cater almost exclusively to those billionaires looking for a place to stash their most prized possessions now that they have liquidated most of their assets we re getting calls every week about a room available for 2 5 million pounds 3 2 million a year sean hoey managing director of ibv london told bloomberg referring to an apartment size vault space ironically the firm which also has 550 safe deposit boxes on site and room for about 450 more iseven with brexit even if london turns into a socialist paradise under labour s corbyn socialist uk or not there is an unprecedented scramble by the ultra rich to park their hard assets in a safe room in a safe city somewhere in the world it has allowed ibv to open 6 locations already with many more likely coming for some it s the threat of a global recession others are avoiding bank deposits as negative interest rates force lenders to charge for holding cash said ludwig karl a spokesman for swiss gold safe ltd which operates high security alpine vaults when the financial system comes crashing down at some point in the not too distant future instead billionaires want to store their hard assets in a some place that nobody else can reach sure enough as we noted last week with the founder of the world s biggest hedge fund ray dalio not helping the global mood when he captured the prevailing anxiety last month after he warnedthere is a similar scramble for the services offered by sincona trading ag a precious metals dealer with more than 1 000 safe deposit boxes for rent in central zurich said benoit schoeni a managing director there has been an extreme demand he said it won t take too long until we re full up while it is hardly a surprise that the ultra rich are seeking places they can park their hard assets what is bizarre is that the continued demand for providers of the service suggest that much of the existing safe base is already taken consider that there are more than 25 million safe deposit boxes by some estimates in the u s alone and while they can be used for the mundane to the exotic it is safe to assume that most hold some combination of cash and precious metals a private collector held the crown of the andes made with 5 3 pounds of gold and more than 400 emeralds in a citibank box before its sale four years ago to the metropolitan museum of art even more curiously for many banks the same banks who complain they can t turn a profit any more safes are no longer a core offering one deterrent is the amount of space they require that s especially the case in london home to the world s largest population of wealthy individuals according to real estate broker knight frank in the city center few places have secure storage facilities as large as ibv s on park lane where customers can also purchase gold coins from across the globe in the u s safe deposit boxes had also fallen out of favor in recent years as banks closed off branches and opt not to install them in new ones coupled with collapsing faith in banks by ordinary individuals demand has waned in recent years according to jpmorgan chase and bank of america the nation s two largest lenders much of the decline can be attributed to clients opting to store documents online especially younger clients said bank of america spokesman don vecchiarello but said jerry pluard founder of safe deposit box insurance coverage last but not least a big source of demand for safes and vaults are central banks themselves and nowhere more so thatn in switzerland where firms have seen a surge in demand driven by central bank policy no pun intended the storage cost for cash is cheaper than negative interest rates said swiss gold safe s karl the firm offers six box sizes with the largest renting for 4 039 swiss francs 4 079 a year central banks may be putting commercial banks out of business but they are certainly a boon for safe box providers they are also a present for law enforcement and regulators who enjoy asking safe users just what it is they have to hide from the banking system indeed as bloomberg notes the proliferation of nonbanks providing safe deposit boxes has prompted some swiss lawmakers to question whether they re providing a safe haven for wrongdoing such as money laundering noting the even bigger issue is getting the cash back into your account said felix brill chief investment officer of liechtenstein based vp bank which manages about 50 billion of assets and offers some safe deposit boxes still no one likes to pay negative interest rates everyone looks for alternatives there is another risk perhaps the oldest risk in the book in 2015 burglars drilled through the wall of an underground vault in london s hatton garden diamond district making off with 20 million of jewelry a year earlier a customer of a wells fargo co branch in highland park new jersey lost millions of dollars of rare watches that had been stored in a safe deposit box the new york times reported in july the irony is that high profile heists and scandals tend to boost other firms offering safe deposit boxes as the rich hunt even more secure places to stash their prized possessions christopher barrow chief executive officer of london based metropolitan safe deposits said his company spent more than 3 million to build a facility that opened this year in southwest london hatton garden was a classic case said barrow whose firm has more than 15 000 safe deposit boxes in central london alone there was a flight to quality on the back of it there is a simpler reason why demand for safe deposit boxes will only grow we now live in a world in which assets only have value because of constant central bank intervention if one day an apparatchik forgets to push the correct button or it s a risk the world s ultra rich no longer want to live with

trade friction and world economic instability likely to continue under the present us administration thailand still aims for 3 export growth in 2020 and economic growth of 2 7 to 3 7 thailand is targeting growth of between 2 7 and 3 7 in 2020 with a growth in exports predicted at 3 it comes as economic planners are hoping for a stronger economic performance in december to round out the year with the economy recording an export contraction for the year 1 6 to the end of october while there are many causes for concern moving into 2020 including the highly valued thai baht and evidence that key trade partners are facing problems thailand recorded a 48 growth in exports to the united states in october and also posted a current account surplus for the year in the first ten months of 7 9 billion showing a widening trade surplus thailand s council for economic ministers announced on friday that a target growth rate of between 2 7 and 3 7 had been set for the thai economy as the final quarter of the year comes to a close a briefing was given by kobsak pootrakool deputy secretary general to the prime minister for political affairs private investment in 2020 predicted to be 3 13 trillion as thailand looks beyond this year it follows what has been a disappointing year for the thai economy as the government predicts that the country s exports for the year will end up contracting by 1 6 as thailand went into last year it was predicting a 4 growth rate in exports according to friday s briefing economic ministers are predicting a 3 rise in 2020 together with stronger investment from the private sector from both local and foreign concerns the committee has forecast that investment in thailand in the course of 2020 will be to the order of 3 13 trillion ministers are also suggesting the tourism sector in 2020 will see 41 8 million visitors urgent effort to disburse public budgets to drive the domestic economy especially in the last quarter a key concern is the efforts of ministers to drive the proper disbursement public expenditure budgets to boost the domestic economy the urgency of this is acute in the final quarter as the government seeks to round out the year on a more optimistic note with the tourism high season and expectations that exports in the last month of the year will show a bounce one strong reason for this is the low base level for december 2018 when exports were only 19 4 a precursor to this year s disappointing outcome october s exports dropped by 4 5 the news comes as the latest exports figures for october show a 4 5 drop for the period on a year on year basis however the country recorded a stronger current account surplus as imports for the month decreased by 7 6 leaving thailand with a trade surplus of over 506 million agricultural products except for sugar showed the biggest contraction with rice exports tapioca rubber steel related products and tvs all hit asean region exports hit hard exports to the asean region were also down quite significantly by over 9 with a drop of over 8 in exports to the european union exports to china were down by over 5 experts at the commerce ministry feel that the toughest period of the us china trade war may be over as there was a pick up in computer related exports in october exports to the united states up by 48 in october significantly exports to the united states were up by a whopping 48 in the month with a huge 97 increase in exports to switzerland new trade pact with turkey thailand in recent weeks has signed a trade pact with turkey and is expected to begin talks with the european union shortly towards a free trade agreement thailand is also looking forward to the regional comprehensive economic partnership between asean and five other asia pacific countries being ratified in february 2020 however the impact of this will take time to be seen significantly in trade patterns trade surplus expanded in the first 10 months the director general of the trade policy and strategy office at the ministry of commerce pimchanok vonkorporn confirmed this week that thailand s trade surplus for the first 10 months of the year was 7 9 billion even as exports contracted by up to 1 6 she warned that there were considerable downside risks going into 2020 notably the high value of the thai baht and a slowdown in the world economy which had impacted the kingdom s major trading partners stocks tumble this week as time frame for a us china trade deal lengthens as trump holds out it comes in a week when stock markets in the us and worldwide tumbled as the first phase of a trade deal between china and the united states announced in october was put on the long finger seasoned observers fear that under the current us administration trade stability between the us and china may be too much to expect as this us president seems from his statements to be quite satisfied with the current situation both us and chinese leaders playing hardball this week while visiting an apple supplier manufacturing facility in texas the president said this i haven t wanted to do it yet because i don t think they re stepping up to the level that i want indeed this is now a familiar pattern as both the us and chinese presidents stand back from the talks retaining veto power over deals hammered out by their aides as a negotiating tactic both leaders appear determined not to be bested trump thinks the us is winning the problem for china however is that the current situation appears to be damaging its economy more than it is damaging the united states at this point we continue to talk to china china wants to make a deal the question is do i want to make a deal because i like what s happening right now we re taking in billions and billions of dollars president trump revealed to reporters on his trip to the lone star state this week human rights in china a growing spectre not only in hong kong but more seriously in xinjiang province a growing but a significant hurdle to trade rapprochement has also emerged with stiffening of resolve by the us congress concerning human rights in china this week congress passed a bill designed to strengthen the human rights of protestors and citizens in hong kong which the us president is expected to sign into law it is bound to provoke an adverse reaction from beijing not only that but the us congress is also becoming increasingly vocal on the treatment of uighur muslims in the western chinse province of xinjiang it is reported that up to 1 million uighurs have been imprisoned in the equivalent of concentration camps but chinese authorities justify the repressive measures as it battles unrest in the area thailand shows signs of adjusting to the us china trade friction with a pick up in computer exports in the meantime thailand shows signs of adjusting to the trade friction between its two largest trading partners with the pickup seen in october in computer related exports attributed to this however it is also suffering from subdued domestic consumption and confidence despite elaborate government stimulus measures car sales dropped by over 11 in october domestic car sales for october fell by 11 3 for the fifth month in succession however two points should be noted one is that the drop was based in a superlative performance for car sales in thailand for october 2018 when sales reached the highest level in 5 years the second point is this is seen as a direct effect of strong curbs imposed by the thai central bank to rein in household borrowing focusing on new car sales which came into effect in april this year further reading deputy pm somkid warns that public speculation on the economy could undermine sentiment and confidence economy not yet in crisis says central bank governor as ministers meet to discuss trade and tourism finance minister ready to take further action to prevent the thai economy falling into recession

photo by libershot com cc by photoshopped from birch gold group historic changes in the world economic system don t happen overnight in fact they can take decades one of those changes has been taking place since may 2014 namely the weakening of the u s dollar s hegemony as the global reserve currency agora financial put it plainly in a recent issue of their 5 minute forecast stating you don t have to buy into imminent collapse to know the rest of the world wants to get out from under the dollar s thumb the data backs this dire proclamation as the dollar has lost more and more of its share of the global reserve everyquarter except one since q4 2016 according to the international monetary fund s official report at the same time the euro has been steadily gaining share the most current data in q2 2019 shows that the share of dollars held in reserve around the world has reduced to 61 63 so the world is slowly turning away from the dollar a sluggish process agora calls de dollarization they claim this process has its origins in may 2014 when russian media described a de dollarization meeting among russian and chinese leaders since then more countries have started taking part in the de dollarization process which has escalated thanks to economic sanctions the u s imposed in may 2018 to make sure the dollar stays in power the lawfare blog reports that this escalation may have incensed these countries when president trump withdrew from the jcpoa in may 2018 the united states not only reimposed on iran sanctions that existed prior to the agreement but also added new sanctions as hilary hurd noted on lawfare an estimated 700 individuals entities and aircraft are now subject to u s sanctions including over 300 targets not previously sanctioned and more than 50 iranian banks and their foreign subsidiaries but these countries may have found a workaround for these sanctions one that presents a clear and present danger to the u s dollar hegemony we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us strength in numbers may make the dollar dance nervously the list of countries that want to dethrone the dollar includes but isn t limited to russia iran venezuela cuba sudan zimbabwe myanmar the democratic republic of the congo north korea and also countries like china pakistan and turkey which are not under full sanctions but rather targets of other punitive economic measures individually these countries wouldn t stand a chance against the still established dollar hegemony but together they equal america s economic output according to agora the european workaround being developed for these countries to bypass using the u s dollar in business transactions while avoiding sanctions is called instex the instrument in support of trade exchanges instex is european special purpose vehicle spv a legal entity created specifically to allow companies based in the european union and in the future potentially elsewhere to continue to engage in business with iran without running afoul of u s sanctions germany has also called for an independent payment system suggesting an alternative to the traditional swift system just last year france may also join the fray granted instex still faces a number of hurdles in order to provide a robust alternative to swift and usurp u s economic policy that said according to lawfare even if instex fails it seems certain that the international desire for a dollar independent payment system will only grow as the u s continues to expand its extraterritorial economic policies put simply if the u s keeps pushing this growing number of countries will continue finding new ways to push back and if the u s dollar ever loses its hegemony as global reserve currency it could represent a monumental sea change for the u s economy best to prepare in case things go haywire as the dollar keeps weakening at some point silver and gold prices could be positioned to break out for example it happened in 2017 when gold rose to new heights as the dollar dropped after a simple fed announcement losing global hegemony will likely have way more impact on the dollar both silver and gold could perform well as a hedge against the dollar if foreign countries continue to move away from it

by vivek mishra bengaluru reuters australia s housing market revival will carry on into 2020 thanks to a series of interest rate cuts from the reserve bank of australia this year and another expected next year according to a reuters poll of property market analysts respondents were however skeptical about how long the rebound would last with most saying it would only be a year before the rate of house price inflation cooled off again the latest reuters poll of 13 property analysts taken nov 6 20 showed average home prices would rise 5 0 nationally next year nearly double the rate predicted just three months ago and then slowing to 4 5 in 2021 six of 10 analysts who answered an additional question said further interest rate cuts to the record low 0 75 benchmark cash rate after three rba cuts already this year would stimulate australia s housing market activity and prices significantly oh how the story has changed six months ago the key debate among many australian housing market observers was how much further prices could fall noted paul bloxham chief economist at hsbc in sydney we expect housing prices to continue to rise in 2020 underpinned by mortgage rates which are likely to stay low for a considerable period of time the rba is expected to ease once more in 2020 in its bid to boost a slowing economy that has marked nearly three decades of uninterrupted expansion all but one respondent in the latest reuters poll said that australia s housing market activity is more likely to rebound over the coming 12 months than decline again households have responded strongly to regulatory easing and rate cuts strong pricing growth particularly in sydney and melbourne is likely over the next year noted adelaide timbrell economist at anz a regional breakdown of the poll data showed sydney and melbourne australia s two most populous cities which contribute about 43 to the country s gross domestic product would lead property price growth in 2020 house prices in sydney and melbourne were forecast to rise 7 7 and 7 4 in 2020 respectively in brisbane and adelaide they were expected to rise 2 3 next year and in 2021 but analysts were skeptical about how long the sudden revival in australia s property market would last particularly given that the broader economy is still not showing many signs of improvement australia s wage price index rose 0 5 in the third quarter and consumer sentiment held below average in november suggesting that recent monetary policy stimulus has failed to spur household demand in a reuters poll taken last month economists forecast the australia economic growth to slow to 1 9 this year the weakest rate since the 1990 1991 recession followed by 2 5 in 2020 and 2021 a strong rebound in household consumption will remain elusive given that the outlook is for income growth to remain subdued in the coming quarters noted katrina ell economist at moody s analytics china australia s largest offshore property investor has imposed strict capital controls amid the ongoing trade conflict with the united states analysts said that could affect the sustainability of the recent house price recovery low foreign demand for housing and a weaker economic environment should limit home price growth our view is of national home price growth of around 5 after this initial bounce has run its course said diana mousina senior economist at amp capital in sydney on an affordability scale of 1 to 10 where 1 is extremely cheap and 10 is extremely expensive australia house prices were rated 7 by respondents in the reuters poll polling and analysis by vivek mishra editing by ross finley and alexandra hudson
international man before 1913 there was no income tax and the united states was a much freer country initially the government sold the federal income tax to the american people as something only the rich would have to pay jeff thomas yes exactly it always begins this way the average person is always happy to see the rich taken down a peg so this makes the introduction of the concept of theft by the government more palatable once people have gotten used to the concept and accept it as being perfectly reasonable then it s time to begin to drop the bar as to who the rich are ultimately the middle class are always the real target international man the top bracket in 1913 kicked in at 500 000 equivalent to around 12 million today and the tax rate for it was only 7 the government taxed those making up to 20 000 equivalent to around 475 000 today at only 1 that s one percent jeff thomas any good politician understands that you begin with the thin end of the wedge then expand upon that as soon as you feel you can get away with it the speed at which the tax rises is commensurate with the level of tolerance of the people and in different eras the same nation may have a different mindset the more domination a people have come to accept from their government the faster the pillaging can be expanded as an example the stamp tax that king george iii placed upon the american colonies in the eighteenth century was very small indeed less than two percent but the colonists were very independent people asking little from the king in the way of assistance and instead relying upon themselves for their well being such self reliant people tend to be very touchy as regards confiscations by governments and even two percent was more than they would tolerate against the left a ro rockwell jr llewellyn h best price 2 84 buy new 8 00 as of 08 22 utc details by comparison if today say texas were to eliminate all state taxation and allow only two percent in federal taxation washington would come down on them like a ton of bricks saying they were attempting to become a tax haven they d be accused of money laundering and aiding terrorism and might well be cut out of the swift system the federal government would shut down the state government if necessary but diminished tax would not be tolerated international man of course once the american people conceded the principle of an income tax in 1913 the politicians naturally couldn t resist ramping it up just look at the monstrosity that exists today in the us tax code which most americans passively accept as normal it s a typical example of giving an inch and taking a mile jeff thomas yes the key to it is twofold first you have to be sensitive as to how quickly you can ramp up taxation and second that rate is directly proportional to the level that the public receive largesse from the government they have to have become highly dependent upon a nanny state and thereby willing to take their whipping from nanny the greater the dependency the greater the whipping international man homeowners in the us and most countries must regularly pay property taxes which are taxes on property that you supposedly own depending on where you live they can be quite high and never seem to go down what are your thoughts on the concept of property taxes jeff thomas well my view would be biased as my country of citizenship has never in its 500 year history had any direct taxation of any kind the entire concept of direct taxation is therefore anathema to me it s easy for me to see simply by looking around me that a society operates best when it s free of taxation and regulation and people have the opportunity to thrive within a free market years ago i built my first home from my savings alone which had been sufficient because my earnings were not purloined by my government i never paid a penny on a mortgage and i never paid a penny on property tax so following the construction of my home i was able to advance economically very quickly and of course i additionally had the knowledge that unlike most people in the world i actually owned my own home i wasn t in the process of buying it from my bank and or government so not surprisingly i regard property tax as being as immoral and as insidious as any other form of direct taxation international man not all countries have a property tax how do they manage jeff thomas i think it s safe to say that political leaders don t really have any particular concern over whether a tax is applied to income property capital gains inheritance or any other trumped up excuse their sole concern is to tax taxation is the lifeblood of any government once that s understood it becomes easier to understand that government is merely a parasite it takes from the population but doesn t give back anything that the population couldn t have provided for itself generally more efficiently and cheaply so as to how a government can manage without a property tax we can go back to your comment that the us actually had no permanent income tax until 1913 that means that they accomplished the entire western expansion and the creation of the industrial revolution without such taxation so how was this possible well the government was much smaller without major taxes it could become only so large and dominant the rest was left to private enterprise and private enterprise is always more productive than any government can be smaller government is inherently better for any nation governments must be kept anemic international man the cayman islands doesn t have any form of direct taxation what does that mean exactly jeff thomas it means that the driving force behind the country is the private sector we tend to be very involved in government decisions and in fact generate many of the decisions laws that i ve written privately for the cayman islands have been adopted by the legislature with no change whatsoever to benefit government as regards property tax there are only three countries in the western hemisphere that have no property tax and not surprisingly all of them are island nations the turks and caicos islands dominica and the cayman islands i should mention that the very concept of property ownership without taxation goes beyond the concern for paying an annual fee to a government additionally in times of economic crisis governments have been known to dramatically increase property taxes further they sometimes announce that your tax was not paid for the year even if it was and they confiscate your property as a penalty this has been done in several countries what s important here is that with no tax obligation the government in question is unable to simply raise an existing tax if you have no reporting obligation you truly own your property and you can t be the victim of a legal land grab instituting a new tax is more difficult than raising an existing one and instituting any tax in a country where direct taxation has never existed is next to impossible international man how do cayman s tax policies relate to its position as a business friendly jurisdiction jeff thomas well there are two answers to that the first is that the cayman islands operates under english common law as opposed to civil law that means that as a non caymanian you re virtually my equal under the law your rights of property ownership are equal to mine therefore an overseas investor even if he never sets foot on cayman cannot have his property there taken from him by government squatters or any other entity such as can legally do so in many other countries the second answer is that since we re a small island group the great majority of business revenue comes from overseas investors therefore our politicians even if they re of no better character than politicians in other countries understand that if they change a law or create a tax that s detrimental to foreign investors and depositors wealth can be removed from cayman in a keystroke of the computer before the ink is dried on the new legislation billions of dollars can exit on the knowledge that the legislation is taking place now our political leaders may not be any more compassionate than those of any other country their one concern is that their own bread gets buttered but should they pass any legislation that s significantly detrimental to overseas investors their careers are over they understand that and recognise that their future depends upon making sure that they understand and cater to investors needs international man governments everywhere are squeezing their citizens through higher taxes and new taxes and don t forget that printing money which debases the currency is also a real but somewhat hidden tax too what do you suggest people do to protect themselves jeff thomas well the first thing to understand is that many nations of the world grabbed onto the post war coattails of the united states the us was going to lead the world and europe the uk canada australia japan etc all got on board for the big ride to prosperity they followed all the moves the us made over the decades for a new liberty the murray rothbard best price 3 99 buy new 6 49 as of 05 35 utc details unfortunately once they were on board the train they couldn t get off when the us went from being the largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation those same countries also got onto the debt heroin that big party is coming to an end and when it does all countries that are on the train will go over the cliff so what that means is that you as an individual do not want to be on that train if you re a resident of an at risk country you want to first and foremost liquidate your assets in that country and get the proceeds out you may leave behind some spending money in a bank account so that you have the convenience of chequing atms etc and that money should be regarded as sacrificial you then would want to move the proceeds to a jurisdiction that s likely to not only survive the train wreck but prosper as a result of it once it s there you want to keep it outside of banks and in forms that are difficult to take from you cash real estate and precious metals after that if you re able to do so it would be wise to also get yourself out before a crash as the day will come when migration controls will be imposed and it will no longer be legal to exit it does take some doing but if faced with a dramatic change in life i d want to be proactive in selecting what was best for me and my family before the changing socio economic landscape made that choice for me reprinted with permission from international man

thank you for the kind introduction and for your long standing friendship to the u s department of defense and of course this gathering would not have been possible without the vision and leadership of king hamad and crown prince salman who in 2004 first welcomed iiss to manama for the very first gulf dialogue the kingdom certainly predicted the value that this event would bring to the international community in a rapidly changing security environment during the late emir of bahrain s 1983 visit to the white house his highness sheikh issa bin salman and president ronald reagan discussed the then nascent gulf cooperation council to show the significance of partnership and regional cooperation in promoting stability and dealing with shared threats in the region and these partnerships are nothing new to the united states as early as 1790 just after the united states was founded oman received the u s ship the boston rambler into port and in 1840 the sultan s envoy sailed to new york becoming the first arab diplomat to be accredited to the united states day in and day out the u s department of defense leads by example by engaging with our partners in the region in world war ii bahrain opened up its ports to american sailors and airmen fighting in europe and in 1945 american president franklin delano roosevelt hosted saudi king abdul aziz aboard a u s navy destroyer in the suez canal for our first governmental meeting with the saudis and throughout the 1950s we concluded our earliest mutual defense assistance agreements with egypt pakistan and saudi arabia since then we have cultivated over 250 defense agreements with our friends here in the region which complement the eight significant bases we operate in the centcom aor of note bahrain graciously welcomed the u s navy s centcom headquarters in 1995 and we have enjoyed a strong partnership ever since both then and now partnership in the face of adversity has allowed the u s and our partners to overcome threats and address instability therefore it is only fitting that that the u s national defense strategy is founded on advancing partnerships around the globe this region in particular inherently understands what the united states has known since 1790 that a stable world requires a stable middle east when left unchecked aggressive regimes and malign actors cause instability and threaten not only individual nations but also the rules based international order since 1945 this order has both fostered and underpinned global economic growth stability and peaceful dialogue but we must never take it for granted as secretary esper said last month there is no inherent permanence to this system like minded nations must work to preserve and protect it against aggressive actors that prioritize malign desires and goals at the expense of this rules based international order today we encounter challenges not unlike those faced in the decades since 1945 conventional and unconventional aggression in this region threaten the rules based order and seek to threaten the global economy and break down regional security we seek to counter these trends by fulfilling the words of a much admired u s secretary of defense and state george marshall who in the wake of world war ii declared that the the only way human beings win a war is to prevent it for the united states the role that we play as a partner is critical for the defense department this means working with regional and global partners to identify efficient and effective means to advance shared objectives recognizing that building partner capacity is a journey not a specific destination now i d like to spend a few moments on three key challenges facing the united states and our partners in the middle east first the fight to defeat daesh or isis the united states has rallied together 81 nations for the defeat isis coalition and fought successfully in close partnership with the iraqi security forces and the syrian democratic forces the coalition freed 100 of isis held territory it liberated 7 7 million people who lived under the brutal rule of isis and at the hands of u s special operations forces it took down isis leader abu bakr al baghdadi and days later one of his top deputies this global coalition reflects the partnerships the u s spearheads and exemplifies how international collaboration can stabilize the region recently president trump reaffirmed that the enduring defeat of isis remains a core priority for the u s military together with our coalition partners we will continue to inflict maximum damage on the remnants of isis including denying isis access to oil fields for financial gain toward that end the united states will retain a force in northeast syria and we will maintain our presence at at tanf garrision along syria s border with jordan in iraq the united states is committed to building the capacity of the iraqi security forces to ensure they are well equipped to defend against terrorist and other destabilizing threats that pose a long term threat to iraq and the region u s forces have been training iraqi forces to counter isis since 2015 and in the last quarter of the year alone the u s led coalition expects to have trained 15 000 members of the iraqi security forces we have built on our progress by transitioning to a train the trainer approach so that iraqis can pass on their learned expertise to future generations of iraqi forces in addition we support nato mission iraq s nascent efforts to reform the iraqi security sector through targeted defense institution building even as we eliminate isis s so called caliphate the united states and our partners must acknowledge a different kind of instability the one coming from iran the second challenge i will touch on this afternoon iran has escalated its aggression in the region since secretary mattis stood on this same stage last year to condemn tehran s malign actions in the last six months alone iran has sought to disrupt the freedom of navigation and the global economy and destabilize its neighbors through direct attacks and through its proxies in yemen syria lebanon and iraq the united states remains focused on an economic and diplomatic maximum pressure campaign that has continued to achieve its objectives since 2018 despite its leadership s bluster to the contrary the heavy economic toll on tehran is undeniable the international monetary fund has assessed that iran s economy will contract by 9 5 in the coming year while iran has already seen the inflation rate grow to between 31 and 35 has lost 60 of its currency s value against the dollar and has been forced to cut 28 of its defense budget thereby cutting 17 of its funding to the irgc no doubt affecting the operations of its regional proxies at the same time president trump has made clear that the united states stands ready to meet the iranians at the negotiating table unfortunately with this may s attacks on tankers transiting the strait of hormuz and tehran s attack on aramco oil facilities in saudi arabia in september iran has made clear its intent to continue a pattern of aggressive and malign behavior that is destabilizing these attacks are not merely a regional or u s problem they are a threat to global security and the global economy necessitating an international response the united states has met this call to succeed by internationalizing the response through the international maritime security construct or imsc and supports the regional integrated air and missile defense effort led by saudi arabia headquartered here in manama the imsc has sought to deter malign activity and promote maritime security by ensuring the freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce throughout the arabian gulf the strait of hormuz the bab el mandeb strait and the gulf of oman and as our coalition diversifies from saudi arabia the uae and bahrain to the uk albania and australia it becomes easier to maintain stability as an additional effort to bring stability to the skies and to counter iran s demonstrable threat of ballistic missiles secretary of defense esper announced the deployment of u s forces such as bombers airborne intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities maritime patrol aircraft cruisers and the abraham lincoln aircraft carrier group including destroyers and fighter aircraft squadrons since may 2019 the deployment of approximately 14 000 additional u s forces seeks to deter further iranian aggression and provide the u s with a formidable array of capabilities to defend against and if necessary respond forcefully to iranian aggression as former president fdr has said peace like war can succeed only where there is a will to enforce it and where there is available power to enforce it these u s deployments augment the considerable capabilities of our partners with whom we have been working closely to provide the basis for a networked layered regional defense tehran and its proxies have demonstrated both the capability and the intent to use their missile arsenal as a tool of regional coercion the thaad battery and the three patriot batteries that we have been deploying will also counter tehran and its proxies attempts to wield their missile arsenal as a tool of regional coercion as president trump has clearly stated the united states does not seek war with iran yet i would also remind iran s leaders that they should not mistake the restraint the united states has shown to be a lack of will to respond forcefully to aggression we are dedicated to ensuring that our partners have the capabilities to address threats such as piracy in their territorial waters as evidenced by the counter piracy task force that bahrain commanded last year and we seek to ensure they have the training and equipment necessary to counter terrorist threats to their sovereignty and the systems necessary to track and defeat uav or uas incursions into their airspace an increasing worldwide concern we encourage our partners to take responsibility for their security and america s longstanding investment in security cooperation is emblematic of this between 2015 and 2019 alone the united states invested approximately 74 million in the training of 3 200 personnel working in national security including military and civilians throughout the region u s arms bolster unrivaled global coalitions and our products remain the most advanced and trusted military technology on the market over the last five years u s foreign military sales have totaled approximately 132 billion for the centcom area of responsibility demonstrative of our commitment to partner capabilities here today general mckenzie can attest to how consistently we engage with our partners the centcom commander engages with roughly 180 key leaders in one year alone more broadly over the course of the year we participate in a staggering number over 40 in this region alone exercises with dozens of participating partners earlier this month for example we concluded the annual imx naval exercise that brought together 47 nations 6 international organizations 5000 personnel 40 vessels 34 visit board search and seizure teams 19 explosive ordnance disposal teams and 17 aircraft as winston churchill once quipped one always measures friendships by how they show up in bad weather if the last six months have shown anything it s that u s forces are showing up in greater and greater numbers in the region as the weather has become stormier the united states does not profess to be perfect or to get things right all the time but our partners know what we stand for you know our values and you know that you can count on us now and in the future i would also add that over the decades america s adversaries whether they were saddam hussein s regime osama bin laden and al qaeda or abu bakr al baghdadi and his isis followers have seen what the u s stands for they have seen our values in action and they know that america will always be with our partners and allies in this context it is worthwhile to draw a contrast with the opportunistic behavior of some external actors that we are seeing here in the middle east as our partners pursue opportunities for external trade and investment in their economies and infrastructure the united states encourages them to consider the risks and track record of states such as russia and china we encourage them to consider their assistance to the murderous assad regime in syria and the regime in tehran that intently pursues malign activities throughout the region and we encourage the region to consider with clear eyes the predatory economic model that china is promoting as it pursues new projects no foreign policy no matter how ingenious has any chance of success if it is born in the minds of a few and carried in the hearts of none henry kissinger said world war ii made abundantly clear that while few men can do it alone certainly few nations can carry the burden of global security alone in conclusion i will leave you with our vision of the middle east one that is stable and prosperous one that is not dominated by any malign power or group and that is rooted in the rules based international order accordingly the united states is continuing to enhance our partnerships including through an integrated gulf cooperation council and going forward the united states will work closely with each of you our partners in the middle east to continue to make this vision of stability and peace a reality thank you very much news letter join the globalsecurity org mailing list enter your email address

cnn rock bottom interest rates have pumped up stock prices knocked down mortgage rates and supported the creation of countless unicorns in silicon valley savers on the other hand have been crushed by near zero rates some of those savers penalized by the federal reserve s easy money policies have made their displeasure known directly to the central bank s leaders janet yellen said thursday that when she ran the fed a lot of people correctly guessed her email address it wasn t very challenging to do that since it was janet yellen frb gov and fired off angry messages about how the central bank was making life miserable for them some of the most disturbing notes came from people who said i worked i played by the rules and i saved for my retirement and i have money in my bank do you know i m getting absolutely nothing yellen said at the world business forum in new york the fed dropped rates to near zero in late 2008 as part of a massive response aimed at quelling the panic gripping the american economy and financial markets it was up to us to make this the great recession rather than the great depression said yellen who led the san francisco fed during the 2008 crisis yet the past 11 years of extremely low interest rates has unintentionally punished savers money in the bank earns very little interest adjusted for inflation that money often loses value if you re a saver and you re hoping to save for retirement this is a really miserable environment said yellen who presided over five interest rate hikes during her four year tenure as fed chief that ended in february 2018 not a happy calculation for savers the former fed chief explained that bottom scraping rates mean that people seeking to retire need to accumulate substantial amounts of wealth to expect a reasonable flow of income when they stop working it is not a happy calculation to make when interest rates are as low as they are yellen said unfortunately yellen doesn t see the environment getting much better for savers she explains that this phenomenon pre dated the 2008 crisis and is a reflection of slow growth low productivity and aging demographics i do think this is the new normal yellen said adding that it seems that even today s economy needs relatively low rates to support it the fed reversed course this year by lowering interest rates in three consecutive meetings in a bid to offset weak global growth and crippling trade tensions those moves dropped the fed s target rate to a range of just 1 5 to 1 75 jerome powell who replaced yellen as fed chief recently signaled the central bank may keep rates steady for now the fed hung savers out to dry and jay powell and co seem intent on doing it again if needed peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group wrote in a note to clients on friday trump wants negative rates savers have been penalized even further in europe and japan where central bankers have dropped interest rates into negative territory ubs and credit suisse have both announced plans to charge wealthy clients to stash their cash despite the pain that would deliver to savers and retirees president donald trump has criticized the fed for failing to follow suit who ever heard of such a thing trump said during a recent speech of germany s ability to borrow at negative rates give me some of that give me some of that money i want some of that money our federal reserve doesn t let us do it beyond the punishment for savers yellen warned that this era of extremely low rates has other negative side effects she pointed to the epic pile of debt that corporate america is sitting on very high asset prices and the fact that life insurance companies and pension funds are reaching for yield i worry that could ultimately have adverse consequences for financial stability yellen said of the reach for yield the inequality problem yellen also expressed concern about america s rising inequality gap she noted that this is a long term structural problem one caused by rapid technological change and to a lesser extent globalization it is a serious economic problem and social problem yellen said it leaves all too many people with the feeling that the economy is not working for them the top 1 of households now control 34 7 trillion of the nation s wealth according to the federal reserve that s up by 611 from the 4 88 trillion they held in 1989 yet the gains have been more muted for the rest of the country the bottom 50 of families control only 2 08 trillion today up a more modest 174 from 1989 yellen said inequality has serious health consequences including rising death rates among middle aged white americans with less education this is a tremendously disturbing phenomenon yellen said against that backdrop politicians on both sides of the aisle have seized on the sense of discontent to call for radical changes to the economic system of course a lot of the political issues we face in the united states where people begin to feel the system is not working for them are traceable to it yellen said

the democrat impeachment scam of president donald trump is giving aid and comfort to the communist regime in china which is violently attacking hong kongers who seek to continue living their lives free of beijing s oppression right now chinese government sanctioned police and troops are making the former british holding a bloodier tiananmen square under the blanket of silence created by our nation s impeachment focus additionally recent reports that china continues widespread theft of u s intellectual property through our university and national science lab system while at the same time purporting to negotiate in good faith over recognizing and respecting u s intellectual property demonstrates the folly of taking chinese president xi zinping at his word in any deal the awful truth is that right now the chinese take the u s for chumps who will turn a blind eye to any offense so long as they promise to buy a few extra bushels of soybeans and corn and they are hoping that the democrat impeachment fraud will force president trump into a position where he feels that he needs a deal at any cost fortunately president trump can walk and chew gum at the same time and while it may be painful for those in the u s agricultural sector to hear the president should shut down all trade talks with china until at the very least they honor the freedom of the people of hong kong history has confirmed to china s government that they can have the fruits of freedom through an economic partnership with the u s while enslaving its own people because americans are more concerned with lebron james latest nike shoes than the child and forced laborers who produce them america has repeatedly been told about millions of uyghur muslims being placed in concentration camps for re education while these are horrifying the daily stock market tally credited to chinese trade progress is somehow more important than millions of people enslaved what many don t realize is that the united states department of labor s bureau of international labor affairs 2018 list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor lists china as one of the worse labor abusers in the world china uses some combination of forced or child labor to produce textiles artificial flowers christmas decorations coal footwear garments nails bricks cotton electronics fireworks and toys think about that as you shop for your children or grandchildren s christmas presents the very gift you give them may very well have been made by someone your child s age subjected to sweatshop conditions yet multi national corporations and their shills continue to whine about president trump s imposition of tariffs against chinese goods which force the relocation of corporate supply chains away from these slavers even worse the chinese use political dissidents as live organ donors makes planned parenthood s baby body parts business look almost humane and christian churches and believers are regularly jailed for simply possessing the bible as the atheist state seeks to assert absolute control over the minds and bodies of those who have the misfortune to live under their rule yet somehow we worry more about whether the latest iphone has a cool camera rather than the bloody fingers who are forced to produce it the people of hong kong cry out resisting this oppression begging the people of the united states to join them in their quest for freedom president trump should answer this call by ending all trade discussions with the rogue chinese government focusing instead upon strengthening trade ties with other free countries around the world additionally there should be a concerted effort by the world bank and the international monetary fund to relieve countries like kenya of the debt they have incurred due to china s belt and road initiative which has resulted in china s potential takeover of kenya s strategically vital mombasa port let s be clear the chinese government is not a benign economic partner in the world but instead is a country that has a strategic plan to defeat the united states the chinese government are not benevolent dictators as they engage in abuses against those who seek freedom of religion or opportunity the chinese have not changed for the better due to their engagement with the u s through commerce but instead have economically coerced companies like the nba espn and disney who are in their markets to become advocates and apologists for grotesque chinese policy as we enter into this christmas season americans should show support for hong kong and the chinese people by looking at the label and if it says made in china putting it back on the shelves when you go to the check out stand tell the person ringing you up that you really liked a couple of skirts shoes and electronic items but could not buy them because of the made in china label when millions of americans do this retailers will get the message and supply chains will change and as china finds that destroying freedom enslaving children and religious minorities and using political or religious dissidents as living organ donors are unacceptable in a civilized world perhaps they

editor s note the weekend edition is adapted from the daily stansberry digest this week crypto capital analyst fred marion shares three reasons why cryptos could go from the fringes of society into the mainstream in 2020 steve is cautious when it comes to cryptos but he s always looking for moneymaking opportunities to share with dailywealth readers so if you re interested in crypto investing you must read this essay the first time i bought bitcoin it took a week i spent two days setting up the necessary software on my computer then after filling out all the required forms i had to take the printouts to a nearby drugstore at the store i called a number in california from a red ancient looking moneygram phone the woman on the other end read me a code over the crackly line i took that code to the cash register along with my paperwork and cash finally a few anxiety filled days later the money transfer cleared my bank and a tiny bit of bitcoin showed up in my crypto wallet looking back i wish i bought more bitcoin is up roughly 32 times since my first purchase meanwhile since that day in 2013 the crypto landscape has transformed dramatically now you can buy bitcoin in about five minutes with resources like square s cash app and coinbase s debit card purchases you don t even need to leave your own home and of course the crypto industry has evolved to include many more options bitcoin is one of more than 6 000 cryptos you can actively buy and sell with the right tools today also blockchain developer is one of the fastest growing job categories on the planet in february a report from job search website hired showed that demand for software engineers with blockchain development skills grew by more than 500 over the past year and as the website noted in its report this demand isn t going to disappear anytime soon there was an explosion of demand in the past 12 months for developers with blockchain skills and we expect demand to continue growing as businesses begin implementing its countless use cases from digital identity and smart contracts to workforce management and distributed data storage but even though we ve seen such incredible growth in the crypto space over the past several years we ve only laid the groundwork for what s to come and as i ll explain today 2020 could make the past decade of blockchain development look like child s play can you buy anything with it that s one of the first questions most people ask me about bitcoin i point to a few websites that accept it like overstock com for example but that doesn t impress anyone even though it s easier than ever to trade cryptos they still haven t gone mainstream i m sure a lot of dailywealth readers have heard of bitcoin but how many of you actually own any that could soon change in a big way you see in the first half of next year bakkt a digital assets startup that s backed by intercontinental exchange which owns the new york stock exchange plans to test a bitcoin merchant network coffee giant starbucks sbux will be its first launch partner in other words if everything plays out as expected many folks in the u s should be able to walk into the nearest starbucks just months from now and buy an espresso with bitcoin while we don t know all the details yet we know around 75 million customers visit starbucks each month exposing so many folks to bitcoin as a payment option would be the biggest public relations boon in crypto s history it could change perceptions of bitcoin overnight the act of training starbucks more than 180 000 u s employees on processing bitcoin transactions is big in and of itself i look at it like a mandatory bitcoin education program one that will generate countless coffee shop conversations i expect bitcoin payments to become popular at starbucks especially among millennials millennials are digital natives after all a generation that came of age with the internet they trust bits and bytes in a way that older generations struggle to comprehend consider this according to a survey published earlier this year by investment platform etoro 43 of millennial online traders trust cryptocurrency exchanges more than they do the u s stock market based on an online survey conducted this spring meanwhile americans ages 18 to 34 are four times more likely to own bitcoin than those ages 45 to 64 and 10 times more likely than folks 65 and older younger folks view money through a different lens for them it s not something you entrust to the government it s something you entrust to the inalienable laws of mathematics and computer code and nearly 30 of them would rather hold bitcoin than bonds or stocks some millennials trust bitcoin so much more than the u s dollar that they ve given the dollar a nickname boomer bucks the idea of carrying around cash is just quaint to many millennials but in 2020 we could see something bigger than starbucks entrance into the crypto world as i explained in the november 15 dailywealth social media giant facebook fb officially unveiled its own crypto called libra earlier this year it s not a bitcoin clone instead facebook and its roughly 20 partners in the so called libra association seek to create a form of money with a stable value what s known in the crypto industry as a stablecoin today most stablecoins are pegged to national currencies for example crypto token tether which trades in the crypto universe under the symbol usdt launched in 2014 with the goal of maintaining a 1 to 1 ratio with the u s dollar that means 1 usdt should always be worth 1 to maintain that peg tether limited the token s creator aims to back every usdt it issues with a fiat dollar in a bank account that s where libra will be different rather than being backed by the u s dollar alone libra will be backed by several countries currencies as well as sovereign bonds since its launch in 2014 tether has grown into a behemoth its trading volumes often exceed even bitcoin s some 20 billion of tether change hands every day much of it moving capital between china with its strict capital controls and the rest of the world while i was attending vegas blockchain week last month libra came up in conversation a prominent entrepreneur in the space described libra as crypto s punching bag it s the first high profile project to take the full brunt of the u s government s anger over the birth of cryptocurrencies essentially and i m paraphrasing here the entrepreneur said this about facebook ceo mark zuckerberg and the u s government he didn t just poke the bear he stripped off all his clothes slathered honey all over his body climbed into the cave and grabbed the bear s newborn cubs from almost the moment libra was announced you got the sense that regulators and lawmakers smelled blood first they called david marcus facebook s crypto chief before u s congressional committees they wanted the company s commitment that it wouldn t release libra before new regulations were put in place i committed to waiting for us to have all the appropriate regulatory approvals and have addressed all concerns before moving forward marcus responded that wasn t good enough so government officials summoned zuckerberg to capitol hill for six hours of excruciating hearings this wasn t testimony so much as verbal abuse and it sets a dangerous precedent the idea that entrepreneurs must go to washington and beg for permission to innovate there s a reason why washington is nervous though facebook s user base is staggering between the company s four products facebook instagram whatsapp and messenger it has 2 8 billion monthly users worldwide to put that in perspective only around 356 million people everyone living in the u s and a handful of other territories and countries including puerto rico american samoa ecuador and zimbabwe use the u s dollar as at least one of their official currencies if libra launches next year it could become one of the world s largest currencies overnight and even if it doesn t happen in 2020 i believe libra will launch at some point despite the regulatory outcry and the departure of some of the libra association s high profile partners including financial services companies mastercard ma visa v and paypal pypl the opportunity is too big for it not to happen even if it takes until 2021 and another wild card could make an even bigger impact than libra in 2020 i m talking about the world s most populated country china you see while facebook s potential entrance into the crypto industry continues to meet opposition both here in the u s and abroad china is taking things into its own hands in a speech in late october chinese president xi jinping said the country intends to take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain and he noted that the country will increase investments to make it happen bitcoin prices rocketed 40 higher on the news but xi wasn t endorsing bitcoin so much as setting the table for the release of china s own digital currency and it could be coming sooner rather than later the chinese government has been working on a digital currency since 2014 and it s almost ready a senior official at the country s central bank said in august china is playing 3d chess while the rest of the world is playing checkers they already have all the systems and the network ready jack lee managing partner of hcm capital told financial news network cnbc earlier this month i think you will see it very soon in the next maybe two to three months today the dollar reigns supreme as the global reserve currency it s an exorbitant privilege for the u s one that has allowed us to run massive trade deficits for decades with few to no repercussions but if the chinese yuan is suddenly cheaper faster and easier to use thanks to nearly instantaneous settlements nothing will stop the world from switching old habits die hard but they die quickly if it means more money in people s pockets facebook s libra and china s looming digital currency both share a major problem though as far as we know they ll both be backed by the same fiat currencies we use today that means they will also ultimately inherit the biggest problem with fiat money inflation meanwhile bitcoin was designed to be the hardest form of money in history eventually the world will have 21 million bitcoin and no more that s the way bitcoin s founder an individual or group known as satoshi nakamoto programmed the network when bitcoin was first released in 2009 there will never be a 21 000 001st bitcoin it s such a finitely scarce asset that it s hard to even conceptualize what it means if everyone in the world got an equal number of bitcoin we would each have less than 0 003 bitcoin about 22 worth at today s prices if we only gave out bitcoin to millionaires the 14 million of them in the world today would each get roughly 1 5 bitcoin about 11 000 worth that radical scarcity is one of the reasons many people refer to bitcoin as digital gold it s a place for investors to store their wealth where it can t be watered down by bureaucrats so what does all this mean in 2020 we ll finally see people spending bitcoin to buy coffee and we ll see corporations and governments embracing cryptos from facebook s libra to china s digital currency bitcoin will finally go from the fringes of society into the mainstream in june a survey from statista showed just how far we have to go the market research firm polled roughly 1 000 people in each participating country to find out how global consumers think the following chart shows respondents familiarity with cryptocurrencies as you can see turkey leads the way with about one in five of the poll participants from the country saying they own crypto the depreciation of the country s fiat currency the lira has resulted in the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies over the past several years but here in the u s only 5 of the statista survey s respondents all internet users between ages 18 and 64 said they have owned cryptocurrencies that s a lot of potential market share before you even leave our country bitcoin s market cap remains small it s still only about 150 billion today many u s listed stocks are bigger than that and bitcoin s supply is limited we ll never have more than 21 million as we said so if a lot of people from just one country start pouring money into the space its price could rocket higher in fact it could go much higher than almost anyone can imagine today though it likely won t be a straight move up bitcoin is becoming more accepted every day you no longer need to spend a week jumping through hoops installing hard to understand software talking to someone on a beat up phone while standing in the corner of a drugstore and then waiting impatiently for days just to buy a small number of bitcoin we re seeing it with starbucks we re seeing it with libra and we re seeing it with china my colleague and crypto capital editor eric wade believes bitcoin will soar to 1 million in our lifetimes that s more than 13 000 higher than today s price about 7 500 while i m excited about bitcoin s prospects it isn t the biggest opportunity in the crypto space right now earlier this week dr ron paul the 12 term u s congressman and three time presidential candidate joined eric for a special crypto focused event they gave attendees a behind the scenes look at what s happening in the crypto space right now and more important eric revealed all the details about the next bitcoin this tiny crypto currently trades for less than one penny yet eric believes it will ultimately change the way you and millions of americans do business in dozens of different ways it could be even bigger than buying bitcoin for 0 05 back in 2010 if you invest just 100 in this crypto at today s prices you ll be up more than 500 000 if it climbs to 50 if you missed the event that s ok the good news is it s not too late to get all the details you see for the next few days we re offering a free replay of the event we want to make sure as many folks as possible have the opportunity to hear from eric and dr paul watch the replay right here good investing fred marion editor s note during this week s event eric shared all the details about an incredible buying opportunity in the crypto space he said it s like going back in time and buying bitcoin for a nickel back in 2010 eric believes this crypto will be on the tips of everyone s tongues in 2020 yet it trades for less than a penny today get all the details right

via international man international man before 1913 there was no income tax and the united states was a much freer country initially the government sold the federal income tax to the american people as something only the rich would have to pay jeff thomas yes exactly it always begins this way the average person is always happy to see the rich taken down a peg so this makes the introduction of the concept of theft by the government more palatable once people have gotten used to the concept and accept it as being perfectly reasonable then it s time to begin to drop the bar as to who the rich are ultimately the middle class are always the real target international man the top bracket in 1913 kicked in at 500 000 equivalent to around 12 million today and the tax rate for it was only 7 the government taxed those making up to 20 000 equivalent to around 475 000 today at only 1 that s one percent jeff thomas any good politician understands that you begin with the thin end of the wedge then expand upon that as soon as you feel you can get away with it the speed at which the tax rises is commensurate with the level of tolerance of the people and in different eras the same nation may have a different mindset the more domination a people have come to accept from their government the faster the pillaging can be expanded as an example the stamp tax that king george iii placed upon the american colonies in the eighteenth century was very small indeed less than two percent but the colonists were very independent people asking little from the king in the way of assistance and instead relying upon themselves for their well being such self reliant people tend to be very touchy as regards confiscations by governments and even two percent was more than they would tolerate by comparison if today say texas were to eliminate all state taxation and allow only two percent in federal taxation washington would come down on them like a ton of bricks saying they were attempting to become a tax haven they d be accused of money laundering and aiding terrorism and might well be cut out of the swift system the federal government would shut down the state government if necessary but diminished tax would not be tolerated international man of course once the american people conceded the principle of an income tax in 1913 the politicians naturally couldn t resist ramping it up just look at the monstrosity that exists today in the us tax code which most americans passively accept as normal it s a typical example of giving an inch and taking a mile jeff thomas yes the key to it is twofold first you have to be sensitive as to how quickly you can ramp up taxation and second that rate is directly proportional to the level that the public receive largesse from the government they have to have become highly dependent upon a nanny state and thereby willing to take their whipping from nanny the greater the dependency the greater the whipping international man homeowners in the us and most countries must regularly pay property taxes which are taxes on property that you supposedly own depending on where you live they can be quite high and never seem to go down what are your thoughts on the concept of property taxes jeff thomas well my view would be biased as my country of citizenship has never in its 500 year history had any direct taxation of any kind the entire concept of direct taxation is therefore anathema to me it s easy for me to see simply by looking around me that a society operates best when it s free of taxation and regulation and people have the opportunity to thrive within a free market years ago i built my first home from my savings alone which had been sufficient because my earnings were not purloined by my government i never paid a penny on a mortgage and i never paid a penny on property tax so following the construction of my home i was able to advance economically very quickly and of course i additionally had the knowledge that unlike most people in the world i actually owned my own home i wasn t in the process of buying it from my bank and or government so not surprisingly i regard property tax as being as immoral and as insidious as any other form of direct taxation international man not all countries have a property tax how do they manage jeff thomas i think it s safe to say that political leaders don t really have any particular concern over whether a tax is applied to income property capital gains inheritance or any other trumped up excuse their sole concern is to tax taxation is the lifeblood of any government once that s understood it becomes easier to understand that government is merely a parasite it takes from the population but doesn t give back anything that the population couldn t have provided for itself generally more efficiently and cheaply so as to how a government can manage without a property tax we can go back to your comment that the us actually had no permanent income tax until 1913 that means that they accomplished the entire western expansion and the creation of the industrial revolution without such taxation so how was this possible well the government was much smaller without major taxes it could become only so large and dominant the rest was left to private enterprise and private enterprise is always more productive than any government can be smaller government is inherently better for any nation governments must be kept anemic international man the cayman islands doesn t have any form of direct taxation what does that mean exactly we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us jeff thomas it means that the driving force behind the country is the private sector we tend to be very involved in government decisions and in fact generate many of the decisions laws that i ve written privately for the cayman islands have been adopted by the legislature with no change whatsoever to benefit government as regards property tax there are only three countries in the western hemisphere that have no property tax and not surprisingly all of them are island nations the turks and caicos islands dominica and the cayman islands i should mention that the very concept of property ownership without taxation goes beyond the concern for paying an annual fee to a government additionally in times of economic crisis governments have been known to dramatically increase property taxes further they sometimes announce that your tax was not paid for the year even if it was and they confiscate your property as a penalty this has been done in several countries what s important here is that with no tax obligation the government in question is unable to simply raise an existing tax if you have no reporting obligation you truly own your property and you can t be the victim of a legal land grab instituting a new tax is more difficult than raising an existing one and instituting any tax in a country where direct taxation has never existed is next to impossible international man how do cayman s tax policies relate to its position as a business friendly jurisdiction jeff thomas well there are two answers to that the first is that the cayman islands operates under english common law as opposed to civil law that means that as a non caymanian you re virtually my equal under the law your rights of property ownership are equal to mine therefore an overseas investor even if he never sets foot on cayman cannot have his property there taken from him by government squatters or any other entity such as can legally do so in many other countries the second answer is that since we re a small island group the great majority of business revenue comes from overseas investors therefore our politicians even if they re of no better character than politicians in other countries understand that if they change a law or create a tax that s detrimental to foreign investors and depositors wealth can be removed from cayman in a keystroke of the computer before the ink is dried on the new legislation billions of dollars can exit on the knowledge that the legislation is taking place now our political leaders may not be any more compassionate than those of any other country their one concern is that their own bread gets buttered but should they pass any legislation that s significantly detrimental to overseas investors their careers are over they understand that and recognise that their future depends upon making sure that they understand and cater to investors needs international man governments everywhere are squeezing their citizens through higher taxes and new taxes and don t forget that printing money which debases the currency is also a real but somewhat hidden tax too what do you suggest people do to protect themselves jeff thomas well the first thing to understand is that many nations of the world grabbed onto the post war coattails of the united states the us was going to lead the world and europe the uk canada australia japan etc all got on board for the big ride to prosperity they followed all the moves the us made over the decades unfortunately once they were on board the train they couldn t get off when the us went from being the largest creditor nation to the largest debtor nation those same countries also got onto the debt heroin that big party is coming to an end and when it does all countries that are on the train will go over the cliff so what that means is that you as an individual do not want to be on that train if you re a resident of an at risk country you want to first and foremost liquidate your assets in that country and get the proceeds out you may leave behind some spending money in a bank account so that you have the convenience of chequing atms etc and that money should be regarded as sacrificial you then would want to move the proceeds to a jurisdiction that s likely to not only survive the train wreck but prosper as a result of it once it s there you want to keep it outside of banks and in forms that are difficult to take from you cash real estate and precious metals after that if you re able to do so it would be wise to also get yourself out before a crash as the day will come when migration controls will be imposed and it will no longer be legal to exit it does take some doing but if faced with a dramatic change in life i d want to be proactive in selecting what was best for me and my family before the changing socio economic landscape made that choice for me editor s note governments everywhere are squeezing their citizens through increased taxation and money printing which is a hidden tax this trend will only gain momentum as governments go broke and need more cash most people

copenhagen denmark louise purup nohr s morning routine is like something out of a sustainable future when she hustles her kids into the bathroom what flushes down the toilet will later turn into the natural gas that warms breakfast on the stove the eggs come from the chickens in the backyard the coffee machine s gurgling is powered by electricity generated from the wind the water that washes the dishes is heated by sustainable sawdust pellets the recycling gets shunted in eight directions so little ends up in the dump and the commute first to school then to work is on a cargo bike that bumps across copenhagen s extensive bike lane network amid mounting global concern about climate change denmark has turned into a buzzing hive of green experimentation with efforts underway inside homes across cities and on a national scale households such as purup nohr s are seeking to limit their carbon footprints by cutting back on consumption copenhagen is trying to become the first carbon neutral capital by 2025 a full 25 years before washington and other major world cities expect they might have a shot at canceling their emissions louisa purup nohr s family in copenhagen uses secondhand cloth diapers and buys used goods so as not to fuel more production and consumption denmark s newly elected center left leaders are trying to turn the whole country into a showcase for how to go green without going bankrupt danes hope they will inspire others to follow suit creating an example that goes beyond the borders of this country of 5 8 million people the societal effort is also a measure of just how much needs to change to slow climate change for purup nohr s family being environmentally conscious has involved conscious trade offs we re not minimalists said purup nohr 31 but she and her husband have examined every aspect of their lives for its environmental impact it is a journey she said you start looking and then you look at your food and then you look at your transport when you start thinking about the environment you want to make your life fit some of their adjustments have been relatively minor they phased out liquid shampoo in favor of soap bars that don t require bottles and hung an hourglass to the shower to keep themselves from dawdling under the water they bought used reusable cloth diapers which they plan to resell to someone else when they are done with them the little red cart their 1 year old uses to toddle around is secondhand as are the rest of the toys so as not to fuel more production and consumption but the family has also made more significant lifestyle decisions with climate and the environment in mind purup nohr her husband and two small children don t travel on planes they ve committed to exploring denmark s many islands during their vacations for years to come she works part time reasoning that earning less spending less and consuming less all go together and they ve contented themselves to live in a small apartment in town instead of something like the more spacious suburban houses they grew up in the family isn t radical by danish standards they haven t cut meat from their diet for instance though they ve reduced it they rent cars from time to time and they try not to be doctrinaire about their efforts danes have long tilted toward green friendly action especially in copenhagen a city of 624 000 with a rich countercultural tradition nearly half of danes 47 consider climate change to be the most serious problem facing the world according to european union polling that s more than double the e u average of 23 and yet researchers from the norwegian university of science and technology pegged the annual carbon emissions of the average dane at 14 5 tons above the e u average and reflective of the country s wealth many scientists say a 2 tons per person annual limit will be needed to meet the 2050 goals of the paris climate accords people are always saying that denmark is doing so much said mathilde vallat 16 we re still polluting like hell vallat is among the danish students who have joined the fridays for future movement inspired by the example of 16 year old greta thunberg who comes from neighboring sweden thousands of high schoolers have marched through the cobbled streets of copenhagen decrying their parents generation for not doing enough the deliberate choice to live small purup nohr said is one way people can be kinder to the planet than their parents might have been louise purup nohr commutes with her children by bike when you start thinking about the environment you want to make your life fit she said she and her husband she said live in a world where our parents live in big houses with a lot of money and we don t we have no debt we have no savings it s a choice we could also have chosen to have different jobs with more money i think we live the good life she acknowledged that climate issues can feel overwhelming i don t read articles about the ice melting or the bio diversity crisis she said we never talk about climate with the children i think it s way too scary instead she focuses on things within her control while asking herself do you want to give a better world to your children or a catastrophe having a motivated population with families like purup nohr s has enabled copen hagen to set one of the world s most ambitious climate goals the dash to become carbon neutral within the next six years has sent city planners scouting across the baltics for sustainable sawdust turned what were once traffic choked roundabouts into tree studded miniature wildernesses and led to the construction of an urban ski slope atop a hulking new power plant that burns trash to make electricity livability and the green transformation go hand in hand said copenhagen mayor frank jensen who helped establish the climate goals soon after taking office in 2010 denmark has invested heavily in wind energy and this fall for the first time wind turbines generated enough power for the country s electricity for a full 24 hours the combined ski slope and power plant with emerald green artificial turf that can be used year round is visible from the historic 18th century city center across the harbor it s the visual centerpiece of the city s efforts to reduce emissions by shifting to greener energy sources the city has also switched from coal to sawdust pellets left over from logging and lumber production to heat the water that runs from central plants to homes a pre existing system called district heating that was already more efficient than home boilers it s only a small city said joergen abildgaard head of the team running copen hagen s climate plans but it matters because when you look at a global perspective we know that people are moving to cities we know there s a growing middle class if those investments are done in a sustainable way it s positive another major focus of the city s efforts is how people get around copenhagen officials estimate that at least 75 of all trips must be done by foot bike or public transportation to meet the 2025 goals and to reduce cars in the city center copenhagen has raised the annual resident parking fee from 1 48 to 148 jensen the mayor said the green sales pitch got more buy in after a 2011 downpour in which 6 inches of rain fell on copenhagen in less than three hours causing massive floods and more than 1 billion in damage all the citizens of copenhagen could see we have to act jensen said since the flooding city planners and residents have sought to make the urban landscape more absorbent in one stretch of streets in oesterbro a dense district just outside central copenhagen parking spaces have been given over to plots of land where trees and bushes grow wild a roundabout that was once a desolate stretch of pavement is now a birch studded parkland cars still move through but on narrowed lanes birds fly from tree to tree kids run across small footbridges in total the city plans to spend about 400 million over the course of the 11 year effort which started in 2013 but officials emphasize that economic growth has continued even while the city has invested in becoming greener and they say residents will be shielded from rising fossil fuel prices as well as from some of the damage from extreme weather events in a warming world some have suggested that copenhagen is cheating by not including its international airport officially outside city limits in its calculations and perhaps the biggest issue of all according to critics the city s plan doesn t demand much sacrifice from its citizens it doesn t require any changes at all for individuals said fanny broholm a city council member from the left wing alternative party and we need to change everything if we are to get to two tons of carbon emissions per person per year broholm said danes need to consume less something not addressed by copen hagen s emissions plans which focus on what comes out of the city s smokestacks not on the environmental impact of purchasing a plastic toy from china flying for a beach vacation to the mediterranean or eating red meat we re at 0 1 percent of emissions globally said danish environment minister dan joergensen whose government issued car is a gleaming electric mercedes sedan that s not going to save the planet but we want to show the world that we can do this

what labour s manifesto says is bad enough but what it doesn t say is terrifying jeff prestridge on what 83bn spending spree means for you it took just a minute for jeremy corbyn to sit down after delivering labour s manifesto before the emails started pinging their way into my inbox i have been watching the labour party in birmingham and have now seen their manifesto said one reader i have a learjet on standby and a place for you on it if you so desire i was tempted but i declined his offer made i think tongue in cheek he s a lovely ex biscuit maker from manchester another said i just hope anybody with an ounce of sense does not vote for labour some 400billion of borrowed money a spending spree of 83billion total madness god help us if corbyn gets anywhere near no 10 because it will be the hard working people of this country who pick up the tab for his idealistic plans spot on you get the picture already despite all the attractive commitments made in labour s for the many not the few manifesto and the measured way corbyn introduced it shrewd readers realise that if it was ever implemented it would be goodbye great britain hello bankrupt britain and hello taxes galore for some it would result in higher income tax bills for all of middle britain it would result in higher taxes on accumulated wealth be it on our share portfolios and the income dividends and profits from them or on our second homes i don t have one or buy to let properties again i have none death taxes inheritance tax would also be ramped up in fact i wouldn t rule out any assault on wealth if corbyn seized power even our tax friendly isas could be threatened as could the right to tax free cash from our pensions when we choose to access them in later life nothing can be ruled out absolutely nothing add in the likelihood of rising prices economic fragility creeping unemployment and it would all soon take us back to the dark days of the 1970s when james callaghan s labour government crippled by a plunging pound was forced to go cap in hand to the international monetary fund and borrow and borrow some more in order to save the country from rack and ruin please never again it s a view shared by peter hargreaves founder of hargreaves lansdown one of the country s most successful businessmen of the past three decades who from humble beginnings the son of a baker from clitheroe went on to build a ftse 100 listed company maybe he s viewed as one of the financial speculators that corbyn refers to in his party s manifesto who have had a free ride for too long if so that s ridiculous because hargreaves was instrumental in building a multi billion pound business that has created employment opportunities galore in bristol and has empowered millions of people to make themselves wealthier woodford excepted by enabling them to invest from the comfort of their armchair an entrepreneur par excellence in the wake of the publication of labour s manifesto hargreaves told me i love this country but i hate the politics and the entrenched out of touch establishment but his harshest words were saved for corbyn he said corbyn would soon turn the uk into the west s version of venezuela a broken south american country destroyed by left wing governments despite having one of the greatest oil and gold reserves of any country in the world the populist socialist policies pursued by presidents hugo chavez and nicolas maduro during the 2000s have left 95 per cent of its population in abject poverty the corbyn type extreme left is a far greater political worry than any other on the immediate horizon so does he have his private jet an embraer legacy on standby in case corbyn gets his grubby feet inside no 10 downing street i wouldn t leave this country he said i m too patriotic how will labour raise taxes labour s election manifesto involves a huge 82 9billion spending spree to be funded by a similar tax rise it outlined a 45p income tax rate above 80 000 and opted to call its new 50p level above 125 000 the super rich rate capital gains tax inheritance tax and corporation tax will also rise but it plans to splash the cash it raises on what it calls real change on this podcast simon lambert georgie frost and lee boyce run through the main financial points of labour s manifesto and look at how the tories pension taper has clobbered the nhs press play above or listen and please subscribe if you like the podcast at apple podcasts acast spotify and audioboom or visit our this is money podcast page of course it s easy to be enticed by the plethora of offerings in labour s manifesto in fact like a bag of liquorice allsorts there s something for all and on the surface it s all rather tasty a hailstorm of jelly baby promises so if corbyn wins next month s election there will be an end to tuition fees a move greeted enthusiastically by undergraduates among the audience at birmingham university from where he launched his manifesto there will be an extension of both maternity and paternity rights free shares for workers and a culling of the gig economy and zero hour contracts indeed if there is an economy still functioning in 2030 there is even the prospect of a 32 hour working week to look forward to pull the other one corbyn there s more greater rights for tenants free prescriptions free full fibre broadband courtesy of a nationalised arm of british telecom what would maureen lipman s beatrice bellman the star of bt s privatisation campaign in the late 1980s think about that and the introduction of a real living wage of at least 10 an hour a widespread nationalisation campaign rail mail water and energy that corbyn claims will result in lower fares and utility bills pull another one corbyn there are even pledges to address some of the campaigns we ve run as a newspaper so for example recompense for women born in the 1950s whose state pension age was pushed back without adequate notice plunging some of them into poverty and free tv licences for the over 75s if jeremy corbyn wins next month s general election there will be an end to tuition fees even a halt to bank branch closures something we ve campaigned on for more than 20 years a beefing up of the local post office service offering loans to small businesses and an end to the charging of fees for withdrawing cash from an atm all commendable pledges but for the time being mere words and probably excruciatingly difficult to deliver in truth the manifesto reads as if jeremy corbyn has suddenly discovered a magic money tree shake a branch and there s more money available or as money expert brian dennehy put it the manifesto is a mammoth wish list with a touch of lewis carroll thrown in for good measure fantasy politics that should never be enacted so where is all the money going to come from to cover this 83billion spending splurge this is where serious cracks in the manifesto suddenly start appearing although all the pledges and promises are spelt out royally there are only hints at how this great spending spree is going to be funded as hargreaves told me it s what labour s manifesto doesn t say rather than what it does that is the worry in other words watch out middle britain what 83bn spree means for you it says we ll ask those who earn more than 80 000 a year to pay a little more income tax while freezing national insurance and income tax rates for everyone else it means 1 6 million people earning more than 80 000 will pay more income tax 45 per cent income tax on annual incomes above 80 000 50 per cent income tax on incomes over 125 000 it says we will end the unfairness that sees income from wealth taxed at lower rates than income from work vat is a regressive tax that hits the poorest hardest and we guarantee no increases in vat it means higher capital gains tax rates on share sales and second homes buy to let properties equivalent to a seller s highest marginal rate of income tax a savage capital gains tax allowance cut from 12 000 a year to a derisory 1 000 higher taxes on dividend income again equivalent to an investor s highest marginal rate of income tax a reduced annual dividend allowance from 2 000 to 1 000 and what the manifesto failed to say what will happen to tax relief on pension contributions will it be cut and will the lifetime allowance and annual allowances be reduced will tax free cash remain will isas remain intact if so will the annual limit remain at a generous 20 000 per adult or will it be trimmed back in labour s defence a supporting document called funding real change spells out how it intends going about finding 83billion of extra revenue it doesn t make for easy or comfortable reading especially the section on taxing income from wealth equitably and efficiently and in places you have to read between the lines in order to understand labour s intentions business will take the biggest hit a 30billion hit and few will disagree with corbyn s specific targeting of multi national companies the likes of amazon and facebook he also says he will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies the labour party has announced plans to nationalise bt and offer free broadband for all more disappointing is the intended reversal of some of the recent cuts in corporation tax that would hurt both small and big businesses alike it doesn t take a rocket scientist to realise that higher company taxes will make great britain plc less competitive and less profitable impacting adversely on jobs and reducing the ability of companies to distribute the dividends that help fund our pensions falling profits are not good for share prices roger clarke a partner at leeds based wealth manager the private office says the uk has already experienced an exodus of companies to overseas centres the proposed increase in business taxes will encourage more to follow jason hollands a director of tilney says labour s unfriendly business policies will undermine the uk s appeal as a destination for international investment oh dear on the personal side as the for the many not the few manifesto strapline implies high earners will pay more in income tax or as the manifesto more delicately puts it we ll ask those who earn more than 80 000 a year to pay a little more income tax so annual income over 80 000 in the tax year starting april 6 next year will be taxed at 45 per cent tax while income in excess of 125 000 will attract 50 per cent tax it means 1 6million people the top 5 per cent of income tax payers will pay more tax for someone with annual income of 100 000 it will result in 1 000 of extra tax yet with labour stating it will freeze the 80 000 threshold more people over time will be dragged into paying more tax 1 9million people by the tax year starting april 6 2023 according to the institute for fiscal studies yet it s labour s plans for taxing wealth that are truly shocking and frankly rather scary we will end the unfairness that sees income from wealth taxed at lower rates than income from work the manifesto casually states under labour 1 6million people the top 5 per cent of income tax payers will pay more tax but this is code for a vicious assault on accumulated wealth more is revealed in the supporting funding real change document not to be read if alone at night it will result in higher tax rates imposed on capital gains made from the sale of personal assets shares holiday homes and buy to lets they will increase in line with income tax rates simultaneously allowances designed to mitigate tax will be reduced to a de minimis level of 1 000 the likes of the capital gains tax allowance currently 12 000 and the annual dividend allowance 2 000 so for example a 40 per cent taxpayer who crystallises 15 000 of gains on a share would currently be left with 14 400 after 20 per cent tax and use of the cgt allowance under labour it falls to 9 400 as a result of the 1 000 allowance and 40 per cent tax meanwhile a 40 per cent taxpayer who receives 5 000 of dividends is currently left with 4 025 after use of the 2 000 allowance and dividend tax at 32 5 per cent under labour 1 000 allowance and 40 per cent tax the figure falls to 3 400 hollands describes such an overhaul of wealth as alarming he predicts that if labour wins next month there will be a clamour to sell shares held outside an isa or pension before the new rules kick in he also believes such a draconian cgt regime would stop people selling and buying shares to ensure their portfolio remains in line with their objectives and risk profile very investor unfriendly holiday home owners would face a second homes tax equivalent to double what the property would attract in council tax more people would also be swept into inheritance tax as a result of a paring back in the nil rate threshold to 325 000 the level it was at in 2015 add in vat on private school fees a scrapping of the marriage tax allowance and a financial transaction tax on the city and you have a recipe for economic and household disaster all alarming as my biscuit man said in an email labour s manifesto is pie in the sky policies yes corbyn s taking the biscuit he must be avoided at all costs
23 11 2019 regime faces new crisis tehran has blocked the internet in a desperate attempt to suppress protests reports yassamine mather over the last five days tens of thousands of iranians have protested against the hike in the price of oil following an official statement issued by the country s economic coordinating committee which issued the following restrictions each motorist is allowed to buy 60 litres of petrol a month at 15 000 rials 0 10 a litre but each additional litre will then cost 30 000 rials the announcement came as a shock to iranian drivers who until this week could buy up to 250 litres of fuel at 10 000 rials per litre according to the government the revenues gained from fuel will be used for cash payments to low income households the iranian president hassan rouhani claimed on november 16 that 75 of citizens were currently under pressure and the extra revenue from the petrol price hike would go to them and not the treasury however from the beginning there was a problem no one believes claims about helping the deprived from a government presiding over a system riddled with corruption and nepotism every day iranians suffering from lack of food medicine and basic goods through a combination of sanctions and economic mismanagement hear about multi billion dollar corruption cases and money sent abroad by unscrupulous capitalists many of them close allies of one or other faction of the regime iran s oil minister and the country s ambassador to the uk both claimed that the measures were good for the environment although there is no doubt that iran s heavy traffic is creating pollution who believes claims like that from a government that is failing to take a responsible position regarding nuclear waste and radiation a government whose lack of environmental policy has led to catastrophic weather conditions in the south of the country a government that stands idly by as major lakes dry up while water from rivers is diverted to the highest bidder neoliberalism of course no one should underestimate the effect of us imposed sanctions on iran the subsequent reduction in the country s oil exports and the fall in value of iran s currency according to the international monetary fund iran s economy is likely to contract by 9 5 this year mainly as a result of sanctions however we should also remember that successive iranian governments have shown complete willingness to adhere to every dictate of the imf and global capital earlier this year hundreds of thousands of iranians received the following text message from government agencies dear head of household your subsidies have been eliminated this was a reference to the monthly cash subsidies paid by the government to many families the government claims that in order to determine whether a household is still eligible to receive them it will now take into account all income and assets as well as the ability to spend for example the number of foreign trips undertaken the government s economic advisors mainly enthusiastic adherents to neoliberal capitalism have argued that the near universal handout is not an optimal safety net for low income families in february 2018 ali larijani the speaker of the iranian parliament majles stated that supreme leader ali khamenei had personally called for structural reforms to iran s budget note once again the contradiction between this adherence of the entire regime including all its factions to the dictates of global capital on economic issues while repeating anti us slogans ad nauseum showing unbelievable levels of stupidity and ignorance sections of the iranian opposition are calling on western governments and human rights organisations to support the protestors in iran they do not seem to be aware that these are to a large extent economic protests turned political because of the iranian state s violent response sanctions imposed by the west have played a significant role in impoverishing ordinary iranians as opposed to those close to government officials who have often benefited from sanctions successive iranian administrations reformist and conservative who have followed every imf and world bank dictate to the letter have been instructed to remove subsidies so that they can truly be accepted as flag bearers for a neoliberal economy given the above do you really think these government and their human rights organisations care about the killing of innocent iranians who do you think came up first with the concept of abolishing state subsidies where in the world have they supported those demonstrating against economic hardship caused by abolition of subsidies the reality is that most iranians cannot make ends meet unemployment is rising and university graduates cannot find work in line with their qualifications many of them have three or four temporary low paid jobs often including work as uber type drivers the increase in the price of fuel will have an effect on them obviously crude oil is currently selling at 62 a barrel and although iran is one of the world s largest oil producers it has limited refining capacity while sanctions have made it difficult to obtain spare parts for oil plants no doubt the country s budget deficit has left rouhani s government little room to manoeuvre but even under these circumstances announcing such a drastic rise in the price of fuel was inevitably going to lead to protests and clearly the state and its security forces had been making preparations for the inevitable demonstrations etc internet on november 16 alone iranians uploaded hundreds of videos of protests ranging from cars blocking highways to demonstrators shouting slogans and setting fire to pictures of khamenei the following morning the government attempted to close down the internet but it did not succeed entirely by november 19 65 hours after the initial imposition of the shutdown the last remaining networks were being cut and connectivity to the outside world fell further to around 4 the iranian government s inability to shut down the internet completely has raised some important questions generally speaking governments need help from internet service providers isps and some countries such as china exercise much more control in regulating the isps regularly disconnecting the internet in various regions when a government orders isps to disable their service internet disconnection can happen in a number of ways they could shut down or unplug devices such as routers and servers or change the domain name system dns which regulates ip addresses this is known as a digital kill which can serve to allow selective government services to stay open every device on the internet including servers for websites and social media has an ip address and the dns acts like a street map where the address is used to find a particular location when a user wants to access a website a translation occurs between what the user has entered in his her computer s web browser and the machine friendly address necessary to translate the webpage if an isp provider or government stops this map it basically prevents the internet from finding addresses so it is important to learn the lessons from the way the iranian government attempted to close down the internet many activists on the left have illusions about the mobilising power of social media but we have to be aware that if and when the state finds it necessary to stop the left organising via social media or email it will be very easy for governments in advanced capitalist countries to do that even beyond their own borders there is no doubt the current protests are widespread and by all accounts most of the protestors are from the poorer sections of society despite the online shutdown i have seen footage of demonstrations in several towns and cities but surprisingly there are few reports of protests in tehran although small towns close to the capital have been the scene of violent clashes footage posted on social media suggest that up to 200 protestors have been killed since november 16 the security emergency centre of iran s interior ministry accused some internet users of rumour mongering and spreading lies about the protests on november 18 rouhani claimed that protests had been few and far between clearly a lie he also warned motorists who have blocked major roads that cctv footage will be used to prosecute them as the first footage of protests appeared supporters of khamenei in the conservative factions of the regime were claiming that the unwise initiative taken by the rouhani government was because he wants to resume nuclear negotiations with the united states khamenei had no knowledge of the latest moves according to these people allegedly rouhani was hoping that the protests would demonstrate how sanctions are damaging the economy and that they would encourage the supreme leader to engage in talks with the us and its allies such claims were disproved on the morning of november 17 when khamenei appeared on television confirming his support for the fuel price hike he stated that most iranians have a comfortable life compared to other people in the region of course it is difficult to grasp what khamenei meant by a comfortable life but this prompted speculation that he was comparing iran with syria and this was a not so veiled threat to declare a state of emergency paving the way for the revolutionary guards to take power us reaction amos harel writing in haaretz was typical of a number of commentators when he posed the following question iran s protests are just what trump wants so why is he silent according to amos the trump administration seems to be no more involved at least for the time being the president is preoccupied with tweeting against the democrats who have begun impeachment proceedings against him and hasn t had a chance to make time for iran related matters however that does not mean that supporters of us style regime change in iran have kept quiet there have been endless commentaries on saudi us and israeli financed tv stations by so called experts listening to their comments is like watching paint dry they have no real information about what is actually going on iran they just keep on repeating their irrelevant out of date views still supporting sanctions and in the case of hard line royalists war against iran as if sanctions had no role in the devastating economic situation that has led to increasing poverty and hardship as i have reported there are hundreds of videos of protests in iran showing people shouting death to khamenei and videos of security forces opening fire on protestors but i have seen just one video showing people shouting pro shah slogans there are around 20 of them and they do not look very enthusiastic it is almost as if they had been paid to do it and none of the onlookers around them repeat those slogans it is all very bizarre but the royalists keep posting the same video claiming that so many protests are pro shah do they think people are stupid apart from anything else don t they realise that people blame them the advocates of regime change from above for supporting existing sanctions and calling for yet more as much as they blame rouhani and the rest of the regime at this stage it is difficult to predict what will happen to these nationwide protests if the iranian government had hoped that imposing censorship by blocking the internet will stop the riots spreading they have already been proved wrong on the other hand

in early november china s economic planning organization the national development and reform commission ndrc removed cryptocurrencies from a list of industries that are denied assistance from local governments and that could eventually be banned throughout the country this move appears to be part of a larger effort by the chinese communist party ccp to reassert government awareness of and influence over the nation s massive digital financial markets beijing wants in on china s huge digital economy complementing the ndrc s action on cryptocurrencies is a plan by the people s bank of china pboc to issue a digital yuan potentially becoming the first major central bank in the world to provide an electronic national currency these two actions are part of a broader initiative by the ccp to shore up perceived weakness in the nation s emerging digital payments industries as well as giving the government access to valuable data that can be used for economic planning anti money laundering enforcement and domestic surveillance china s digital payments industry is currently worth 27 trillion nearly 16 percent of the country s gross domestic product with 94 percent of that market flowing through two firms ant financial s alipay and tencent holdings s wechat pay ref each of these companies have more than 900 million users and a large portion of these transactions are mobile to mobile payments that never intersect with the state run banking system requiring the government to go through private companies if it wants information on those transactions an official digital currency will likely be different while details are sparse a digital currency issued by the pboc would likely require users to download a digital wallet and then receive a cryptographic token from the central bank that verifies and attaches its unique identity to all transactions associated with that wallet it is unclear if other digital payment providers would also have to adopt this digital currency or if the government simply intends to compete against them by making the nation s official currency easer to spend however because user adoption will be key to the e currency s success forced adoption of the central bank s digital currency seems likely but this plan is about more than money it is about knowledge and power china is developing digital currency not true cryptocurrency the central bank is trying to regain the power it lost as it simply can t allow private companies to dominate payments which lie at the heart of the finance system says zhu chen a leading shanghai based financial consultant ref china s central bank governor yi gang agrees those big tech companies bring to us a lot of challenges we have to have the borderline between central bank and big tech companies ref but why currency means interest power global politics and diplomacy says the pboc s director of research wang in if a payments tool can provide the function of currency then it will definitely have impact on legal tender and affect how a country manages its currency and financial system ref put simply the chinese government has concluded that it cannot allow industry to control the nation s financial development and data this is also why china will not allow a true cryptocurrency one of the driving motivations behind the development of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin ethereum and ripple is the desire for anonymized transactions the underlying objective is to move financial interactions away from the traditional banking sector in a way that is still secure and reliable this contravenes beijing s interests and so its planned digital currency will be different using what some chinese officials have called controllable anonymity ref china s regulatory law enforcement and intelligence services will have full access to all financial data associated with the new currency while promising to keep that information away from private sector actors who would use this information for marketing and other services as long as you aren t committing any crimes and you want to make purchases that you don t want others to know about says changchun mu deputy director of the pboc s payments department we still want to protect this kind of privacy ref this added level of control is a central element of the ccp s interest in digital currency the imposition of an orwellian social credit score highlights the extent to which the government intends to monitor the daily actions and conduct of its citizens making all financial transactions observable would clearly serve this effort and would also include countless foreign companies and individuals doing business in china the pboc justifies its need for a digital currency as an effort to protect its monetary sovereignty and legal currency status ref but these principles imply that a government should monopolize money production this idea is misguided and particularly dangerous when implemented by a government already bent on controlling so many aspects of people s lives under this type of digital currency regime the government would exercise unlimited control over the means of payment for all goods and services people would have no alternative to the electronic accounts held at the central bank meaning that they would ultimately have to rely on the government to put money into the accounts and hope that the government refrains from taking the money out given governments historical track record as a steward of money ref the principle of monetary sovereignty should be replaced with one of consumer sovereignty rather than suppressing alternative forms of money the government should protect people s ability to decide what the best means of payment are through a competitive process nothing can provide as powerful a check on the government s ability to diminish the usefulness of money as allowing competitive private markets to provide money ref policy recommendations the united states cannot assert significant influence over how china proceeds with its digital currency plans it can however orient its own policies to create a prosperous environment for america s financial innovations failing to do so heightens the risk that the u s will fall further behind international competitors in the evolving financial technology markets to that end congress should remove barriers to entry in the market for alternative monies and ensure that no single type of money enjoys a regulatory advantage at minimum congress should de criminalize the use of money the bank secrecy act anti money laundering laws have effectively criminalized the use of money and the presumption of innocence is all but gone these laws force financial firms to file millions of reports per year on law abiding citizens it is incredibly expensive and appears to have been an enormous waste of resources surely congress can develop better ways to help law enforcement catch criminals while allowing financial technology companies to prosper regardless congress should ensure that producers of alternative monies are not held to higher or lower regulatory standards than traditional financial companies the bank secrecy act anti money laundering laws have effectively criminalized the use of money and the presumption of innocence is all but gone these laws force financial firms to file

catch criminals while allowing financial technology companies to prosper regardless congress should ensure that producers of alternative monies are not held to higher or lower regulatory standards than traditional financial companies amend legal tender laws congress should amend legal tender laws because they allow courts to force acceptance of a certain amount of official currency to satisfy debts even if a contract calls for delivery in another means of payment ref congress should amend legal tender laws because they allow courts to force acceptance of a certain amount of official currency to satisfy debts even if a contract calls for delivery in another means of payment eliminate capital gains tax disadvantage since the internal revenue service treats effectively all alternative currencies as assets every such transaction is a taxable event and is reportable on schedule d of the taxpayers form 1040 or if a business the analogous business tax form congress should

comments out of china and end of year buying traders said bite sized updates from around the world hydrogen hype australian federal and state energy ministers on friday agreed on a national hydrogen strategy that aims to make the nation a world leader in clean hydrogen production by 2030 the plan will pave the way for increased production of hydrogen using fossil fuels with ccs or renewable energy both for domestic use and export however earlier in the day the australia institute think tank released a report saying the consulting that backs up the strategy had massively exaggerated export potential for example the minimum sales potential to japan was set three times higher than the amount of hydrogen japan plans to use in 2030 the think tank also said that producing hydrogen from renewables in a cost competitive way was at least 10 years away meaning the production would rely on fossil fuels for now the guardian reports the ministers also discussed climate policy and the

change while china has spent more money than any other country on clean energy it s still the biggest consumer of coal and is estimated to have as much capacity in the pipeline as the current total in eu the nation could triple its per capita economic growth and standard of living while cutting final energy demand by 27 in 2050 said the etc which published the report in partnership with the rocky

china cuts the government of china has decided to reduce renewable power subsidies by 30 from 8 1 bln yuan 1 15 bln in 2019 to 5 7 bln yuan in 2020 in 2020 around 52 of the subsidies will go to wind projects 47 to solar parks and 1 to biomass plants china is phasing out public support for renewable power plants as the fall in manufacturing costs is helping renewable projects to achieve grid parity with coal fired power plants and to compete with them subsidies for large solar plants will be phased out soon and subsidies for new onshore wind projects could be removed at the end of 2021 in an attempt to reduce a subsidy payment backlog of at least 120 bln yuan in jan 2019 the ndrc unveiled new solar and wind policies for the development of future subsidy free projects the renewable projects will generate power at the same price as non subsidised coal fired power plants and will not have to comply with any quota restrictions however wind and solar projects will receive governmental support on land and financing consequently in may 2019 the commission and the national energy administration nea of china approved 250 renewable power projects totalling 20 760 mw in 16 provinces that will be developed without subsidy most of the projects 168 will be solar pv projects for a total capacity of 14 780 mw followed by 56 wind projects 4 510 mw and 26 distributed trading

beijing reuters china on friday revised up its nominal 2018 gross domestic product gdp by 2 1 to 91 93 trillion yuan 13 08 trillion keeping it on track to achieving its goal of doubling the size of its economy by 2020 from 2010 the revisions showed that the services sector contributed more to gdp in 2018 than the original data had indicated the national bureau of statistics said in a statement the change in the size of 2018 gdp will not significantly influence the calculation for the 2019 growth rate the statistics bureau said the world s second biggest economy is growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades pressured in part by a trade war with the united states china routinely revises its annual gdp data days before gdp data for 2018 was released in january the statistics bureau cut its final 2017 growth figure to 6 8 from 6 9 china s fourth national economic census released on wednesday included richer data points that showed more business entities and a bigger total asset base in 2018 than assumed under earlier gdp estimates li xiaochao deputy head of the statistics bureau told reuters earlier this week revisions to historical gdp figures will also be made li told reporters nominal gdp includes changes in prices due to inflation so it is usually higher than adjusted or real gdp massaging numbers to hit targets growth of about 6 2 is seen needed for the whole of this year and the next to meet the communist party s longstanding goal of doubling gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 despite nbs stressing that the current round of revisions is the result of the census uncovering previously unrecorded activity it s hard to ignore the fact that it will also help them meet official growth targets said julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics in a note in previous revisions real growth has almost always been revised upwards he said analysts say that without further information from the nbs it s hard to calculate the impact of the latest adjustments on the 2018 s real gdp or the gdp growth rate for that year but a rough estimate of an adjusted real gdp growth in 2018 might be 8 9 compared to an original reading of 6 6 said chaoping zhu global market strategist at j p morgan asset management in a note the government s target range for 2019 growth is 6 6 5 the economy expanded 6 4 in the first quarter 6 2 in the second and 6 0 in the third the weakest pace since 1992 if the 2018 figure is revised up the government might be more tolerant of an economic slowdown next year and set a lower growth goal in 2020 said zhu as the deadline for doubling the size of the economy draws nearer it s become increasingly clear that the target was too ambitious said evans pritchard our research suggests that political pressure to meet growth targets has encouraged the national bureau of statistics nbs to massage the gdp deflator in recent years the gdp deflator is the ratio of nominal to real gdp in an email to reuters louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics said he would not discount the possibility of the nbs massaging the data however an upward revision by the nbs is neither surprising nor unreasonable he said noting that newly included sectors in statistical coverage tend to grow quickly also outside of china revisions of the size of economies are almost always upwards he said a paper published by the u s based brookings institution earlier this year said china had overestimated nominal and real growth rates by about 2 percentage points between 2008 and 2016 reporting by gabriel crossley editing by kim coghill shri navaratnam
cybercrime is flourishing in venezuela as the country s deepening economic and political crisis drives thousands into the underground criminal world according to a report released thursday by intsights a global threat intelligence company intsights analysts discovered large scale and sophisticated efforts to steal personal information from people in latin america who work for a variety of companies such as banks and retailers and then either sell that information online or use it to collect even more data the hackers are based in venezuela and neighboring countries like colombia where many venezuelan refugees have settled these information gathering operations are particularly lucrative for venezuelans as they are sold for cryptocurrency such as bitcoin a welcome alternative to the country s own currency which has endured rapid inflation and they re not subtle about it specific information about the operations like who the hackers are where they are located and even hackers phone numbers are surprisingly easy to find according to charity wright an analyst at intsights normally experienced hackers operating in countries such as russia china and vietnam hide by taking on alternate identities and profiles to throw people off they don t seem too concerned about hiding wright said i think it s because they don t sense law enforcement will do anything venezuelan opposition activists demonstrate against president nicolas maduro in caracas on july 6 2017 federico parra afp via getty images file venezuela s hyperinflation has caused a deterioration of the national currency and in turn many venezuelans have turned to cryptocurrencies the international monetary fund says inflation of the venezuelan bolivar the country s currency is expected to hit a startling 200 000 percent this year a cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in november 2018 now costs 18 000 bolivars according to bloomberg venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in latin america with the world s largest oil reserves and vast gold deposits but decades of corruption and mismanagement under socialist rule have led its economy to ruin in the past year protests have turned deadly after crackdowns by the government of president nicolás maduro the country has also endured sizable blackouts venezuela based cybercrime efforts span a variety of common digital misdeeds including large scale email phishing efforts and malware campaigns sensitive information collected through successful hacks is then sold on various public websites and on the dark web the report indicates victims don t receive much cooperation from the government when they file complaints because of the economic and political turmoil in the country as a result local law enforcement is turning a blind eye censorship in venezuela has caused hackers to openly use social media the government blocks many websites such as cnn and el nacional a popular national newspaper even the walkie talkie app zello which was popular among venezuelans during the protests has been blocked people have turned to virtual private networks vpns which help sidestep internet censorship and the tor browser a free and open source software that enables anonymous communication but even vpns and tor have been banned by venezuela s state owned internet provider cantv venezuelans now rely heavily on social media apps such as instagram snapchat facebook and twitter as well as the messaging app whatsapp for information because of the censorship cybercriminals have also turned to social media apps to collaborate and find work wright said many of the venezuelan cybercriminals intsights found appeared to use their own photos on social media and accurate descriptions of where they live making it easy to find out who they are cybercurrency makes cybercrime easier wright said for a long time bitcoin was used by people that were into technology she said cryptocurrencies have become a widely used form of payment in venezuela according to wright the venezuelan government created its own digital currency dubbed the petro in february 2018 more than 4 million venezuelans have fled the country in recent years to escape low wages a collapsing health care system the absence of basic services and the lack of security the majority are settling in neighboring colombia with limited work opportunities many venezuelans have turned to cybercrime as an alternative for making money the venezuelan underground has risen to the surface with the anarchy and chaos of the maduro regime said tom kellermann head of cybersecurity strategy for cloud computer company vmware and a global fellow for cyberpolicy at the wilson center while the most prolific cybercriminal underground in south america is in brazil considered one of the top four most sophisticated in the world venezuela s hacking community has become more brazen because of the chaos that is currently ongoing in the country according to kellermann the report has a bleak outlook for the future the maduro regime s priorities do not include protecting infrastructure or global enterprises at the moment the report states it says that even if corporations went directly to venezuelan opposition leader juan guaído recognized as the legitimate leader by the u s and about 50 other nations there is little that his government can do to control the cybercrime emerging from venezuela

the world s two biggest economies have been locked in a bruising trade conflict for more than a year us president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping both insisted friday they would resist pressure to give ground on a trade deal that washington s leader said could be very close the comments from trump and xi came six weeks after the announcement of a phase one bargain which appears no closer to becoming a reality as the two sides tussle over tariffs and china s future purchases of us farm exports in beijing on friday president xi jinping said china wants a deal but is not afraid to fight back if necessary trump s reply came several hours later in a freewheeling live dial in to fox news in which he told on air hosts the deal was potentially very close but that xi was under greater pressure to strike a bargain he wants to make a deal much more than i want to make it i m not anxious to make it trump said he also said that when it comes to hong kong he is balancing competing interests stopping short of pledging to sign new us legislation to support the restive semi autonomous city s democracy movement us regulators on friday also turned up the pressure on chinese telecoms firms zte and huawei branding them threats to national security and barring them from multi billion dollar subsidy programs for wireless equipment and services the huawei controversy in particular has landed squarely in the middle of the trade conflict raising the question of whether trump could offer some concessions on access to the us market to grease wheels in the trade negotiations the world s two biggest economies have been locked in a bruising trade conflict for more than a year hitting each other with volleys of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods china not going to budge as we always said we don t want to start the trade war but we are not afraid xi told former us officials and other foreign dignitaries at a meeting at beijing s great hall of the people when necessary we will fight back but we have been working actively to try not to have a trade war he told the group which included former us secretary of state henry kissinger former us treasury secretary henry paulson and trump s former economic adviser gary cohn china has called for a rollback of existing tariffs to which trump has said he did not agree american officials want large purchases of us farm exports the chinese leader said the trade talks may affect the future prospects of the world economy and china holds a positive attitude diana choyleva chief economist at enodo economics said xi s comments do not mean that beijing is about to go on the offensive but it shows that it is not going to budge trump has fostered distrust among the chinese making xi very determined that there is no point to really give up much choyleva told afp at the new economy forum trump launched his trade war in march 2018 demanding that china end practices widely seen as unfair such as forced technology transfers from us firms and massive subsidies given to chinese firms xi said he told international monetary fund chief kristalina georgieva who met him earlier that china will continue on the path of financial reform and opening but the precondition is that we will ensure security of our nation s financial sovereignty xi warned that a technological iron curtain would affect the future prospect of humanity paulson the former us treasury chief told xi that 5g wireless technology could be either a potential area of conflict or cooperation for china and us i believe key to minimizing conflict is if we can develop shared standards for emerging technologies he said kissinger who warned at the forum thursday that the trade war could snowball into armed conflict told xi that our nations have to cooperate if there is to be a prosperous international order kissinger also met with the vice chairman of china s central military commission xu qiliang according to state news agency xinhua which made no mention of the other us officials sino us military ties should be a stabilizer for bilateral relations xu said according to xinhua adding that both sides should strengthen strategic communication to avoid misunderstandings and misjudgment
china on friday revised up its nominal 2018 gross domestic product gdp by 2 1 to 91 93 trillion yuan 13 08 trillion keeping it on track to achieving its goal of doubling the size of its economy by 2020 from 2010 however with the economy growing at its weakest pace in nearly three decades the revisions could fuel scepticism about the credibility of chinese data with some analysts suspecting authorities may be massaging the numbers to achieve beijing s ambitious targets in a statement the national bureau of statistics nbs said the change in the size of 2018 gdp will not significantly influence the calculation for the 2019 growth rate yet some analysts suggest the nominal nudge may actually not be so nominal after all despite nbs stressing that the current round of revisions is the result of the census uncovering previously unrecorded activity it s hard to ignore the fact that it will also help them meet official growth targets said julian evans pritchard senior china economist at capital economics in a note in previous revisions real growth has almost always been revised upwards he said indeed growth of about 6 2 is seen needed for the whole of this year and the next to meet the communist party s longstanding goal of doubling gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 such a rate of expansion would be a stiff ask given the 6 0 gdp growth logged in the third quarter the slowest pace since 1992 and with many analysts tipping the pace to slip below 6 in 2020 a slowdown in demand at home and abroad has weakened the world s second biggest economy in part with business investment and factory activity hit by a trade war with the united states china routinely revises its annual gdp data days before gdp data for 2018 was released in january the statistics bureau cut its final 2017 growth figure to 6 8 from 6 9 china s fourth national economic census released on wednesday included richer data points that showed more business entities and a bigger total asset base in 2018 than assumed under earlier gdp estimates li xiaochao deputy head of the statistics bureau told reuters earlier this week revisions to historical gdp figures will also be made li told reporters the services sector contributed more to gdp in 2018 than the original data had indicated the statistic bureau said nominal gdp includes changes in prices due to inflation so it is usually higher than adjusted or real gdp massaging numbers to hit targets analysts say that without further information from the nbs it s hard to calculate the impact of the latest adjustments on the 2018 s real gdp or the gdp growth rate for that year but a rough estimate of an adjusted real gdp growth in 2018 might be 8 9 compared to an original reading of 6 6 said chaoping zhu global market strategist at j p morgan asset management in a note the government s target range for 2019 growth is 6 6 5 the economy expanded 6 4 in the first quarter 6 2 in the second and 6 0 in the third the weakest pace since 1992 if the 2018 figure is revised up the government might be more tolerant of an economic slowdown next year and set a lower growth goal in 2020 said zhu as the deadline for doubling the size of the economy draws nearer it s become increasingly clear that the target was too ambitious said evans pritchard our research suggests that political pressure to meet growth targets has encouraged the national bureau of statistics nbs to massage the gdp deflator in recent years the gdp deflator is the ratio of nominal to real gdp in an email to reuters louis kuijs head of asia economics at oxford economics said he would not discount the possibility of the nbs massaging the data however an upward revision by the nbs is neither surprising nor unreasonable he said noting that newly included sectors in statistical coverage tend to grow quickly also outside of china revisions of the size of economies are almost always upwards he said a paper published by the u s based brookings institution earlier this year said china had overestimated nominal and real growth rates by about 2 percentage points between 2008 and 2016 source reuters reporting by gabriel crossley editing by kim coghill shri navaratnam

by carmen sesin with nbc news tech and science news hacking efforts are particularly lucrative for venezuelans as they are sold for cryptocurrency a welcome alternative to the country s own currency which has endured rapid inflation advertisement cybercrime is flourishing in venezuela as the country s deepening economic and political crisis drives thousands into the underground criminal world according to a report released thursday by intsights a global threat intelligence company intsights analysts discovered large scale and sophisticated efforts to steal personal information from people in latin america who work for a variety of companies such as banks and retailers and then either sell that information online or use it to collect even more data the hackers are based in venezuela and neighboring countries like colombia where many venezuelan refugees have settled these information gathering operations are particularly lucrative for venezuelans as they are sold for cryptocurrency such as bitcoin a welcome alternative to the country s own currency which has endured rapid inflation and they re not subtle about it specific information about the operations like who the hackers are where they are located and even hackers phone numbers are surprisingly easy to find according to charity wright an analyst at intsights normally experienced hackers operating in countries such as russia china and vietnam hide by taking on alternate identities and profiles to throw people off they don t seem too concerned about hiding wright said i think it s because they don t sense law enforcement will do anything venezuelan opposition activists demonstrate against president nicolas maduro in caracas on july 6 2017 federico parra venezuela s hyperinflation has caused a deterioration of the national currency and in turn many venezuelans have turned to cryptocurrencies the international monetary fund says inflation of the venezuelan bolivar the country s currency is expected to hit a startling 200 000 percent this year a cup of coffee that cost 150 bolivars in november 2018 now costs 18 000 bolivars according to bloomberg venezuela was once one of the wealthiest countries in latin america with the world s largest oil reserves and vast gold deposits but decades of corruption and mismanagement under socialist rule have led its economy to ruin in the past year protests have turned deadly after crackdowns by the government of president nicolás maduro the country has also endured sizable blackouts venezuela based cybercrime efforts span a variety of common digital misdeeds including large scale email phishing efforts and malware campaigns sensitive information collected through successful hacks is then sold on various public websites and on the dark web the report indicates victims don t receive much cooperation from the government when they file complaints because of the economic and political turmoil in the country as a result local law enforcement is turning a blind eye censorship in venezuela has caused hackers to openly use social media the government blocks many websites such as cnn and el nacional a popular national newspaper even the walkie talkie app zello which was popular among venezuelans during the protests has been blocked people have turned to virtual private networks vpns which help sidestep internet censorship and the tor browser a free and open source software that enables anonymous communication but even vpns and tor have been banned by venezuela s state owned internet provider cantv venezuelans now rely heavily on social media apps such as instagram snapchat facebook and twitter as well as the messaging app whatsapp for information because of the censorship cybercriminals have also turned to social media apps to collaborate and find work wright said many of the venezuelan cybercriminals intsights found appeared to use their own photos on social media and accurate descriptions of where they live making it easy to find out who they are cybercurrency makes cybercrime easier wright said for a long time bitcoin was used by people that were into technology she said cryptocurrencies have become a widely used form of payment in venezuela according to wright the venezuelan government created its own digital currency dubbed the petro in february 2018 more than 4 million venezuelans have fled the country in recent years to escape low wages a collapsing health care system the absence of basic services and the lack of security the majority are settling in neighboring colombia with limited work opportunities many venezuelans have turned to cybercrime as an alternative for making money the venezuelan underground has risen to the surface with the anarchy and chaos of the maduro regime said tom kellermann head of cybersecurity strategy for cloud computer company vmware and a global fellow for cyberpolicy at the wilson center while the most prolific cybercriminal underground in south america is in brazil considered one of the top four most sophisticated in the world venezuela s hacking community has become more brazen because of the chaos that is currently ongoing in the country according to kellermann advertisement the report has a bleak outlook for the future the maduro regime s priorities do not include protecting infrastructure or global enterprises at the moment the report states it says that even if corporations went directly to venezuelan opposition leader juan guaído recognized as the legitimate leader by the u s and about 50 other nations there is little that his government can do to control the cybercrime emerging from venezuela

for the average 18 to 35 year old nigerian the words bretton woods probably don t mean much however every time they re charged for atm withdrawals or incur fees for international money transfers these two words are a stark reminder that nigeria s financial system was not designed with them in mind the current financial system that underpins the nigerian economy was created at the 1944 bretton woods conference held in the usa this conference created the financial system we use today establishing the rules that govern the global economy it created a new way of managing and exchanging value between individuals and organisations primarily based on the needs of developed countries and markets and in case you were wondering there were no nigerians at the table according to luno s recent future of money report nigerians between the ages of 18 and 35 want a new deal from the global financial system when asked how they felt about their current financial situation only 39 percent of nigerians between 18 and 35 said they felt secure the lowest of all the countries surveyed google trends data also revealed that nigerians record the highest number of google searches for bitcoin in the world as much as this highlights the curiosity of a young tech savvy generation a deeper look at this statistic speaks to a desire for change of the seven countries profiled in the future of money report nigerians were the most conscious of the fees they paid on card transactions and mobile banking ninety percent of nigerians were aware of credit and debit card fees compared to 51 percent of their peers in the uk and 77 percent in france while cash is still king in nigeria digital transactions are fast becoming the default method of payment for most young people thanks to convenience speed and other advantages but excessive fees are not helping the much needed transition cheaper means of exchange cryptocurrencies however are starting to offer nigerians an alternative take cross border payments for example which can be so slow and expensive with traditional banks in some cases it is much easier and cheaper to take physical cash on an aeroplane and give it to the recipient than to make a bank transfer with cryptocurrencies users have a secure instant and nearly free option for cross border financial transactions currency fluctuations the future of money report also revealed that 3 out of 5 nigerians don t believe the value of the naira will increase over the next 12 months nigeria s dependency on its oil sector has always left the naira vulnerable to price fluctuations if you ask nigerians whether they prefer to work with the us dollar usd or naira they often select the former due to its stability there is still a desire to avoid the charges that come with using a foreign currency stablecoins which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets such as gold and more stable fiat currencies like the us dollar offer the best of both worlds they offer the low volatility that comes with familiar stable assets as well as the low transaction fees associated with using local currency over the last few decades the value destruction of currency fluctuations to nigeria has been billions if not trillions of dollars however with stablecoins the next generation of nigerians are being presented with an opportunity to write a different story investment purposes cryptocurrencies are yet to achieve mainstream adoption in nigeria but that hasn t stopped early adopters from trying to get their hands on it and explore the different use cases offered for example bitcoin mirrors the characteristics of one of the world s most valuable assets gold it has also proved to be a profitable investment for many people across the world in general cryptocurrencies are rare assets that have the potential to increase in value they are also malleable and can be broken down into smaller units without losing their value cryptocurrencies are almost impossible to counterfeit which make them a very desirable asset to own for long term investment however as with any new asset class there will always be a higher level of volatility compared with traditional trading the good thing is that as the benefits become clear especially to developing markets disadvantaged by traditional financial systems the more people and businesses will hold the coins for their utility value this will in turn reduce speculation and volatility a new world although nigeria didn t have a seat at the table when the current financial system was being constructed in 1944 the next generation is eager to take back control of its future with the open and decentralised nature of cryptocurrencies there s an understanding that nigerians don t have to be left behind in the global economy over the next century there is undoubtedly a bubble of interest around cryptocurrencies in nigeria but with the option of cheaper money transfers greater currency stability and new investment opportunities it will not be too long before this so called bubble becomes commonplace in nigeria about the author marius reitz is the general manager for africa at luno a company facilitating

key point tehran didn t anticipate that there would be such a large and firm public backlash widespread protests gripped iran for a third straight day following a government mandated fuel price increase of 50 percent and fuel rationing program introduced nov 15 demonstrators protesting the price hikes have burned and looted more than 100 banks and shops across the country barricaded highways and massed in the grand bazaar a major cultural center in tehran thus far the government has responded by shutting down the country s internet and instituting violent crackdowns despite these protests the largest and most widespread since the united states pulled out of the nuclear deal with iran and instituted a campaign of economic sanctions against the country it s unlikely that the current round of demonstrations will threaten the continuity of the iranian government but the eventual fallout from the protests and the government s response could prove a seminal moment for iran s post sanctions strategy a desperate measure for a desperate time the government s decision to boost fuel prices shows the degree of strain u s sanctions have put on the iranian economy already iranian efforts to manage the large scale protests in lebanon and iraq through its proxies and political influence have stretched its resources and tehran certainly anticipated that instituting the first fuel price increase since 2015 had the potential to spark protests after all when tehran introduced a fuel rationing plan in 2007 riots followed a 2017 proposal to increase fuel prices drew such opposition that it was not implemented so given that its hands are already full in dealing with regional protest movements and the strong previous resistance to fuel price increases it follows that iran wouldn t have introduced the hike this week unless it was an absolute necessity tellingly in a nov 17 cabinet meeting president hassan rouhani used an economic argument to justify the increase he argued that tehran could only afford to continue assisting the poorest iranians who bear the biggest burden of u s economic sanctions if it increased oil exports an option he acknowledged was not realistic increased taxes or cut subsidies rouhani had long criticized the fuel subsidy scheme as too expensive the international monetary fund estimated that fuel subsidies alone represented 1 6 percent of iranian gross domestic product in the 2017 18 fiscal year and recommended that tehran take steps to reduce them despite the economic prudence of reducing the subsidies the fuel price increases are proving hard to swallow for a society already dealing with significant inflation and shortages of food medicine and other basic goods the political weight will fall on rouhani the political blame for the fuel price hike will fall on rouhani and his moderate allies who control the presidency and much of parliament with parliamentary elections approaching in february 2020 fuel prices appear to be a tailor made issue for iran s hard line conservatives who are seeking to regain the seats that they lost in 2016 along with criticizing rouhani for the decision they will try to pin the blame for the poor economy on foreign influences even though rouhani and his allies likely will pay a price for the decision he has the backing of supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei he along with the rest of iran s leadership across the political spectrum recognize the need for economic prudence under khamenei s resistance economy strategy to weather sanctions pressure the supreme leader has come out in support of the decision which was ultimately made by the supreme council of economic coordination khameini set up that panel jointly chaired by rouhani parliamentary speaker ali larijani a traditional conservative and judiciary head ebrahim raisi a more hard line conservative in june 2018 authorizing it to make extraordinary economic decisions to combat the effects of sanctions and present a united political front in the face of u s pressure nevertheless media reports from iran indicate that a handful of lawmakers upset with the price hike and unrest have begun to gather support to try to impeach rouhani and dismiss larijani what s ahead for the protests protests in iran are not uncommon with significant bouts of unrest such as the 2017 18 economic protests and the 2009 green movement protests lasting for weeks at a time given the broader sense of economic angst currently pervading iran the fuel protests could well evolve into a historically comparable episode because of the history of protest the government has developed tools to manage unrest using a combination of crackdowns by security forces and control of information this makes it unlikely that the fuel protests will grow to the point of upending the iranian political environment or prompting resignations from the government which is an explicit goal of the u s sanctions strategy however the effects of the current unrest could provide a defining moment for iranian strategic thinking much like the 2012 chicken crisis and subsequent decline in the value of the rial precipitated by a round of sanctions in 2012 pushed iran to return to negotiations with the united states soon thereafter the fuel protests along with generally poor economic conditions in iran are making it clear that the u s maximum pressure sanctions strategy has created a situation for tehran that is unsustainable in the long run it will continue to put out feelers for negotiations with the west and entertain reentering talks with the united states in exchange for economic relief but it wants to be able to do so on its terms and when it has leverage it would rather not do so while president donald trump still occupies the white house hoping that a successor would be more pliant and amenable in future talks in the meantime iran will continue to take action however unpopular to keep the economy afloat and crack down on opposition to its austerity measures it will use the gradual ramping up of its nuclear program both as leverage in future talks and to raise the cost for the united states if the white house does not grant some financial relief in the short term iran could also opt to resume its aggressive campaign targeting oil exports and other regional targets particularly if the hard line parliamentary candidates perform well in elections nevertheless iran will continue to do whatever it can to keep its economy afloat as it waits to see whether trump will return to office after u s elections in
