the european union is negotiating a lucrative agreement with the four founding nations of the south american trade bloc mercosur argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay the deal will probably be completed this year and immediately become the eu s largest trade agreement ever to learn more about this history making deal read our article will brazil s new president open the door to the holy roman empire god s church has prophesied for over 60 years of a strong relationship between europe and south america through this mutually beneficial partnership latin america is helping to create the holy roman empire your bible shows that such an alliance will lead to some very dark days for the united states of america if the people don t heed god s warning which the vast majority certainly won t we all need to realize that this is going to affect our lives in a way that perhaps nothing ever has before u s trade policy is leading to a trade war that will inflict massive damage on our country so says your bible the only way to avert the impending crisis is by looking to the great god who inspired bible prophecy and who gives us direction on how to be blessed instead of cursed whether we receive overwhelming blessings is our choice when the eu mercosur trade deal is finalized it s very likely that the eu will soon afterward be pared down from 27 nations not counting britain which is in the process of exiting to just 10 right now the eu is too divided even in religion while latin america is uniformly catholic the eu must achieve similar unity which is why it must be reduced to 10 members at the head of the smaller european entity will be a strongman and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up daniel 8 23 this powerful leader will probably personally select the 10 nations that form the new holy roman empire americans had better be watching these world events we will be impacted based on prophecy it appears that the coming european superpower will be the greatest in the world at least for a time in our article 2019 may bring europe s biggest trade deal yet we wrote eu officials believe that world trade will drastically change in 2019 as they sign a trade agreement with south america in recent years the eu has finalized trade pacts with chile peru colombia mexico panama costa rica honduras and nicaragua but since 2000 the potential enormous trade deal with mercosur has remained elusive now after concluding a trade agreement with japan the eu intends to reach an agreement with the south american confederation of mercosur as soon as possible handelsblatt reported trumpet translation throughout the trade agreement with mercosur would mark the eu s largest trade deal ever it is predicted to far surpass the agreement with japan that comes into force on february 1 to create the world s largest trade bloc the eu s new top priority is to urgently conclude trade deals with the rest of the world with more than 260 million people and a gross domestic product of approximately 2 9 trillion mercosur is one of the world s largest economic blocs europe urgently needs to conclude a deal with south america to make its trade policy work latin america is full of abundant resources germany the dominant force in europe knows this decades of accurate forecasting current events match what our predecessor the late educator and theologian herbert w armstrong prophesied for many years his plain truth magazine of may 1962 declared that the united states is going to be left out in the cold as two gigantic trade blocs europe and latin america mesh together and begin calling the shots in world commerce he warned of a brutal trade war in which europe and south america assert dominance even over russia and china fifty six years later we can state with confidence he was right in october 1957 the plain truth declared latin american nations will join in with the european revival of the old roman empire no qualifications just a stone cold guarantee our free booklet he was right catalogs the decades of accurate forecasting by mr armstrong and the worldwide church of god that he founded in it we wrote between 2002 and 2011 over 49 percent of weapons imported by south american nations came from the eu according to sipri s arms transfers database it is also noteworthy that more arms from the eu came from germany than any other nation south america has clearly avoided being dependent on america for critical weapons systems but it is dependent on europe that doesn t happen by accident national leaders evidently all came to a similar conclusion they couldn t afford to manufacture their own advanced weapons they didn t want to be dependent on the u s or russia so they chose to side with europe south america is welded to europe s military system the alliance is secure south america s military is hugely dependent on europe both europe and south america seem to have forgotten all the foreign aid that america has poured into these regions god warns us against trusting our supposed alliances instead of him by looking to the prophecies of the bible god s church has delivered a warning message for decades that describes exactly what is happening on the world scene right now blessings and curses and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies genesis 22 15 17 god blessed the descendants of the great patriarch abraham primarily america and britain with control of the most vital sea lanes on earth the key to dictating the flow of worldwide trade our nations don t deserve this blessing it was bestowed upon us as a result of god s promise to abraham to prove the identity of abraham s descendants request our free book the united states and britain in prophecy by herbert w armstrong the american and british people have received the birthright blessing an indescribable amount of prosperity due to abraham s obedience to god in genesis 35 11 god prophesied of a great company of nations the british empire and a great single nation america this wealth didn t fall into our laps because of our own impressive ingenuity though most people think so we have been lavished with abundance because of abraham deuteronomy 28 is known as the blessings and curses chapter hou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow verse 12 this was once true of america and britain today america s debt is a staggering 22 trillion and soaring we are far from the blessing outlined in this verse as a whole our people must be making some wrong choices verse 29 warns that if we turn away from god we won t prosper verse 52 pictures america s economy being battered by foreign competition and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god hath given thee we are doomed to lose our sea gates in large part this has already happened america and britain no longer oversee the panama canal the suez canal the south china sea and other strategically located ports as these gates continue to fall into the hands of our enemies those enemies will be more capable of blocking world trade think about this curse from a geographical perspective america enjoys an advantageous position on the globe separated by oceans from the biggest threats of europe and asia how could it be besieged unless latin america is also a part of the plot notice in verse 52 god rebukes our nations for trusting in our own physical power in deuteronomy 31 29 the time frame for the fulfillment of these dire prophecies is revealed in the latter days we have failed to acknowledge god as the source of our blessings so he will take them all away even now our national power is rapidly diminishing britain s is already almost completely gone the root cause of our suffering is sin getting to know god god the father is angry because we are trusting in men instead of him latin america is a crucial part of the economic siege against the u s god has moved our enemies to punish us for our sins that may be difficult for some to believe but it s clearly stated in numerous prophecies therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations ezekiel 5 8 9 unparalleled destruction and pain are coming this warning can save your life if you choose to heed it during the coming time of suffering god will protect those who are loyal to him and doing his work thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts verse 3 god tries and tests our nations but he protects individuals who turn from evil ezekiel 33 11 wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity ezekiel 5 11 liberals in society today might not care how you conduct your life but god does god s church prophesies against america and britain ezekiel 6 1 2 world war iii is near but god wants to save all people even those who refuse to repent at this time will get to know god in the great tribulation which leads directly into the second coming of jesus christ once christ establishes his world ruling government we will no longer see the holy roman empire or any more wars we will experience endless joy and peace

help enlighten your fellows be sure to pass this on survival depends on it there is a lot of talk about which economic bubble will burst first and burst the worst sounds like a gangsta rap song no the stock market real estate luxury goods corporate debt and government bond bubbles and other lesser bubbles all jockey for the titles it s the everything bubble for good reason the good reason is the 1 owns everything of high value so if western governments make it their policy to inflate those valuations even higher then the 1 regains everything they lost in 2008 welcome to western liberal democracy if you have a seat in the house of lords i m sure you re not suffering too badly because of that good reason i listed all of these bubbles are worse now than in 2008 nothing was learned and nothing was delivered i am not a doomsayer but these kinds of facts make me write that great recession ii great depression ii is around the corner however not all bubbles are created equal the luxury goods bubble for example it s mildly interesting from a sensational news aspect that the most expensive bottle of wine is now worth 558 000 but the luxury goods market is a minuscule part of every nation s real economy excepting france italy and switzerland back in 2008 a half million dollars set the record for largest lot of wine ever 27 bottles so these stories only prove the existence of huge asset inflation bubbles 1 27th in the area of wine sales the stock market bubble is also mainly a rich person s problem we only hear about it so very often because the rich own the media in the west and the coverage thus reflects their interests yes 52 of americans own stock because it s a huge part stupidly rapaciously of the american private pension system but only 18 own stock directly and can buy and sell at will we all know that stocks no longer have any correlation to a company s actual performance and prospects those really paying attention also know that the great recession s bailout money has been used for stock buybacks which raise the stock price that bubble is ending too taxpayer funded stock buybacks were higher than ever in 2018 and yet produced the worst market results since 2008 this now failing tactic of buybacks is the source of the corporate debt bubble the stock market bubble s bursting is not that important to the everyday person no matter how much media coverage will be devoted to it the real economy will not not sink because of it no matter how much less your 401k pension is now worth the related corporate debt bubble is far more impactful instead of using that cheaply borrowed money from the government to hire or for r d corporations are thus not prepared for capitalism s next inevitable crisis which translates into layoffs which translates into a huge real economy hit as workers are not buying lunch paying rent or buying decidedly non luxurious but still necessary goods the real estate bubble affects many more people and not just in the construction market just over 50 of germans are homeowners rising up to 70 as you get in the former socialist bloc nations with the us around 65 amazingly home prices have surpassed the prices in 2008 in the us but it s rarely remembered that houses are only worth what a bank will loan you to pay for them banks are getting money from governments cheaply but instead of real economy investments they inflate houses which they own with incorrect valuations when credit is so low that borrowing is near free why not pay yourself more so that means more dumb loans have been dangled and signed when this bubble bursts it will hurt but it won t bring the entire economy to a total halt as a daily journalist who deals with housing activists regularly let me pass this on to you there are few mass problems easier for the government to fix than housing housing oversupply in the us is back to 2007 levels why aren t the homeless and poorly housed rejoicing because in the west housing policy is controlled by real estate speculators lenders and landlords not dwellers citizens your country lacks mainly low cost housing supply like france and the us again the stroke of a pen creates a fabulous real economy and real quality of life boom for your citizenry but not in capitalism think china is wrong to build ghost cities i say lay off the propaganda you are wrong to imagine that construction doesn t move faster than government bureaucracy check those ready made planned towns in 10 years they always get filled up with chinese peasants eventually the bond bubble however is the mother of all bubbles that s because the most important actor in any economy is the government lie to yourself about how the west values a free market all you want if a government cannot pay bills wages or provide necessary services then the real economy will be crippled because so many western governments run on deficits which is not to say that all debt is unproductive debt they have to borrow via bonds can t borrow like greece then you wind up like greece it takes a us government shutdown for the socialism for the losers new york times to say what all lower and middle class people know government jobs are the best ones the times is right no government jobs cutbacks then no more lunches at rayetta s lunch box but brown bagging instead no jobs for blacks muslims then it s back to their two low paying choices in private industry depending on gender janitor security or receptionist austerity cutbacks or shutdown cutbacks indeed means three families that would be getting above average pay won t get it with huge consequences on the local and national levels reduced overall economic activity so i am not falsely trumpeting the virtue of big government when i note that if when eurozone governments cannot borrow money via bonds and thus cannot fund their daily operations then the economic output of those individual nations will plunge drastically government workers will likely work for free for months as in greece and elsewhere mainly because they are patriots who also have nowhere else to go they can t become private sector waitresses because ravetta is actually about to close the lunch box down government workers have no money to lunch there so it s now near bankruptcy if the public sector dies it will take much of the private sector with it if national governments can t get money can the european central bank the higher level but not really level of government in the eurozone step in no the ecb is tapped out and on the verge of becoming a joke they can no longer buy government bonds or help banks replace this role which the ecb has served for years they failed because they did not attach any strings to bailouts thus never fundamentally strengthening a weakened economy burdened with a poor governmental structure macron will not do what it takes to gain credibility with the yellow vests admit that all of france s and the eurozone s policies have failed and have also been morally wrong the post 2009 taxpayer bailouts for failed banks we were told were supposed to not just save ravetta s lunch box but to help open ravetta s lunch box ii creating jobs and circulating wealth in the real economy there were no formal promises or strings necessary we were told banks would just do the right thing on their own the reality is that post 2009 banks jealously guarded their taxpayer bailouts and refused to lend that money went into the various 1 benefitting bubbles the ecb then lowered their interest rates all the way to zero giving commercial banks zero risk to borrow money which could be then lended to ravetta this means that failed investments were taken off the books of private banks with the failures assumed by taxpayers and now the private banks were even being staked with money banks knowing how bad the eurozone s situation truly was didn t bite they borrowed but didn t lend that borrowed money went into the various 1 benefitting bubbles that caused the ecb to try something else in 2015 qe the ecb tapped a keyboard and created 2 5 trillion bitcoins out of thin air wait not bitcoins but 2 5 trillion euros this money went to buy something banks didn t want for obvious reasons government bonds but also some private sector bonds by taking the problem of unwanted national sovereign bonds out of the picture eurozone qe the theory went would also keep private banking interest rates low that means they could give loans to corporations and the small and medium sized ravettas finally creating economic growth the eurozone is a currency area not a country qe had plenty of problems and entanglements which the us and japan did not have but what it did have was again no promises or strings attached much of the money went into the various 1 benefitting bubbles however qe did temporarily solve the problem of sovereign debt in the eurozone by taking it on its own books and keeping it off the books of the member nations this has allowed member nations to look attractive to investors too bad that investors never invested in the real economy the fake economy stocks van goghs real estate etc has been booming for 10 years after all now that qe is ending the reality is that the bond issue was not solved because there is no one who can replace the role of the ecb nobody can or will buy eurozone bonds at the same level and thus how will governments be funded this is the main problem caused by the end of qe so despite 10 years of public funding banks never forwarded any of this money to ravetta it should be totally clear that what banker bailouts zero interest lending and qe did for the eurozone was simply to free up high finance to 1 fund stock market buybacks to prop up the stock market 2 to inflate non productive corporate debt 3 make risky and overvalued loans to prop up values in the real estate market 4 create the profits which the 99 never sees but which fuel sales in the luxury goods market government is mommy and daddy where they lead all the children must follow it is only the socialist inspired systems china vietnam iran cuba etc which have fundamentally different aims and which fundamentally limit the reach of high finance as well as neoliberal and foreign capitalists which will be able to buffet the coming storm the eurozone however could see total chaos at any moment france has the yellow vests already eurozone still the weakest link but even weaker i have written extensively about how the eurozone is far far weaker economically now than during their sovereign debt crisis in 2012 back then nobody wanted to loan to eurozone nations like greece and ireland whose balance sheets rocketed to awful expressly because they were laden with banker bailout debt from 2008 given that eurozone nations have relinquished the right to print their own money those countries were up a creek without a paddle get a loan or the national economy stops but why loan to many in the eurozone in 2012 they suffered the 2008 crash plus banker bailout debt plus they had embarked on the policy of strangle your national economy to reduce the social safety net and workers rights a k a austerity the solution was mario draghi s 2012 whatever it takes speech which translated on a practical level to quantitative easing i e no strings attached near free taxpayer money to the 1 and high finance in order to stop them from squeezing the national bond markets of the eurozone as they had started doing the us and japan had embarked on qe sooner and more deeply this solution steadfastly refuses to inject money into the real economy which is why yellow vests are suffering instead of content the first proof of this is that the eurozone has achieved a lost decade of economic growth average annual growth rate from 2008 to 2017 was just 0 6 which the media never admits but which i detailed despite nearly four years of qe worth 2 5 trillion euros money was only injected into the 1 er economy and the second proof of this is that we now have real estate bubble ii stock market bubble ii luxury goods bubble ii etc only eurozone government bond bubble ii has not appeared because when it does by definition all hell will break loose the government socialists understand is the only backstop from disaster capitalists falsely believe it is the source of disaster beyond the poor day to day policy of qe there have been no structural policy changes as result of the poor capitalist led rules which allowed sovereign debt crisis i to happen in the first place no mutualization of eurozone debt no increased transparency of the eurogroup no changes at all so of course there will be sovereign debt crisis ii all this explains to a time traveller in 2008 that the 1 has continued to win despite the great recession caused by their bad decisions the yellow vests are there precisely as a result of the guaranteed failure of non socialist inspired economic policies when the eurozone bond market gets turbulent it s a yellow vest rampage i say good on top of all this practical governmental failure the logic philosophy and history of capitalism dictates sovereign debt crisis ii will happen punk unpatriotic heartless high financiers will go back to doing what they do before the european central bank began buying them off squeezing the national bond markets for profit oh ecb interest rates are no longer 0 then why would we risk our own money to buy your ever worsening country s bond oh the ecb won t go below 0 you mean you won t pay us to buy your bonds oh the ecb can t buy national bonds either because qe has bought so much 2 5 trillion euros that its credibility is strained and its legal limits reached and your nation can t print money either well too bad for your nation i guess germany and the dutch should be relatively ok thankfully furthermore we also have a generation of young capitalists who have never ever seen a bear market wrap your heads around this perpetual reality of capitalism they will get their tails handed to them on a platter and our tails along with them to say that i am wrong about why the european debt crisis will not start soon given the withdrawal of high finance pampering is to say that capitalism is not capitalism but that it is a centrally planned regulated protective riches limiting socialism instead is to say that high finance has found morality and wants to make money honestly is to say that international neoliberal capitalists have rediscovered fraternal patriotism the eurozone s qe after postponements is now done it was supposed to be finished in september of 2017 which is why i wrote this 7 part series about it back then but it was postponed and prolonged with a qe2 until december 2018 the us and japan have also had multiple rounds of qe the eurozone the largest macroeconomy in the world and yet also the weakest link the global economy and which has been significantly weakened by the policies pursued since 2012 and since 2008 is about to re enter crisis mode maybe at the first sign of eurozone sovereign debt bubble ii they will announce qe 3 but that would require a changing of their rules the ecb is not as independent as the us fed or the bank of japan after all it is very likely given the horrifically slow nature of the eu s 18th century liberal democratic system that the rules will not be changed in time given the fact that qe 3 would come amid such a very worse economic and bubble situation than qe 1 or qe 2 and now france has the yellow vests angered rendered desperate and emboldened by eight years of austerity just imagine the effect any major economic shock and subsequent slowdown will have on the yellow vests what if unemployment goes from 9 to 11 the yellow vests are marching every saturday because they want immediate improvement not a dramatic worsening how would they respond to the 1 s faux solutions to an economic shock are they going to sit back and hold their tongue in order to placate the confidence fairy are they going to put their faith in the campaign promises of a patsy like francois hollande are they going to give a chance to a candidate who is even more last minute and even more falsely fabricated than emmanuel macron are they going to take a chance on marine le pen even though they firmly rejected her in 2017 the answer is no the answer is we don t know what the yellow vests will do on any given saturday all we know is that recession is around the corner outright economic crisis appears extremely possible and that every possible outcome strengthens the yellow vests macron will not do what it takes to gain credibility with the yellow vests admit that all of france s and the eurozone s policies have failed and have also been morally wrong even if macron does break down and end austerity completely that will require more borrowing that means the 1 and their supporters like reuters will cry foul over the same old absurd all deficits are bad fears and raise borrowing rates bond rates as well if macron continues on his path that means more poor economic performance which means more yellow vest supporters that is certainly what he will do in the first cabinet meeting of the year he instructed cabinet minsters to be more radical in their attempt to reform the country i e continue with real economy crushing reforms to the unemployment and social security systems in 2019 this might keep france s bond rates low but france is in the eurozone french success is tied to keeping italy s spain s and everyone else s bond rates low as well as the 2nd largest motor in the eurozone france s economic stagnation heightens the risk of all their eurozone partners the eurozone is not the us or japan and certainly not china it only takes one nation in the context of multiple bubbles caused by 10 years of terrible economic policies which are in place to paper over 30 years of terrible economic policies to bring the eurozone back into crisis with higher bond rates so higher bond rates are inevitable it s just a matter of when high finance already knows all this this week saw latin american bank bonds become less risky than eurozone bank bonds which hasn t happened since 2012 how long until they move to eurozone nations where the french are at now is zero tolerance that s a very intelligent place for the masses to be given the recent history i ve recounted the yellow vests are calling january 19th act 10 which has reached the point of absurdity i realize that the french have a culture which overwhelmingly stresses the visual aesthetically concerned aspects of culture painting fashion acting but revolution is not theater are the yellow vests going to have act 324 one day leftist revolutionary political change is not a pose nor a role nor a shirt to put on but a permanent and committed determination regardless for how long france wants to persist with these theater inspired slogans sovereign debt crisis ii will make permanent believers out of the yellow vest don t look at the yellow vests in an isolated vacuum the only thing new about the yellow vests is purely sartorial how very french it s just 1 protest which has lasted 8 years times have changed the yellow vests were not on the ground in 2008 nor will the response to economic recession crisis be like in 2012 when france continued to put their faith in a mainstream politician francois hollande indeed with the yellow vests mobilised so well i say this let the bubbles burst and the crisis hit as soon as possible it would be far better in the long run
kpmg managing partner reyaz mihular ips executive director dr dushni weerakoon ccc chief economist shiran fernando central bank governor dr indrajit coomraswamy and hayleys strategic development head manohari abeysekera at the panel discussion pic by sameera wijesinghe ceylon chamber of commerce says scope for moderate growth in its 2019 outlook says global challenges and elections balanced by good weather possible uptick in consumption experts concerned over rupee depreciation and debt warn recent political instability could linger in investor minds governor says structural changes need to continue to improve growth the economic intelligence unit of the ceylon chamber of commerce ccc expects sri lanka to grow by about 3 5 in 2019 buoyed by increased rainfall and stronger consumption but was cautious of political uncertainty ahead of elections and external challenges presenting the key findings of the outlook 2019 report compiled by the eiu ccc chief economist shiran fernando noted that sri lanka is likely to see 3 5 4 growth this year economic expansion is likely to come from personal services activities wholesale and retail trade as well as an increase in household consumption from populist policies usually implemented during an election year however fernando expressed concerns over currency depreciation and called for structural reforms to continue to put sri lanka on a sustainable growth trajectory he also noted that sri lanka s foreign direct investment while increasing was limited to big ticket items such as the hambantota port and port city that depends on bilateral relations and less on non state linked foreign investors global growth is on a downward trend and normalising interest rates could pose difficulties for sri lanka sri lanka is also facing high debt repayments and elections so this outlook is focused on shifting gears from stability to resilience we expect growth to be moderate and for the rupee to remain under some pressure though possibly not as much as what was seen this year fernando said looking at sri lanka s top exports fernando opined apparel would depend largely on the rupee outlook while both rubber and tea are facing supply side constraints tourism needs to recover from political instability but is expected to continue its growth path central bank governor dr indrajit coomaraswamy delivering the keynote address at the event outlined plans to raise the bulk of the 5 9 billion needed to repay sri lanka s debt and said the recent government delegation to visit washington for talks with the international monetary fund imf focused on creating fiscal space for the gamperaliya and samurdhi programs the governor said efforts were already underway to raise funds from india china and through an international sovereign bond the central bank aims to raise about 5 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to offset any political uncertainty that may pop up later in the year the central bank is likely to announce its growth projections for 2019 next month there are two significant headwinds in 2019 one is our reservoirs are full which means that we can have good harvests and use hydro power the second is low oil prices if you take those two factors together output can improve depreciation can give a boost to growth in the short term but a lot of other things need to come together as well but you can t keep depreciating the currency so we have to get away from that and hopefully remedial action has been taken the exogenous factors of oil prices normalisation of interest rates and dollar appreciation we cannot do much about but domestically the trade balance has been reduced by curtailing gold and vehicle imports he said the governor cautioned against using monetary policy to spur growth and called for structural reforms including fiscal consolidation reform of state owned enterprises legal and regulatory reforms to attract investment and measures to boost exports to continue my fear is that most of the attention in 2019 will be on politics noted institute of policy studies ips executive director dr dushni weerakoon speaking during the panel discussion after the release of the report risks are about the currency and i take the point that a near 20 depreciation is not such a bad thing in terms of providing some kind of a boost to export competitiveness but that will be short lived it is not long term to me the main issue is that we are in a low growth environment and a 20 depreciation today means that risks are not in terms of inflation i see the problem in terms of debt sri lanka is carrying foreign currency denominated debt of 60 of gdp with 36 of that debt held by the central government 3 by the central bank and another 20 by the state owned enterprises so a sudden sharp depreciation means our debt numbers and outlook changes overnight and when you factor in the low growth momentum those numbers start to look more alarming so in that context sri lanka moving into a critical debt repayment period till about 2021 does not provide a very positive outlook she added kpmg managing partner reyaz mihular noted recent political instability would take time to dissipate and called for pragmatic policy making that would stabilise the economy and focus on long term growth what happened in the last quarter created doubt in the minds of investors about the political stability in this country i talk to a lot of investors and when they look at a country like sri lanka they take what we do for the most part as par for the course but what happened is something that completely disturbed them because they suddenly realized the entire thing can get topsy turvy and that can create a lot of uncertainty about their future plans especially for long term investors and i think that will hang over us for some time mihular said we need to get realistic about our satiation we are eternally optimistic we think no matter what happens life will go on but it doesn t work like that everything we do there is a cost to pay for it there is nothing called a free lunch there is a need to explain in simple terms to the public the real situation of the country mihular commended selective government policies such as the effort to establish a single window for exports and a land bank but insisted the reforms needed to continue for them to have stronger impact hayleys strategic development head manohari abeysekera was upbeat about sri lanka s economic prospects in 2019 pointing out that as the central bank had clear plans on debt repayment it was less of a concern to the private sector we are quite optimistic of 2019 the agriculture sector has improved which is a big positive for us hayleys is in agriculture industries and services so it can be taken as a barometer for sri lanka s economy the central bank has its plans to raise funds to repay debt and sri lanka has never defaulted on a payment so i don t think it s all doom and gloom although we could have some political instability i am optimistic that 2019 would be a better year for the country even the political instability that happened in october and november gave a message to the politicians that they need to listen to the public she said abeysekera noted that when hayleys acquired singer sri lanka which is the largest retailer in the country with 450 consumer retail shops countrywide they found as much as 30 of the retail output comes from the farming community when we bought singer we thought demand would be from the western province and the middle class but when we drill down we realised the knock on effect of agriculture even though agriculture has limited gdp contribution 30 of sri lanka s population relies on agriculture the government should encourage exports as that would be beneficial and even with debt sri lanka still has potential to benefit from its geographical location and other attributes
while many countries struggled following the 2008 global financial crisis china appeared as though it had largely escaped unscathed key points china s rising levels of debt mostly attributed to a credit boom post gfc china s rising levels of debt mostly attributed to a credit boom post gfc many large infrastructures are struggling to generate positive revenue many large infrastructures are struggling to generate positive revenue chinese local government debt has been called an iceberg with titanic risks but observers are becoming increasingly concerned beijing will struggle to repay an ever increasing mountain of debt with potential detrimental consequences for the global market china s debt has been a key factor to its economic success in riding out the gfc due to a large government stimulus injected into its economy however the financial boost has mostly led to china having one of the highest corporate debts in the world only second to the special administrative region of hong kong the past year has been a tumultuous one for the chinese market it was hit by an economic downturn and for the first time in two years exports unexpectedly plunged to its lowest point all of this against the backdrop of an ongoing trade dispute and punishing tariffs by the us beijing made moves to solve its issues by slashing central bank reserves earlier this month the fifth time within a year freeing up us116 billion 161 3 billion to stimulate more economic growth but forecasted figures by a number of global financial institutions are not looking too positive for the global superpower and adding to the debt fears is an opaqueness and inability for analysts to completely obtain information and understand the full extent or impact of the potential looming problem there s no positive way to spin it the tianducheng development in hangzhou was designed to accommodate 10 000 people but remains sparsely populated reuters aly song a common misconception about the chinese economy is that it is largely driven by exports and while that might be the case prior to 2008 it all changed during the crisis when global demand for chinese imports quickly declined throughout europe and the united states to ride out the gfc the chinese government injected a 4 trillion rmb 823 5 billion stimulus to create jobs through large scale infrastructures projects real estate and foreign investments despite limited domestic market interest according to the bank for international settlement bis china s overall debt currently sits at 255 7 per cent of its gross domestic product gdp with its corporate debt standing at 160 3 per cent well ahead of japan and the us however the concerns do not surround the amount of china s accumulated debt but rather the rate of its corporate debt and its growth since the gfc which also includes state owned enterprises soe and local governments prompting fears of a financial crisis with a domino effect corporate debt is the amount of money borrowed by non financial institutions from the private sector while accumulated debt also includes household and public debts while many economists do not seem particularly concerned about a debt default due to china s large foreign reserves including us1 15 trillion in us bonds speculation of a credit crisis still ranges from an economic slowdown to the next global financial crisis while its still up for debate many agree the effects could be felt across the globe a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks according to the world bank and the imf the chinese economy is forecast to continue to slow down in the coming years reuters stringer jane golley an economist and acting director at the australian centre on china in the world at the australian national university said the issue had become more complex as it was not known how big the debt was and how it was being spent the uncertainty it creates makes global capital markets individual investors and even local domestic consumers nervous about that trickle down effect she told the abc dr golley added that china could not sell all its us government bonds as it would have major global implications a report published by s p global ratings in late 2018 found off balance sheet borrowing by local governments as high as 40 trillion yuan 8 2 trillion and dubbed it a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks james laurenceson deputy director at the australia china relations institute at uts said the debt held by the corporate sector particularly in seos became a core part of the problem especially through zombie firms which do not generate revenue there s no positive way to spin it debt has been ploughed into assets that aren t producing a substantial return he said this is slowly grinding down china s growth rate and means more policy stimulus is needed to produce the same amount of growth a total waste of money china s central bank slashes capital requirements for the fifth time in a year amid an economic slowdown reuters reinhard krause according to the china power project at us think tank the center for strategic and international studies state owned enterprises accounted for more than half of china s corporate debt in 2016 while only accounting for half of its gdp he ling shi an economist from monash university said some of these infrastructure projects were a total waste of money and will not generate cash flow he was referring to empty ghost cities and an array of abandoned projects such as airports and large buildings with limited use some cities with fewer than 100 000 in population have applied to build subways where the roads above are totally empty he said also some airports constructed using loans from banks which provide services for very limited numbers per year he said china s potential crisis may also be lurking in its shadow banking system which has been tied to its credit boom shadow banking is an unregulated and unstable aspect of the chinese market which sells anything from wealth management products to investment trusts creating a notion of an expanding economy beyond official channels according to dr shi shadow banks have been used by local governments to finance infrastructure projects therefore contributing to the overall government debt a report published by bis last year found much of the sector was driven by traditional and state owned banks with significant levels of state involvement loading bad outcome imminent sense of crisis contagious a 2016 international monetary fund imf report found 38 out of 43 economies whose national debt was 30 per cent higher than its gdp experienced severe disruption in the form of financial crises and a decline in growth it also found the probability of a bad outcome was imminent if the boom lasted for more than six years these are all criteria the chinese economy meets dr laurenceson said it was unlikely a chinese financial crisis would lead to a catastrophic us style market collapse and cause the next global financial crisis this means that rather than a collapse if the root causes aren t addressed china s growth rate will just slowly grind down for the foreseeable future he said he added that even this would be problematic as it had the potential to result in an economic stagnation similar to japan s lost decade following the collapse of its asset prices the government seems to have recently introduced a number of financial reforms and budget restructuring aimed at lowering debt levels reuters china daily according to the world bank and the imf the chinese economy is forecast to continue to slow down in the coming years further adding to the anxiety around whether beijing can repay its debts dr shi said it would continue to be an ongoing and difficult issue with no clear solutions if the chinese gdp can be maintained at 6 per cent per year in theory it can still use its economic growth to repay its debt however this is a little bit too optimistic he said he added that some of the infrastructure projects would need positive cash flow which then could be used to pay back some debt but it might take a very long time when it becomes massive is when that sense of crisis becomes contagious dr golley said its not just a debt crisis on its own but it s the fear of debt crisis reducing consumer confidence business confidence even further and then having impacts on chinese demands for imports and it all starts to ratchet up through there the chinese government seems to have recently introduced a number of financial reforms and budget restructuring aimed at lowering debt levels in recent times including greater restrictions on debt financed overseas investments allowing some state owned zombie firms to go insolvent and a reduction in coal and steel industries but dr laurenceson explained there was only limited evidence the authorities were addressing the root causes of the problem he said there had been attempts to audit books of local governments to move lending from murky high interest rate shadow banking to official banking sectors however it still did not balance the disproportionate quantities of state owned firms which were far less productive than private companies the chinese government considers soes to play an important stabilising role in society and dr laurenceson added beijing would be reluctant to let them go bankrupt and close therefore contributing to the potential risk to growth and financial stability of the second largest economy in the world
the euro is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month but they aren t popping corks across the continent except perhaps with the notable exception of delusional eurocrats such jean claude juncker president of the european commission who argued the euro has become a symbol of unity sovereignty and stability it has delivered prosperity and protection to our citizens some prosperity much of the continent is characterized by double digit unemployment rising inequality political strife and a virtual lost generation of youth who have never experienced anything remotely approaching a robust ebullient economy greed based integration is giving the eua bad name the worst thing about the eurozone as a whole is the currency union itself the euro reinforces structural inequalities between member states as well as between social groups within countries it is also worth recalling that its creation was supposed to be an intermediate step toward the inevitable formation of a united states of europe of a supranational fiscal authority i e a federal union in which a central government for the whole of europe becomes responsible for the economic stabilization and income redistribution for the whole of the eu while the allocation of resources is left in the hands of the nation state governments that is clearly along ways away given existing political tensions between the creditor nations of the germanic north and the debtor southern periphery nations to quote abraham lincoln a house divided against itself cannot stand nor can a currency union minus a real fiscal authority to go with it since the latter seems politically impossible against a backdrop of brexit yellow vest protests in france and a governing coalition in italy that openly toys with abandoning the euro a more likely outcome is the breakup of the currency union or a model of integration that isn t simultaneously an enrichment program for the investor class in an ideal world the euro s end would come via coordinated action reintroducing national currencies and immediately requiring all tax and other public contractual obligations within the nation to be denominated in that currency so as to create immediate demand for those currencies much more likely however is that the dissolution will occur via disruptive crisis that the euro has survived for 20 years is not a sign that we are moving closer to the day of an ever closer union the longstanding aspiration of the fathers of the modern day european union originally started as the six nation european coal and steel community rather it is a sign of democratic subversion a technocracy run amok that has survived by depriving elected national parliaments of control over fiscal policy taxation spending and the core economic policies of the nation state the euro has been both the method and the cause of this democratic disenfranchisement by design not by accident how you ask because by substituting national currencies with a supranational currency the euro s creation severed the link between state and money and with it the flexibility to confront economic crises of the magnitude that have been experienced throughout the euro s history especially post 2008 it has therefore becomean instrument of greedas it has facilitated a massive wealth transfer toward the top tier of european society along with an evisceration of the social welfare state national parliaments remain therefore constrained because without a national currency they lack the fiscal capacity to respond and they also faced potential bankruptcy much like an american state which is a user not an issuer of the dollar mario draghi s whatever it takes speech in july 2012 alleviated the solvency problem of the national bond markets of countries in the eurozone because the european central bank is the only entity that can create the euros needed to backstop the national bonds credibly that along with some alleviation of fiscal austerity induced a modest cyclical recovery from 2015 to 2018 but the recovery such that it was has proved ephemeral the gdp growth of the european union as a whole has flamed out and is now experiencing its lowest growth in four years the trillions of euros mobilized during successive crises have largely been devoted toward covert bank bailouts and recycling money to creditors rather than assisting the vast army of unemployed greed and while each successive crisis since the euro s inception has hitherto been enough to avert the ultimate blow up of the currency union the poor economic baseline has remained constant in fact economist michael burrage recently compared the economic performance of the 12 founder eurozone members with 10 independent countries which are comparable in terms of economic structure labor institutions and productivity surprise surprise the eurozone countries rank at the bottom it is worth reiterating that this is not a european union problem but a eurozoneproblem because high unemployment caused by austerity policyis an enduring eurozone ez characteristic consider that countries such as norway switzerland and even the uk beset by brexit woes are outperforming the ez countries especially on the unemployment metric the underlying assumption of a common currency namely that it would lead to a convergence of the member countries production employment and trade structures has been proven false other than the currency itself the only commonality in the ez has been poor economic growth in virtually the entire region a one size fits all currency union doesn t work there is a multiplicity of challenges private debt unemployment automation education worker productivity that can only be resolved via more socially inclusive i e generous national supranational development strategies but that is within the purview of fiscal policy which in turn is constrained by the existence of each country effectively borrowing in a foreign currency which is de facto what the euro is given the institutional separation between the state and the currency itself so going back to national currencies seems a necessary first step why not simply attempt to devalue the euro for one thing relying on external boosts to growth via currency devaluation depends on the willingness of other trading partners to adopt growth strategies that will accommodate the resultant increased imports highly problematic in today s increasingly protectionist environment furthermore during previous periods of relative euro weakness the biggest beneficiary by far in the eurozone has been germany as evidenced by the fact that the country has a current account surplus now a shade under 8 percent of gdp which largely comprises the bulk of the european union s external trade surpluses with the rest of the world the rest of the bloc particularly the mediterranean members are still registering subpar growth and substantially higher levels of unemployment so in the first instance a euro devaluation helps germany not the european union as a whole furthermore the common currency means a common monetary policy which has amplified the strains of the eurozone rather than mitigating them in the period leading up to the 2008 global crisis inflation rates in the mediterranean countries were higher which meant that real interest rates were lower hence cheap credit fueled asset bubbles in countries such as greece spain and portugal which in turn provided the illusion that they were converging with the northern european economies by contrast post 2008 european central bank ecb interest rates remained too high for too long for those now debt laden periphery countries and they therefore have suffered greater fall out from the financial crisis than germany the economist servaas storm has quantified the impact during the pre crisis years 1997 2007 membership of emu was beneficial for all countries except germany and italy emu membership is estimated to have increased per capita real incomes in greece portugal and spain by 8 10 things change considerably after 2008 however being part of the eurozone has depressed the real incomes in greece by 16 in italy by 8 in portugal by 4 and in spain by 8 compared to the counterfactual in contrast most northern core economies benefited from their emu membership as their actual per capita income levels are estimated to be higher than in the counterfactual scenario without eurozone membership germany stands out in this post crisis period 2008 2014 with the average german having an actual income which is about 5 higher than the estimated non emu counterfactual the ecb s monetary policy initially fomented asset bubbles in the periphery and then exacerbated debt deflation when these bubbles burst in seeking to mitigate the southern debt deflation post 2008 however the resultant low interest rates fueled a boom in germany this largely explains why berlin s actual income is higher than the estimated counterfactual which would have occurred had germany still been using the deutschmark as the ever vigilant bundesbank likely would have raised interest rates sooner and more aggressively even with a common monetary policy had the eurozone members existed in a federal union comparable to canada or the united states policy makers could have mitigated regional divergences via fiscal transfers or equalization payments and the issue of intra regional trade imbalances would also be a non issue nobody in the u s really cares for example whether new york runs a trade deficit with texas because of the overriding existence of this federal union we call the united states of america but even though there is no common fiscal union the european monetary union custodians have nonetheless imposed a fiscal austerity straitjacket as a precondition of euro membership i e the perversely named stability and growth pact which has delivered minimal growth and lots of instability so countries that earn membership in club euro get the worst of all possible worlds minimal capacity to bolster growth via aggressive fiscal policy just fiscal austerity like joining a religion that offers hell but no heaven fiscal austerity exacerbates productivity differentials less money for investment education social welfare higher unemployment etc and locks the slow growth countries into debt trap deflation and perpetual economic stagnation see greece as exhibit a and no means of inflating away the debt domestically because there is no national printing press last but not least the champions of the monetary union notably those in berlin continue to preach the destructive myth that increased competitiveness via structural reforms which usually means the ability to fire workers more easily and cut social welfare programs will somehow enable the afflicted countries to match germany s economic dynamism however as storm points out countries can t compete if the composition of exports in each country is different germany is strong in medium and high tech manufacturing and this strength shows up in a strong export performance as well as a limited vulnerability to external shocks emphasis mine the strong export performance is in part derived from the fact that high end goods are not particularly dependent on the low labor costs to compete globally by contrast the periphery countries are generally locked into low and medium tech activities many of which compete with china and are therefore much more subject to its competitive threat italy s textile industry being a classic case in point the upshot is that what s good for germany is not so for italy or france and vice versa what is required are distinct national industrial policies aiming at accommodating and diversifying the existing trade structures of the mediterranean countries in particular sadly the eurozone makes no provision for this largely because of the eurozone s deficit phobia as i have written before there is a broader philosophic problem embodied in the pact implicit in the drive to create a stability culture is the belief that public debt is invariably an evil the consequences of which must be stopped at all costs but as events of the past decade have clearly demonstrated excessive private sector debt build up notably in asia and the united states has played a far more destabilizing role in the global economy than fiscal profligacy which undercuts one of the main rationales for retaining the stability pact in its current form if we say that the government can run budget surpluses for 15 years what we are ignoring is that this means the private sector will have to run deficits for 15 years going into debt that totals trillions of dollars in order to allow the government to retire its debt again it is hard to see why households would be better off if they owed more debt just so that the government would owe them less there are very few instances of a controlled dissolution of a currency union and a concomitant re establishment of national currencies one recent example is what occurred after the breakup of the old yugoslavian federation even though the re establishment of national currencies occurred with minimal economic disruption the dissolution did not come without cost as many of the former members of the yugoslavian federation engaged in a

is also worth remembering that the uk does not even share a common currency as it retains the pound in the eurozone itself we would likely witness these same simmering resentments from the wealthier countries which have long criticized the mediterranean scroungers imagine what happens if the next eruption occurs in italy or france with its yellow vest protests presaging trouble there greece or

continent in the aftermath of world war ii the urgency reflected in mario draghi s whatever it takes speech would have been more admirable if it had focused noton saving the euro at all costs but rather on establishing a full employment economy that benefits all european citizens not just its financiers and oligarchs there is no point in preserving a currency union if it comes at a cost of sabotaging economic growth and the broad welfare of the eu s citizens likewise the power of the nation state s fiscal policy should not be restricted but freely deployed alongside of or if necessary substituting the market to ensure that equitable prosperity is achieved for the many not the few

and oligarchs there is no point in preserving a currency union if it comes at a cost of sabotaging economic growth and the broad welfare of the eu s citizens likewise the power of the nation state s

while many countries struggled following the 2008 global financial crisis china appeared as though it had largely escaped unscathed key points china s rising levels of debt mostly attributed to a credit boom post gfc china s rising levels of debt mostly attributed to a credit boom post gfc many large infrastructures are struggling to generate positive revenue many large infrastructures are struggling to generate positive revenue chinese local government debt has been called an iceberg with titanic risks but observers are becoming increasingly concerned beijing will struggle to repay an ever increasing mountain of debt with potential detrimental consequences for the global market china s debt has been a key factor to its economic success in riding out the gfc due to a large government stimulus injected into its economy however the financial boost has mostly led to china having one of the highest corporate debts in the world only second to the special administrative region of hong kong the past year has been a tumultuous one for the chinese market it was hit by an economic downturn and for the first time in two years exports unexpectedly plunged to its lowest point all of this against the backdrop of an ongoing trade dispute and punishing tariffs by the us beijing made moves to solve its issues by slashing central bank reserves earlier this month the fifth time within a year freeing up us116 billion 161 3 billion to stimulate more economic growth but forecasted figures by a number of global financial institutions are not looking too positive for the global superpower and adding to the debt fears is an opaqueness and inability for analysts to completely obtain information and understand the full extent or impact of the potential looming problem there s no positive way to spin it the tianducheng development in hangzhou was designed to accommodate 10 000 people but remains sparsely populated reuters aly song a common misconception about the chinese economy is that it is largely driven by exports and while that might be the case prior to 2008 it all changed during the crisis when global demand for chinese imports quickly declined throughout europe and the united states to ride out the gfc the chinese government injected a 4 trillion rmb 823 5 billion stimulus to create jobs through large scale infrastructures projects real estate and foreign investments despite limited domestic market interest according to the bank for international settlement bis china s overall debt currently sits at 255 7 per cent of its gross domestic product gdp with its corporate debt standing at 160 3 per cent well ahead of japan and the us however the concerns do not surround the amount of china s accumulated debt but rather the rate of its corporate debt and its growth since the gfc which also includes state owned enterprises soe and local governments prompting fears of a financial crisis with a domino effect corporate debt is the amount of money borrowed by non financial institutions from the private sector while accumulated debt also includes household and public debts while many economists do not seem particularly concerned about a debt default due to china s large foreign reserves including us1 15 trillion in us bonds speculation of a credit crisis still ranges from an economic slowdown to the next global financial crisis while its still up for debate many agree the effects could be felt across the globe a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks according to the world bank and the imf the chinese economy is forecast to continue to slow down in the coming years reuters stringer jane golley an economist and acting director at the australian centre on china in the world at the australian national university said the issue had become more complex as it was not known how big the debt was and how it was being spent the uncertainty it creates makes global capital markets individual investors and even local domestic consumers nervous about that trickle down effect she told the abc dr golley added that china could not sell all its us government bonds as it would have major global implications a report published by s p global ratings in late 2018 found off balance sheet borrowing by local governments as high as 40 trillion yuan 8 2 trillion and dubbed it a debt iceberg with titanic credit risks james laurenceson deputy director at the australia china relations institute at uts said the debt held by the corporate sector particularly in seos became a core part of the problem especially through zombie firms which do not generate revenue there s no positive way to spin it debt has been ploughed into assets that aren t producing a substantial return he said this is slowly grinding down china s growth rate and means more policy stimulus is needed to produce the same amount of growth a total waste of money china s central bank slashes capital requirements for the fifth time in a year amid an economic slowdown reuters reinhard krause according to the china power project at us think tank the center for strategic and international studies state owned enterprises accounted for more than half of china s corporate debt in 2016 while only accounting for half of its gdp he ling shi an economist from monash university said some of these infrastructure projects were a total waste of money and will not generate cash flow he was referring to empty ghost cities and an array of abandoned projects such as airports and large buildings with limited use some cities with fewer than 100 000 in population have applied to build subways where the roads above are totally empty he said also some airports constructed using loans from banks which provide services for very limited numbers per year he said china s potential crisis may also be lurking in its shadow banking system which has been tied to its credit boom shadow banking is an unregulated and unstable aspect of the chinese market which sells anything from wealth management products to investment trusts creating a notion of an expanding economy beyond official channels according to dr shi shadow banks have been used by local governments to finance infrastructure projects therefore contributing to the overall government debt a report published by bis last year found much of the sector was driven by traditional and state owned banks with significant levels of state involvement loading bad outcome imminent sense of crisis contagious a 2016 international monetary fund imf report found 38 out of 43 economies whose national debt was 30 per cent higher than its gdp experienced severe disruption in the form of financial crises and a decline in growth it also found the probability of a bad outcome was imminent if the boom lasted for more than six years these are all criteria the chinese economy meets dr laurenceson said it was unlikely a chinese financial crisis would lead to a catastrophic us style market collapse and cause the next global financial crisis this means that rather than a collapse if the root causes aren t addressed china s growth rate will just slowly grind down for the foreseeable future he said he added that even this would be problematic as it had the potential to result in an economic stagnation similar to japan s lost decade following the collapse of its asset prices the government seems to have recently introduced a number of financial reforms and budget restructuring aimed at lowering debt levels reuters china daily according to the world bank and the imf the chinese economy is forecast to continue to slow down in the coming years further adding to the anxiety around whether beijing can repay its debts dr shi said it would continue to be an ongoing and difficult issue with no clear solutions if the chinese gdp can be maintained at 6 per cent per year in theory it can still use its economic growth to repay its debt however this is a little bit too optimistic he said he added that some of the infrastructure projects would need positive cash flow which then could be used to pay back some debt but it might take a very long time when it becomes massive is when that sense of crisis becomes contagious dr golley said its not just a debt crisis on its own but it s the fear of debt crisis reducing consumer confidence business confidence even further and then having impacts on chinese demands for imports and it all starts to ratchet up through there the chinese government seems to have recently introduced a number of financial reforms and budget restructuring aimed at lowering debt levels in recent times including greater restrictions on debt financed overseas investments allowing some state owned zombie firms to go insolvent and a reduction in coal and steel industries but dr laurenceson explained there was only limited evidence the authorities were addressing the root causes of the problem he said there had been attempts to audit books of local governments to move lending from murky high interest rate shadow banking to official banking sectors however it still did not balance the disproportionate quantities of state owned firms which were far less productive than private companies the chinese government considers soes to play an important stabilising role in society and dr laurenceson added beijing would be reluctant to let them go bankrupt and close therefore contributing to the potential risk to growth and financial stability of the second largest economy in the world
beirut reuters financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt beirut reuters financial strains in lebanon have been brought into focus by turbulence on markets where its dollar denominated sovereign bonds suffered a heavy sell off last week following comments by the finance minister about the public debt the bonds recovered this week on assurances the government is absolutely not planning to restructure the debt and is committed to paying its maturing debt and interest payments at predetermined dates advertisement but the episode has added to debate about lebanon s debt sustainability after warnings from politicians the imf and world bank over economic and financial conditions in a country that has suffered years of low economic growth lebanon s factional politics has led to years of policy paralysis and obstructed reforms needed to boost investor confidence more than eight months after an election politicians have been unable to agree a new government what are the problems lebanon has one of the world s biggest public debts compared to the size of its economy largely generated through servicing existing debt and high state spending it amounts to roughly 150 percent of gdp the world bank has estimated that financial transfers to the state owned power producer alone averaged 3 8 percent of gdp from 2008 to 2017 a public sector wage increase in 2017 and higher interest rates have added to pressures on the budget deficit advertisement lebanon also has a current account deficit because it imports far more than it exports financing these two deficits has depended on critical financial transfers from its diaspora but questions over this model have grown at the heart of concerns is the recent slowdown in remittance deposit inflows which have traditionally funded a large part if not all of lebanon s financing requirement goldman sachs said in a dec 3 analysis advertisement the world bank in an october report said lebanon was exposed to significant refinancing risks attracting sufficient capital and in particular deposits to finance significantly larger budgetary and current account deficits is proving challenging in light of slower deposit growth lower oil prices have been seen by economists as a major cause of the slowdown with many lebanese working in oil producing gulf arab states political instability and lower growth in lebanon have also been cited as factors advertisement economic growth rates have fallen to between 1 and 2 percent from between 8 and 10 percent in the four years before syria s civil war began in 2011 how urgent is the situation central bank governor riad salameh said last month the banking sector was capable of financing the state s foreign and domestic debt in 2019 the central bank s foreign assets stand at around 40 billion advertisement the financial system has proven resilient through political crises assassinations and war the lebanese pound peg against the u s dollar has been stable for over two decades often in the absence of effective government the central bank has maintained stability using stimulus packages and unorthodox financial operations made possible by large diaspora deposits into the banks advertisement but since 2016 the slowdown in non resident inflows prompted the central bank to embark on financial engineering to draw more dollars to its reserves the world bank and imf have praised the central bank for a critical role but the world bank s october report noted some central bank tools were becoming less effective and that lebanon s risk profile was rising sharply advertisement confidence is critical to encouraging the inflows upon which the system rests this would be boosted if a new government was agreed and moved quickly towards making reforms of the power sector this could unlock some 11 billion in funding pledged by foreign states and institutions last year for a capital investment programme advertisement where does hezbollah figure in this the power wielded by the iran backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah is at the heart of tension between lebanon and gulf states such as saudi arabia that once supported beirut but have turned their attention elsewhere in recent years goldman sachs noted that one cause of the slowdown in remittance and deposit growth was the perceived reduced likelihood of external support in light of heightened tensions between lebanon and the oil rich gulf countries advertisement the heavily armed group is listed as a terrorist group by the united states and fought a war with israel in 2006 we have warned for some time that if there was a fresh escalation of tensions with gulf countries or israel that could lead to another period of capital flight that puts the dollar peg under pressure jason tuvey of capital economics said advertisement the united states has tightened financial sanctions against hezbollah part of its wider effort to counter iran the lebanese banking sector has been applying these measures and anti money laundering legislation lebanon lobbied washington in 2017 to balance its tough anti hezbollah stance with the need to preserve the country s financial stability consequently sanctions were altered enough to allay fears of major economic damage advertisement the application of such measures may have weighed on some inflows to lebanon though it is difficult to know to what extent tuvey said can the next government fix the problem once prime minister designate saad al hariri manages to form a government investors will be looking for follow through on promises of reducing the budget deficit but there are concerns that politics could get in the way of reforms once again lebanese and international stakeholders agree that the budget deficit needs to narrow but a credible actionable plan for achieving this is still lacking and it remains unclear if political dynamics will allow for a concerted fiscal adjustment fitch ratings said writing by tom perry editing by pravin char this

u s review available data show u s economy is hanging in there industrial production rose 0 3 in december driven by a 1 1 jump in manufacturing output details of the empire and philly fed manufacturing surveys however suggest that the factory sector slowed in january conditions in the housing market look to be stabilizing with the nahb homebuilder survey recovering two points in january and mortgage purchase applications rising the ongoing partial government shutdown delayed the december reports for housing starts and retail sales this week hanging in there the ongoing partial federal government shutdown meant a number of economic data reports were not released this week among them were what would have been two of the major focal points housing starts and retail sales the housing market has been an area of concern in recent months as buyers and builders have grappled with higher mortgage rates and costs that have led to a further deterioration in affordability homebuilder sentiment plummeted in december sparking fears that the slowdown was set to intensify this year while the nahb index remains well below its level this time last year builders reported better conditions in january with the index edging up two points top chart the retreat in mortgage rates over the past two months has also helped allay concerns about the housing market since mid november conventional rates have fallen about 50 bps buyers look to be stepping back into the market mortgage applications for purchases have jumped more than 10 in each of the past two weeks to reach a new cycle high the postponed release of the december retail sales report arguably the most important retail report of the year comes as u s growth prospects look increasingly reliant on consumers the good news is that private retails sales reports painted a strong picture of spending in december redbook same store sales which closely track core retail sales at physical stores were up were more than 6 every week in december middle chart the bad news is that clouds continue to hang over the industrial side of the economy the empire and philly fed surveys for january were mixed on the headline but details pointed to slower activity in the factory sector the headline of both surveys are derived from independent questions on business activity constructing each index like the ism equal weighting of production new orders employment supplier deliveries and inventories showed further slippage bottom chart the ism and regional pmis remain in positive territory however and hard data suggest industrial output is hanging in there overall industrial production rose 0 3 in december while manufacturing output rose 1 1 amid a nearly a 5 jump in autos production with global growth easing and trade general policy uncertainty elevated we would not be surprised to see manufacturing production ease up over the next couple of months as the shutdown has dragged on concerns are mounting about its ultimate impact to growth the length of the shutdown points to growing spillovers in terms of consumer spending not just as federal workers have now missed a paycheck but for the swath of contractors reliant on government work for now the impact in terms of employment looks to be contained while the labor department reported 10 500 former federal employees filing initial jobless claims 5 000 more than the previous week total initial claims fell for a second straight week that suggests most contractors are still on their company payrolls although it does not shed light on pay and spending u s outlook existing home sales tuesday after rebounding 1 9 in november we are expecting existing home sales to fall by an identical amount in december sales have been held back by higher mortgage rates in november and december and poor weather which kept many potential home buyers indoors sales are also being hindered by a lack of affordable product and overall inventories remain relatively low home prices should moderate further as sales have weakened significantly in parts of the country where home prices tend to be more expensive including major markets along the west coast and the more densely populated areas in the northeast inventories of higher priced homes have risen and sellers are cutting their asking prices we are looking for this to continue this year as overall economic growth struggles and homeowners in higher tax states come to grips with the new tax law previous 1 9 wells fargo 1 9 consensus 0 9 month over month leading indicators thursday forecasts for the index of leading indicators are clouded by the lack of economic news released this past month due to the government shutdown the leading indicators are produced by the conference board and will published on thursday our own forecast calls for a 0 1 percent drop which is in line with the consensus much of what goes into the leading indicators and coincident indicators has been reported the bls has continued to report data on jobless claims the ism data is available and all of the financial components are available what is missing however is fairly vital data on new orders for consumer goods orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and building permits this is the most cyclical part of the economy and is where much of the recent weakness has been the missing data and how the conference board deals with it means that this data may be revised substantially once the government shutdown finally ends previous 0 2 wells fargo 0 1 consensus 0 1 month over month other indicators the government shutdown will take a huge bite out of the economic releases this coming week we will miss data on international trade retail and wholesale inventories new home sales factory orders and housing starts we will continue to receive data on weekly jobless claims on thursday which are already exceptionally low at just 213 000 and expected to fall slightly further for the week of january 19 we will also get reports on manufacturing conditions from the richmond fed and kansas city fed on wednesday and thursday which we do not forecast the regional fed manufacturing surveys all turned lowed in december but have been mixed so far this month the empire survey plunged 7 6 points to 3 9 in january while the philadelphia fed survey rose 7 9 points to 17 we will probably see mixed results from the factory sector once again this week with the richmond fed likely holding up better than the kansas city fed which is seeing some pullback in energy related investment previous richmond fed 8 kansas city fed 3 global review global uncertainties abound the international events and data of the past week pointed to a still uncertain outlook and suggest it might still take some time for global economies to stabilize and global central banks to resume tightening in the u k pm may s brexit deal was heavily defeated by the parliament although the government subsequently survived a no confidence vote the path forward remains uncertain although we ultimately expect the brexit deal to be struck in the eurozone uncertainty relates primarily to the path of the economy highlighted over the past week by subdued german gdp and a large fall in eurozone industrial production global uncertainties abound the focal point of the global economic picture this week was the united kingdom specifically a parliamentary vote on u k prime minister theresa may s brexit withdrawal deal while a defeat was widely expected the margin of defeat 432 202 was larger than expected still may s government survived a vote of no confidence following the initial defeat on the withdrawal deal and may is now expected to hold cross party talks to devise a plan b on how to proceed these discussions could involve a proposal for a second referendum but we expect that proposal will be denied and instead we expect u k parliament will ultimately devise an alternative deal that appeases the european union and allows the united kingdom to leave the e u with a deal on march 29 in the interim until there is a clear path forward we see downside risks for the u k economy and the pound as the uncertainty weighs on business consumer and investor sentiment indeed there was little in this week s u k data that was upbeat in tone the december cpi was benign slowing to 2 1 year over year while core cpi firmed slightly to 1 9 meanwhile december retail sales fell 0 9 month over month partly reversing their sizeable november gain another area of lingering uncertainty is the overall strength of the eurozone economy while the european consumer appears to be holding up ok including a gain in november retail sales and drop in unemployment the manufacturing sector remains under significant pressure this week the eurozone reported a 1 7 month over month decline in november industrial production with weakness broad based across the major economies of germany france italy and spain on an annual basis eurozone industrial production fell 3 3 the largest decline since late 2012 meanwhile germany the region s largest economy reported full year 2018 gdp growth on 1 5 down from 2 2 in 2017 in what was a relatively minor silver lining the german statistics office said there were signs of a slight recovery in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter the outlook for china s economy also remains somewhat uncertain despite some signs of progress on the u s china trade front china has resumed purchases of certain u s products including soybeans and also temporarily suspended additional tariffs on u s made vehicles meanwhile u s president trump has indicated he thinks a trade deal is likely that said the timing and scope of any trade deal if reached remains uncertain and for now u s tariffs on chinese goods that were imposed earlier in 2018 appear to be having an increasing impact after what appeared to be some front loading of chinese exports in recent months perhaps aimed add lessening the pain from any additional u s trade actions in 2019 trade growth slowed noticeably in december in local currency terms chinese exports slowed to just 0 2 year over year while imports actually fell 3 1 against that backdrop authorities continue to pledge further monetary and fiscal stimulus measures aimed at supporting the chinese economy global outlook china gdp monday next week offers an important scorecard on the performance of china s economy in 2018 in the form of q4 gdp as well as december activity china s economy displayed a steady easing in growth last quarter a trend that we believe continued into the fourth quarter we forecast q4 gdp slowed to 6 4 year over year which would match the slowest pace of chinese growth seen during the global financial crisis u s china trade tensions and an associated slowing in chinese export growth have been contributing factors to the slowdown prompting authorities to respond with growth supportive monetary and fiscal policies almost as interesting as the overall pace of economic growth will be insights into economic performance by sector on that front december retail sales are forecast to have remained steady at 8 1 year over year but industrial production growth is expected to have eased further to 5 3 year over year previous 6 5 wells fargo 6 4 consensus 6 4 year over

and contributing to subdued gdp growth overall in its latest monetary policy report the bank of canada projected a temporary slowing in growth as lower oil prices depress investment and output and in that context consumer spending and retail sales will be monitored in the months ahead as to whether they can offer a source of relative stability nominal retail sales rose 0 3 month over month in october and in fact have not declined on a monthly basis since june that run is expected to have come to end in november with the consensus forecast for retail sales to have fallen by 0 7 although

manufacturing pmi has fallen for five straight months and the services pmi for three straight months through the latest data for december 2018 for the manufacturing sector that underwhelming trend is expected to have continued into january with the consensus forecasting a slight fall to 51 3 in contrast the services pmi should show some improvement with a forecast increase to 51 5 the european

of fed speakers were on the wires this week expounding their views on the outlook for monetary policy neel kashkari president of the minneapolis fed said that i m not seeing evidence to support further hiking which was not a huge surprise given that he is widely seen as one of the most dovish members of the federal open market committee fomc dallas fed president kaplan echoed kashkari by stating that the fed would be wise to give time and be patient the comments by kashkari and kaplan are interesting but they are not overly relevant because neither bank president is a voting member of the fomc this year perhaps more telling were the comments by esther george president of the kansas city fed and new york fed president john williams not only are george and williams voting members of the fomc this year but both tend to have relatively hawkish views george said that it seems to me that we should proceed with caution and be patient in his speech on friday williams asked the rhetorical question of how the fed should respond to an outlook of slowing growth he answered his own question in one word carefully if relatively hawkish members of the fomc are urging restraint then it seems likely that the fed will refrain from raising rates in the foreseeable future these comments by fed policymakers reinforce our own view that the fomc will remain on hold at the january 30 march 20 and may 1 policy meetings as the committee digests incoming economic data the government shutdown has precluded the release of some economic data but we think that once the data start to flow in earnest again they will show that the u s economy continues to grow at a pace that is strong enough to push the unemployment rate which is already near a 50 year low even lower if as we expect many fomc members then reason that the tightness in the labor market will lead to further wage acceleration that could potentially lead to higher inflation then we would look for the fomc to tap on the brakes again with another 25 bp rate hike this summer topic of the week this week we welcome jen this week we welcome jen licis as the newest analyst to join the economics group we wanted to take some time to introduce jen as she begins work on our team jen hails from ohio where she recently completed her masters of science in finance with a specialization in investments at the university of cincinnati uc jen also completed her undergrad education at uc and proudly holds a bachelor s degree in economics jen solidified her interest in economics while in college taking a variety of courses with the highlight being her participation in an economics study abroad program in australia jen hopes to explore various research topics throughout her time with the group with a particular interest in foreign exchange and inflation prior to joining wells fargo jen completed several internships including at dealer tire fidelity charitable and the financial industry regulatory authority finra jen cites her most recent internship with finra as giving her a varied perspective on different aspects of the financial services industry which she believes will help her excel in her current role jen s work in corporate strategy at dealer tire as well as her experience with the investment team at fidelity charitable have also given her valuable skills to contribute to our group when not analyzing economic data jen pursues her passion for running and staying active and plans to explore the variety of running trails and outdoor activities charlotte has to offer credit market insights majoring in debt is the housing market another thing that millennials have killed the homeownership rate fell five percentage points between 2005 and 2014 with an even more pronounced eight point decline among adults aged 25 34 only 37 of young adults currently own homes down from a peak of 44 one explanation for this decline is the explosion in student loan debt rising enrollment and skyrocketing tuition costs have caused student loan debt to more than double over the past decade to almost 1 5 trillion more than total credit card or auto loan debt it is natural to wonder if this growing indebtedness is discouraging or inhibiting young graduates from doubling down in a sense and taking out a mortgage in fact new research from the federal reserve estimates that around 20 of the decline in young adult homeownership between 2005 and 2014 can be attributed to higher student loan burdens clearly paying off these loans leaves potential homebuyers with less disposable income to apply toward a monthly mortgage payment or perhaps more importantly toward a down payment furthermore falling behind on these payments can damage credit scores and impair access to affordable financing the psychological burden of such a debt load often tens of thousands of dollars with delinquency rates over 10 before even the first day of a first job likely also has an effect on the oft analyzed millennial psyche that said student loan debt is by and large an investment in one s human capital with an overwhelmingly positive return higher education drives future earnings potential median weekly earnings for those with a bachelor s degree are more than 60 higher than for those with only a high school diploma college graduates then in theory should eventually be better able to afford homeownership all else equal all of this takes place however amidst a broader context of declining affordability for years home price appreciation and rent growth have outpaced wage growth mortgage rates have climbed higher and there has been insufficient new supply in the markets in which millennials want to live
the rising personal savings rate may pave the way for strong consumer spending the financial crisis that crippled the us economy in 2007 shook the global landscape the aftershock sent the markets into turmoil resulting in the great recession which saw the us economy s gross domestic product gdp shrink by 5 1 from the fourth quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2009 the crisis affected most people and it clearly showcased the frailties in the modern economic system with a bevy of news reports focusing on financial derivatives to corporate malfeasance the paltry american personal savings rate was an afterthought according to economists at wells fargo the savings measure can be thought of as personal saving as a share of after tax income kevin lansing a macroeconomic researcher from the federal reserve bank of san francisco notes that since 2000 the average personal savings rate was 1 9 in comparison to 5 2 in the 1990s lansing explains that the sharp reversals in the savings rate during the 2000s could have been caused by the burgeoning rise in the stock market along with housing prices consumers mistook the rise in their stocks and housing values as an increase in their savings which eventually led them to spend and acquire debt the debt to personal income rose to a mammoth of 118 in 2005 which stressed household balance sheets as the recession took hold many consumers and private sector enterprises had to deleverage their debt leading to a loss in demand and an increase in savings the us economy tumbled and extraordinary measures were taken by the federal reserve to save the economy from collapse recent savings rate the savings rate has now jumped after the housing bubble rocked consumer finances according to the federal reserve bank of st louis economic data fred the average personal savings rate in 2007 was 3 however in 2008 people started to save more to deleverage and pay off debts which resulted in an average savings rate of 4 9 from 2008 15 the average savings rate has been approximately 5 7 with the highest reading of 10 5 in december 2012 the latest reading on the personal savings rate in february 2015 came in at 5 8 this is surprising for analysts as it is the highest rate in more than two years admittedly there has been a string of disappointing news from the us economy such as poor job growth along with a stronger dollar which is hurting exports but even with the disruption caused by the los angeles port strikes there has been good news with wage gains and lower oil prices while the former has seen rather poor increases over the past couple of years the statistic has increased by 2 1 from a year ago in march hence the question of a rising personal savings rate needs to be answered and its implications if any for the us economy must be analyzed reasons for higher personal savings rate the long and brutal winter that pummeled the american northeast clearly affected consumer buying behavior even with personal income rising by 0 4 in february consumer spending barely budged as it grew by 0 1 harsh winters can dampen people s appetite for consumerism and it could lead to a higher savings rate as the shortened spring leads to summer there may be an increase in consumption due to pent up demand spending that is bound to increase after a period of saving and sluggish buying the consumer confidence index may reflect this buoyed outlook as it rose by 2 5 points in march mark vitner and michael brown economists at wells fargo see the latest reading as a sign of better spending to come in spring the steep fall in brent and wti crude oil prices has pushed down gasoline prices on april 7 2015 nationwide gas prices were 2 38 nationwide which is 1 20 less than a year ago according to analysts at gasbuddy los angeles may see gasoline prices hover between 2 80 and 3 10 from may through august lower gasoline prices should fuel demand as it is a tax cut for the middle class however as aforementioned the savings rate has risen as people are pocketing the gains rather than spending cash for consumers to start spending more they will have to believe that gasoline prices will stay low in the long term this is almost the same as tax cuts not leading to extra spending because people believe that taxes will rise again in the future in a recent survey from the consumer federation of america consumers see gasoline prices rising by 50 to 3 20 in the next two years consumers may be saving now in anticipation for higher gasoline prices in the future the great recession scarred the general populace as many people were left unemployed or stuck with lower wages millennials were greatly affected as they suffer from low starting salaries that could lead to lower income gains in the future even with a purring economy recent graduates may find it tedious to switch jobs considering the realities they faced during the financial crisis no matter the recovery taking place people were hurt by the recession and this could lead to tepid recoveries along with slower spending and higher savings negativity bias could be used to explain some of the risk aversion this is when the brain is more sensitive to negative news than positive news indeed the great recession brought a lot of unpleasantness over a long period of time consumers are attuned to the unpredictable future and they are taking the necessary action saving more this could explain the higher average savings rate from 2008 onward with a lot of debt taken prior to the popping of the housing bubble private sector companies and individuals had to deleverage economist richard koo from nomura research institute chalks this to balance sheet recessions according to koo balance sheet recessions lead to minimizing debt instead of maximizing profits following the bursting of a nation wide asset price bubble japan was plagued by a balance sheet recession during the 1990s the main problem stems from the deleveraging that takes place that causes income to be used to pay down debts presently people may even use their incomes to pay down accumulated student loan debts nonetheless consumers want to bolster their balance sheet before increasing consumption implications of higher savings rate income will be diverted away from consumption as people save their money and pay down their debts insightful research by charles atkins and susan lund showcase that by keeping incomes constant and increasing the personal savings rate by 1 this will cause a 100 billion fall in consumer spending the researchers also mention that an increase in us incomes by 2 a year would allow households to reduce their debt to income ratio by 5 and have a personal savings rate of 2 3 according to a new york times article the average us consumer s debt to income ratio peaked at 130 right before the recession with an expectation of increased wages in the future there will be more income to spend and save in the spring as per research from oxford economics higher savings can be channeled into the financial markets for more investment this could lead to an increase in capital stock and innovation that could fuel economic growth in the future oxford economics contends that a higher level of household and national saving enables an increase in investment without a worsening of the us s foreign borrowing position without savings to fund a healthy 20 25 of gdp investment rate there might be an increase in borrowing from foreign investors such borrowing could lead to overreliance on finicky foreign investment oxford economics reports that the us personal savings rate needs to be maintained at 5 9 as the investment rate stood at 19 of gdp in 2013 even if an increase in personal savings can lead to higher investment there must be demand for any expectation of investment researchers jamee moudud and ajit zacharias showcase that saving needed to finance investment comes mainly from retained earnings and not from household saving as a result an increase in demand from consumers can lead to higher profitability for businesses especially in a recovering economy that should be the impetus for capital investment a higher savings rate or less government spending may take away from the consumption required to fuel investment finally an increased personal savings rate to save or pay debts will improve consumers balance sheets which might help people weather further economic storms a sobering note comes from wells fargo economists who mention that 47 percent of the households save nothing out of current income this measure fell from almost 48 in 2010 but the high figure is a concern it is also worrisome that 64 of the working populace has only three months of expense income if there was a problem with their main income nick bunker from the washington center for equitable growth concurs because the savings rate differs at each level of the income distribution it is no surprise that the top 1 was able to save on average 36 from 1986 to 2012 in fact the bottom 90 averaged a negative savings rate from 1998 2008 this statistic should have increased after the great recession but it showcases a dearth of savings for the most vulnerable the us personal savings rate has seen an uptick since the bursting of the housing bubble but it might start falling in the near future as balance sheets are repaired an inequality of savings dampens the rosy picture of higher expected consumption in the future it may not be a problem for us president barack obama at the moment but it is something the next

brexit and us china trade negotiation were the two major themes last week after a week of drama it s still unclear exactly what kind of brexit deal would get through the parliament there s some anticipation for uk prime minister theresa may on her plan b on monday yet she could fail to deliver again nevertheless sterling ended as the strongest one last week on perceived diminishing chance on no deal brexit on the other hand dollar gained as there are signs of progress in the trade talks or at least words from the us side were positive the developments also lifted stocks and treasury yields the us government shutdown is extending its record run with no end in sight but it s largely ignored by traders new zealand dollar ended as the weakest one followed by swiss franc and then yen sentiments improved on progress of us china trade negotiations global market sentiments were broadly lifted by optimism that us and china will eventually make a trade deal to avert full blown trade war china vice premier liu he has confirmed his visit to washington for next round of negotiation on january 30 31 ahead of that comments from the us side were generally positive white house economic adviser larry kudlow noted on friday that we re making progress in negotiating on the grandest scale between the two countries ever we re covering everything he added it s going to take time we are moving it s reported that the us is demanding regular reviews of reforms in china as the latter has history of unfulfilled promises at the same time tariffs threat won t go away even if it s a deal to ensure thorough implementation of the agreed reforms in particular us is known to have heavy concerns over intellectual property protection technology transfers industrial subsidies and other trade barriers rather than just trade deficit on the other hand it s also reported that china is offering a six year path to eliminate trade surplus with the us by 2024 it stood at usd 323b last year that is seen as doable on the chinese side as they could just shift imports from other countries to the us but that will likely be seen as inadequate by trump and utrs robert lighthizer their concerns are more on opening up market access in china rather than just selling to china dow extended rebound more upside in near term nevertheless investors were happy with the progress so far as dow ended up strongly again to close at 24706 35 55 day ema was decisively taken out for now as long as 24014 78 support holds the rebound from 21712 53 should head towards 61 8 retracement of 26951 81 to 21712 53 at 24932 09 or it could rise further to 78 6 retracement at 25820 34 before topping more importantly dow is now back above 55 flat 55 week ema the development suggests that price actions from 26951 81 are just correcting the up trend from 15450 45 rather than the 10 year up trend from 6469 95 if that s the case the range of the consolidation is pretty much set inverted us yield curve turned flat optimism is also clearly reflected in the us yield curve from 1 year 2 610 to 2 year 2 616 to 3 year 2 604 and 5 year 2 627 the curve is essentially flat rather than inverted 10 year yield also extended the rebound from 2 554 to close at 2 784 last week technically strong support was seen from long term channel as well as 38 2 retracement of 1 336 to 3 248 at 2 517 sustained break of 55 week ema now at 2 831 should confirm completion of the pull back from 3 248 and that should also confirm that the up trend from 1 336 is saved dollar index s correction might be completed dollar index s recovery from 95 02 extended higher last week to close at 96 33 the developments are turning positive for the index considering that it drew support from 55 week ema eur usd s corrective rise looks completed earlier than expected at 1 1569 similarly usd chf s corrective pull back is likely completed at 0 9176 too usd jpy has taken out a key resistance level at 109 46 the above development further rebound is both stocks and yield will revive the chances of fed s rate hikes in the second half of the year and that should be dollar positive too hence we ll pay attention to reaction from 55 day ema this week firm break will bring retest of 97 71 high but rejection by the ema will extend the correction from 97 71 with another decline sterling ended strong after brexit drama after a week of brexit drama sterling ended as the strongest one last week despite paring some gains on friday in short uk prime minister theresa may s brexit deal suffered historic defeat in the commons on tuesday but she then narrowly survived the confidence vote on wednesday now may is continuing with her liaison with uk mps and eu to line up an amended deal may is expected to table her plan b on monday the commons has scheduled to vote on the amended motion on january 29 domestically there is no serious discussion between may and opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn corbyn insisted that may have to take no deal off the table but may refused to do so because it is not within the government s power to rule out no deal on the other hand former conservative prime minister john major criticized that her deal is dead and i don t think honestly that tinkering with it is going to make very much difference if any difference at all with the eu it s reported that may is repeating the same demand regarding the irish backstop those include either a legally binding time limit right for uk to unilaterally withdraw or a commitment to to a trade deal finalization before 2021 may has been in talks with h dutch prime minister mark rutte german chancellor angela merkel french president emmanuel macron and irish leader leo varadkar at this point we re not seeing any progress for may s deal in whatever amendment to get enough vote from the parliament yet but let s see what she ll say on monday ecb and boj to meet this week two central banks will meet this week ecb and boj at the meeting in december ecb has already turned cautious by noting that risks are broadly balanced by moving to the downside since then economic data remained weak in particular headline cpi slowed back to 1 6 yoy while core cpi was unchanged at 1 0 showing no upward pressure but for now the deterioration in outlook is unlikely strong enough to prompt ecb to change its forward guidance yet that is ecb will likely maintain the wordings of keeping interest rates unchanged at present level at least through summer of 2019 policymakers would probably wait for new economy projections in march first before making any changes on the other hand boj will release new economic projections this week and we may see downward revision in inflation estimates in december japan all item cpi slowed to 0 3 yoy down from 0 8 yoy and matched expectation core cpi all item ex fresh food slowed to 0 7 yoy down from 0 9 yoy and missed expectation of 0 8 yoy core core cpi al item ex fresh food energy stayed unchanged at 0 3 yoy the data showed that even discounting the fall in energy prices consumer inflation stayed week and apparently the recovery is not passed on to consumers and business remained reluctant to raise prices the data added to the case for boj to cut inflation forecasts back in october boj projects core cpi to hit 1 4 in fiscal 2019 and then 1 5 in fiscal 2020 such projections would be trimmed to reflect the decline in oil as well as global slowdown position trading strategy as market sentiments improve with further rebound in stocks back to normal yield curve and progress in us china trade negotiations we d expect traders to start pricing in fed s rate hike again they were rather pessimistic just two to three weeks ago when the chance of a cut by december was higher than that of a hike hence we ll look for opportunity to buy dollar ahead last week we noted that buying sterling was tempting on receding chance of no deal brexit this week selling sterling also looks tempting as the rally lost momentum but still we d avoid it as brexit outcome remains unpredictable usd jpy s rebound from 104 69 is extending and looks strong but the structure still suggests it s corrective thus we ll not long usd jpy we ll also avoid selling aud usd since downside will be limited should stock rebound continue comparing euro and swiss franc the franc is the preferred one to sell as eur chf drew support from 1 12 handle and it s trying to extend the rebound actually cad chf long is a candidate too considering the strength in loonie thanks to oil price rally usd cad also stays near term bearish but comparing usd chf and cad chf usd chf is in a clearer medium term rise hence usd chf is preferred taking a look at usd chf firstly structure of the fall from 1 0128 suggests that it s corrective strong rebound from medium term trend line also suggests that medium term rise from 0 9186 is still in progress last week s break of near term channel resistance suggests that the correction is completed at 0 9716 already and larger rise might be ready to resume though as usd chf is facing 0 9963 resistance and eur chf retreated ahead of 1 1340 8 we ll choose to buy usd chf on dip that is we ll buy usd chf at 0 9920 mid way between 0 9963 and 4 hour 55 ema at 0 9876 stop will be placed at 0 9825 below 0 9856 minor support target is placed at 1 0300 as we expect the upside to extend to take on 1 0342 resistance 2017 high risk reward ratio is at 1 4 which is acceptable gbp usd weekly outlook gbp usd s corrective rise from 1 2391 extended to 1 3001 last week but formed a temporary top there and retreated initial bias is neutral this week for some consolidations first further rally is expected as long as 1 2668 minor support holds on the upside above 1 3001 will target 1 3174 resistance which is close to 38 2 retracement of 1 4376 to 1 2391 at 1 3149 we d expect strong resistance from there to limit upside at least on first attempt on the downside break of 1 2668 support will argue that such rebound is completed and turn bias back to the downside for retesting 1 2391 low in the bigger picture whole medium term rebound from 1 1946 2016 low should have completed at 1 4376 already after rejection from 55 month ema the structure and momentum of the fall from 1 4376 argues that it s resuming long term down trend from 2 1161 2007 high and this will remain the preferred case as long as 1 3174 structural resistance holds gbp usd should target a test on 1 1946 first decisive break there will confirm our bearish view however sustained break of 1 3174 will invalidate this case and turn outlook bullish in the longer term picture outlook in gbp usd remains bearish rebound from 1 1946 was rejected solidly by falling 55 month ema the pair was limited well below 38 2 retracement of 2 1161 2007 high to 1 1946 as well as the decade long falling trend line on break of 1 1946 next target will be 61 8 projection of 1 7190 to 1 1946 from 1 4376 at 1 1135
sputnik pavel lisitsyn largely from gold mined in the country dwindling dollars this week the russian central bank reported that it had added to its gold reserves again in 2018 with the sovereign stockpile jumping by nearly 275 tonnes to 2 112 tonnes total the stockpile valued at close to 87 billion at today s exchange rate and comprising 18 6 percent of russia s total reserves of 468 5 billion has allowedrussian gold reserves have been growing from just over 500 tonnes in 2009 to the present figure a record for modern russia and moving ever closer to the 20th century soviet record of 2 800 tonnes on the eve of the second world war russia s status as a major gold producing country has enabled it to top up reservesalthough the russian ministry of finance has not yet published the complete 2018 figures on gold production for 2018 january october 2018 figures reflect a gold output of 264 99 tonnes in the first three quarters of the year up from 261 17 tonnes produced during the same period in 2017 according to financial analysts speaking to the russian online news portal gazeta ru the growing share of gold in reserves is a subject which has become particularly relevant in light of the growing threat of new us sanctions against moscow targeting dollar settlements by russian banks as sputnik indicated last week the gold buy up has come in conjunction with the russian central bank s serving to make up for it as of october 2018 russian investment in us treasury bills once a staple of russia s reserve portfolio dropped to just 14 8 billion down from a whopping 176 3 billion in 2010 when the figure hit its peak as of q2 2018 us dollar denominated assets in russia s reserves sat at 21 9 percent of the total down from 46 3 percent a year earlier according to alor broker analyst alexei antonov although the russian central bank may continue to purchase some us dollars t bills and other obligations in the future the overall strategy on us debt seems unlikely to change for his part bks broker senior analyst sergei suverov noted thathe said last week russian prime minister dmitri medvedev indicated that it was the us s aggressive and even stupid economic policy and not some political vendetta which prompted moscow to change its trade and investment strategies as is known we are also widening the use of rubles and other currencies in foreign trade transactions medvedev predicted that the tendency toward rejecting the dollar as a global reserve currency will only grow with time not only in russia but internationally he said the russian central bank began diversifying its international reserves in april in response to fresh us sanctions against moscow late last year addressing the alleged weaponisation of the dollar russian president vladimir putin quipped that the white house was shooting itself not in the foot but a bit higher we do not have the goal to move away from the dollar we are forced to do this let me assure you we will do this we are not leaving the dollar the dollar is leaving us putin said following the publication of a de dollarisation plan announced by the ceo of vtb russia s second largest bank
the direct impact of the trade war on hong kong is small us china entrepot trade via hong kong in 2017 was just 9 per cent of hong kong s total export and import trade the majority of the items included in the trade war also do not pass via hong kong but hong kong is feeling the conflict s indirect effects with a deteriorating business environment discouraging investment and disrupting business planning and development more importantly any slowdown of the chinese economy would reduce demand for hong kong s banking and finance professional and logistics services if the trade war escalates chinese demand for raw materials and semi manufactured goods will also fall affecting hong kong s re exports to china from countries other than the united states the world economy will grow at a lower rate than expected in 2019 in addition to the us china trade war issues related to brexit currency crises in some emerging economies and a change in monetary policy in the united states are impacting global growth figures the international monetary fund s most recent forecast for global economic growth is 3 5 per cent lower than the 3 7 per cent predicted earlier this year some economists are also warning of a possible financial crisis or at least increased financial risks as a decade of quantitative easing comes to an end interest rates are on the rise and emerging economies are experiencing the consequential capital outflows some doubt whether the world is more prepared to cushion financial risks than in 1997 98 or 2007 08 even under the linked exchange rate the hong kong government was forced to intervene to defend its dollar in 2018 though hong kong s robust monetary system and prudent supervision should be able to keep the country out of financial crisis the hiking of interest rates and a deteriorating business environment have triggered adjustments in the stock and property markets irrespective of whether such adjustments should be made for market corrections domestic consumption will likely decrease due to the adverse wealth effect the silver lining for hong kong is favourable geo economics in the region the hong kong asean free trade agreement that was concluded in november 2017 is proving particularly significant despite the fact that the agreement will not be enforced until early 2019 hong kong asean economic interactions are already on the rise in the first three quarters of 2018 hong kong s domestic exports to asean its second largest trading partner after mainland china increased by 7 3 per cent and imports by 20 1 per cent year on year hong kong also serves as asean s stepping stone to china with 599 asean companies established in hong kong as of june 2018 another favourable development is the formation of the greater bay area which includes nine guangdong cities plus hong kong and macau the bay bridge linking zhuhai macau and hong kong was opened in october 2018 bringing hong kong more chinese tourists and businesses in the long run the bridge will play a key role in facilitating the development of the greater bay area the greater bay area reflects a push towards a common market with free flows of human and capital resources goods and services and information the major opportunity for hong kong is synergy with guangdong cities such as shenzhen zhuhai and guangzhou in innovation and technology hong kong may also see an opportunity to establish bridgeheads in guangdong cities in health care and educational services domestic investment and consumption remained strong in hong kong in 2018 a trend that is expected to continue into 2019 the government has significantly increased expenditure on education and is committed to investing an additional hk 20 billion us 2 6 billion in research and development another hk 20 billion has been put aside for the longer term development of the lok ma chau technology loop adjacent to shenzhen private consumption is supported by near full employment the unemployment rate was 2 8 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 the demand for professional business and financial services from mainland china and elsewhere has been strong which will continue unless us china relations further deteriorate or global financial risks increase assuming that a short term solution to the us china trade war will be achieved following the 90 day truce and that federal reserve interest rate increases will be milder than expected hong kong should be able to attain 3 per cent gdp growth in 2019 slightly higher than the past 10 year trend of 2 9 per cent this would be still lower than the 3 8 per cent achieved in 2017 and the estimated 3 2 per cent expected for 2018 but given the current state of play 3 per cent may be a figure to cheer about edward k y chen is chairman of the board of directors at the school of professional and continuing education the university of hong kong this article is part of an eaf special feature series on 2018 in review and the year ahead
according to financial analysts speaking to the russian online news portal gazeta ru the growing share of gold in reserves is part of the strategy to reduce the country s dependence on the us dollar a subject which has become particularly relevant in light of the growing threat of new us sanctions against moscow targeting dollar settlements by russian banks as sputnik indicated last week the gold buy up has come in conjunction with the russian central bank s dumping of some 24 4 percent of its dollar denominated reserves with euro and yuan denominated assets plus gold serving to make up for it as of october 2018 russian investment in us treasury bills once a staple of russia s reserve portfolio dropped to just 14 8 billion down from a whopping 176 3 billion in 2010 when the figure hit its peak as of q2 2018 us dollar denominated assets in russia s reserves sat at 21 9 percent of the total down from 46 3 percent a year earlier dwindling dollars according to alor broker analyst alexei antonov although the russian central bank may continue to purchase some us dollars t bills and other obligations in the future the overall strategy on us debt seems unlikely to change
london if there is one useful conclusion that economists and investors can draw from the crazy year that has just ended indeed from the whole crazy decade since the global financial crisis of 2008 it is this as they say in hollywood nobody knows anything in the film industry the richest and most experienced studios and producers spend vast amounts of time and money on audience research but still have no idea if their latest creations will turn out to be hits or flops so why be surprised if the same is true of financial markets or for that matter of commodity prices policymaking and corporate performance why be shocked if the world s richest company admits as apple did after christmas that it has no idea how many iphones it will sell in china or if the world s best informed energy traders predict a global supply shortage that will boost oil prices above 100 just when a supply glut sends the market tumbling to 50 or if the us president does not know if he hates or loves global trade or if stock markets predict a global economic boom when bond markets predict recession and then both reverse suddenly contradicting each other in the opposite direction at this time last year economic expectations were almost universally optimistic every region of the world appeared to be simultaneously booming for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis central bankers were confident that they could safely start to withdraw their extraordinary monetary stimulus and stock market investors were almost unanimously bullish yet 2018 turned into the worst year for investors since the financial crisis forcing central bankers to begin backing away from their plans to normalise monetary policy economists to downgrade their growth forecasts and many businesses to prepare for recession in 2019 or 2020 what went wrong economic data were only slightly weaker than expected in the second half of 2018 the world bank for example has reduced its estimates of global growth in 2018 and 2019 by just 0 1 percentage points to 3 per cent and 2 9 per cent respectively since its june outlook the main cause for concern has been the behaviour of financial markets many economists saw the simultaneous plunge in long term interest rates and equity prices in december as an indicator of recession either investors know something awful that is not yet evident in the statistics or declining market sentiment would become a self fulfilling prophecy by causing businesses or consumers to cut back but before concluding that financial markets can always predict or shape the future we should recall that economic and policy changes usually move financial expectations not vice versa so what events apart from market volatility would cause a recession or severe global slowdown a popular answer is simply the passage of time the global economic expansion that began in 2009 has already lasted almost 10 years if a us recession does not occur by 2020 the country will have experienced the longest uninterrupted expansion in its history there is nothing in economic theory or historical experience to suggest that expansions die of old age or that recessions happen spontaneously but expansions do become more vulnerable to diseases of old age high interest rates rising energy prices accelerating inflation or banking crises that are triggered when unsustainably high property prices suddenly collapse and if none of these economic mishaps occurs eventually political leaders can become recklessly overconfident leading to wars trade conflicts or gross budgetary mismanagement several of these problems began to appear in 2018 rising interest rates in the us fiscal tightening in italy and much of europe an escalating tariff war between the us and china and higher energy prices around the world it is not surprising therefore that the world economy slowed in 2018 instead of accelerating as most economists including me expected but many of the forces that caused last year s slowdown are now reversing oil prices have fallen us bond yields are back to almost where they started in 2018 trade conflicts appear to be subsiding and china is easing macroeconomic policy at least to some extent and will probably move to outright stimulus if its economy weakens much further the policy changes and political events just described were clearly the main drivers of last year s market shocks for example january s stock market correction and volatility surge were clearly caused by fears of us overheating and rising bond yields once the overheating concerns subsided bond repricing turned out to be very limited equities everywhere rebounded and the dollar remained very weak dollar weakness and global equity strength reversed abruptly in may when markets were hit by a perfect storm of the three political shocks that i had considered most likely soaring oil prices in anticipation of iran sanctions the us china tariff war and the formation of a left right populist government in italy in october with political risks receding emerging markets started to outperform stock markets stabilised elsewhere even in europe the oil price returned to what looked like a stable pre sanctions range of 60 65 and the strengthening of the dollar ended in short markets seemed to move broadly in line with the changing political and macroeconomic fundamentals until everything suddenly went haywire in early december for the next three weeks until december 24 the s p 500 collapsed by 16 per cent for no apparent reason brent oil plunged from 61 to 50 the dollar again strengthened and yields on 10 year us bonds fell from 3 per cent to 2 7 per cent if all of the main fundamentals suggest that economic growth in 2019 could end up as strong or even stronger than in 2018 why did equity prices and bond yields suddenly collapse last month could it be that investors are so confused by political chaos that they have given up trying to anticipate what could happen next if so then markets instead of being predictive become increasingly reactive simply extrapolating recent events in a world where nobody knows anything investors may be no better than hollywood

by cassandra garrison and gabriel burin buenos aires jan 18 reuters argentina s central bank bought 190 million in foreign exchange markets over the past week to weaken its peso currency a radical change from just months ago when it was spending billions to prop it up and may be forced to intervene further after a run on the peso last year halved its value the central bank introduced a super tight monetary policy that boosted the currency but over the past week the strengthening currency has slipped outside the limits of a non intervention band agreed with the international monetary fund in part the improvement in the peso s fortunes has been due to dwindling expectations that the federal reserves will raise u s interest rates rising u s treasury yields last year drained money from emerging markets hurting the peso in addition the tighter monetary policy introduced last year to stabilize the peso has left many small and medium sized argentine companies without access to pesos president mauricio macri s government froze growth in the money supply last year as part of the 56 3 billion imf agreement as a result many companies in argentina have been forced to sell dollars in recent weeks to make payments in local currency to pay suppliers salaries and taxes the combination of domestic and international factors pushed the peso to strengthen past the limit of its band for the first time on jan 10 prompting the central bank to intervene for five days in a row over the past week on thursday the bank remained on the sidelines of the market after several days of intervention as the peso fell 0 56 percent to 37 7 per u s dollar pushing it back inside the band the moving band stood at 37 523 pesos to the dollar to 48 559 on thursday yet some economists suggested the bank may be forced to resume its dollar buying in the coming days purchases of dollars could continue as pressures on the exchange rate increase because companies and families have to sell dollars to get pesos said martin vauthier director of consultancy eco go story continues while the slump in the peso last year sowed economic chaos the strengthening in the currency isn t necessarily a good thing economists say the weaker peso helped to make argentina s products more competitive overseas raising hopes that a rebound in exports could fuel growth after a painful recession argentina needs a weaker peso further peso appreciation could halt the external adjustment that argentina needs to rebalance and narrow its current account deficit said edward glossop who covers emerging markets at capital economics in london maintaining the band for carlos de sousa a senior economist at oxford economics argentina s sky high interest rates need to fall to prevent the peso from strengthening above the upper limit of its band in the medium term as the central bank has pledged not to buy more than 50 million a day to stabilize it the central bank of argentina has made too many promises you are promising that you are not going to allow the monetary base to grow and that you are not going to intervene more than 50 million a day and not more than 2 percent of your monetary base per month that is a really big set of promises de sousa said however with elections looming in october in which business friendly president mauricio macri faces a tough battle to win a second term the peso could also come under selling pressure as political uncertainty mounts economists said if the peso strays outside the band for weeks on end it would raise questions over whether the bank should drop the policy said ilya gofshteyn of standard chartered in new york it s almost a self fulfilling prophecy the more speculation heats up the more capital inflows you get and therefore the more pressure on the bank there is to let the band go all together gofshteyn said other economists took a cautious view that the band will remain in place but could flatten as the peso stabilizes over time you hope it becomes a freely floating exchange rate but there is a case for waiting until after the election before you make the next step said dirk willer an emerging market analyst at citigroup reporting by gabriel burin and cassandra garrison editing by ross colvin and phil berlowitz
grantham who forecast 2000 and 2008 declines the bubble is bursting the size and duration of the moves in stock prices in the final three months of 2018 toward their long term average valuation is consistent with the moves linked with the bursting of the technology boom in early 2000 and the crash of 1929 according to martin tarlie part of the asset allocation team at the firm overseeing about 70 billion a multiyear bubble in american stocks is now deflating as sentiment turns negative despite solid fundamentals and investors should own as few u s equities as possible according to gmo llc if that s all we experience prices are fair if the us starts to look like europe china there is more to go pic twitter com pihbmhog0r too loose too long central banks lack weapons to combat next recession new york cnn business if there s a serious recession on the horizon the world s central banks may have trouble fighting it central banks took dramatic and unorthodox steps to prevent economic collapse during the financial crisis they slashed interest rates and in the years that followed spent trillions on bonds as part of an effort to spur growth one decade later global central banks are only starting to reverse those moves interest rates in developed economies remain incredibly low in some places they re even negative the federal reserve is unloading some of the bonds it bought but central banks in europe and japan have not yet done so the question now is whether central banks waited too long to raise rates to more normal levels leaving them unprepared for the next crisis if we have a recession i think it s going to be worse than normal said kenneth rogoff a professor at harvard university and former chief economist at the international monetary fund it will be more difficult to respond politics is also making life more complicated for central banks in countries like india and turkey they ve faced threats of political interference while president donald trump has repeatedly criticized the federal reserve
until 2010 reports assessing poverty in jordan were done regularly every two to three years by the department of statistics dos a 2010 report on poverty issued by the jordanian government showed that 14 percent of the population lived under the poverty line at an annual 813 jordanian dinars 1 144 usd per individual showing a rise of 1 percent since 2008 since then however poverty statistics in jordan have been completely absent due to what critics are calling a stalling technique in the latest house discussions regarding the controversial income tax law the lower house s economy and investment committee called for the need to provide all statistics data and studies on the issue no figures neither rough nor accurate were provided and the law passed without determining a scientifically studied poverty line the law which was already a sensitive topic before the lower house brought up poverty statistics is part of a series of measures instituted since amman secured a three year credit line of 723 million us dollars from the international monetary fund in 2016 that loan intended to support economic and financial reform has the long term objective of reducing jordan s public debt from about 94 percent of gross domestic product gdp to 77 percent by 2021 the income tax law was not favorably received and resulted in the overthrowing of the hani mulki government in may later on under a new government and with a new draft the law passed both houses of parliament but is still regarded as a harmful decision by experts in an attempt to calm the waters director of the dos qasem zu bi recently said in a press conference that a comprehensive report will be launched during the first quarter of 2019 although no official figures have been presented the 2019 report is looking at a state of deterioration that has caught up with jordan according to various reports launched toward the end of 2018 jordan stepped down on the legatum prosperity index in 2018 to stand at 91 out of 149 the world bank classified its economy as a low growth scenario unicef studies showed that 20 percent of children in jordan suffer from multidimensional poverty and only 38 percent of aid required to finance the jordan response plan jrp for the 1 4 million syrian refugees was met moreover the united states reduced its funding to unrwa by 350 million usd putting 711 schools and 526 000 palestinian students in jordan at risk activist and community activist sarhan taamari who lives in the impoverished mamouneyeh neighborhood in maan 218 kilometers southwest of the capital amman said the government will try and pin this on the syrian crisis but the truth is that billions of dollars have been donated by the international community donations that could have covered refugees living costs for more than ten years privatizing jordan taamari stated that the real reason behind a collapsing gdp is the 2006 imf deal in the deal jordan agreed to sell key state companies to foreign investors now almost all critical services and natural resource productions are foreign owned the water company the total gas station and one of the three telecommunications companies are french while the potash and phosphate mines are almost all privatized and foreign owned moreover the world bank plays a critical role in jordan s energy sector and over 1 billion us dollars on investments in power and energy come from the private sector additionally jordanian businessmen have been selling their shares in state companies something that the government has been trying to conceal according to taamari in a country whose public debt has risen to 96 percent of its gdp frustrated individuals have been trying to help as many people as their limited resources allow in july 2018 when an offensive by the syrian government displaced 40 000 syrians at jordan s border jordanians lent a hand despite the government s insistence on closing the borders bringing back joy amid rising frustration in 2018 farrah matalka a graduate in social economics launched bringing joy by giving joy an independent campaign to help distribute 600 food parcels monthly and renovate houses unaffiliated with the government or privately run organizations matalka relies solely on donations from individuals via her instagram account she posts images and videos of dilapidated houses and areas and asks followers for donations other than monthly parcels the campaign takes on short term projects she has raised funds for the operation and recovery fees of child victims of fires as well as the distribution of school essentials and winter clothing these simple acts of kindness can not overshadow the clear and growing frustration with living conditions in jordan two waves of protests one that resulted in overthrowing former mp hani mulki s government and another that was filled with anti monarchy chants are obvious expressions of citizens anger the governates series of refusals to listen to ministers explanations for why the income tax law is critical is yet another sign of the government s disconnect with people paying 70 percent of their incomes to cover personal debts the rise of public debt and unemployment standing at 19 percent by the end of the year and a 30 percent rise in drug addiction cases tackling poverty in jordan needs a multiple faceted strategy as dos director qasem su bi said in a recent press conference people are anxious for the report on poverty but what is more important is how the government plans on reducing it dos spokesperson saeda momani said the report may not be published in early 2019 as the committee working on it has decided to widen the sample and include more syrian refugee representation as well i suggest we delay talking about the report for at least six months momani concluded
january 19 2019 07 08 pm updated 07 08 pm ist buenos aires like many argentine businessmen marco meloni is doing everything he can to avoid laying off staff at his textile factory despite a slump in sales more than 70 interest rates and soaring utility bills the reason he doesn t have the money to fire anyone a little reported and unusual feature of the economic crisis gripping latin america s third largest economy is the absence of many workers losing their jobs small businesses the biggest employer in argentina have been hardest hit by inflation that is nearly 48 a tumbling peso and major cuts to subsidies for public utilities that have sharply increased companies operating costs but the unemployment rate has barely budged from 9 reuters interviews with business owners in textile plastic clothing and paint industries government officials and union leaders show that many firms are adopting different strategies to try to survive until the economy begins to recover which the international monetary fund expects to begin in the second quarter firms are reducing working hours halting production on some days cutting shifts and making workers take their vacations now in anticipation of more customer demand once the economy lifts the workforce contracted by just 1 20 000 registered workers between october 2017 and october 2018 the latest government data shows that represents about 1 of the 12 million strong labour force in contrast the u s lost about 6 or 8 7 million people of its workforce during the two years of the 2007 08 great recession as companies laid off workers to stay afloat generous labour laws argentina has some of the world s most generous labour laws and they are making it more difficult for small business owners such as meloni to adapt to an economy now in recession typically in a tough economic climate a company might be expected to reduce its workforce to cut costs but in argentina taking that step could dramatically increase costs and potentially push a company into bankruptcy the labour laws make the country one of the most expensive in latin america to employ or fire a worker argentine companies are required to pay workers laid off a month for every year of service plus at least one additional month simply for informing them they are being fired and crucially there is no cap on how much a company needs to pay layoff costs in argentina are among the highest in the world according to the world bank s doing business project president steps in the argentine labour laws have helped to contain what could have been a big increase in the unemployment rate in addition president mauricio macri a free marketer who wants to reform the country s rigid labour system to encourage foreign investment is taking steps to dissuade companies from firing workers he announced on nov 13 that companies must give 10 days notice of any plans to lay off workers so that the government can help find ways to keep them employed mr macri wants to expand an existing program that helps to subsidise salaries of workers at companies that can show they are in financial straits the government has not yet issued any regulations to enforce its announcement so it is not clear whether companies are informing them of pending dismissals mr meloni said the plant which makes fabrics used to operate 24 hours a day from monday to saturday but now operates 16 hours a day five days a week like many other businesses mr meloni advanced the holidays to 100 employees with the hope that once summer ends in march demand will pick up daniel funes de rioja the head of one of argentina s biggest labour law firms said a major issue for companies was the seniority of many workers many especially in low skilled industries stay in the same job for years so paying them severance becomes very expensive production minister dante sica said companies were also reluctant to fire workers because of forecasts showing an economic recovery around the corner they prefer to suspend and not fire because of the cost of layoffs plus the cost of hiring is costly mr sica said while workers are staying in their jobs they are earning less because of the shorter hours and fewer shifts some have resorted to taking second jobs working for uber the ride hailing app for example according to anecdotal reports
via hussmanfunds while we don t presently observe conditions to look for a buying opportunity or a bottom from a full cycle standpoint we do observe conditions that are permissive of a scorching market rebound even if it only turns out to be the fast furious prone to failure variety we wouldn t dream of removing our safety nets against a market decline that i continue to expect to draw the s p 500 toward the 1000 level by the completion of this cycle still we ve prepared for the possibility of unusual volatility here most likely including one or more daily moves in the range of 4 6 potentially to the upside yes that means one or more daily moves on the order of 100 150 points on the s p 500 and 900 1300 points on the dow you think i m kidding john p hussman ph d interim comment pre open 12 26 18 in recent days we ve heard a number of analysts gushing that the s p 500 is vastly cheaper than it was only a few months ago it s worth noting that they re actually referring to an index that is now less than 10 below the steepest speculative extreme in history the chart below puts current valuations into perspective using our margin adjusted p e which is better correlated with actual subsequent 10 12 year market returns than the price forward operating earnings ratio the shiller cape the fed model and a wide range of alternative valuation measures that wall street uses to reassure investors that valuations are anything less than obscene as market conditions currently stand valuations remain extreme and market internals remain negative so aside from the likelihood of a knee jerk market spike on any variant of the word deal we continue to be in a trap door situation with respect to market risk though we did take the edge off of our negative outlook to allow for a scorching relief rally my present view is that the overall function of that relief rally has been served still it s important to be clear and this point is central to the adaptation that we made to our approach back in 2017 if our measures of market internals were to improve signaling a shift of investor psychology away from risk aversion and toward speculation we would expect to adopt a constructive market outlook though undoubtedly with a safety net given present valuation extremes there s still too much divergence across individual securities industries sectors and security types to identify that sort of shift here but we can t rule it out we ll take that evidence as it comes what i can say unequivocally is that at points where our measures of market internals become favorable we will not adopt or amplify a negative market outlook regardless of how extreme market valuations may be we learned the hard way in this half cycle that we can no longer rely on any limit to the recklessness of wall street once speculators get the bit in their teeth again safety nets would be essential in any event but if internals shift so will our outlook as market conditions currently stand valuations remain extreme and market internals remain negative so aside from the likelihood of a knee jerk market spike on any variant of the word deal we continue to be in a trap door situation with respect to market risk though we did take the edge off of our negative outlook to allow for a scorching relief rally my present view is that the overall function of that relief rally has been served as a side note i ve renamed the measure above to the margin adjusted p e mape rather than the margin adjusted cape the reason is that it seems to be confused for robert shiller s cyclically adjusted p e cape so mape it is notably the mape also avoids certain statistical artifacts such as the fixed 10 year window that will bump shiller s cape down by about 10 as depressed earnings from the 2008 2010 period roll off making the cape look cheaper this seemingly cheaper shiller cape will emerge only by virtue of restricting the denominator to earnings achieved purely during an economic expansion that at 114 months is now only marginally shorter than the 120 month expansion that peaked in march 2001 on a related note for those waiting for a recession as a signal to become more conservative about market risk recall that by the economic peak in march 2001 the s p 500 was already a year into a bear market that had taken the index down by 27 and would by october 2002 take the index down by another 30 from there pricing stocks on peak earnings the fact is that in market cycles across history margin adjusted measures are far better correlated with actual subsequent market returns than unadjusted price earnings measures on that subject it s useful to remember the words of the legendary benjamin graham who warned about pricing stocks based on earnings figures at the peak of an economic cycle the purchasers view the good current earnings as equivalent to earning power and assume that prosperity is equivalent to safety say what you like about using margin adjusted measures as an improved sufficient statistic for the very long term cash flows that u s equities deliver over time these measures are far better correlated with actual subsequent market returns than alternative earnings based measures like price forward operating earnings in over a century of data these measures are also far better correlated with the discounted sum of actual subsequent cash distributions that the s p 500 has delivered to investors over time even when we see periodic divergences between actual s p 500 total returns and those one would have projected 10 12 years earlier those divergences are correlated with the level of consumer confidence at the end of the period which is another way of saying that while valuations drive long term returns temporary extremes in valuation are generally related to cyclical extremes in investor psychology one of the more cringe worthy features of the behavior of investment professionals here is the spectacle of wall street analysts touting the reasonableness of valuations on the basis of year ahead earnings expectations that they themselves are responsible for fabricating just as in 2000 and 2007 instead of the investment profession acting as a historically informed buffer to defend investors against reckless speculation extrapolative projections like these are actually endorsed and encouraged by the very people who should know better the chart below is thanks to topdowncharts so called long term earnings projections of this magnitude are particularly offensive given the fact that measured from the peak of the economic cycle in 2007 to the current peak actual s p 500 reported gaap earnings have grown at an average rate of just 3 8 annually with revenues growing at just 2 7 measuring from the economic cycle peak of 2000 to the present gets you an average peak to peak earnings growth rate of just 5 1 annually with revenue growth of 3 4 notably those figures fully include the impact of stock repurchases which reduce the s p 500 divisor as well as the record profit margins of recent years if anything future earnings growth is likely to fall short of even what we ve observed over the past couple of decades the reason as i ve noted previously is that the real structural growth rate of the u s economy the sum of demographic labor force growth and trend productivity growth is now down to just 1 4 the faster growth rate of real gdp in recent years has been entirely the result of a decline in the rate of unemployment which now stands at just 3 9 barring a further persistent decline in unemployment we re likely to observe a slowing of real gdp growth toward 1 4 even if the economy avoids a recession add 2 inflation and earnings growth is likely to slow to less than 4 annually even if profit margins remain near recent highs by contrast an economic contraction of any magnitude at all is likely to produce a surprising plunge in s p 500 index earnings though we constantly hear that recent reductions in corporate tax rates will justify permanentlyhigher corporate profit margins the historical fact is that u s corporations have generally competed on the basis of after tax profit margins specifically in data since 1947 reductions in nonfinancial corporate tax rates have been accompanied by similar reductions in nonfinancial pre tax profits so that after tax profit margins have increased by far less than one might have expected as a result of those tax cuts on the subject of errors it s one thing to err because something happens that violates all evidence from history but it s another to repeatedly make the same mistake as a result of ignoring history altogether it seems to me that ignoring extreme valuations and pricing stocks based on earnings projections that have no link to the way earnings have behaved across history is an error of the second type i regularly admit my own error in the recent advancing half cycle particularly because i hope it can be instructive despite anticipating the 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 collapses and admirably navigating decades of complete market cycles prior to 2009 i made a very specific error in the recent half cycle that was detrimental the error was my bearish response to severe overvalued overbought overbullish syndromes that had regularly been followed by air pockets panics and crashes in market cycles across history but failed to place any limit on speculation in the face of zero interest rate policies in late 2017 i finally threw up my hands and abandoned the idea that we could rely on anyhistorically defined limit to speculative recklessness instead i resolved that whenever our measures of market internals are uniformly favorable which we use to gauge speculative pressures because speculators tend to be indiscriminate we would rule out adopting or amplifying any bearish outlook in the future no exceptions period sufficiently extreme conditions can push us to a flat neutral outlook but never to a bearish one unless ragged and divergent internals indicate that investor psychology has shifted from speculation to risk aversion the role of history and evidence is to provide us with something we can learn and apply in the future there s no question that the world can change in ways that violate past experience and offer new learning but my sense is that the best kind of learning is coherent you take the new evidence to shift your understanding in a way that makes it consistent with the entirety of experience again you don t just abandon everything you know and shrug well it s a brand new world for our part prioritizing market internals is sufficient to make things coherent again the fact is that the entire total return of the s p 500 from the 2007 peak to today occurred during periods where our measures of market internals were favorable while nearly all of the 2007 2009 collapse as well as the recent market weakness occurred when they were not on the competition between stocks and bonds another danger for investors here is the willingness to accept offensively speculative valuations on the argument that bond yields are low the empirical fact is that bond yields are tightly correlated with nominal gdp growth but as one can demonstrate using any discounted cash flow model if interest rates are low because growth rates are also low no valuation premium is justified by the low interest rates at all long term returns will already be lower commensurate with the lower interest rates by virtue of the lower growth rate itself a valuation premium then just adds insult to injury to the extent that prospective returns on stocks are dismal yet the yields on bonds barely provide a term premium over and above treasury bills the appropriate response is not to argue in favor of stocks but instead to argue in favor of cash and alternatives like hedged equity particularly while market internals remain ragged and divergent even when analysts recognize that rich market valuations will likely be associated with poor long term returns for stocks the observation is often coupled with a phrase like but these expected stock market returns remain competitive with bonds two responses to that first no given the choice between stocks and treasury bonds even with their presently depressed yields we would still expect higher returns and smaller downside risks from bonds second to the extent that prospective returns on stocks are dismal yet the yields on bonds barely provide a term premium over and above treasury bills the appropriate response is not to argue in favor of stocks but instead to argue in favor of cash and alternatives like hedged equity particularly while market internals remain ragged and divergent there are points in every market cycle when a material retreat in valuations is joined by an improvement in measures of market action and internals it s at that point that one should make a vigorous case for stock market exposure doing so just 10 below the steepest valuation extreme in history in a market where investors remain inclined toward risk aversion which we read from the behavior of internals is a measure of both 1 impatience with the market cycle and 2 a misguided sense of entitlement with respect to market gains that occurred as a result of speculative pressures that are no longer present the new economy while some analysts have argued that the current batch of glamour technology companies has boosted profit margins permanently they seem wholly unware of the regularity with which this argument has been made across history the argument is recurrently applied to a rotating group of companies that invariably become associated with the new economy as opposed to the defunct old economy upon which traditional valuation measures have been defined here s the problem as any new technology advances from a small base new product adoption by consumers can create astoundingly high growth rates and profit margins but as market share approaches saturation these logistic growth curves begin to plateau and growth predictably slows toward zero we observed exactly the same profile from the leading companies that dominated the 2000 market peak as i observed back in august 2000 and as is likely to unfold in rather the same way this time one of the hard lessons that investors will learn in the coming quarters is that technology stocks are actually cyclicals modest changes in economic growth and overall corporate profitability have a highly leveraged impact on the revenue growth and profitability of technology companies though economic growth is likely to slow only modestly we are anticipating a plunge of 20 or more in the earnings of s p 500 technology stocks in the coming quarters on recession risk the next question then is whether the u s is nearing an economic recession on that subject we re probably a bit less committal than one might imagine because we re still monitoring a few components of our recession warning composite specifically we d be inclined to wait until we observe a decline in the ism purchasing managers index below 50 coupled with an uptick to an unemployment rate of anything above 4 and a slowdown in year over year job growth to 1 4 from the current 1 8 with regard to confirming measures we d also pay close attention to the consumer confidence spread as the future expectations index has been falling much more sharply than the present situation index this behavior typically precedes recessions once the present situation index of consumer confidence drops by more than about 20 points below its 12 month average a recession has typically started a decline in aggregate hours worked compared with 3 4 months earlier is also a useful confirmation while i was one of the few observers that correctly anticipated the recessions that accompanied the 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 market collapses my reliance on data that was subsequently revised produced false signals earlier in this recovery so i m inclined to be a bit conservative about identifying recession risk here moreover given that valuations and market action already encourage a defensive market outlook there s really nothing to gain from a recession signal since it wouldn t really alter our investment stance still though we re inclined to wait for more data and to look for greater deterioration before identifying a recession it s important to remember how quickly the data can shift the amount of time between the peak in economic confidence and the beginning of a recession is usually very short in general a uniform deterioration in financial employment and economic confidence measures even compared with 6 months earlier strongly amplifies the risk of a recession and there s not much lead time at all put simply we want to have a reliable set of confirming evidence but it s also important to remember how quickly that evidence can emerge questions we hear a lot given the volatility of the financial markets in recent months my sense is that the best comments to offer are those that relate to these questions bull market or bear market my impression is that the recent bull market peaked on september 20 2018 which is also when we observed the largest preponderance of historically useful top signals we ve ever seen as i noted at the time the only other point that came close was march 24 2000 the date of the 2000 bubble peak still the primary usefulness of a bull bear label is to emphasize the potential for steep market losses over the completion of the cycle as long as one recognizes that risk there s no need for labels it s probably better to recognize that the market remains hypervalued and that market internals remain unfavorable if internals improve at high valuations our outlook is likely to shift to something that might be described as constructive with a safety net if they improve at substantially lower valuations we re likely to move to an unhedged or aggressive stance for now there s so much downside risk that we d view an improvement in internals as a bear market rally but whatever one might call it we d likely be constructive with a safety net even that i suspect is likely to emerge from lower levels buy stocks or buy bonds my impression is that neither provides much prospect for meaningful returns and 10 off the most obscene valuations in u s history isn t what i d call a bargain with the yield curve as flat as we currently observe the main reason to own bonds is based on the likelihood of a decline in yields in the event of economic weakness there s some potential for that but i d lean toward a mix of treasury bills modest bond market durations high credit quality and hedged equity our estimated return risk profile for precious metals shares is also fairly strong here but given the volatility of those shares i d characterize that as a constructive situation rather than an aggressive one none of these is without risk recession or continued expansion we re seeing a good deal of weakness in our leading measures and a lot of the regional purchasing managers indices and fed surveys are deteriorating as well but we don t have a sufficient basis for an outright recession warning this expansion is very long in the tooth unemployment is quite low and the underlying structural growth factors are dismal so my sense is we re far closer to a recession than to 4 real gdp growth as far as the eye can see given the other factors already in place be particularly watchful for an ism purchasing managers index below 50 a move above 4 in unemployment and a slowdown in employment growth below about 1 4 year over year a decline in aggregate hours worked versus 3 months earlier along with a steep drop in consumer confidence particularly about 20 points below its 12 month average would all be strong confirming evidence of an economic downturn more rate hikes or a new round of qe on december 19 fed chair jerome powell observed we ve reached the bottom end of the range of what the committee believes might be neutral i think that is exactly right as i observed in the december comment the combination of low structural economic growth and modest inflation pressure is fairly consistent with the current level of short term interest rates long term rates would normally be higher in the context of current data but given the deterioration in leading economic measures remember payroll employment and the unemployment rate are two of the most lagging economic measures available there s little compelling upward pressure don t take hope in fed intervention to support the market other than knee jerk reactions first remember that the fed eased persistently throughout the 2000 2002 and 2007 2009 collapses with no effect when investors are inclined toward risk aversion safe liquidity is a desirable asset not an inferior one my view is that it s essential to monitor market internals directly we don t disclose the details of our own measures but i ve discussed uniformity divergence breadth leadership price volume sponsorship credit spreads and other factors often enough that the central concept should be clear when investors are inclined toward speculation they tend to be indiscriminate about it we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us if and when internals improve virtually anything the fed does will likely be associated with market gains if internals continue to indicate risk aversion among investors then those knee jerk clearing rallies would best be used as opportunities to sell marginal stock holdings and tighten up hedges my impression is that jerome powell is highly aware of how loose the cause and effect links are between monetary policy and the real economy but apart from noting that the fed s workhorse economic model estimates only a 0 2 change in the unemployment rate after 3 years in response to each 500 billion in asset purchases there s nothing in his past speeches that indicates an intellectual opposition to qe it s not at all clear that the fed recognizes its role in creating repeated cycles of bubble and collapse so we have to allow for another round of qe in response to the next recession again the appropriate response on our part will be to align ourselves with market internals a favorable shift would likely encourage a constructive or aggressive investment outlook particularly if valuations have retreated substantially at that point inflation or deflation one of the key features of the recent speculative episode has been yield seeking speculation by investors starved for safe yields in response wall street and corporate america provided more product in the form of low grade covenant lite debt indeed the median rating on u s corporate debt now stands just one notch above junk in an economic decline one should expect a disruptive wave of defaults with far lower recovery rates than in previous economic cycles now defaults tend to be deflationary so what you tend to see is an upward spike in the yields on junk bonds and corporate debt but a downward trend in the yields of securities viewed as being without credit risk which has historically included treasury securities the question is what happens when we begin to run trillion dollar deficits in the event of a deflationary economic decline even one where defaults are higher as a result of all the yield seeking and low grade debt issuance of recent years another round of qe seems likely our response to that prospect is simple we ll take our cue from market internals particularly given that the entire net total return of the s p 500 since 2007 occurred when our measures of internals have been favorable and most of the 2007 2009 collapse occurred when they were not as i ve regularly noted our problem during the recent half cycle had nothing to do with valuations or market internals but with our bearish response to overvalued overbought overbullish syndromes meanwhile it s also important to allow for an inflationary economic decline which would result from a public loss of faith in the ability of the government to run a stable debt gdp relationship in that event all bets on qe are off and the country will just face a difficult situation as it has periodically faced before the best indicator of inflation is inflation it s difficult to forecast inflation with macroeconomic variables because large shifts in inflation are typically linked to discrete events that provoke a loss of confidence in price stability itself like the trifecta of great society deficits nixon closing the gold window and an oil embargo or the combination of money printing and a supply shock like using deficit finance to pay striking workers in the ruhr not surprisingly we ll infer that shift in confidence from uniformity in the behavior of inflation sensitive asset prices there s no economic factor that predicts the rate of inflation better than the rate of inflation itself and related uniformity in the behavior of inflation sensitive securities including precious metals exchange rates bond prices commodities tips and related securities just like a shift in market internals it may be difficult to predict but it s fairly easy to align yourself with it i know that many observers are quietly repeating milton friedman s phrase that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon the problem is you won t reliably see that in the data as a former economics professor i get it the quiet job of the economics profession is to indoctrinate teenagers with purely theoretical models by showing them line drawings nobody ever asks them to spend time staring at actual numbers so they become adults and sometimes even fed governors who take theoretical diagrams as reality for example the notion that the phillips curve is a relationship between unemployment and general price inflation when there s utterly no evidence for it in fact as i ve regularly argued when you actually look at a w phillips data a century of british unemployment and wage data during a period of stable general prices under the gold standard the phillips curve is actually a relationship between unemployment and real wage inflation of course money creation and general price inflation are undoubtedly linked when money creation hits the pace of the weimar republic or zimbabwe but for the u s there s no economic factor that predicts the rate of inflation better than the rate of inflation itself and related uniformity in the behavior of inflation sensitive securities including precious metals exchange rates bond prices commodities tips and related securities just like a shift in market internals it may be difficult to predict but it s fairly easy to align yourself with it finally i ve been asked why my january comment didn t come out earlier in the month it s because this last section is important to me in honor and remembrance of dr martin luther king jr dr king noted that he tried to speak on the subject below at least once a year preserving that tradition has always seemed an appropriate way to honor him if you ve never read dr king s writings this talk is a good place to start i don t think it s possible to read his words without coming away better for it loving your enemies november 17 1957 i want to use as a subject from which to preach this morning a very familiar subject and it is familiar to you because i have preached from this subject twice before to my knowing in this pulpit i try to make it a something of a custom or tradition to preach from this passage of scripture at least once a year adding new insights that i develop along the way out of new experiences as i give these messages although the content is the basic content is the same new insights and new experiences naturally make for new illustrations so i want to turn your attention to this subject loving your enemies it s so basic to me because it is a part of my basic philosophical and theological orientation the whole idea of love the whole philosophy of love in the fifth chapter of the gospel as recorded by saint matthew we read these very arresting words flowing from the lips of our lord and master ye have heard that it has been said thou shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them that despitefully use you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven over the centuries many persons have argued that this is an extremely difficult command many would go so far as to say that it just isn t possible to move out into the actual practice of this glorious command but far from being an impractical idealist jesus has become the practical realist the words of this text glitter in our eyes with a new urgency far from being the pious injunction of a utopian dreamer this command is an absolute necessity for the survival of our civilization yes it is love that will save our world and our civilization love even for enemies now let me hasten to say that jesus was very serious when he gave this command he wasn t playing he realized that it s hard to love your enemies he realized that it s difficult to love those persons who seek to defeat you those persons who say evil things about you he realized that it was painfully hard pressingly hard but he wasn t playing we have the christian and moral responsibility to seek to discover the meaning of these words and to discover how we can live out this command and why we should live by this command so this morning as i look into your eyes and into the eyes of all of my brothers in alabama and all over america and over the world i say to you i love you i would rather die than hate you and i m foolish enough to believe that through the power of this love somewhere men of the most recalcitrant bent will be transformed reverend dr martin luther king jr now first let us deal with this question which is the practical question how do you go about loving your enemies i think the first thing is this in order to love your enemies you must begin by analyzing self and i m sure that seems strange to you that i start out telling you this morning that you love your enemies by beginning with a look at self it seems to me that that is the first and foremost way to come to an adequate discovery to the how of this situation now i m aware of the fact that some people will not like you not because of something you have done to them but they just won t like you but after looking at these things and admitting these things we must face the fact that an individual might dislike us because of something that we ve done deep down in the past some personality attribute that we possess something that we ve done deep down in the past and we ve forgotten about it but it was that something that aroused the hate response within the individual that is why i say begin with yourself there might be something within you that arouses the tragic hate response in the other individual this is true in our international struggle democracy is the greatest form of government to my mind that man has ever conceived but the weakness is that we have never touched it we must face the fact that the rhythmic beat of the deep rumblings of discontent from asia and africa is at bottom a revolt against the imperialism and colonialism perpetuated by western civilization all these many years and this is what jesus means when he said how is it that you can see the mote in your brother s eye and not see the beam in your own eye and this is one of the tragedies of human nature so we begin to love our enemies and love those persons that hate us whether in collective life or individual life by looking at ourselves a second thing that an individual must do in seeking to love his enemy is to discover the element of good in his enemy and every time you begin to hate that person and think of hating that person realize that there is some good there and look at those good points which will over balance the bad points somehow the isness of our present nature is out of harmony with the eternal oughtness that forever confronts us and this simply means this that within the best of us there is some evil and within the worst of us there is some good when we come to see this we take a different attitude toward individuals the person who hates you most has some good in him even the nation that hates you most has some good in it even the race that hates you most has some good in it and when you come to the point that you look in the face of every man and see deep down within him what religion calls the image of god you begin to love him in spite of no matter what he does you see god s image there there is an element of goodness that he can never slough off discover the element of good in your enemy and as you seek to hate him find the center of goodness and place your attention there and you will take a new attitude another way that you love your enemy is this when the opportunity presents itself for you to defeat your enemy that is the time which you must not do it there will come a time in many instances when the person who hates you most the person who has misused you most the person who has gossiped about you most the person who has spread false rumors about you most there will come a time when you will have an opportunity to defeat that person it might be in terms of a recommendation for a job it might be in terms of helping that person to make some move in life that s the time you must do it that is the meaning of love in the final analysis love is not this sentimental something that we talk about it s not merely an emotional something love is creative understanding goodwill for all men it is the refusal to defeat any individual when you rise to the level of love of its great beauty and power you seek only to defeat evil systems individuals who happen to be caught up in that system you love but you seek to defeat the system within the best of us there is some evil and within the worst of us there is some good the person who hates you most has some good in him even the nation that hates you most has some good in it even the race that hates you most has some good in it no matter what he does you see god s image there there is an element of goodness that he can never slough off the greek language as i ve said so often before is very powerful at this point it comes to our aid beautifully in giving us the real meaning and depth of the whole philosophy of love and i think it is quite apropos at this point for you see the greek language has three words for love interestingly enough it talks about love as eros that s one word for love eros is a sort of aesthetic love plato talks about it a great deal in his dialogues a sort of yearning of the soul for the realm of the gods and it s come to us to be a sort of romantic love though it s a beautiful love everybody has experienced eros in all of its beauty when you find some individual that is attractive to you and that you pour out all of your like and your love on that individual that is eros you see and it s a powerful beautiful love that is given to us through all of the beauty of literature we read about it then the greek language talks about philia and that s another type of love that s also beautiful it is a sort of intimate affection between personal friends and this is the type of love that you have for those persons that you re friendly with your intimate friends or people that you call on the telephone and you go by to have dinner with and your roommate in college and that type of thing it s a sort of reciprocal love on this level you like a person because that person likes you you love on this level because you are loved you love on this level because there s something about the person you love that is likeable to you this too is a beautiful love you can communicate with a person you have certain things in common you like to do things together this is philia the greek language comes out with another word for love it is the word agape and agape is more than eros agape is more than philia agape is something of the understanding creative redemptive goodwill for all men it is a love that seeks nothing in return it is an overflowing love it s what theologians would call the love of god working in the lives of men and when you rise to love on this level you begin to love men not because they are likeable but because god loves them you look at every man and you love him because you know god loves him and he might be the worst person you ve ever seen and this is what jesus means i think in this very passage when he says love your enemy and it s significant that he does not say like your enemy like is a sentimental something an affectionate something there are a lot of people that i find it difficult to like i don t like what they do to me i don t like what they say about me and other people i don t like their attitudes i don t like some of the things they re doing i don t like them but jesus says love them and love is greater than like love is understanding redemptive goodwill for all men so that you love everybody because god loves them you refuse to do anything that will defeat an individual because you have agape in your soul and here you come to the point that you love the individual who does the evil deed while hating the deed that the person does this is what jesus means when he says love your enemy this is the way to do it when the opportunity presents itself when you can defeat your enemy you must not do it now for the few moments left let us move from the practical how to the theoretical why it s not only necessary to know how to go about loving your enemies but also to go down into the question of why we should love our enemies i think the first reason that we should love our enemies and i think this was at the very center of jesus thinking is this that hate for hate only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe if i hit you and you hit me and i hit you back and you hit me back and go on you see that goes on ad infinitum it just never ends somewhere somebody must have a little sense and that s the strong person the strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate the chain of evil and that is the tragedy of hate that it doesn t cut it off it only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love i think i mentioned before that sometime ago my brother and i were driving one evening to chattanooga tennessee from atlanta he was driving the car and for some reason the drivers were very discourteous that night they didn t dim their lights hardly any driver that passed by dimmed his lights and i remember very vividly my brother a d looked over and in a tone of anger said i know what i m going to do the next car that comes along here and refuses to dim the lights i m going to fail to dim mine and pour them on in all of their power and i looked at him right quick and said oh no don t do that there d be too much light on this highway and it will end up in mutual destruction for all somebody got to have some sense on this highway somebody must have sense enough to dim the lights and that is the trouble isn t it that as all of the civilizations of the world move up the highway of history so many civilizations having looked at other civilizations that refused to dim the lights and they decided to refuse to dim theirs and toynbee tells that out of the twenty two civilizations that have risen up all but about seven have found themselves in the junk heap of destruction it is because civilizations fail to have sense enough to dim the lights and if somebody doesn t have sense enough to turn on the dim and beautiful and powerful lights of love in this world the whole of our civilization will be plunged into the abyss of destruction and we will all end up destroyed because nobody had any sense on the highway of history the strong person is the person who can cut off the chain of hate the chain of evil and that is the tragedy of hate that it doesn t cut it off it only intensifies the existence of hate and evil in the universe somebody must have religion enough and morality enough to cut it off and inject within the very structure of the universe that strong and powerful element of love somewhere somebody must have some sense men must see that force begets force hate begets hate toughness begets toughness and it is all a descending spiral ultimately ending in destruction for all and everybody somebody must have sense enough and morality enough to cut off the chain of hate and the chain of evil in the universe and you do that by love there s another reason why you should love your enemies and that is because hate distorts the personality of the hater we usually think of what hate does for the individual hated or the individuals hated or the groups hated but it is even more tragic it is even more ruinous and injurious to the individual who hates you just begin hating somebody and you will begin to do irrational things you can t see straight when you hate you can t walk straight when you hate you can t stand upright your vision is distorted there is nothing more tragic than to see an individual whose heart is filled with hate he comes to the point that he becomes a pathological case for the person who hates you can stand up and see a person and that person can be beautiful and you will call them ugly for the person who hates the beautiful becomes ugly and the ugly becomes beautiful for the person who hates the good becomes bad and the bad becomes good for the person who hates the true becomes false and the false becomes true that s what hate does you can t see right the symbol of objectivity is lost hate destroys the very structure of the personality of the hater the way to be integrated with yourself is be sure that you meet every situation of life with an abounding love never hate because it ends up in tragic neurotic responses psychologists and psychiatrists are telling us today that the more we hate the more we develop guilt feelings and we begin to subconsciously repress or consciously suppress certain emotions and they all stack up in our subconscious selves and make for tragic neurotic responses and may this not be the neuroses of many individuals as they confront life that that is an element of hate there and modern psychology is calling on us now to love but long before modern psychology came into being the world s greatest psychologist who walked around the hills of galilee told us to love he looked at men and said love your enemies don t hate anybody it s not enough to love your friends because when you start hating anybody it destroys the very center of your creative response to life and the universe so love everybody hate at any point is a cancer that gnaws away at the very vital center of your life and your existence it is like eroding acid that eats away the best and the objective center of your life so jesus says love because hate destroys the hater as well as the hated now there is a final reason i think that jesus says love your enemies it is this that love has within it a redemptive power and there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals that s why jesus says love your enemies because if you hate your enemies you have no way to redeem and to transform your enemies but if you love your enemies you will discover that at the very root of love is the power of redemption you just keep loving people and keep loving them even though they re mistreating you here s the person who is a neighbor and this person is doing something wrong to you and all of that just keep being friendly to that person keep loving them don t do anything to embarrass them just keep loving them and they can t stand it too long oh they react in many ways in the beginning they react with bitterness because they re mad because you love them like that they react with guilt feelings and sometimes they ll hate you a little more at that transition period but just keep loving them and by the power of your love they will break down under the load that s love you see it is redemptive and this is why jesus says love there s something about love that builds up and is creative there is something about hate that tears down and is destructive so love your enemies there is a power in love that our world has not discovered yet jesus discovered it centuries ago mahatma gandhi of india discovered it a few years ago but most men and most women never discover it for they believe in hitting for hitting they believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth they believe in hating for hating but jesus comes to us and says this isn t the way as we look out across the years and across the generations let us develop and move right here we must discover the power of love the power the redemptive power of love and when we discover that we will be able to make of this old world a new world we will be able to make men better love is the only way jesus discovered that and our civilization must discover that individuals must discover that as they deal with other individuals there is a little tree planted on a little hill and on that tree hangs the most influential character that ever came in this world but never feel that that tree is a meaningless drama that took place on the stages of history oh no it is a telescope through which we look out into the long vista of eternity and see the love of god breaking forth into time it is an eternal reminder to a power drunk generation that love is the only way it is an eternal reminder to a generation depending on nuclear and atomic energy a generation depending on physical violence that love is the only creative redemptive transforming power in the universe so this morning as i look into your eyes and into the eyes of all of my brothers in alabama and all over america and over the world i say to you i love you i would rather die than hate you and i m foolish enough to believe that through the power of this love somewhere men of the most recalcitrant bent will be transformed and then we will be in god s kingdom

dubai additional signs of biting us sanctions on the iranian economy will start to appear this year economists and researchers have said tens of thousands of jobs are expected to be lost and all economic sectors that are engaged with foreign investments including the automobile industry will bear the brunt of the american sanctions which went into effect late last year they explained we don t have obviously 100 per cent accurate statistics as the sanctions were imposed last november but a lot of anecdotal and indicative reports suggest there are going to be significant job losses in a number of industries particularly the automobiles sector said sanam vakil senior consulting research fellow in the middle east and north africa programme at london based think tank chatham house job losses would be across several sectors vakil said in an interview with gulf news i would imagine that those sectors would be heavily engaged with international companies relying on international relations and investments such as the automobiles industry which is a very important sector for domestic employment as well but i would also say the services sector is also going to suffer as well as the consumer sector according to the statistical centre of iran which is the official iranian body authorised to collect data and implement surveys and censuses the unemployment rate reached 12 10 per cent in march 2018 up from 11 9 per cent in december 2017 12 1 iran s jobless rate in march 2018 up from 11 9 in december 2017 it is estimated that the combined percentage rates of unemployment and underemployment in many non industrialised countries is 30 per cent in the developed countries those rates range between 4 per cent and 12 per cent iran s services sector is the largest employer representing 50 4 per cent of the total employment in the country followed by the manufacturing sector 32 per cent and agriculture 17 6 per cent according to the iranian centre 50 4 share of employment in iran in the country s services sector iran s population stood at 81 10 million people in march 2018 according to official statistics due to population growth some estimates put the number of people who enter the country s job market every year at nearly one million people economists cautioned that the rate of job creation is well below the level of people who are joining the labour force the absolute number of people who are unemployed is growing every year and one of the ways of dealing with that is to attract large scale foreign investments to create jobs now that won t happen and indeed that level of investing is dropping as european companies are withdrawing out of the country so yes we will see unemployment rise for sure said nicholas fitzroy risk briefing director and middle east analyst at the economist intelligence unit in an interview with gulf news fitzroy said it is too early to have data on the impact of the us sanctions on iran however oil exports constitute the key figure that can be trusted at the moment that has impact on economic growth in a country that has inflation estimated at 40 per cent the absolute number of people who are unemployed is growing every year and one of the ways of dealing with that is to attract large scale foreign investments to create jobs now that won t happen nicholas fitzroy risk briefing director and middle east analyst at the economist intelligence unit i don t think the economy will collapse i just think what we will see in the next year or two the economy contracting relatively sharply a relatively deeper recession fitzroy said i think in the next year or two we will have 3 or 4 per cent contraction and maybe more then it will start to resettle with some foreign investors from china or india working out ways to circumvent the us sanctions he said the economy will resettle but only after a deep recession he added other economists said that the international monetary fund imf has already predicted that the iranian economy will contract 1 5 per cent in 2018 and 3 6 per cent in 2019 said lukman otunuga analyst at fxtn a global foreign exchange broker he told gulf news that a weaker iranian currency is among the main concerns which is a main factor for inflation although uncertainty over the macroeconomic landscape sent the iranian rial tumbling sharply in 2018 the local currency witnessed stability at the end of 2018 after the central bank of iran intervened however a weakening iranian rial accelerated inflationary pressures with consumer prices jumping to 39 9 per cent in november oil rich iran has been under a series of economic sanctions since 1979 the country has been under two rounds of sanctions in the past 12 years the first was in 2006 and the second in late 2018 last time all the countries were against iran all governments and private companies couldn t do business this time the private sector is choosing not to do business vakil said in reference to the fear among different economic circles of the american threats of imposing sanctions on companies dealing with iran all the multinational companies have made the decision that the american economy is much more important for their business than the iranian economy she said sanctions in 2006 the un security council imposed international economic sanctions on iran in a unanimously adopted resolution 1737 for failure to halt its uranium enrichment programme they were lifted on january 2016 after a nuclear deal was reached between tehran and the five members of the security council members plus germany however us president donald trump withdrew from the agreement in may 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on iran that came went into effect last november 2018 to force iran to change its regional policies which include supporting militia groups and the development of ballistic missiles currently iran is taking the position of wait and see for the outcome of the 2020 presidential elections said sanam vakil a research fellow at chatham house i think they are very much looking at the forthcoming us elections of 2020 as a parameter for their ability to survive during this period she said last time all the countries were against iran all governments and private companies couldn t do business this time the private sector is choosing not to do business sanam vakil senior consulting research fellow in the middle east and north africa programme at chatham house oil after the american sanctions came into effect iran s oil exports dropped from 2 4 million barrel a day to nearly 1 4 million barrel a day at present the almost 50 per cent drop would have a massive impact on the iranian economy said nicholas fitzroy of the economist intelligence unit the us when it imposed its economic sanctions on iran gave a temporary waiver to eight customers to keep buying crude from the islamic republic china india japan south korea italy greece taiwan and turkey however

the perspective atlanta georgia january 19 2019 liberian lawmakers the national investment commission nic has announced the liberian government and the hummingbird resources inc have signed a gold mineral development concession worth over us 250 million the gold mineral development agreement between the government of liberia and the hummingbird resources inc was negotiated and signed but very little was known about the contents of these negotiations and actual terms of the agreements due to opaque processes and reasons of confidentiality often invoked in relation to the contracts there is no doubt why it like almost all agreements of this kind of was kept secret from the liberian people the hummingbird resources inc agreement awarded exploration licenses for all minerals covering over 7 000 square kilometers located within a significant proportion of eastern liberia sinoe grand kru river gee and maryland counties further according to reports the company is expected to mine about 14 trillion ounces of gold over the 25 yr life span of the project the world bank affiliate international finance corporation ifc is said to have invested us 8m in the project it is remarkably disadvantageous to the country of liberia and its people liberian negotiators failed to understand that mineral development is a long term investment and contracts must establish how rents will be divided between governments and companies as well as how costs and risks will be shared hummingbird will pay a signature fee of us 3 million to the government of liberia with us 1 5 million to be paid within 15 days of the effective date and thereafter us 1 5 million to obtain the license a royalty of 3 is given to the government of liberia on gold revenues additionally the agreement allows 10 percent shares for liberians how could liberians negotiators give away so much to the hummingbird resources inc why the national legislature failed to critically analyze the hummingbird mineral development agreement but recommended the ratification of the mineral agreement the environmental protection agency epa despite the agency role in the formulation of the mining sector policy was left out of the negotiation process of hummingbird resources inc why why critical issue such as environmental management was not discussed and that certain environmental experts were not allowed to speak on the issue of extraction processing and transporting of minerals and it impacts on the environment as well as on the potential health and safety of those working in the industry during the process leading to signing of the hummingbird mineral development agreement didn t president weah veto the act to ratify the mineral development agreement mda between the government of liberia and hummingbird resources liberia incorporated for several reasons according to the president the special presidential concessions review committee overall conclusion was the agreement didn t meet a fair business arrangement and few critical aspects needed reconsideration in order to bring a protracted benefit with mutual balance for each of the comparing parties did the liberian negotiators know the combined income statement of hummingbird resources inc did not show any revenue but reported losses did our negotiators know that in mali three people were killed and many others injured in may of 2018 at the komana west deposit owned by hummingbird also did our negotiators know hummingbird decided to provide a 2 million convertible loan to the u s zinc mining company bunker hill otc bhll and many investors of hummingbird resources inc didn t like the brunker hill deal as the company was turning away from gold or mineral exploration did our negotiator know that the company managed to secure additional funding from its lenders due to loses did we award gold minefield covering 7 000 square kilometers to a company that has zero revenue and has accumulated over the 24m net operating loss from 2008 through 2016 because of the world bank which invested us 8m into the company and is also liberia s lender and economic adviser hummingbird resources inc is not naïve and it knows for sure that they will find good quantities of high quality minerals in sinoe grand kru river gee and maryland counties they are going to reap so much and give liberia so little considering the 10 royalties stipulated in this agreement liberia stands to get ten cents for every dollar earned 10 for every 100 earned and so forth a royalty of 3 may sound a lot but i am afraid it is peanut for a post conflict country that is so desperately needed for roads schools hospitals etc another concern of mine pertaining to estimated us 250million agreement is there is a known fact that deposits of iron ore gold and diamonds are in liberia however and there is considerable potential for additional discoveries a wide range of other mineral resources are present and minerals with known potentially economic targets in liberia these include barite bauxite manganese heavy mineral sands kyanite phosphate kaolin rich clay silica sand copper lead nickel tin tungsten zinc and range of technology metals such as niobium tantalum zirconium and rare earth elements what happens when hummingbird resources inc discover other mineral resources she would reap the amount of the increase which would equal almost millions or billions of dollars per year when mining resume in liberia these types of contracts normally have a windfall tax to cover this eventuality unfortunately those that negotiated the agreement were unaware of this possibility due to the lack of in depth inquisition or should i say greed the present regime under president weah leadership like its predecessor madam sirleaf failed to recognize that if we do not reinvest in liberia resources wealth into productive investments above ground liberia is actually becoming poorer our leader including the member of the national legislature continues to use their access to financial resources from extractive industries to advance their own personal agendas instead of using them in the best interest of the nation as a whole natural resources are a public resource and the negotiations between liberia and foreign companies should be transparent accessible and easily understandable by citizens unfortunately this is not the case in liberia communities are not given the opportunity to review contracts and find out how much revenue has been generated and what development projects the revenues have been spent on sadly the new pro poor government had re introduced the failed policies of plantation economy which afford investors to loot liberia s resources while the political elites ripped the benefits at the expense of ordinary liberians it is time that president weah insists on the imposition of a windfall profit tax on these long term concession agreements all over the world countries have been renegotiating or imposing a windfall profit tax if renegotiation is impossible according to former world bank chief economist and a nobel laureate in economics and university professor at columbia university joseph e stiglitz natural resource foreign companies will push back emphasizing the sanctity of contracts and threaten to leave but the outcome is typically otherwise a fair renegotiation can be the basis of a better long term relationship i tend to agree with professor stiglitz argument and botswana is a prime example botswana s renegotiations of such contracts laid the foundations of its remarkable growth for the last four decades which led to an immense reduction of poverty moreover it is not only developing countries such as ghana botswana bolivia and venezuela that renegotiate bad contracts developed countries such as israel and australia have done so as well even the united states has imposed a windfall profits tax south africa home to the greatest mineral wealth in the world estimated to be worth 2 5 trillion is considering imposing a swinging 50 windfall tax on mining super profits and a 50 capital gains tax on the sale of prospecting rights those are among the proposals put forward by an independent panel of experts set up by the ruling african national congress anc to study the possibility of greater state intervention in the mining sector ghana africa s second biggest gold producer recently announced a review and possible renegotiation of all mining contracts to ensure that mining profits are maximized the good of the country it plans to raise taxes on mining companies from 25 to 35 and a windfall tax of 10 on super profits in addition to existing royalties on output metal to 6 guinea home to the world s largest bauxite reserves as well as one of the world s biggest iron ore deposits is helping itself to a 15 stake in all mining projects and an option to buy a further 20 in guinea mining companies are legally obliged to pay a tax to the owners of the land on which they mine they are also required to support local development projects namibia has decided to transfer all new mining and exploration to a state owned company algeria has become the latest african country to consider slapping windfall profit taxes on foreign oil companies according to report algerian government says the tax will be applied in months when the price of brent crude averages above 30 a barrel and will vary from 5 to 50 depending on the company s total production as we speak brent crude oil is averaging 107 per barrel the same can be said of ivory coast s government which recently adopted a 19 tax on gold profits seeking to capitalize on current high gold prices to help fund reconstruction following a decade long political crisis the new 19 windfall tax would yield some 40 billion cfa francs 79 1 million in additional income to the state annually zambia for example had hoped to impose windfall profit taxes on copper mining to finance an infrastructure fund poor management of our natural resources results to no economic growth and no growth no pro poor agenda it is that simple mineral exploration is exhaustible unless we use it prudently now when commodity prices are good we ll regret later and so while the going is promising we must make sufficient revenue from it and we can diversify to other areas in our economy liberians are sitting on huge natural resources and we ought to find a way of rewarding ourselves something from that ownership it is up to liberians to know what it is entitled to and claim it accordingly if they don t they will have nobody to blame information and economic methodologies exist which liberia can use for bargaining if ghana ivory coast guinea algeria and other african countries can do it i am sure liberia can do it as well it s time we get the right remittances from our natural resources therefore it is no longer wise to allow investors to invade liberia and let them exploit its resources at will we must do something about the exploitation of our natural resources by the selected few at the expense of the majority poverty in liberia cannot possibly be eliminated unless the poor themselves say we insist on justice with regard to the equal distribution of wealth not charity one example of that justice is to end privatization of natural resources or obtain the right remittances from our natural resources shine your eyes my people hummingbird financial statements from the years 2011 2013 2015 2016 hummingbird 2 million convertible loan to u s zinc mining company

santa barbara with equities slumping exchange rate volatility increasing and political risks intensifying financial markets around the world have hit a rough patch during times like these international investors generally grow cautious and prioritise safety over returns so money flees to safe havens that can provide secure liquid investment grade assets on a sufficiently large scale but there are no obvious safe havens today for the first time in living memory investors lack a quiet port where they can find shelter from the storm historically the safe haven par excellence was the united states in the form of treasury bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the us government as one investment strategist put it back in 2012 when people are worried all road lead to treasuries the bursting of the us real estate bubble in 2007 offers a case in point no one doubted that the us was the epicentre of the global financial crisis but rather than flee the us capital actually flooded into it in the last three months of 2008 net purchases of us assets reached 500 billion three times more than that of the preceding nine months combined to be sure some of these dollar claims were due to the fact that foreign banks and institutional investors needed greenbacks to cover their funding needs after interbank and other wholesale short term markets seized up but that was hardly the only reason why portfolio managers piled into the us much of the increased demand was due to sheer fear at a time when nobody knew how bad things might get the us was widely seen as the safest bet but this was before the arrival of us president donald trump who has managed to undermine confidence in the dollar to an unprecedented degree in addition to abandoning any notion of fiscal responsibility trump has spent his first two years in office attacking international institutions and picking fights with us allies to be sure even before trump confidence in the dollar suffered a blow in 2011 when standard poor s downgraded treasury securities by one notch in response to a near shutdown of the us government that episode was triggered by a standoff between then president barack obama and congressional republicans over a routine proposal to raise the federal debt ceiling today however investors have even more reason to worry about the us government s credit rating in 2018 alone the us government was shut down three times and it remains in a partial shutdown to this day owing to trump s demand for funds to build a big beautiful wall on the border with mexico where can investors go if not the us the eurozone might seem like a logical alternative after the dollar the euro is the world s most widely used currency and taken together the capital markets of the eurozone s 19 member states are close in size to the us market but europe has troubles of its own economic growth is slowing not least in germany and the risk of a banking crisis in italy the eurozone s fourth largest economy looms on the horizon worse still is the uncertainty over brexit which could prove highly disruptive if the united kingdom crashes out of the european union without a divorce agreement needless to say britain too can be ruled out as a safe haven at least until the brexit fiasco is resolved what about the swiss franc though its attractions are obvious switzerland s financial markets are simply too small to serve as an adequate substitute for the us that leaves japan with its abundant supply of government bonds it is the biggest single market for public debt outside the us the question for portfolio managers though is whether it is really safe to invest in a country where government debt exceeds 230 per cent of gdp for comparison the public debt to gdp ratio in the us is around 88 per cent and even in troubled italy it is no more than 130 per cent admittedly the market for japanese government debt is more stable than most owing to the fact that much of it is held by domestic savers which is to say it is safely tucked under the mattress but japan is an aging country with an economy that has remained almost stagnant for a quarter century investors would be right to wonder where it will find the resources to continue servicing its massive debt overhang and then there is china with the world s third largest national market for public debt certainly the supply of assets in china is ample but the chinese market is so tightly controlled that it is essentially the opposite of a safe haven it will be a long time before global investors even consider putting much faith in chinese securities with secure ports becoming scarce investors will become increasingly jittery they will be inclined to move funds at the slightest sign of danger which will add substantially to market volatility today s rough patch is probably here to stay benjamin j cohen is professor of international political economy at the university of california santa barbara

the trade dispute between the united states and china has weighed on the chinese economy the us is the world s most prosperous nation with the highest gdp and has been a significant addressable market for chinese exports the tariffs and retaliation over the past months have caused the loss of a substantial customer for china and their economic data and stock market have both reflected the consequences of protectionist policies china is the most populous nation in the world and asia s leading economic power china is also the world s leading consumer of raw materials as the country continues to build infrastructure and must feed its people australia is a nation that is resource rich and its position as a substantial producer of commodities and close geographical proximity to asia make the country a significant supplier of raw materials to china the international monetary fund lists australia as the world s fourteenth largest economy with a gdp of 1 428 trillion in 2018 the us economy by comparison stood at 20 513 trillion with china second at 13 457 trillion the current trade dispute has weighed on economic conditions in china and the australian economy has felt the impact of chinese economic weakness as the country is in many ways a supermarket for the asian nation the ishares msci australia etf nysearca ewa holds shares in many of australia s top companies the index declined since its most recent high in january 2018 which could be because of the trade issues between china and the united states a long position in ewa could be a bet on a resolution of the trade issues and a new framework for commerce between the us and chinese australia is a significant producer of commodities the climate and geography of australia and its small population density make the nation a substantial exporter of the products it produces australia produces iron ore the primary ingredient in steel gold wheat copper coal meats wool aluminum and a variety of fruits and vegetables the nation is an exporter of excellent wines to the world as a commodity producing nation the australian dollar has a high correlation with commodities prices source cqg as the monthly chart shows the australian currency against the us dollar hit respective peaks at 0 9770 in 2008 and 1 1005 in 2011 the years where commodities prices reached peaks when the raw material markets fell to their most recent bottoms in late 2015 and early 2016 the australian dollar versus us dollar relationship reached its nadir at 0 6809 in january 2016 the value of the a recovered reaching a high at 0 8135 in early 2018 but it moved back to below the 0 7000 level recently which was likely the result of weakness in the chinese economy the a has been in a bearish trend since early 2018 while the final quarter of 2018 was a tough time for equity markets and commodities such as crude oil the value of the australian dollar moved lower throughout the year source cqg as the weekly chart illustrates the a fell from a high at 0 8135 in january last year to a low at 0 6825 on the second trading day of 2019 a decline of 16 1 one of the primary issues for the australian economy and its currency has been the trade dispute between the us and china china has had an economic cold over the recent months and australia has come down with the flu china s economy weakens on protectionism china is australia s leading customer as it accounts for around 30 which is almost triple the percentage of its second largest trading partner japan therefore the slowdown in the chinese economy has had a significant impact on the australian economy source cqg the economic turndown in china has caused the domestic stock market to decline the ishares china large cap etf product fxi moved from 54 per share at the end of january 2018 to a low at 37 84 in early november a drop of 30 the fxi was at the 40 63 level on january 17 a lot closer to the low than the high from last year at this time the lower chinese stock market has been a leading reason for the drop in the value of the australian dollar against the us currency over the past year as chinese economic travails have led to lower demand for raw materials and falling commodities prices which are the bread and butter factors for economic growth in australia a trade deal with the us could ignite china and australia in december amidst an environment of increasing tariffs and retaliatory measures between the us and china the leaders of the two nations met at the g 20 meeting in buenos aires argentina to discuss how to prevent the protectionist environment from spiraling into an all out trade war presidents trump and xi agreed to a 90 day moratorium on any new protectionist measures so that their trade negotiators could work towards a new framework the meeting in argentina injected optimism in the markets that a trade deal would ignite global economic growth the trade dispute has had differing impacts on the us and china as china depends on the us market for its exports more than the us depends on china the short term economic effect on china has been more dramatic which sent chinese stocks lower and accounted for deteriorating economic data from the asian nation therefore when it comes to economics the us has had a dominant position in the trade dispute however from a political perspective the opposite may be the case china takes a long term view given their political system china can wait out the trump administration s attempts to level the playing field for international trade for far longer than the president can wait for success given his upcoming 2020 re election campaign political success in china is measured decades while in the us the time frame for success or failure is far shorter therefore politics favors the chinese and puts president xi in a dominant position on the trade dispute a continuation of the trade dispute would likely continue to weigh on the chinese economy and the prices of commodities as lower demand from the world s leading consumer is a bearish factor for the raw material markets however a trade deal that unleashes a new era of economic growth would likely lift chinese demand for commodities and that would be good news for the australian economy as their primary customer would return to the market with a vengeance causing prices to rise the supermarket to asia ewa will mirror economic growth or contraction in many ways the ishares msci australia etf is a bet on a trade deal and economic growth in china the fund summary for ewa states the investment seeks to track the investment results of the msci australia index composed of australian equities the fund generally invests at least 90 of its assets in the securities of its underlying

production and financing sides of the business the top holdings include source yahoo finance ewa has suffered under the weight of the trade dispute between the us and china over the recent months source barchart as the chart shows ewa dropped from a high at 24 18 per share in january 2018 to a low at 18 35 in late december a decline of over 24 at 20 34 on january 17 the etf remains not far off its recent low australia is the supermarket to china and any trade deal with the us that ignites the chinese economy is likely to lift not only the value of the australian dollar but the price of the ewa etf product a long position in ewa these days could be a bet on a trade deal between the us and china sometime in 2019

care what they think about him they deserve to be collapsing they the vassalic eu a group of 28 countries some 500 million people with a combined economy of a projected 19 trillion us dollar equivalent about the same as the us have submitted themselves to the dictate of washington in just about every important aspect of life the eu has accepted on orders by washington to sanction russia venezuela iran and a myriad of countries that have never done any harm to any of the 28 eu member states the eu has accepted the humiliation of military impositions by nato threatening russia and china with ever more and ever more advancing military basis towards moscow and beijing to the point that brussels foreign policy is basically led by nato it was clear from the very get go that the us sanctions regime imposed on russia and all the countries refusing to submit to the whims and rules of washington directly and via the eu was hurting the eu economically far more than russia this is specifically true for some of the southern european countries whose economy depended more on trading with russia and eurasia than it did for other eu countries the sanctions disaster really hit the fan when trump unilaterally decided to abrogate the nuclear deal with iran and reimpose heavy sanctions on iran and on everybody who would do business with iran european hydrocarbon giants started losing business that s when brussels led by germany started mumbling that they would not follow the us and even that they would back european corporations mainly hydrocarbon giants sticking to their contractual arrangements they had with iran too late european business had lost all confidence in brussels eu administration s feeble and generally untrustworthy words many breached their longstanding and after the nuclear deal renewed contracts with iran out of fear of punishment by washington and lack of trust in brussel s protection case in point is the french british petrol giant total which shifted its supply source from iran to russia no not to the us as was of course washington s intent the damage is done the vassals are committing slow suicide the people have had it more than half of the european population wants to get out of the fangs from brussels but nobody asks them nor listens to them and that in the so called heartland of democracy sic that s why people are now up in arms and protesting everywhere in one way or another in germany france the uk belgium the netherlands italy hungary poland the list is almost endless and it can be called generically the yellow vests after the new french revolution the latest in a series of the us attacking germany and german business and german integrity for that matter are the us ambassador s richard grenell recent threats to german corporations with sanctions if they work on nord stream 2 the 1 200 km pipeline bringing russian gas to europe to be completed by the end of 2019 it will virtually double the capacity of russian gas supply to europe instead washington wants europe to buy us shale gas and oil and especially keeping europe economically and financially in the us orbit avoiding in any way a detachment from washington and preventing the obvious and logical an alliance with russia this attempt will fail bitterly as various german ministers including foreign minister heiko maas have loudly and with determination protested against such us hegemonic advances well friends you have bent over backwards to please your washington masters for too long it s high time to step out of this lock step of obedience in france this past weekend of 12 13 january the yellow vests went into round 9 of protests against dictator macron his austerity program and not least his abject arrogance vis à vis the working class a recent public statement of macron s is testimony of this below the belt arrogance trop de francals n ont pas le sens de l effort ce qui explique en partie les troubles que connalt le pays translated too many french don t know the meaning of effort which explains at least partially the trouble this country is in the yellow vests and a majority of the french population want nothing less than macron s resignation protesters are consistently and largely under reported by christophe castaner the french interior minister this past weekend the official figure was 50 000 demonstrators countrywide when in reality the figure was at least three times higher the official french version would like the public at large inside and outside of france to believe that the yellow vest s movement is diminishing it is not to the contrary they are demonstrating all over france and that despite the macron regime s increasing violent repression rt reports on macron s orders the police are becoming more violent using military suppression to control protesting french civilians thousands have been arrested and hundreds injured by police brutality nevertheless the movement is gaining massive public support and the yellow vests idea is spreading throughout europe this spread is of course hardly reported by the mainstream media in fact 80 of the french back the yellow vests and their idea of a citizen initiated referendum ric for référendum d initiative citoyenne under which citizens could propose their own laws that would then be voted on by the general public the ric could effectively bypass the french parliament and would be enshrined in the french constitution a similar law exists since 1848 in switzerland and is regularly applied by swiss citizens it is a way of direct democracy that any country calling itself a democracy should incorporate in its constitution the uk is in shambles thousands are taking to the streets of london organized by the people s assembly against austerity calling for general elections to replace the failing tory government they are joined by the french gilets jaunes yellow vests out of solidarity many of the uk protesters are also wearing high visibility yellow vests this is in direct correlation with the ever growing louder debacle over brexit yes or no and how at this point nobody knows what britain s future is going to be propaganda and counter propaganda is destined to further confuse the people and confused people usually want to stick to the status quo there is even a movement of pro remain propaganda organized by some members of the european parliament imagine talking about sovereignty if brussels cannot even leave the brits alone to decide whether they want to continue under their dictate or not hélas the brits are largely divided but also past the stage of being swayed by foreign propaganda especially in this delicate question of leaving the eu which a majority of brits clearly decided in june 2016 prime minister theresa may has screwed up the brexit process royally to the point where many brits feel that what she negotiated is worse than no deal this has likely happened in close connivance with the unelected eu leadership which does not want the uk to leave and under strict orders from washington which needs the uk in its crucial role as a us mole in the european union on 15 january 2019 the uk parliament voted on whether they accept the negotiated brexit conditions or whether they prefer a no deal brexit or will request an extension for further negotiations under article 50 of the treaty of lisbon which was imposed by the heads of state of the 28 members without any public vote and is a false stand in for a eu constitution ms may s proposal was largely rejected by the british parliament but her government survived a subsequent vote of no confidence now the situation for the a divided british population is chaos so far nobody knows probably not even ms may what will follow next there are various options including snap elections and let the new pm decide a new remain or exit referendum that would not go down well with probably the majority of the population or simply a vote to in parliament for a no deal brexit or to stay in the eu after all for weeks the yellow vest movement has spread to belgium and the netherlands for similar reasons public discontent over austerity eu dictatorship over belgian and dutch sovereignty last friday one of the belgian yellow vests was overrun by a truck and killed authorities reported it as an accident greece the ms media report all is donkey dory greece is recovering has for the first time in many years a positive growth rate and is able to refinance herself on the open capital market greece is no longer dependent on the irate and infamous troika european central bank ecb european commission and imf reality is completely different as about two thirds of the greek population are still hovering around or below the survival level no access to public health care affordable medication public schools umpteen times reduced pensions most public assets and services privatized for a pittance nothing has fundamentally changed in the last years at least not for the better and for the majority of the people the troika has allowed the greek to go to the private capital markets to boost falsely their the greek s image among the international public at large basically telling the brainwashed populace it worked we the troika did a good job nothing worked people are unhappy more than unhappy they are indignant they demonstrated against angela merkel s recent visit to athens and their protests were violently oppressed by police forces what do you expect this is what has become of europe a highly repressive state of spineless vassals on wednesday 16 january the greek parliament may hold a vote of confidence against or for prime minister alexis tsipras the official and make believe reason is supposedly the controversy over the name of macedonia which in fact has long been settled the real reason is the public s discontent about the continuous and increasing blood letting by never ending austerity sucking the last pennies from the poor according to lancet the renowned british health journal the greek suicide rate is soaring nobody talks about it will tsipras survive a possible vote of confidence if not early elections who will follow tsipras don t be fooled by the term democracy the elite from within and without greece will not allow any policy changes that s when people à la gilets jaunes yellow vests may come in civil unrest enough is enough in italy the coalition of the 5 star movement and the small right wing brother lega norte is pulled to the far right by lega s matteo salvini deputy prime minister and interior minister mr salvini is clearly calling the shots and his alliance is firing strongly against brussels and with good reason as brussels is attempting to impose rules on italy s budget while the same rules do not apply equally to all eu member states for example macron france s rothschild implant has special privileges as far as budget overrun margins are concerned mr salvini s anti brussels anti eu stance is no secret and he has a lot of italians behind him an italian yellow vest movement cannot be excluded the empire s vassal castle is crumbling and not even silently then there are the former soviet satellites hungary and poland turned right wing don t appreciate brussels meddling with hungary s anti immigration policy and in poland over a controversial overhaul of the judiciary system never mind whether you agree or not with individual country actions both cases are clear interferences in these nations sovereignty though upon the european court of justice s strong warning poland indeed blinked and reinstated the judges fired in the judiciary reform process poland s love for nato and brussels use of the nato leverage may have played a role in poland s reversal of decision nevertheless discontent in poland as in hungary among the public at large remains strong migration and the judiciary are just the visible pretexts the legendary tip of the iceberg reality is on a deeper level much deeper these countries are both reminded of what they considered the soviet union s handcuffs freedom is not being dictated by brussels the triad of systematic and willful destabilization and destruction of what we know as the greater middle east and western world is what we have to be aware of the east mostly russia and china is a challenge being tackled simultaneously impressively for the brainwashed westerner but rather meekly for those who are informed about russia s and china s military might and intelligence capacity this drive of destabilization cum destruction comes in three phases it started with the middle east which for the most part has become a hopeless hell hole a source of indiscriminate killing by the western allies say the emperor s puppets and mercenaries resulting in millions killed and in an endless flood of refugees destabilizing europe which is the second phase of the triad it s in full swing it happens right in front of our eyes but we don t see it it s the yellow vests austerity increasing inequality unemployment social sector s being milked to zilch by the financial system popular uprisings oppression by police and military forces it s reflected by the dismal powerlessness of the people that leads to enough is enough in the streets that s the way it s all wanted the more chaos the better people in chaos are easily controlled now comes phase three of the triad latin america it has already started three or four years back countries that have struggled for decades to eventually break loose with some form of democracy from the fangs of empire are gradually being subdued with fake elections and internal parliamentary coups back into the emperor s backyard the southern cone argentina chile brazil uruguay paraguay is gone except for bolivia peru colombia ecuador all the way to guyana are governed by neoliberal even neo nazi shaded lords of washington but there is still venezuela cuba nicaragua and now also mexico that have not caved in and will not cave in in an extraordinary analysis thierry meyssan describes in the terrible forthcoming destruction of the caribbean basin how the pentagon is still pursuing the implementation of the rumsfeld cebrowski plan this time aiming at the destruction of the caribbean basin states there is no consideration for friends or political enemies thierry meyssan observes he goes on predicting that after the period of economic destabilization and that of military preparation the actual operation should begin in the years to come by an attack on venezuela by brazil supported by israel colombia an ally of the united states and guyana in other words the united kingdom it will be followed by others beginning with cuba and nicaragua the troika of tyranny as per john bolton only the future will say to what extent this plan will be implemented at the outset its ambitions exceed the crumbling empire s actual capacity when it comes all down to one single denominator it s the current western financial system that must go it is private banking gone berserk we are living in a financial system that has gone wild and running havoc uncontrolled a train of endless greed that is loosely speeding ahead and doesn t know when it will hit an unyielding steel enforced brick wall but hit it will it is a mere question of time people are sick and tired of being milked no end by a fraudulent pyramid system constructed by the us and her dollar hegemony and maintained by globalized private banking we are living in a private banking system that has nothing to do with economic development but everything with a greed driven domination of us consumers sold on debt and on money that we don t control despite the fact that we earned it with our hard labor despite the fact that it is our added value to what we call the economy no this system is totally disrespectful of the individual it is even ready to steal our money if it needs to survive our banking system it takes the liberty of administering it and basically appropriating it once our money is in a private bank we have lost control over it and mind you and get it into your brains private banks do not work for you and me but for their shareholders but through hundreds of years of indoctrination we have become so used to it that being charged interest for borrowing our own money through an intermediary who does nothing absolutely nothing but wait for profit to fall into its lap has become the normality it isn t this system has to be abolished the faster the better private banking needs to be eradicated and replaced by local public banking that works with local currencies based on local economic output way removed from globalized concepts that help steal resources empty local social safety nets all under the guise of austerity for progress we should know better by now there is no austerity for progress has never been this fraudulent imf world bank concept has never worked anywhere we have to de dollarize our money de digitize our money and pool it through a public banking system for the purpose of people s growth hence a society s or nation s growth there is currently one good example the bank of north dakota the bnd has helped the us state of north dakota through the 2008 and following years crisis with economic growth instead of economic decline with almost full employment versus skyrocketing unemployment in the rest of the us and the western world we need to build our common wealth with sovereign money backed by our sovereign economies as the empire and its vassals are crumbling badly they are shaking in their foundations it is time to rethink what we have been taking for granted and for normal a fraudulent and deceptive monetary system backed by nothing no economy not even gold we are living on sheer fiat money made by private banking by a mouse click and by letting us be enslaved by debt enough is enough the yellow vests have understood they want to get rid of their macron who keeps propagating the fraud it is time to rethink and restart as the crumbling is getting louder and louder empire s european vassal state is falling apart and will pull washington and its hegemonic war and money machine along into the abyss first published by the new eastern outlook neo

by karamoh kabba the first was lieutenant john clarkson that was well over 200 years ago in the late 18th century on his departure in what would become depending on who you talk to the famous or infamous governor clarkson s prayer for sierra leone o lord the inhabitants of this vast continent incline their hearts towards us that they may more readily listen to our advice and doctrines and that we may conduct ourselves towards them as to convince them of the happiness we enjoy under thy almighty protection he also asked god guide them o merciful god in the paths of truth and let not a few wicked men among us draw down thy vengeance upon this colony indeed our hearts have been inclined towards them we listened to their advices as all 48 of them after him inculcated their doctrines in us for over two centuries until 1971 god may not have guided us in the paths of truth but we upheld their democracy and half of us their christian doctrine as we endured sustained wickedness from them for failing to uphold their own part of the covenant we chose to man our own affairs and so we removed the last governor at least so we thought but not that fast in 2016 the british government sent us guy warrington as high commissioner to sierra leone he came with all the attributes of a colonist he is very loathed by us his so called subjects for his brazing imposition on our affairs unlike the lengthy prayer from the first governor guy warrington tweeted a short prayer for his colony time to go on holiday stay safe salone guy warrington s unsavory diplomatic relationship and knack for imperialism may be hereditary the warringtons were mostly farmer based families found in england and later in the usa and canada in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries as farmers whereas they may have benefited from slave labour one famous warrington was conspicuous in diplomacy in the mid 19th century historical records state that george hanmer warrington was an unresolved mystery surrounds the marriage of hanmer warrington to jane eliza pearce who was rumoured to be the illegitimate child of the prince regent later george iv although never proven this tenuous connection may explain why warrington was able to maintain himself in unusual style in a villa outside tripoli and why he was never recalled in spite of repeated diplomatic infringements particularly towards one french consul baron joseph louis rousseau george hanmer warrington according to further findings indeed he was required to explain his sometimes aggressive behaviour to the colonial office on more than one occasion in sierra leone guy warrington stands accused of meddling with the march 2018 presidential election the all peoples congress apc in power then accused him of collusion with operatives of local civil society organizations csos to rig the elections because of apc government s trade relationship with china and its insistent on subsidizing global commodities to cushion prices against the earnings of low income and jobless citizens which became anathema to british interest and indeed as accused guy warrington had openly boasted on saint patrick s day after a few drinks that the apc will not win the presidential election a boastfulness he would make good of through collusion with csos he heavily funded with dfid and eu aids a whopping three million pound sterling was paid out to a coalition of csos and media operatives under the guise of standing together for democracy this coalition was the main tool of false propaganda against the apc what is more guy warrington stands accused of imposing a pre programmed dfid funded tally 2018 software on a three million voting population one local commentator wrote that few primary school pupils could count the entire voting population of sierra leone in few hours and that sierra leone didn t need expensive electronics counting equipment procured by dfid if it were not meant for the ploy to rig the election the only difference with the alleged russia meddling with the us election and the sierra leone one is that the justice system in sierra leone is too weak to investigate the allegations of wrongdoing the gavel has been held down tightly in place by the most powerful beneficiaries of the ploy instead the cso operatives partners of the grand conspiracy to rig the election are now busy peddling fake reports to reinforce their position on the public that the elections were free and fair they are now aggressively propagating on the sierra leone local media that polls reveal that we the people have trust in the president it is worth observing that trust is not binding how can we even trust a president who has no regard for the constitution the rule of law acts of parliament and freedom of expression the binding documents and principles between him and us but we should have seen it coming when guy warrington started his diabolical plan against the country for its business relationship with china in an article entitled after brexit uk sl commit to free trade published by the exclusive newspaper on the 30th august 2017 guy warrington wrote this is a uk commitment that after we leave the eu trading terms will remain at least as good as they are now but that is just the baseline the uk government is determined to strengthen the attractiveness of the uk already one of the easiest places in the world to do business as a commercial destination post brexit a more global britain will also aim to strengthen trade and other ties with the rest of the commonwealth including sierra leone at another time british high commissioner peter west the predecessor to warrington brazenly asked the national secretary general nsg of the apc party why is it that the chinese are winning all the contracts not knowing the deep seated reason behind the question the nsg simply replied the chinese are fast and cheap recently an audio broadcast a product of western media has become suddenly conspicuous on sierra leone social media including whatsapp in which the narrator gripes over chinese contracts and how the people are not benefitting from them just when the apc challenged the bias slpp government transition team gtt report guy warrington became a frequent visitor to the state house and ministries his words from the brexit article improving revenue collection and infrastructure respecting the sanctity of contract clarity on land title tackling corruption at all levels must be implemented but in a very rude manner at the expense of human rights principles suddenly the gtt report has taken a brand new dimension consistent with britain s transparency international unexplained wealth orders uwos a commission of inquiry to investigate unexplained wealth of past apc government officials ranging from the former president the former vice president former ministers and deputies all the way down to directors and commissioners to be headed by one judge biobele from nigeria and other two more judges this is against the backdrop that transparency international has been empowered to tender investigation of uwos in the court of law a uwo can also be applied to politicians or officials from outside the european economic area eea or those associated with them i e politically exposed persons peps a uwo made in relation to a non eea pep would not require suspicion of serious criminality thus the slpp government s insistent on excluding the rules of court committee and the rules of evidence in its three commissions of inquiry transparency international has recently published five examples of uwos peps of five developing countries including two from africa libya and nigeria who owns properties in england that transparency international perceives not commensurate to their income from above a uwo made in relation to a non eea pep would not require suspicion of serious criminality simply means that like the international court of justice this too will focus on developing third world countries leaders politicians despite that uwos situation exists in many developed countries judge biobele on his own part is known for questionable conduct of being used in nigeria as a tool of vindictive pursuit of opposition politicians similar to his pending assignment in sierra leone his commission was legally challenged and was barred from proceeding with the commission with respect to subsidy removal the briton woods institutions are only deepening the level of poverty in sierra leone by design like in all other developing countries they have been to by suppressing social democracy and social capitalism initiatives it has dawn on western nations themselves that communism socialism and capitalism are all anachronistic and obsolete knowing very well that social democracy and social capitalism have become the world order yet are forcing developing countries to remove subsidies from global commodities thereby deepening hardship and poverty to ensure that developing nations indebted to the world bank wb and the international monetary fund imf have capacity only for debt maintenance at the expense of reinforced poverty meanwhile social democracy and social capitalism is supported and well funded in the west in england the ub40 which is now the job seekers allowance jsa initiative is still the statutory instrument of social democracy meant to support low income earners and jobless citizens in the usa free housing free medical medicare medicaid and food stamp for jobless citizens and the aged are equally statutory instruments of social democracy in all of these nations in the west large corporations are bound by law to embark on social capitalism through corporate social responsibility csr and community development programmes nevertheless double standard has been the order of the day in africa s relationship with the west all in all the people of sierra leone are very wary about their last governor in the person of guy warrington the country is becoming mercurial under his watch like peter penfold the desire to involve in possible small arms and weapons from bulgaria deal could not be dismissed like sandline s acquisition of koidu holdings during the civil war the acquisition of the ferengbeya iron ore deposits could not be dismissed as well especially that the chinese businesses are folding up and moving out it all may be in the last governor of sierra leone s grand imperial plan only that we hope the british government is not in cohort with him and if not we hope investigations of his stewardship in sierra leone would not be dragged under the carpet like in the case of peter penfold s wrong dealings in sierra leone
source xinhua 2019 01 19 21 53 30 editor xuxin video player close by eric j lyman rome jan 19 xinhua estimates for how much the italian economy will grow this year or if it will grow at all continue to weaken as lower industrial production political uncertainty and slower exports all take a toll in the latest news the bank of italy lowered its expectations for economic growth in 2019 to 0 6 percent from 1 0 percent previously that leaves the italian government as the only major entity still predicting the country s gross domestic product will grow by at least 1 0 percent this year italian government settled on the figure in december reducing previous estimates of 1 5 percent growth as part of budget deficit negotiations with the european commission the international monetary fund the organization for economic cooperation and development italy s national statistics institute ratings agency standard poor s and the european commission have all reduced their prognostications for italian economic growth to between 0 5 percent and 0 8 percent even with its new lower 0 6 percent growth figure the bank of italy s estimate is more optimistic than many others six weeks ago u s investment bank morgan stanley cut its growth estimate for the italian economy in 2019 in half to 0 5 percent in december goldman sachs another major investment bank predicted 0 4 percent growth the most recent private sector estimates are even weaker pimco a leading bond company predicted this week that the italian economy would remain static in 2019 showing no net growth compared to the previous year meanwhile lorenzo codogno founder and chief economist with lc macro advisors predicted in a research note this week that the italian economy would contract by 0 2 percent this year all the estimates represent a dramatic downward trend for the italian economy s growth prospects a year ago in january 2018 the consensus estimated for economic growth in 2019 were in the range of 1 2 percent to 2 2 percent it would be wrong to put too much importance on a single estimate for economic growth and we have to keep in mind that different models take different figures into account alessandro polli a political economist with rome s la sapienza university told xinhua but when there s a clear trend in the general consensus that means it s time to pay attention polli said that falling growth estimates can hurt economic growth on their own by spooking investors which drive yields for government debt higher and convincing businesses and individuals less likely to spend money polli said an anticipated slowdown in italian exports within the european union and to china and the united states were a major factor earlier in the week economists told xinhua that reduced industrial production 1 6 percent lower in italy in november would drag economic growth lower and in his research note codogno said the factors behind the slowing growth levels are tied to the political uncertainty of the current government and its budget plans which he said will increase the country s debt levels codogno said the combination of factors will push italy to the brink of recession given that statistics will likely show the economy shrank in the last quarter of 2018 he predicted a slight recovery in the second half of 2019 but not enough to compensate for the weak first half the risks are to the downside codogno said if these ideas are wrong it s most likely because they under estimate how deep and long an economic recession could last

of the federal government and financial market volatility stoked fears of a sharp deceleration in economic growth the drop in confidence reported by the university of michigan on friday is the clearest sign yet that the impasse in washington over trump s demands for 5 7 billion to help build a wall on the united states border with mexico was negatively impacting the economy by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s consumer sentiment tumbled in early january to its lowest level since president donald trump was elected more than two years ago as an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government and financial market volatility stoked fears of a sharp deceleration in economic growth the drop in confidence reported by the university of michigan on friday is the clearest sign yet that the impasse in washington over trump s demands for 5 7 billion to help build a wall on the united states border with mexico was negatively impacting the economy trump has touted high consumer confidence as an indication of the good job he is doing on the economy advertisement while consumer sentiment remains relatively high the gathering dark clouds over the economy could make households more cautious about spending leading to slower growth consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the u s economy this report on consumer sentiment is the first concrete evidence that the economy is going to fall and fall hard if washington does not end the shutdown said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york it is going to be hard to see real gdp growth of more than 1 to 1 1 2 percent in the first quarter if the consumer goes on a buying strike the longest government shutdown in the history of the united states has left some 800 000 government workers without a paycheck private contractors working for many government agencies are also without wages the university of michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell 7 7 percent to a reading of 90 7 this month the lowest reading since october 2016 and the steepest drop since september 2015 economists had forecast a reading of a 97 0 advertisement the survey s measure of current economic conditions decreased to 110 0 from a reading of 116 1 in december its measure of consumer expectations tumbled to a reading of 78 3 the lowest since october 2016 from 87 0 in late december the university of michigan attributed the decline in sentiment to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown the impact of tariffs instabilities in financial markets the global slowdown and the lack of clarity about monetary policies advertisement it said that half of the survey s respondents believed that these events would have a negative impact on trump s ability to focus on economic growth economists estimate the partial shutdown of the government which started on dec 22 is subtracting as much as two tenths of a percentage point from quarterly gdp growth every week advertisement other surveys have also shown an ebb in business sentiment sentiment among both households and businesses has been coming off the sugar highs which were caused by tax cut hopes at the beginning of the trump presidency said harm bandholz chief u s economist at unicredit in new york u s financial markets shrugged off the fall in sentiment with investors focusing on another report on friday showing manufacturing output surged by the most in 10 months in december and on hopes for progress in the u s china trade row advertisement stocks on wall street rallied setting the three main indexes on track for their fourth week of gains the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell factory activity accelerates the broad based jump in manufacturing output in december reported by the federal reserve could allay fears of a sharp slowdown in factory activity advertisement manufacturing activity which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy is slowing as some of the boost to capital spending from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades in addition a strong dollar and cooling growth in europe and china are hurting exports lower oil prices are also slowing purchases of equipment for oil and gas well drilling advertisement production at factories increased at a 2 3 percent annualised rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 3 7 percent pace in the july september period it increased 2 4 percent in 2018 the largest gain since 2012 after advancing 1 2 percent in 2017 while the manufacturing strength in december is a favourable signal for the economy we should keep in mind that it came after soft results in earlier months said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york advertisement a broad range of manufacturing surveys also have been weakening lately so the strength in the manufacturing output in december may prove to be short lived last month motor vehicle production surged 4 7 percent after gaining 0 2 percent in november excluding motor vehicles and parts manufacturing advanced a solid 0 8 percent last month after gaining 0 1 percent in november advertisement december s 1 1 percent surge in manufacturing output together with a rise in mining production offset a weather related drop in utilities leading to a 0 3 percent increase in industrial production industrial output rose 0 4 percent in november it

new york following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week brexit should i stay or should i go another week closer to the date britain leaves the european union or are we given how crushingly prime minister theresa may s brexit divorce deal was defeated by lawmakers there is little chance her plan b to be presented in coming days will get away with just minor amendments so markets now reckon the march 29 deadline will be extended to give parliament more time to negotiate the manner of exit or even to organize a second referendum the optimism has driven sterling to two month highs against the dollar with 4 percent plus gains from jan 3 lows options markets too imply further pound strength over the three month period that encompasses the deadline of course markets glee could be misplaced if may fails to forge consensus within her party and with opposition leader jeremy corbyn and if parliament fails to agree an extension britain will crash out the eu without a deal corbyn wants a pledge from may to block no deal brexit before joining cross party talks but may describes this as impossible her plan b will be unveiled on monday and voted on by parliament on jan 29 sterling looks set for another volatile week mountains can t turn coming days will show whether china s run of weak economic data continues as it releases fourth quarter growth numbers as well as investment and retail sales for december but if anything markets could be surprised on the upside after shockingly bad figures on exports and factory output growth is expected to print at 6 4 percent for the fourth quarter the weakest since the global financial crisis but that would be in line with rates chinese policymakers may be targeting sources tell us some have proposed lowering growth targets to between 6 0 and 6 5 percent beijing has unveiled a series of fiscal and monetary support measures yet unlike in 2015 or during prior slowdowns the government has been careful to avoid simply throwing state money at the problem as the chinese proverb goes mountains cannot turn only rivers can be it household spending sops tax cuts infrastructure projects funded by local governments or money market operations china seems determined not to turn its back on a commitment to deleveraging and market reform and that makes it difficult to say when the economy will rebound 3 draghi ing on ecb bond buying is officially over but with economic data and inflation both continuing to underwhelm the central bank has little time to relax policymakers have acknowledged the euro zone slowdown could last longer than anticipated but will be hoping nonetheless that upcoming data might bring some relief in particular they will monitor

recent dire readings powerhouse germany which barely skirted recession in the latter part of 2018 releases its zew sentiment survey on tuesday ecb president draghi is as yet unlikely to change his assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy but that may be just a question of time after all china s economic slowdown and the u s government shutdown are weighing on global growth and the euro zone still needs to weather the fallout from brexit 4 shutdown slowdown last year at davos u s treasury secretary steven mnuchin sent the dollar plunging by saying a weak currency was good for the united states this year though with a government in shutdown president donald trump has canceled mnuchin s switzerland trip trump is also economizing in other ways including buying macdonalds burgers for white house visitors but anxiety is growing over how much the shutdown could hit u s growth and to what extent it will filter to already stuttering world growth so far damage looks limited jobless claims have continued to fall and the philly fed business outlook survey was above forecast but the longer it continues the worse it gets not only are 800 000 government workers going without

security payments but the democrat controlled house shows no sign of agreeing trump s demands for 5 7 billion to fund a border wall and a house vote to fund the government through feb 28 was postponed to the coming week mnuchin meanwhile has declined to testify to the house about how the shutdown may impact the upcoming tax filing season 5 it s cold out there yes it is that time of year again

more big foreign capital investments are expected in auckland s commercial property market this year photo supplied we asked commercial property leaders for their opinions about prospects for the 2019 market mike bayley mike bayley photo supplied managing director bayley corporation ltd the flow of investment funds into the commercial property market which reached unprecedented levels in 2018 is likely to gather even more momentum in 2019 this will be led by continuing diversification out of the residential market particularly in auckland where the housing market is likely to remain fairly flat for the next few years at the high value end of the commercial property market the big influx of foreign capital in 2018 is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg when the world s largest real estate private equity investment firm blackstone group outlays nz 636 million to acquire a portfolio of office buildings in the viaduct being managed by bayleys property services the rest of the globe takes notice and generally follows suit expect more big investments from the likes of blackstone invesco and s c capital in 2019 while we re a small market new zealand offers global investors a safe harbour in an increasingly turbulent world enhancing connections and exposure to international markets will therefore be a major focus in 2019 in this regard bayleys acquisition last year of knight frank s new zealand business operations and our strategic international alliance with them will provide additional global profile for our clients regulatory restrictions will continue to constrain the amount of funding our main australian owned banks can allocate to commercial property however we expect at least one offshore based non bank commercial property lending entity to establish itself in new zealand this year this will open up more funding options for the development sector in particular the investments funds and syndication market should continue to flourish and offer an increasingly diverse range of products such as augusta s tourism property fund and potentially a residential focused fund later in 2019 mark synnott mark synnott photo supplied ceo colliers international nz the rise of flexible co working new streams of non bank lending and the emergence of build to rent are among the key trends expected to shape the new zealand commercial property market in 2019 the market has well and truly bounced back after a post election slump in late 2017 and early 2018 on the back of this uptick in activity we anticipate another exceptional year of growth in 2019 the ongoing low interest rate environment and sustained offshore investor interest will underpin this growth the flexible co working sector looks set to continue its meteoric rise the sector has doubled in the past three years and our forecasts show it will double again within the next five the main constraints are low levels of vacancy and high levels of rental growth in the office sector reducing available options non bank lending is likely to become more prevalent as developers seek alternative funding models at the same time margins for builders are likely to grow due to consolidation in the construction sector development conditions will make speculative builds more attractive particularly in the office sector there is already strong demand for spec build office space as evidenced by uptake at no 1 sylvia park and 10 madden st in the wynyard quarter the build to rent sector is poised to gain momentum in 2019 this emerging asset class involves the development of residential properties at scale to be rented out privately rather than sold to owner occupiers the asset class is maturing in the united state and europe but remains in its infancy in new zealand we expect auckland s first build to rent residential project to launch in 2019 with further development to follow non bank funders and syndicators will be watching these developments closely in the wider residential development sector kiwibuild will dominate the lower end of the market however skills shortages in the construction industry and the greater margins to be made in the commercial sector will constrain the amount of supply the industrial sector looks likely to continue its stellar run significant deals last year included the 93m sale to goodman of foodstuffs distribution centre in mt roskill and the 53 75m sale to augusta of the castle rock business park in christchurch these were the largest ever industrial transactions in the north and south islands respectively scarce land supply low vacancy and rising rents will continue to attract investors with syndicators and listed property companies remaining active at the top of the market in the office sector strong uptake of prime new supply will contribute to growth in the secondary sector this is good news for landlords but local investors will find it hard to compete against offshore buyers at the top end of the market invesco s recent purchase of a 50 per cent share off precinct of the anz centre in auckland for 181m highlights the continued levels of offshore interest in new zealand office assets retail s transformation will continue in 2019 with some 179 380sq m of new supply expected in auckland over the next few years including significant shopping centre expansions at scentre group s westfield newmarket and kiwi property s sylvia park the new retail precinct at commercial bay will consolidate the shift of auckland cbd s epicentre towards the waterfront and the western cbd fringe hotel supply in auckland looks set to finally catch up with demand revenue in the sector will remain strong due to continued tourism growth and an anticipated spike in demand during the america s cup and apec conference in 2021 outside of auckland the regions are likely to continue booming the residential and commercial markets in hawke s bay and wanaka in particular have undergone tremendous growth over the last two years which will continue as populations grow growth in the other two golden triangle centres of hamilton and tauranga will also remain strong john urlich john urlich photo supplied commercial manager barfoot thompson there has rarely been a year that has seen us looking more globally for clues than this one the economic outlook is now well signalled and a necessary easing of global stock markets is required and due clearly it will pay to be cautious this year but we believe the property sector will make for continued good investment it s been said that nobody wins a trade war and the effects of us policy will be felt globally not least of which will be china this uncertainty will continue to affect the over bought share market and some necessary correction will ensue despite this we are optimistic we will see a relatively soft landing central banks are growth sensitive and the recent tightening of monetary policy will afford them room to move and move they will we are confident any potential slow down will be managed all of this has only one immediate consequence on our commercial property market investment sentiment as we saw last year business confidence is the single business determinant in the demand for real estate our advice to any investor tenant or occupier is that they must consider the current global ructions against the fundamentals of our property market and our fundamentals are very good we would point to record low vacancy rates across all sectors coupled with an unavailability of development options that makes for a challenging environment for real estate agents building will remain costly and the uptake of office space has exceeded predictions consequently there is a relative shortage of prime office space available in the next few years the refurbishment of secondary buildings will continue to remain feasible option and overall the outlook for the auckland cbd and city fringe will remain consistent rental levels will grow the industrial markets are tighter still and the need for greater space continues and will do so going forward a high proportion of industrial occupiers we survey have suggested that more space would benefit their business immediately retailing remains a science and a cautious approach to both site selection and rental levels remains paramount for tenants and occupiers that said consumer confidence remains consistent and the outlook overall remains positive the next quarter may prove testing some sectors such as hotels childcare and residential apartments in the city s periphery are showing signs of increased supply but again overall we are positive to place a 2019 twist on an old cliche we believe fortunes will favour the bold but measured andrew stringer andrew stringer photo supplied senior managing director cbre nz two highly influential but diverse market factors will push new zealand property markets into 2019 first global capital remains very focused on new zealand and auckland in particular we anticipate continuing demand from offshore investors assisted by recent changes to oio thresholds but with a shift back down the risk curve international capital will continue to dominate major transactions focusing on highly secure property moving away from the add value focus of the past 24 months high quality potentially low yielding assets backed by strong and long leases are in strong demand across all sectors with a number of dedicated long walt funds scoping new zealand this is likely to see renewed opportunity for capital recycling through corporate sale and leasebacks secondly decision making around how businesses will use their premises will continue to see greater levels of intelligence applied to it across all sectors of the market office and industrial occupiers are applying ever increasing knowledge to how they use their premises more effectively in order to drive employee engagement and business performance large corporates and smes alike are acutely attuned to the importance of workplace to business performance multi disciplinary advice has never been more important as occupiers seek to use property to add value for instance the co working phenomenon is now entrenched in our market and major office landlords are embracing it but leveraging this flexibility requires specialist workplace strategy in the industrial sector we re seeing this theme emerge as the massive increase in infrastructure spend continues to drive location decisions particularly for manufacturing and distribution the improving connectivity of auckland to the waikato region will broaden choice for industrial occupiers but how specific locations will suit businesses will depend on supply chain benefits traditional property silos are no more and sector lines are being blurred so it will be more important than ever to apply multi disciplinary intelligence in 2019 todd lauchlan todd lauchlan photo supplied managing director jll in a world where global media headlines have been dominated by economic uncertainty throughout 2018 new zealand s economy and property investment market has continued to quietly confidently and purposefully propel itself forward with little fuss or undue self promotion with an official economic growth rate of 3 per cent for the year ended september 2018 new zealand has outperformed many of its key trading partners around the world and is set to do so again in 2019 and beyond according to commentator forecasts the investment case for new zealand at a structural level remains strong and robust and more so if anything the benefits of the underlying attractiveness for larger scale investment in new zealand assets has certainly been demonstrated in recent years since 2014 the total market size of 5m plus deals across all commercial property sectors has averaged 4 6bn per annum by way of comparison between 2005 and 2013 the average was 1 8bn only on any scale this represents a huge structural market shift which cannot be explained by underlying inflation alone new zealand is now increasingly on the global investor stage and should be proud to be so our transparent market and no stamp duty or capital gains tax obligations are undoubted advantages so what for 2019 well we see more of the same although opportunities are admittedly a little bit tougher to find these days as investors appreciate the true value of what they own with new zealand s economy being so well balanced though we see scope for strategic investment in office industrial residential alternatives and high end retail mixed use assets although we are notably concerned for secondary retail space given such dramatic changes in how we shop as a nation these days there is a lot still to play for supported by strong population growth forecast for new zealand and auckland in particular over the next 25 years there are of course challenges ahead and not every property will be a winner careful planning and strategy will be crucial as always to stay ahead of the curve at a more localised level auckland s continuing infrastructural advances are opening up new locations through enhancing accessibility in wellington geographical constraints on development continue to drive value and promote ingenuity across all property sectors in christchurch the creation of so much modern space following the devastating earthquake in 2011 will revolutionise how business is done there in future and across the rest of the south island with increased physical and technological connectivity many more areas are opening up as very real opportunities for investors there is no reason why 2019 should not be another good year for property in new zealand paddy callesen paddy callesen photo supplied managing director savills auckland when forecasting the year ahead those of us who have been in the market for a long time hope for the best but always assess the risks there is never any shortage of dark clouds and turbulence in far off markets while these markets do affect us we trade in a local property environment influenced by continued high net migration and population growth low interest rates low vacancy rates and non inflationary economic growth this leads to demand in all property sectors in the absence of an economic meltdown how will these factors shape the auckland property market in 2019 industrial property will be the standout investment category in 2019 vacancy will remain at record low levels along with a scarcity of suitable development land and increasing construction costs rents will continue to increase across the prime and secondary grades and we also anticipate some further yield compression cbd office property will continue to attract interest from offshore parties with local buyers priced out of the market transaction numbers will be subdued as a result of limited available stock demand will continue to be less strong for retail centres and suburban office property with the best transactions reflecting either high yielding or add value opportunities performance in the housing market will directly affect confidence in the retail property market indications of ocr cuts in 2019 may help residential sentiment to remain steady or possibly improve despite the recent retraction in australia development opportunities will continue to be dominated by domestic demand especially in the smaller scale sub 10ha space pricing will be subject to influence from reduced sales volumes and price moderation of completed products a material influence will be demand from parties seeking to deliver kiwibuild opportunities we also expect to see continued improvement in the availability of credit in 2019 as several of the larger development projects office and apartment reach completion john davies john davies photo supplied co owner director ray white commercial auckland challenging conditions for apartment developers in central auckland are resulting in the mixed use project market softening increases in the cost of labour materials and fees have eroded margins to the point where banks are declining to lend resulting in developments especially smaller scale being suspended or abandoned this trend is likely to gather momentum in 2019 larger better established developers with momentum scale and cash will fare best the trend for residential property investors to move into commercial property will continue once the darling of property investors the residential sector has lost its shine and is now highly regulated with a considerable management burden capital growth is no longer a given and returns have been eroded to a level that is unacceptable to many commercial property offers many attractive characteristics including superior returns net leases and longer lease terms these factors will continue to prompt those looking for passive holdings and income to buy commercial property lease lengths are a key consideration for investors and lenders and this will continue with medium to large scale investors now demanding leases of at least 10 years where just a few years ago six year leases were acceptable this has now increased in part due to banks offering better terms on investments with leases of 10 years minimum overall auckland s commercial property market will remain strong over the medium term at least supported by population growth and a large amount of domestic and overseas capital chasing limited opportunities critical to the ongoing strength of the market are population growth transport and infrastructure development the lift in land values relating to the unitary plan is most likely now behind us future property hotspots will be linked to key infrastructure and access projects including the city rail link the proposed pedestrianisation of queen st roading improvements and retail centre extensions such as 277 broadway and sylvia park

almost as soon as the world s most eminent economic doomsayers began to warn about an impending slump possibly as soon as 2020 policymakers were out of the blocks racing to avert the worst effects the new year message from the international monetary fund imf and a string of similarly gloomy commentators struck a chord apparently within weeks of sounding the alarm that a global recession and possibly a credit crunch to rival 2008 s was on the way first to recognise the danger was the us federal reserve which slammed the brakes on ever tighter monetary policy no more interest rate rises this year and possibly a review of the fed s sale of 3 7tn of assets the unloading of which has done so much in the last 18 months to push up long term interest rates charged by us banks and other lenders to commercial borrowers the people s bank of china brought similar cheer to investors after it loosened credit rules to allow small and medium sized businesses to borrow more freely almost overnight an economy that was slowing dramatically and taking germany the us and much of asia down with it was back on the path to solid growth politicians played their part donald trump s advisers spotted that his tariff war with china was as a serious drag on us trade suddenly the aggressive bickering that governed trade talks last year between trump and the chinese premier xi jinping began to calm noticeably in the past week china s chief trade negotiator the vice premier liu he has said he would travel to the us to work together to further implement the important consensus reached by the two state leaders beijing also pledged to cut taxes on a larger scale to boost business activity against a backdrop of disappointing industrial production figures and the first drop in car sales for almost three decades the state council was following an almost trumpian route to boosting growth city analysts lapped up the news since the christmas break the s p 500 the broadest stock market index tracking major us corporations has climbed back to 2610 from a 2018 low of 2416 even the ftse 100 battered by brexit uncertainty regained its composure and rose 300 points other disputes featured on the imf s risk register the row between rome and brussels over the italian budget deficit and the danger it posed for the eurozone s stuttering recovery was one likewise there was the potential for a no deal brexit to spread chaos in financial markets after the italian government found a way to compromise and the british parliament made clear it wasn t prepared to countenance a no deal brexit both these risks faded or at least in the minds of investors however the cassandras are not giving up just yet one reason is that the cost of the us china trade war in lost economic activity and falling levels of business confidence has almost wiped out the benefits of trump s 1 2tn tax cuts going forward the president s recalibration of his rhetoric on trade with china has come too late and not gone far enough the us must also contend with a colossal policy mistake courtesy of the fed which raised interest rates four times in 2018 and has already offloaded hundreds of billions of dollars of assets its recent pause notwithstanding the extra borrowing costs already imposed by the fed will continue to hurt businesses and consumers a third policy mistake is the shutdown currently gripping the federal government meanwhile in china the ameliorating effects of xi s tax cuts and credit easing are likely to be short lived with knock on effects in the us and europe diana choyleva a china expert at enodo economics said last week that 2019 was shaping up to be a more challenging year than the last as the trade war with the us morphs into a tech war and beijing struggles to keep china s rebalancing on track amid much weaker growth and mounting debt the doomsayers at fathom consulting are sticking by their prediction of a global recession in 2020 at the consultancy ts lombard they see a move by jp morgan as a canary signalling trouble ahead the us bank which has played a major role in the lending bonanza of recent years has increased the reserves it sets aside to cover loan losses it has also tightened its lending criteria could it be that america s biggest bank has stopped dancing in the financial disco even while the music continues to play that s a big call when there is still money to be made from shovelling out cheap loans surely it means there is trouble ahead

more than 10 last year real estate economic data hoya capital real estate housingwire housing data in focus as mortgage rates recede just weeks after much of wall street threw in the towel on homebuilders and the broader housing market in their 2019 outlooks the recent pullback in mortgage rates has started to breathe some life back into the beaten down housing sector the mba purchase index a useful leading indicator of new and existing home sales jumped to the highest level since 2010 while the mba refinance index rose to the highest level since last spring even with the pullback in mortgage rates however rates are still roughly 50 basis points above the average rate between 2012 and 2018 amounting to a roughly 75 higher monthly mortgage payment on a 250 000 loan while recent mortgage demand data has been fairly solid november and december new home sales data which has been delayed by the government shutdown is likely to be ugly when it finally gets released zillow estimates that november new home sales plunged 21 in november on a saar basis but recovered slightly in december dipping a more modest 2 from a year earlier incorporating those estimates into the data set we see that new home sales likely ended 2018 essentially flat a rather remarkable end of year breakdown after recording a ttm growth rate of nearly 9 as recently as september existing home sales data gets released by the nar next tuesday with consensus estimates calling for a saar rate around 5 2 million which would be a 7 annualized decline from last december if nothing else the last six months have reconfirmed that mortgage rates matter quite a bit to incremental single family housing demand a theme that we ve been discussing since mortgage rates initially jumped in the wake of tax reform early last year we were critical of the fed late last year as the committee took a seemingly defiant approach in pushing ahead with rate hikes despite clear signs of slowing in the rate sensitive segments of the market since late december the committee has changed its tune signaling a more dovish policy approach and combined with the pullback in oil prices and resulting decline in inflation expectations have generally lifted optimism across the single family housing sector despite volatility in financial markets throughout december homebuilder sentiment actually improved with all three sub components ticking higher last week we published a review of the performance of the real estate sector over the past year real estate ends worst year since 2008 despite the strongest year of gdp growth in more than a decade real estate equities delivered their worst year since the global financial crisis reits snapped their streak of nine consecutive years of positive total returns dipping 4 on the year homebuilders tumbled 30 in 2018 after surging 59 in 2017 higher mortgage rates and tax reform shifted incremental demand from the single family to the multi family markets single family housing data softened considerably in the second half of 2018 a symptom of the lingering national housing shortage home prices ended the year higher by more than 5 despite peaking supply growth multi family rents accelerated throughout the year to the extent that recent weakness has been driven by higher interest rates the outlook for 2019 looks brighter demographic trends suggest strong housing demand well into the next decade reits and housing related equities have outperformed the broader us stock market over the last 25 years the nareit all equity reit index has delivered an 11 4 average annual return while the fidelity construction housing fund fshox has delivered an 11 2 annual return since 1994 the s p 500 meanwhile delivered a 10 7 annualized rate of

offers focused exposure to 44 of the largest rental landlords in the united states renter nation has been very good to rez investors residential reits have outperformed the broader sector over nearly every recent measurement period this run of outperformance is no coincidence the effects of the historic underinvestment in new home construction continue to put upward pressure on rent growth and border housing inflation the mounting housing shortage is amplified by a large demographic wave of young millennials hitting the housing market rent growth was impressive in 2018 despite record apartment supply growth 2019 performance so far in 2019 reits have climbed more than 6 while homebuilders have jumped nearly 8 the s p 500 meanwhile has climbed nearly 7 on the year while the small

us president donald trump after announcing his decision that the us will withdraw from the landmark paris climate agreement in the rose garden of the white house photo reuters us consumer sentiment tumbled in early january to its lowest level since president donald trump was elected more than two years ago as an ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government and financial market volatility stoked fears of a sharp deceleration in economic growth the drop in confidence reported by the university of michigan on friday is the clearest sign yet that the impasse in washington over trump s demands for 5 7 billion to help build a wall on the united states border with mexico was negatively impacting the economy trump has touted high consumer confidence as an indication of the good job he is doing on the economy while consumer sentiment remains relatively high the gathering dark clouds over the economy could make households more cautious about spending leading to slower growth consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of the u s economy this report on consumer sentiment is the first concrete evidence that the economy is going to fall and fall hard if washington does not end the shutdown said chris rupkey chief economist at mufg in new york it is going to be hard to see real gdp growth of more than 1 to 1 1 2 per cent in the first quarter if the consumer goes on a buying strike the longest government shutdown in the history of the united states has left some 800 000 government workers without a paycheck private contractors working for many government agencies are also without wages the university of michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell 7 7 per cent to a reading of 90 7 this month the lowest reading since october 2016 and the steepest drop since september 2015 economists had forecast a reading of a 97 0 the survey s measure of current economic conditions decreased to 110 0 from a reading of 116 1 in december its measure of consumer expectations tumbled to a reading of 78 3 the lowest since october 2016 from 87 0 in late december the university of michigan attributed the decline in sentiment to a host of issues including the partial government shutdown the impact of tariffs instabilities in financial markets the global slowdown and the lack of clarity about monetary policies it said that half of the survey s respondents believed that these events would have a negative impact on trump s ability to focus on economic growth economists estimate the partial shutdown of the government which started on dec 22 is subtracting as much as two tenths of a per centage point from quarterly gdp growth every week other surveys have also shown an ebb in business sentiment sentiment among both households and businesses has been coming off the sugar highs which were caused by tax cut hopes at the beginning of the trump presidency said harm bandholz chief us economist at unicredit in new york u s financial markets shrugged off the fall in sentiment with investors focusing on another report on friday showing manufacturing output surged by the most in 10 months in december and on hopes for progress in the u s china trade row stocks on wall street rallied setting the three main indexes on track for their fourth week of gains the dollar rose against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell factory activity accelerates the broad based jump in manufacturing output in december reported by the federal reserve could allay fears of a sharp slowdown in factory activity manufacturing activity which accounts for about 12 per cent of the economy is slowing as some of the boost to capital spending from last year s 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades in addition a strong dollar and cooling growth in europe and china are hurting exports lower oil prices are also slowing purchases of equipment for oil and gas well drilling production at factories increased at a 2 3 per cent annualised rate in the fourth quarter after expanding at a 3 7 per cent pace in the july september period it increased 2 4 per cent in 2018 the largest gain since 2012 after advancing 1 2 per cent in 2017 while the manufacturing strength in december is a favourable signal for the economy we should keep in mind that it came after soft results in earlier months said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york a broad range of manufacturing surveys also have been weakening lately so the strength in the manufacturing output in december may prove to be short lived last month motor vehicle production surged 4 7 per cent after gaining 0 2 per cent in november excluding motor vehicles and parts manufacturing advanced a solid 0 8 per cent last month after gaining 0 1 per cent in november december s 1 1 per cent surge in manufacturing output together with a rise in mining production offset a weather related drop in utilities leading to a 0 3 per cent increase in industrial production industrial output rose 0 4 per cent in november it increased at a 3 8 per cent rate in the fourth quarter after notching a 4 7 per cent gain in the third quarter

new research shows that tinkering with public debt is bad for innovative firms in other words if the public debt grows the outlook for innovative firms suffers subsequently gdp growth declines at a later date this is what four researchers wrote in the journal of financial economics citation below most of us already know that budget consolidations after surges in government debt undermine long term growth political uncertainty high tax pressure and rising inflation are not good for the economy this new study found that growing public debt affects gdp growth negatively also because it hinders investment especially investment in innovative firms co author max croce professor of finance at bocconi university in milan italy said by affecting their cost of capital movements in government debt impact firms investment and critically innovation decisions an innovative firm is a business that has implemented or is about to implement innovation innovation involves creating inventing and producing new goods services process methods or business models innovative firms exposure to fiscal variables the authors gathered and analyzed data on 6 000 firms in the usa from 1975 to 2013 they found that about one third of the premium that innovative companies must pay their investors depends on the exposure to fiscal variables this proportion is much higher than for run of the mill businesses prof croce said this spread is huge at around 7 5 per year and it could decline to 5 if there were no fiscal uncertainty when public debt is growing interest rate spikes and uncertainty regarding future fiscal pressure make future cash flow less predictable additionally investors and managers become cautious when they have to decide which projects to back financially they choose the safest and most profitable ones riskier projects on the other hand are more likely to be avoided the net result is that four or five years later gdp growth declines this is due to a lack of innovation starts that affect the overall economy a public debt of 100 results in a 4 gdp decline after five years compared to a 60 public debt the authors refer to the 60 public debt as the normal one what s best for innovative firms prof croce said our results mean that a policy of prudential austerity that is a commitment to reduce public debt during good economic times paired with fiscal policies that prevent long run tax uncertainty could be the most effective on the one hand a systematic use of budget deficits undermines growth and on the other indebted countries risk to experience down cycles with no leeway for fiscal stimuli citation government debt and the returns to innovation m m croce thien t nguyen s raymond l schmid journal of financial economics doi

three decades in 2018 analysts in an afp poll said as the government struggles to contain ballooning debt and a bruising trade war with the united states and in a sign of the battle beijing faces in getting things back on track the survey of 13 economists also forecast expansion in the last three months to be at its weakest since the global financial crisis 10 years ago the figures are the latest in a long running trend that have prompted officials to vow they will not let the economy fall off a cliff and announce support measures including tax cuts and making it easier for banks to lend the full year figure of 6 6 percent would be the worst since 1990 when the economy was hit by outrage over the tiananmen square crackdown a year earlier the october december rate of 6 4 percent marks the slowest quarter since 2009 and indicates china faces a tough year ahead economic momentum is clearly slowing said raymond yeung economist at anz bank relations with top trading partner the united states deteriorated sharply last year after president donald trump hit roughly half of chinese imports with new tariffs in an attempt to force trade concessions from beijing the trade war with the us is on hold for now after president xi jinping and donald trump agreed a three month ceasefire while the two sides try to find a resolution meanwhile china s top negotiator is heading to washington for talks this month ahead of a march deadline to avoid further tariff hikes while a report said the us is considering lifting some levies in return for reforms by beijing while analysts say the standoff

in a report referring to off the books loans analysts say the credit tightening also made loans harder to come by for some would be car buyers which contributed to annual car sales falling for the first time in more than 20 years it is one of a raft of recent economic indicators that point to a deepening slowdown imports and exports fell in december while the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in more than two years chinese officials have announced tax cuts fee reductions and cutting red tape among other measures to stimulate the economy we propose to keep the chinese economy operating in a reasonable range which means that we allow the economic growth rate to have certain fluctuations chinese premier li keqiang told academics and businessmen this week but it cannot have major ups and major downs and it cannot fall off a cliff he said sword of damocles li vowed to help private businesses and take advantage of our massive domestic market with officials intent on not further inflating the debt bubble and the export picture dimming it has reinforced the need for china to rely on its legion of consumers to grow its economy we see a fast deceleration on investment

said while the us trade war is on hold data shows it is denting the chinese economy though analysts say much of the problem is down to government policies exports still drive a significant chunk of china s economy and washington s targeting of cars machinery electronics consumer appliances and other products have led some firms to shift production out of the country most exporters sped up their shipments across the pacific to beat the tariff deadlines with exports to the us holding up until november the trade war with the us should be regarded as a sword of damocles for the chinese economy but its impact is only really visible in the very last months of 2018 said bjorn giesbergen senior economist at rabobank china s exports fell 4 4 percent in december and shipments to the us tumbled the drag to growth from exports looks set to intensify even after the recent announcement to delay the next increase in us tariffs by 90 days said economists at fitch

during his campaign for president and since taking office donald trump has told americans that he is a friend of workers that is not true his disrespect for workers goes far beyond the 800 000 federal employees who are not receiving paychecks because of the government shutdown he initiated many of these workers are now worried about how they will meet their mortgages put food on the table and pay to see the doctor does trump even care when you try as trump did to throw more than 30 million americans off the health care they have you are not a friend of workers when you propose a budget as trump did last year that makes a 1 trillion cut to medicaid a 500 billion cut to medicare and a 72 billion cut to social security you are not a friend of workers when you take away overtime pay to millions of workers as trump did by rescinding a federal labor rule put in place by barack obama you are not a friend of workers trump likes to claim that there are union workers who support him maybe some of them do but they should understand that all his appointees to the national labor relations board do not favor workers day after day trump tells us the economy is absolutely booming the strongest we ever had and the greatest in the history of our nation that might be true for the millionaire who pay 200 000 to be members of mar a lago but it is just not true for millions of middle class and working families mosads so here is what is really happening in our economy since trump was elected the five richest americans have increased their wealth by more than 100 billion companies have announced over 1 trillion in stock buybacks last year alone in 2017 the top 10 corporate executives saw their combined compensation skyrocket by more than 60 percent from the year before reaching almost 1 9 billion on average they each received 185 million in compensation in 2017 the top 25 wall street hedge fund managers made more than 15 3 billion their highest compensation in years incredibly that amount is nearly double what all 140 000 kindergarten teachers in the united states earned last year yes the economy is doing great for the top 1 percent while the very rich get richer real wages for average workers over the past year are up by all of 1 2 percent at around 9 a week and millions of americans work longer hours for lower wages today the united states has more income and wealth inequality than at any time since the 1920s since the 2008 wall street crash 46 percent of all new income has gone to the top 1 percent chief executive officer incomes have gone up 937 percent over the past 40 years and they now make 361 times more than the average worker the most important economic reality of our time is that over the past four decades there has been an enormous transfer of income and wealth from the middle class to the richest people since 1979 the bottom 90 percent of americans have seen their very share of national income decline from 58 percent to 46 percent costing them nearly 11 000 per household as bad as income inequality is wealth inequality is even worse the top tenth of 1 percent in our nation today own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent the three richest people own more wealth than the 160 million people in the bottom half meanwhile the median household in the united states has less wealth than it did 35 years ago after adjusting for inflation and the average wealth of the bottom 40 percent is virtually zero shockingly the wealth gap between white americans and black americans has more than tripled over the past 50 years this is wrong do you know why americans are outraged frustrated and depressed do you know why they are falling to diseases of despair like opioid addiction alcoholism and suicide it has to do with a strong sense of hopelessness because the average worker makes less today than he or she made more than 40 years ago after adjusting for inflation the economy is clearly not absolutely booming when nearly 80 percent of workers live paycheck to paycheck the economy is certainly not the strongest we ever had when 43 percent of households cannot afford basic necessities without going into debt the economy is of course not the greatest in the history of our nation when workers are retiring in even worse financial shape than their parents and when half of older americans have no retirement savings the economy is no good when hundreds of thousands of young people are unable to afford to go to college more than 30 million americans have no health insurance one in five cannot afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors and 40 million live in poverty the time is long overdue to change our priorities instead of an agenda for the wealthy few we need to create an economy that works for all it is time to get to work and do it bernie sanders serves as the junior united states senator from vermont
via upfina the government shutdown is now 27 days old and shows no sign of letting up according to oxford economics the shutdown will hurt gdp growth by 0 2 if it continues until the end of the month and 0 6 if it lasts the whole quarter the longer the shutdown lasts the larger the multiplier so the impact could be larger than 0 6 the scary aspect for government workers is if the shutdown lasts until january 25th workers will miss their second paycheck this should be a cautionary reminder for everyone to have at the very minimum a few months of expenses saved in case of an emergency because of the government shutdown the business inventories and retail sales reports didn t get released the retail sales report was from december which is very important because it includes holiday sales some retailers have said sales growth dwindled at the end of the holiday shopping season we will need to wait until the shutdown ends to see how accurate that is we are now left with alternative data from private companies the redbook same store sales report signaled retail sales growth was strong in december however in the latest report for the week of january 12th growth slowed sharply from 8 9 to 6 7 this is still decent growth but it s not ideal in rate of change terms it is the weakest report since november 24th month to date sales versus the last month were down 1 7 which is the weakest reading since february 2018 the chart below shows another estimate of retail sales growth by a private company as you can see the bank of america internal data is plotted against retail sales ex autos the two lines seem to move in tune with each other this data suggests retail sales growth is slowing keep in mind this data is volatile even though it is the 3 month moving average cass freight index weakens further given the tough comparisons we mentioned in a previous article it s no surprise that the cass freight index s growth slowed in december december 2017 was a record high for the index the index actually declined 0 8 year over year which was the sharpest decline in 24 months as you can see from chart on the left this monthly report led to quarterly growth of about 2 this implies gdp growth will be lower in q4 the latest atlanta fed nowcast shows gdp growth will be 2 8 source cass information systems the chart on the right shows the index has only fallen to the high end of the range it was in from 2012 to 2017 the economy certainly isn t in a perilous situation yet this is just a slowdown the commentary above states the index was hurt by the trade war with china and the decline in wti oil the index should rebound after the trade war is resolved however that probably won t happen in january the year over year growth rate will only get worse because the january growth reading was the highest of this mini cycle we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us fed now sees the slowdown the fed s beige book showed the fed finally sees economic growth slowing it didn t see the slowdown back in october which is partially why the s p 500 fell 14 in q4 the fed s analysis of the economy isn t on the cutting edge we follow fed statements to understand monetary policy when the fed sees economic strength it implies hawkish policy is coming the current slowdown means dovish policy is coming which is good for stocks and bad for the dollar free access to objective insights receive exclusive financial economic insights ad free as you can see from the chart below the fed has started using the words weak or slow more often the usage is still relatively low which means the fed needs to catch up to be in tune with the economy the next fed meeting in january is interesting because of how much less drama there is than there was for the last meeting prior to the december meeting investors were wondering if there would be a rate hike given the stock market volatility and slowdown investors were also worried about the guidance for 2019 now we know the fed won t hike in january as there is a 0 chance of a hike according to the fed funds futures market there shouldn t be much of a change to guidance because the fed has all year to take the 2 hikes it guided for in 2019 off the table there is currently only a 13 9 chance the fed will hike at all this year core cpi estimate the slight decline in core cpi in december will allow the fed to be dovish on january 30th according to renaissance macro research the recent decline in the dollar index and the modest increase in consumer import prices led by non auto consumer goods will cause core cpi to increase slightly the estimated 0 2 increase in consumer goods import prices implies a boost in core goods cpi if the core cpi reading were to increase sharply it would put the fed in a more nuanced position of suggesting a hike however the more likely slight increase probably won t change anything major dollar decline coming as we mentioned a slight increase in core goods cpi isn t enough to get the fed to hike rates again however if the dollar starts to plummet the situation could change as you can see from the chart below merrill lynch surveyed fund managers believe the dollar is overvalued this is the highest percentage that believe the dollar is overvalued since 2002 from 2002 to 2008 the dollar index fell from about 113 to about 84 it s not just this one major movement that was correctly called if you pair a chart of the dollar with this survey you can see it has predicted the major moves in the dollar correctly conclusion the stock market is rallying blissfully as we are unaware of how strong the economy is doing because many of the government reports haven t been released based on the recent redbook and bank of america data it appears the

oddleifson chief executive officer please go ahead christopher oddleifson chief executive officer thank you andrea and happy new year everyone and thank you for joining us this morning with me as always is rob cozzone our chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking we ended 2018 on a high note with strong financial performance including m a related charges operating net income grew to 35 9 million or 1 29 per share nicely above both prior quarter and prior year s results once again strong fundamentals led the way rob will cover the quarter in greater detail shortly i d like to focus my comments today on the full year just completed we produced record earnings for the sixth consecutive year in 2018 highlights included operating eps growth of 40 13 growth in total revenues a 31 basis point improvement in net interest margin fueled by our advantageous balance sheet positioning mid single digits organic loan growth ongoing robust core deposit generation including 10 organic growth in demand deposits disciplined expense management that drove our efficiency ratio down to the mid 50s percentages continued stellar credit quality with lower non performing asset levels versus a year ago and a full year loss rate of a mere 2 basis points rising returns with an operating roi and roe reaching 1 6 and 13 1 respectively by the fourth quarter and a steadily rising tangible book value per share that grew another 12 last year inclusive of the additional goodwill we absorbed so all in all 2018 was a very good year beyond the numbers the rockland trust franchise continued to progress in many ways the highlight of course is reaching agreement to acquire blue hills bank a 2 7 billion community bank which will significantly expand our presence in the greater boston market along with providing a commanding position on nantucket island this is a profitable well run company conversion planning efforts are moving along smoothly and the transaction is expected to be earnings accretive and close in the first half of this year we also recently closed on the milford national bank acquisition which gives us more presence in contiguous worcester county and further extends our footprint within the state this dovetails nicely with the commercial banking and wealth management office we just opened in worcester which is headed up by a very experienced local market leader our investment management business continues to build and grow and is weaning much success in providing wealth management services to our acquired customer franchises we just crossed the 500 million mark in assets under management in the cape cod market and we see great opportunities arising out of our sizable presence in the neighboring islands of martha s vineyard and prospectively nantucket we also just opened a new branch in the boston financial district that we re excited about given how many of our customers work in the area it is a modern design and comes equipped with video teller services and a real highlight of opening day was that our first two customers were members of families that s honored rockland trust 112 years ago we also continue to track and recruit senior experienced professionals into our businesses including commercial banking and investment management who are steadily gaining traction in new business generation and we continue to make investments in new products technology customer convenience security and so on to keep pace with the rapidly changing customer preferences and market dynamics heading into the new year our top priority is the synced integration of blue hills bank given our track record in this area we re quite confident as to its success and eagerly look forward to bringing our two companies together beyond that we have other key initiatives such as online account opening which is imminent expansions of private banking services ongoing modernization of our branch network and increased utilization of sales force so another busy year is expected the recent volatility in the equity market is worth noting trade discussions in a prolonged government shutdown have led to increased uncertainty driving volatility concerned over future growth it s unclear how all this will play out over the next year but the underlying economic fundamentals continue to be strong the general consensus that gdp will be in the mid 2s for q4 inflation is right around the fed s target of 2 and national unemployment is still hovering around historic lows at 3 9 locally the massachusetts economy is even stronger through the third quarter the economy ph has been growing at rates north of 3 state unemployment levels are at 3 4 and at boston area unemployment is an incredible low 2 4 much of this is driven by the consumer and business spending which as the most recent measure was up over 7 from the previous year despite all our progress over these many years we re well aware that none of this comes easy and the bar keeps getting raised given the many challenges facing our industry competition for loans remains intense deposit costs are rising new entrants such as the fintechs are encroaching the pace of technology change is relentless and the macro environment is a bit uncertain what we never lose sight of is the customer and how we best earn his or her trust that is how we approach everything we do we feel we re up to the task and we re quite confident ph to sustaining our success discipline and focus continue to form the pillars of our strategy we ll have to capitalize on our competitive advantages and growing brand awareness and resist allocating our scarce resources to peripheral endeavors we intend to remain flexible nimble and opportunistic to seize on opportunities as they are presented so once again i wish to salute all my rockland trust colleagues and their commitment and enthusiasm and tireless energy they bring to rockland trust each and every day they are by far our most valuable resource and is a source of great pride that rockland trust was named number one again among the large financial services firms in the latest best places to work survey by the boston globe and lastly i d like to acknowledge two of our retiring directors john spurr and carl ribeiro who both reached the mandatory retirement age for directors during the fourth quarter of 2018 i greatly thank them for all their stewardship and guidance they provided to the company and to me for many years i wish them very well that concludes my comments rob robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking thank you chris and good morning before i review fourth quarter and full year earnings in more detail some quick additional notes on the acquisition front as chris remarks the integration of milford national bank and trust is complete and thanks to our exceptional colleagues the systems and customer conversion was virtually seamless the work to further deepen and expand former milford relationships has begun in earnest the acquisition added 293 million in loans 278 million in deposits both at fair value as well as 161 million in assets under administration cost reductions related to the milford transaction are substantially complete with the final reductions occurring with the closure of our legacy milford branch on march 31 blue hill s bank integration plans are well under way and expectations for financial outcomes and customer inroads remain intact this week the blue hills bancorp shareholders approved the merger independent shareholder voting will occur next week we ve received a very warm welcome from both employees and customers and are excited to join forces with an extremely capable team the blue hills transaction is expected to close sometime in the second quarter now turning to earnings inclusive of merger and acquisition charges of 8 million in the quarter net income and diluted earnings per share were 29 9 million and 1 07 respectively for the final quarter of 2018 for the year net income and diluted earnings per share increased 39 and 38 respectively to 121 6 million and 4 40 full year operating net income and operating earnings per share which are adjusted for merger charges and other non core items increased 42 and 40 respectively while fourth quarter operating net income and earnings per share increased an impressive 47 and 45 respectively over the prior year not surprisingly all of these earnings measures were records for the company solid earnings results continue to drive growth in tangible book value per share which increased another 3 7 in the quarter to 28 57 at december 31 despite having absorbed the milford acquisition profitability ratios for the fourth quarter were sustained at very healthy levels with an operating return on average assets of 1 66 and an operating return on tangible common equity north of 18 organic loan growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with total loans up slightly more than 5 annualized within the commercial portfolio c i continues to lead the charge as our recent hires of experienced lenders within corporate banking and floor plan are beginning to pay dividends traditional c i activity was also quite strong during the quarter as stated on prior calls pricing and terms for commercial real estate lending remain challenging despite higher mortgage rates the demand for home purchase financing continues to derive solid growth in the residential real estate category which was up 3 2 organically during the quarter for the full year total loans grew 4 organically in line with earlier expectations organic deposit growth was strong at 2 48 or 10 annualized however growth in savings and interest checking balances benefited from the transition of customary purchase accounts during the quarter as that product offering was eliminated customer repurchase balances which are reflected in the borrowing section of the balance sheet were 141 2 million as of september 30 solid organic demand deposit growth continued in the quarter up 6 annualized and was very strong for the full year up almost 10 long term and continuous emphasis on establishing core deposit relationship was again reflected in our cost of deposits for the quarter which was up only 4 basis points including the impact of the milford acquisition a low deposit beta and healthy loan betas contributed to 11 basis points of net interest margin expansion in the fourth quarter as the favorable behavior of libor leading up to the december fed increase bullied ph loan yields the impact of purchase accounting on net interest income was consistent quarter over quarter at approximately 650 000 however higher interest recoveries did benefit the margin by approximately 1 basis point with the full benefit of the december fed increase net interest margin should expand again in the first quarter of 2019 with the exception of mortgage banking income which was negatively impacted by seasonal declines in volume all core fee income categories experienced growth during the quarter other non interest income which was up 40 benefited from a 1 1 million gain on the sale of a previously closed branch we continually look for opportunities to enhance our network of branches and atms during 2018 we consolidated two branches and opened two including our first in downtown boston just last month non interest expense excluding m a charges increased more than anticipated during the quarter the most significant drivers of the outsized increase lie within the other non interest expense category which was up 18 3 and includes a 1 1 million loss on equity securities and higher loan workout costs associated with the restructuring of a non performing loan the favorable non performing loan restructuring as part of bankruptcy reorganization resulted in a 26 million increase to troubled debt restructures during the quarter this does not represent an increase in problem assets as this credit was first placed on non accrual at the end of 2016 and remains there asset quality metrics improved again with only 142 000 of net charge offs or 1 basis point of loans annualized as such provision for loan losses of 1 2 million was primarily needed to support loan growth let me now turn to guidance for 2019 i will first provide you with our outlook excluding the impact of the blue hills bancorp acquisition and will then remind you of our financial expectations for that transaction loan and deposit growth barring significant competitive changes should be in line with recent experience of mid single digit growth and generally consistent with economic growth assuming no further rate increases the full year net interest margin should be 10 basis points to 15 basis points higher than 2018 with deposit costs increasing another 3 basis points to 5 basis points in the first quarter both non interest income and non interest expense are expected to increase at a low to mid single digit rate when excluding non core items although we expect the credit picture for us to remain very benign in the short term eventual deterioration is likely inevitable and with anticipated growth in pre tax income and the expiration of some new market tax credits the tax rate should increase to approximately 25 in 2019 as a reminder earnings growth in the first quarter of every year is tempered by the increase in payroll related costs and a seasonal slowdown in customer related activity as for the blue hills acquisition should it close early in the second quarter we expect 2019 earnings accretion of approximately 4 net interest margin contraction beginning in q2 of approximately 20 basis points barring a likely deleveraging of the balance sheet and modest accretion to tangible book value per share we look forward to continued progress here on many fronts that concludes my comments chris christopher oddleifson chief executive officer great thank you rob and andrea we re ready for some questions questions and answers operator we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions and our first question comes from laurie hunsicker of compass point please go ahead laurie hunsicker compass point analyst i just wondered if we could start with the non interest expense line i mean that included the 1 1 million loss in equity securities but it was still running about 1 5 million higher than where it s been in the last couple of quarters is that the new run rate or is there anything else non recurring in that figure robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking no there s a couple other things in there laurie i mentioned in my comments the increase in loan workout cost that was about 400 000 maybe a little north of 400 000 all of that associated with the restructuring of that 26 million non performing credit that i described and that is all very positive developments as that company came out of bankruptcy or was reorganized under bankruptcy so money well spent there in addition we had increased our incentive accruals by about 0 5 million associated with our strong performance and a couple of other kind of nuancing items but many of which are unique in nature or one time in nature laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay and then the tax rate i just want to make sure that i heard you correctly 25 which is a higher guide than previously which i believe was 23 is there something different there robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking no i haven t guided to 2019 tax rate laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay and then just so i m clear typically your first quarter tax run rate is below where you are for the duration is that still the case robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking well it all comes down to what happens with equity compensation laurie hunsicker compass point analyst equity comp robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking what executives do there so you have some discrete items that have historically hit in the first quarter that are pretty difficult to predict but when stock performance is good you tend to see that benefit laurie hunsicker compass point analyst got it okay and then just talking about margin with blue hills rolled in and i know roughly i mean my calculation i think it was a 23 basis point drag onto margin with that rolled in absent a restructure i just want to make sure i heard you correctly you said margin would be down 20 basis points absent a restructure robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking that s correct laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay and does that include accretion income robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking that would include accretion income but that s beginning that s not full year it s a beginning in the second quarter laurie hunsicker compass point analyst correct and so if i m thinking about accretion income and it s been running about 3 basis points on your margin is 10 basis points or so a good number or how should we be thinking about that robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking the guidance i ve given is 5 million to 6 million annually associated with the blue hills transaction laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great that s helpful okay and then if you can just update us in terms of how much in one time charges are remaining i ve realized mnb you re almost done i think on one time charges and blue hills obviously took a substantial bite but how much in after tax charges still remain if we just look at those two combined robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking well milford is complete laurie hunsicker compass point analyst so no more one time charges there robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking no more one time charges associated if there is it s very modest in terms of blue hills we ve only taken about 2 million of the blue hills charges so far so versus our estimate of 36 million pre tax we ve only taken 2 million laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay so on an after tax basis we re still at whatever 20 million 20 million or so 20 million 21 million to go robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes that s about right yes laurie hunsicker compass point analyst okay great and then chris last question to you can you just talk to us generally obviously we ve seen your stock price come down we ve seen all bank stock prices come down in the last four months but you still have one of the best stock currencies out there can you just talk generally in this current environment how you re approaching m a here and just what you re seeing generally christopher oddleifson chief executive officer yes laurie i probably sound like kind of a broken record but things haven t changed as much so it s very opportunistic i think and it was so few publicly traded banks that are left in our marketplace it s really really hard to sort of predict any sort of like number so the i just think that they we ll be at the table and so when a board is interested in selling we ll be at the table we ll be we ll definitely go as a desirable acquirer because of our currency and our track record and we talk about what we re going to do and then we do what we d say we re going to do and we re very straightforward and i will also add that in the last 15 years we ve done what 10 acquisitions 10 bank acquisitions that s one every year and a half and sometimes they come in quick succession and sometimes they are a couple of years but it seems like there is a steady i know past results are no prediction of the future but i d like to say that there will be other opportunities that present themselves over the next number of years and we ll be able to take advantage of that that s about is all i can say right now laurie hunsicker compass point analyst great that s helpful thank you very much robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking thanks laurie operator our next question comes from brody preston of piper jaffray please go ahead brody preston piper jaffray analyst good morning chris good morning rob how are you robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes doing great thanks brody preston piper jaffray analyst yes i just wanted to go back and maybe touch on the margin trajectory a little bit understand that maybe ex blue hills you said 10 basis points to 15 basis points up and then bhbk adds a 20 basis point drag ex a balance sheet remix i guess i want to touch on the balance sheet remix what are some of the variables you re considering when you think about the balance sheet remix and the potential upside to the margin robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes i m sure you re familiar with the funding side of the balance sheet at blue hills which is a pretty typical of converted thrifts but atypical of how we ve positioned our balance sheet over time so given the high amount of brokered cds as well as home loan bank advances and some of the lower yielding securities as well as residential arms that are also lower yielding we think there s an opportunity for a meaningful delever and i ll provide much more color on next quarter s call as to what we think we can get accomplished there and maybe even have already completed some of it with help from the folks at blue hills so that is to say that there are likely several hundred million of assets and liabilities that can be eliminated with a fairly modest impact on net interest income brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay all right and then i guess maybe if i could touch on i guess more near term margin trends i guess in the third quarter of this last year we had libor sort of flattened off because it had run up a little bit ahead of itself in the second quarter and i guess maybe so far i know it s early in the first quarter but it s been relatively flat so this if this trend in libor sort of continues would you expect to have more modest nim expansion in the first quarter relative to what you experienced in the fourth quarter robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking absolutely multiple speakers there is no longer an expectation of a march increase with libor at 2 51 2 52 ish if it happens to stay there then the average increase in libor over the quarter will be much less than the average increase we experienced in the fourth quarter so certainly less expansion than what we have just experienced brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay and so i guess that the nim guide on a stand alone basis of 10 basis points to 15 basis points what are you assuming there for rate hikes if any robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking no further rate hikes and just to remind you the 10 basis points to 15 basis points is year over year expansion excluding blue hills so full year 2019 versus to full year 2018 without additional increases and without the impact of blue hills brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay great and then i guess i wanted to i guess maybe go back to the non interest expense line item a little bit touching on the equity security losses i understand that they re probably hard to predict but i guess i wanted to get to the nature of that line item i know there was an accounting change earlier in the year that sort of shifted the losses and the gains to the p l is i guess are those losses or gains is that more tied to the broader movements in the equity market robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes those are tied to movements in the equity market and those are equity securities used to fund our serp liability however we have made a decision unfortunately a little bit too late to put those investments in slightly more conservative and less volatile investment so we should see less volatility as we move forward into 2019 brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay great and i guess maybe going to the deposit front i think last quarter you said that you expected maybe a 4 basis point to 6 basis point increase in the cost of deposits this quarter and the guide for 1q is 3 basis points to 5 basis points which i know is around the same ballpark but it s slightly less and just from sort of what we ve seen in the market we ve seen some i guess maybe some higher cost specials come out of the market is that consistent with what you re seeing or is deposit competition as stiff as it s ever been robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking i d say on an anecdotal basis i ve seen some modest pullback brody i think there are still plenty of options out there for consumers and businesses as well to take advantage of maybe a couple of banks have pulled back now that the probability of additional increases is more muted but the part of the reduction in my guidance for q1 is related to our experience as you said i guided to 4 basis points to 6 basis points last quarter and we came in at 4 basis points because we continue to have a very healthy behavior among our deposit base including greater growth in the demand deposit category which allows us to reduce the higher cost categories or not grow them as quickly and so i m confident that we can continue to do that brody preston piper jaffray analyst all right great and i guess i just have a few sort of higher level questions left i want to know if you could provide us with any updates on cecl and if you have an idea right now as to whether or not directionally your reserve is going to need to go up or down and what are some of the factors driving that because from a quantitative perspective your losses have been extremely low robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking i would say directionally our expectation is that it will need to go up i m not prepared to provide you any more quantitative guidance than that in terms of our preparedness we are moving along rapidly and expect to begin to run a parallel cecl model in february our all of our model inputs have been collected and loaded into software that we re using so we re feeling very good about our progress there and in the coming quarters i ll be able to provide you with some more quantitative guidance brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay great and then you guys do have significant i guess there s a significant amount of wealth down in the nantucket martha s vineyard area which is relatively close to the cape and just in reviewing the map there are some opportunity zones that have been designated down in that area and so i wanted to know if you ve had any discussions with some of your wealthier clients on maybe making opportunities on investments or if you see any type of opportunity to capitalize on that robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking well i m not aware of any of those discussions it s not something that we ve pursued brody brody preston piper jaffray analyst okay great and then last one from me credit is sort of in top of mind for the industry for the last quarter or so and your credit obviously remains pristine but wanted to get your thoughts rob and chris on what s sort of the one thing on this front that keeps you up at night christopher oddleifson chief executive officer well as far as we can see it looks like a benign environment the thing that worries me is that i know the business cycle has not been repealed i know i believe inaudible and i believe there ll be a deterioration sometime in the future but we re not seeing anything yet i should point out also we typically see on the one hand environment deteriorates and our smaller business banking loans begin to have some weakness that looks like a strong portfolio too so it all indicators i mean if you just were sort of looking at the data i ll say we re in great shape and so when you lift your head up and you sort of look around the world and you think about the 10 year expansion you begin to get a little nervous so we re not seeing anything brody preston piper jaffray analyst great thank you very much guys appreciate it robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes thanks brody operator operator instructions our next question comes from collyn gilbert of kbw please go ahead collyn gilbert kbw analyst thanks good morning guys rob so just starting on your the nim comment the 10 basis point to 15 basis point of expansion year over year exclusive of blue hills and no rate hikes is the expectation for that type of expansion is that coming from a remixing of the assets that you re intending to perhaps have happened or is it just kind of natural repricing given the maturation schedule of what you re seeing in the book robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking i just want to be clear collyn that guidance is relative to full year 2018 collyn gilbert kbw analyst yes robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking okay so full year 2018 is 3 91 10 basis points to 15 basis points puts us at 4 01 to 4 06 for full year excluding blue hills we just finished the quarter right around the high end of that range we can expect further expansion in q1 but should we get no additional increases in fed funds libor prime then we would expect the margin to experience some pressure due to increased funding costs in the remaining quarters of the year so that s how i get to that 10 basis points to 15 basis points of core expansion collyn gilbert kbw analyst okay all right that s helpful and then just on the boston initiative maybe if you could just give us an update on how i know you just open that office but how that s trending and sort of how you re thinking about your efforts there if you think that there will be a need or what would cause a need to perhaps open another branch there but just talk a little bit about your the downtown effort and how that s going christopher oddleifson chief executive officer i ll start and rob can add to it our primary driver to opening a branch down there really is to serve our existing customers who commute into the city and service our existing commercial clients down there i want to remind you that we ve been doing business in boston on the commercial side for over 20 years and wealth management for a number of years and we just we opened a commercial banking and wealth management office around the corner from our new branch about five years ago so this branch is really sort of filling into support all those efforts we also in the financial district see some incremental business opportunities that we can leverage and the conversations are going well we ve opened up a number of accounts we are meeting our expectations in terms of thinking about whether we would expand to sort of a full network in downtown boston i think that s probably relatively unlikely that is a the most competitive market we re ever in we think there s a lot of opportunity outside the boston market that may be a more cost effective to get at and so thinking about how we service our existing customers will probably drive most of our decisions rob robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes i would just add that as part of the blue hills transaction we will also have the seaport location so we ll have essentially two i ll characterize as downtown boston locations in the very active areas of boston and we think for certainly for the medium term that s sufficient i d also remind you that our approach to going into boston was a very economic approach our branch is only 1 400 square feet we have reduced staff because we ve added two video teller machines in that branch so that customers can be served by a centralized video teller team that sits in our call center so we thought that was the right approach given the strategic considerations that we were working with collyn gilbert kbw analyst okay that s very helpful and then just shifting over to fees can you just remind me again what percent of your wealth revenues are tied to the equity markets the value of the equity markets robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking equity versus fixed income collyn gilbert kbw analyst yes robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking let s see so i think about 25 of our aum is our core equity portfolio we manage ourselves 25 is bonds and the remaining 50 are mutual funds christopher oddleifson chief executive officer primarily equities so it s probably somewhere between 60 to 70 of our assets under management are some form of equity investment collyn gilbert kbw analyst okay all right that s helpful christopher oddleifson chief executive officer and then we have transactional fees collyn so not all of our revenue that you see on the investment management line is associated purely with managing assets the majority of it is but we also have insurance revenues and annuity revenues that are more transactional in nature and not impacted by fluctuations in the market collyn gilbert kbw analyst okay that s helpful and then just in terms of mortgage maybe rob if you could just kind of give us your outlook there i know you ve been you guys have done a great job in building out the jumbo business portfolio growth was better this quarter because of that but just how you re thinking about and i m thinking more on the mortgage sale side mortgage banking side going forward robert d cozzone chief financial officer and head of consumer and business banking yes well certainly going forward as we combine with blue hills we will be selling a higher percentage of our production blue hills has meaningful mortgage originations in fact they originate more than we do on an annual basis and the bulk of that is sold into the secondary market so i would expect on a combined basis that we ll continue to see kind of mid to high single digit growth in our residential portfolio in 2019 but much higher percentage of our combined production will be sold into the secondary market collyn gilbert kbw analyst okay that s helpful okay that s all i had thanks guys operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to chris oddleifson for any closing remarks christopher oddleifson chief executive officer thanks andrea and thank you everybody for joining us and we look

on donald trump s first visit to beijing as president in late 2017 as trade tensions with china were building the chinese laid the hospitality on thick there were tours of the forbidden city visits to museums housing priceless antiquities and elaborate banquets with president xi jinping and the rest of the chinese leadership when it came to substance beijing signed letters of intent for deals with u s companies ostensibly worth 250 billion and xi pressed trump on the value of a series of high level biannual talks between washington and beijing known as the strategic and economic dialogue robert lighthizer along for the visit as trump s u s trade representative ustr was not happy begun during the george w bush administration and continued under president barack obama the sed as it became known in washington was exactly the sort of open ended gabfest that beijing loved and light hizer loathed he believed these sorts of confabs were designed to string the u s along and avoid dealing with the trade problems at hand strategic and economic bullshit he once called it after the second day of talks lighthizer met with trump privately you re being played he told the president according to multiple white house sources the assessment jibed with trump s gut instinct as well he reassured lighthizer that he would keep trade as the focal point of discussions with beijing moving forward ever since that visit lighthizer has become the most influential voice in trump s ear when it comes to what is arguably the administration s most pressing issue trade relations with the world s second largest economy to the dismay of wall street and much of establishment washington neither of which wants to see trade with china seriously disrupted trump s inclination is to be tough on beijing policy wonks in both parties love to deride trump s instincts as the impulses of an accidental know nothing president lighthizer s presence at his side makes that a far more difficult argument robert lighthizer robert lighthizer photo illustration by gluekit robert lighthizer by tephanie lecocq afp getty as far back as 2010 well before trade tensions with china consumed washington lighthizer wrote a lengthy scathingly detailed and so it happened largely prescient piece for the u s china economic and security review commission a group mandated by congress to present an annual report on the security aspects of washington s economic relations with the people s republic he lampooned the wildly rosy assessments of what china s accession to the world trade organization would mean for the u s economy and for manufacturing workers in particular he pointed out the various policies in beijing that distort trade penalize foreign companies and tilt the playing field in china toward homegrown companies he warned of industrial policies that were designed to promote the development of chinese technology again at the expense of foreign competitors today this is standard fare for the policy mills in washington seminars and conferences abound at places like the center for strategic and international studies or the brookings institution mulling what to do about trade with china remarkably there is now widespread consensus at least around the trump administration s which is to say lighthizer s diagnosis of the problem has quite fairly identified a series of problems in the with china acknowledges william reinsch a former clinton administration official who s now a senior adviser at csis how to best respond is another matter when trump appointed lighthizer the free trade purists principally the fortune 500 and their lobbyists as well as powerful agriculture interests knew they had a challenge in their view he s a protectionist hack lighthizer worked for years as a trade lawyer at skadden arps slate meagher flom the prominent wall street law firm where he represented american steel producers in a variety of cases involving unfair trade practices by foreign countries such as dumping goods below cost in the u s market critics saw him taking the book of the old clients who made him wealthy and since trump is a protectionist they argue lighthizer is abetting his boss s worst instincts and risking an ever more damaging trade conflict between the world s two financial powers us commerce secretary wilbur ross answers questions at a round table briefing in hong kong on september 27 2017 ross on september 27 said he was optimistic over talks between president donald trump and chinese us commerce secretary wilbur ross answers questions at a round table briefing in hong kong on september 27 2017 ross on september 27 said he was optimistic over talks between president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping in november as they seek to reduce a trade deficit more anthony wallace afp getty the caricature mildly amuses lighthizer because he came to his trade hawk status through one of the most politically conventional paths imaginable his first tour in government was as a staffer on the senate finance committee under bob dole the mild mannered republican from kansas who ran against and lost to bill clinton in 1996 he then went to work as a deputy at the agency he now runs the ustr during the reagan administration he was recruited by and reported to another milquetoast moderate former tennessee senator bill brock and served an administration headed by one of the most pro free trade candidates of the 20th century lighthizer considers himself a rock ribbed republican who believes in free trade he says always have he s said like reagan however he is not dogmatic about it born and raised in ashtabula ohio he saw a vibrant steel industry the cornerstone of the region s economy get decimated by offshoring in the 1970s and 80s lighthizer s willingness to deviate from republican trade orthodoxy he says stems from getting hit in the head by reality during his first tour at the ustr the major trade problems came from japan both formal and informal trade barriers made japan all but impenetrable to imports at the same time it built competitive companies in key industries flooding american markets with automobiles steel and semiconductors u s companies were getting crushed by japanese competition back then dogmatic free traders seemed to think the best course was to sit back and take it as clyde prestowitz a former reagan era commerce department official puts it but reagan was willing to use a powerful tool congress had given the executive branch in 1974 the ability to bring unilateral trade action against foreign competitors thought to be unfairly injuring domestic competitors bypassing what was then known as the general agreement on tariff and trade the forerunner to the wto lighthizer was central to putting together these so called super 301 cases named after the section of the 1974 trade law against japan they threatened tariffs on japanese produced goods in order to provide relief to a range of u s industries including semiconductors and satellites the moves infuriated tokyo its trade minister at the time decried washington s mafia tactics but they got japan s attention in semiconductors for example the u s and japan agreed to a series of measures that would increase over time japan s purchase of american made computer chips while also implementing a complex pricing mechanism that was intended to prevent japanese dumping of chips in the u s market that is selling them below cost the u s separately pressured japan s car industry to assemble automobiles in the u s rather than export them which would create jobs in the u s and reduce the bilateral trade deficit with tokyo today there are 24 japanese car plants in the u s as far as lighthizer was concerned the exceptions to the reagan administration s pro trade policies were effective his critics have said because japan a key u s ally did a series of trade deals with washington to help defuse a bigger crisis lighthizer is naïvely assuming china emphatically not a u s ally will do the same he declines to compare the two situations but ustr staffers and people who have worked with lighthizer stress that he s anything but naïve he understands that the case of china is more complicated than japan was in the 1980s he has said the key to a successful trade deal is to know where the leverage is and in this case he believes it s keeping the pressure on china at a time when it is arguably more economically vulnerable than the u s given its rapidly slowing economy that doesn t mean he s slaphappy about tariffs and the risks they pose to u s business and the stock market says a source who sees lighthizer almost daily nor is he necessarily all about the bilateral trade deficit the key longer term issue as the ustr has laid out in its 301 complaint about china is persuading beijing that there will be significant consequences if it tries to build national champions in key high tech industries at the exclusion of foreign competition via state subsidies intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer from the u s and other developed countries if doing so inflicts some economic pain in china thanks to tariffs and limits chinese direct investment in the u s while also causing u s stock investors to head for the exits in fear of a trade war lighthizer appears to be fine with that trade experts such as reinsch say that tack risks disaster the question is can you come up with a cure that s not worse than the disease he says are you going to crater the two biggest economies in the world in order to get china to alter its behavior on cybertheft and forced technology transfer and the protection of its domestic companies are we really going to get china to upend the way it does business is there a way to do that without causing a crisis in the corridors of the trump administration those in fact have been key questions asked by treasury secretary steve mnuchin and national economic adviser larry kudlow who constantly remind the president that his beloved stock market does not like trade conflict they favor a lighter touch than lighthizer who wants to keep the pressure on beijing for the moment lighthizer s view is closer to trump s though all involved are acutely aware of how easily the president can change his mind the temporary suspension of tariffs on beijing which trump agreed to after dining with xi last month at the g20 in buenos aires argentina expires march 1 if trump balks at a deal with china that doesn t give the u s all that it seeks and he reimposes tariffs it is likely that lighthizer s view will have carried the day whether that will be a good thing or not is an entirely different question bp

the united states is pushing for regular reviews of china s progress on pledged trade reforms as a condition for a trade deal and could again resort to tariffs if it deems beijing has violated the agreement according to sources briefed on negotiations to end the trade war between the two nations a continuing threat of tariffs hanging over commerce between the world s two largest economies would mean a deal would not end the risk of investing in businesses or assets that have been affected by the trade war the threat of tariffs is not going away even if there is a deal said one of three sources briefed on the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity

essve tech in alpharetta says she was days away from buying another manufacturing company with an sba backed loan for several million dollars when the shutdown arrived it is extremely frustrating i have spent money on attorneys accountants and real estate surveys and now it s just stuck the longer it drags on the higher the risk that the deal won t close georgia s vast farm country has been particularly hard hit by the shutdown after an already tough 2018 the u s department of agriculture is one of nine cabinet level departments that has been shuttered that has leftmany farmers unable to collect on earlier claims or file new ones for disaster assistance for crop losses or damage caused by october s hurricane michael the same goes for tariff relief from the trade war with china farmers

resident dodged one disaster when she harvested her crop of peanuts before michael stormed into southwest georgia but chinese tariffs have hit her soybean and corn sales and recent heavy rains damaged and kept her from harvesting some of her cotton still hanging from bolls and degrading with every day of exposure to intransigent weather devane would typically go to the local agriculture department s farm service agency to start loan processes and get crop forecasts for next year but the shutdown foiled those plans a lot of the smaller farmers are not going to be able to get a loan for this year she said and we don t know what to do the trump administration on wednesday announced some fsa offices would reopen for three days to perform certain limited services for farmers and ranchers mostly cleaning up paperwork from last year there was no immediate word on when they would start new loans or process disaster assistance the white house also has tried to lessen the impact of the shutdown in recent days by calling back thousands of other federal workers earlier deemed non essential that includes more than half of the internal revenue service s furloughed employees who are needed to process tax returns and will work without pay for now federal contractors go without transportation slows a sprawling ecosystem of federal contractors for shuttered agencies are getting pinched

normally during the shutdown a spokeswoman said but ongoing transit projects are a different story marta pays for such projects with local funding and then requests federal reimbursement which can t happen with transportation shuttered that could force the transit system to choose eventually between using reserves or selling bonds or delaying projects in savannah officials say it s business as

open this photo in gallery manulife insurance s toronto headquarters is photographed on sept 27 2017 christopher katsarov the globe and mail manulife financial corp and power financial corp have more than a few things in common but here s the big one these former stock market superstars have done poorly since the eruption of the credit crisis underperforming other canadian financial companies by a wide margin and leaving long term investors exasperated from their peak in october 2007 manulife shares are down 52 per cent without factoring in dividends power financial shares are down 36 per cent from their high point in may 2007 the pain for investors is widespread practically every canadian owns at least one of the two stumbling giants through their mutual funds pension funds or stock portfolios compare their performance with the biggest banks royal bank of canada is up 63 per cent from its precrisis high in 2007 toronto dominion bank is up nearly 90 per cent the shares of all of the big six domestic banks are higher in fact suggesting that a business model based on lending money may be more resilient than one that relies on selling insurance and mutual funds if you had invested in manulife or power financial five years ago as the north american economic recovery was gaining momentum a fine backdrop for most companies you would still have earned almost nothing interest rate increases which are supposed to light up insurance profits have failed to gain much traction some of their peers have struggled as well over the past decade but the shift is particularly striking for manulife and power financial because of the stark contrast with their go go years when they could do no wrong manulife s share price rose nearly fivefold between 2000 and 2007 soon after it demutualized emerging as a dynamic global force during a period of industry consolidation power financial rose more than twelvefold between 1995 and 2007 instilling the belief that this was a stock you could embrace for life alongside the company s controlling shareholders the desmarais family now cut to the disappointment life insurance has lost some of its importance with consumers tighter financial regulations are raising operating costs and persistently low rates are eating into the profit margins both companies have made acquisitions that haven t panned out and they face threats from the growing popularity of cheap investment products such as exchange traded funds etfs which are squeezing the fees of asset managers it seems to me that the business model is headed for oblivion on an incredibly expensive distribution network which can only function by selling really expensive products said larry bates the former global head of debt capital markets at royal bank of canada and more recently the author of beat the bank the canadian guide to simply successful investing others say manulife and power financial suffer from too much complexity and that comes from pros who know their way around corporate balance sheets but who also say that the actuarial assumptions that underpin the companies operations can be black boxes these companies are very difficult to analyze said stephen takacsy chief investment officer and lead portfolio manager at lester asset management in montreal early in his career he worked alongside none other than dominic d alessandro who would later become manulife s chief executive from 1994 to 2009 yet even with this insider s perspective mr takacsy refers to companies such as manulife as big multiheaded monsters open this photo in gallery roy gori chief executive officer of manulife stefen chow globe and mail no one minded the complexity when the stocks were making investors rich now it s just one more reason to stay away not everyone is though low stock valuations are raising hopes among some analysts and investors that manulife and power financial are bargains poised to regain some affection from the market manulife made a couple of lists of top stock picks for 2019 and top executives at both companies believe they have the right strategy for winning back investors headwinds are par for the course roy gori ceo of manulife said in an interview i remain very confident that as we continue to deliver and execute against the priorities that we ve set that we re going to see the stock price reflect the true value of the company so what has to go right for manulife and power financial to shake off the past decade and return to their winning ways if you push aside the brain numbing actuarial science the insurance business is actually straightforward customers who want to protect themselves financially against illness or death pay premiums to insurance companies the companies invest the money largely in government and corporate bonds so that they can meet their obligations to policy holders down the road problem is low interest rates have diminished the yields on bonds which comprise 51 per cent of manulife s asset mix and 72 per cent of the asset mix at great westlifeco inc the insurance holding of power financial even today following a succession of rate hikes since 2017 the bank of canada s overnight rate sits at just 1 75 per cent versus 4 5 per cent in 2007 the prospect of low investment returns influences insurers liabilities the premiums they charge and the products they offer and it weighs heavily on their profits in 2007 manulife generated operating income adjusted for unusual gains and losses of 6 7 billion in 2017 its operating income was 30 per cent lower at about 4 7 billion over the same 10 year period profit margins declined from 19 4 per cent to just 8 4 per cent moving toward stocks and other investments might juice insurers returns but it exposes them to risks tied to the stock market so they re stuck the wealth management business which is a natural fit with insurance has its challenges too the popularity of etfs which generally track indexes at a fraction of the cost of mutual funds are forcing money managers across the wealth management spectrum to cut their fees to stay competitive even so asset managers are struggling to hold onto assets as etfs capture consumer interest open this photo in gallery from left power financial chairman paul desmarais jr president and ceo jeffrey orr and co chairman andre desmarais head to the company annual meeting in boucherville que on may 14 2014 paul chiasson the solution to these challenges cut costs trim fees add new products get more tech savvy and bulk up but it s a slow process jeffrey orr power financial s ceo knows that when his company s numerous entities are laid out in an organization chart they can resemble a christmas tree the holding company has significant stakes in igm financial inc an asset manager and great west lifeco the insurance company both are publicly traded and they operate under banners such as investors group mackenzie investments putnam investments london life and many others oh and power financial is a holding company within another holding company power corp of canada the structure gives the desmarais family a lock on control the family trust owns a 21 per cent ownership stake in power corp and through the magic of multiple voting shares it has a 59 per cent voting stake that gives the trust sway over every corporate entity what the desmarais family says goes a high level of control at a time when some critics believe the family has become risk averse but the way mr orr sees it power financial s structure boils down to three confluent businesses it helps groups and individuals accumulate wealth manage wealth and hedge their risks and while these businesses are being buffeted by changes beyond mr orr s control he doesn t set interest rates or dictate consumer preferences he can slash costs ditch underperforming elements and build market share in areas where bigger is better you can t change the market environment mr orr told the globe and mail you have to have a strategy that deals with the reality and fortunately for us we have historically sought to have leadership positions he expects power financial will make a significant acquisition in the united states where it controls putnam investments a global asset manager with us 160 billion in assets under management he believes that larger scale translates into cost advantages and he is looking for meaningful contributions from businesses that are still developing power financial and igm own a significant stake in wealthsimple financial inc a robo adviser that is leading the charge toward low cost online investment management but mr orr is not overpromising the organic growth that we have right now is not what it was historically so when we do what we ve done for the last five years which is deliver pretty solid single digit growth in adjusted earnings that s a lot of hard work to get there he said mr gori is facing similar challenges at manulife he must reassure investors who were dismayed by manulife s deep troubles during the financial crisis it cut its dividend in half in 2009 and issued new shares amid concerns about its capital levels that the insurer can still thrive and he is saddled with john hancock financial services inc the boston based insurer that manulife bought for 15 billion in 2004 with tremendous fanfare the acquisition briefly made manulife the most valuable canadian company based on the total value of its shares but john hancock has since become a dead weight with longer lifespans and rising health care costs dragging on the performance of its long term care business a number of observers believe that the division should be jettisoned and the fact it hasn t been divested is raising concerns that no one wants it mr gori though believes that today s manulife is radically different than what it was prior to the financial crisis when it ran into a load of trouble its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations is a fraction of what it was 10 years ago he said and through hedging its sensitivity to stock market volatility is half of what it was we want our earnings to be sustainable he said when a significant percentage of your earnings are coming from the equity market or interest rates you re trading and that s really not what we are in the business of doing he s also betting big on asia where the middle class is growing fast he expects that manulife s 120 year history in the region along with the fact that it already operates in 12 markets there gives the company a competitive advantage that will drive a larger share of the company s profits within five years in north america mr gori is pushing for greater efficiency he s controlling spending third quarter growth in expenses was 5 per cent half the five year average he s investing in technology the insurance business he said is stuck in the dark ages and freeing up at least 5 billion in capital by moving out of underperforming areas i don t think there is one magic bullet that will solve all issues or unlock all value he said but he expects that shifting financial resources into more promising operations will improve manulife s return on equity ratio which should help the stock both manulife and power financial have one standout feature that is drawing the attention of some investors the stocks look exceptionally cheap implying limited downside risk and significant upside potential if the companies can get moving again manulife shares trade at just 8 5 times reported profit or about half what the price to earnings ratio was in 2007 according to bloomberg power financial s price to earnings ratio is also historically low at 9 8 price to book values which compare share prices with net assets are also well below what they were more than a decade ago manulife s price to book ratio is just 1 04 today versus 2 58 in 2007 and by some estimates power financial s market capitalization represents a 20 2 per cent discount to the value of its underlying assets according to desjardins which is well above the 10 year average discount of 13 4 per cent at the same time dividend yields which compare annualized payouts with share prices are remarkably high manulife not a dividend powerhouse before now yields an impressive 4 7 per cent and power financial yields 6 3 per cent that s about double what either stock yielded in 2007 why so inexpensive analysts suggest that there is a lack of confidence in profit growth and lingering concerns about acquisitions including manulife s john hancock the bigger picture isn t pretty either the s p tsx composite index remains volatile which is weighing on sentiment toward insurers and asset managers and although the bank of canada has raised its key interest rate from ultralow levels over the past couple of years further increases are on hold amid forecasts of slowing economic growth a head fake for anyone who bet that profit boosting rates were here to stay the idea that manulife and power financial pale next to their own boom years may also be weighing on sentiment after all second acts are rare between the start of 2000 and october 2007 manulife s share price surged 391 per cent or 462 per cent after factoring in rising dividends dominic d alessandro manulife s ceo between 1994 and 2009 reigned as bay street royalty power financial began its ascent earlier from the start of 1995 to its peak in may 2007 the stock soared 1 113 per cent or 1 590 per cent with dividends outperforming the likes of apple inc pre iphone but still and cementing the reputation of the desmarais family led by the late paul sr as empire builders that makes for tough comparisons nonetheless some bargain hunting investors are discovering that attractive valuation metrics are becoming impossible to ignore at a time when some performance metrics are improving rbc dominion securities expects that manulife s return on equity will improve to 13 4 per cent in 2018 it will report its year end results on feb 13 that s still well below roe of 17 3 per cent in 2007 but it marks a 10 year high similarly rbc expects that power financial s great west lifeco s roe will rise to 14 4 per cent in 2018 typically we don t own any canadian companies in our global fund but manulife has gotten so cheap that we added it to the global accounts this past fall said john hadwen a portfolio manager at ci investments signature global asset management in toronto sure manulife has issues but enthusiasts believe that the share price is already discounting the ugly parts analysts at canaccord genuity and bmo nesbitt burns have added manulife to their top canadian stock picks for 2019 arguing the stock price could rally as much as 50 per cent this year profit in asia rose 22 per cent in the third quarter year over year and a focus on cost cutting has identified 1 billion in unnecessary expenses interest in power financial is also stirring robert gill a portfolio manager at lincluden investment management a discretionary investment management firm in mississauga recently took a position in the stock with the belief that the share price was out of whack with the quality of the company we think that the future is brighter than the past if you couple that with the fact that you re getting it at a very attractive valuation multiple there s a margin of safety in that mr gill said desjardins securities upgraded the stock to a buy recommendation in mid december it s a notable shift for the brokerage given that desjardins had been relatively unenthusiastic about the stock for the previous two years and paul holden an analyst at cibc world markets turned bullish on igm financial canada s largest independent money manager and a core component of power financial nine months ago for the first time since covering the stock over the past decade what has changed igm is a far better company today in terms of strategy competitive positioning and financial efficiency mr holden said in a note last year the company has slashed fees to stave off irrelevancy in a low fee world embraced high net worth clients and cut costs mr holden expects that its assets under management which drive fees will rise by more than 7 per cent in 2019 analysts and fund managers can be wrong of course and ceos are cheerleaders for their own causes but at least they re pounding the table for cheap out of favour stocks rather than trying to sustain a bubble we can tell our story the best we can and we have increased our presence in front of investors a lot in the past 12 months to ensure that investors understand what we re doing what is our value creation strategy how we re trying to deploy capital on the belief that at some point people will recognize value mr orr said power financial s share price fell 25 per cent in 2018 though investors may need more convincing editor s note an earlier version referred to john hadwen a portfolio manager at ci investments signature global asset management incorrectly as paul hadwen

government shutdown or not the federal reserve is still open for business it funds itself for the record the upcoming meeting of fed officials on jan 29 and 30 will likely be much dissected particularly the conversation on interest rates dr lael brainard currently serves as a member of the federal reserve board of governors and will be at that meeting she spoke to marketplace host kai ryssdal the following is a full transcript of their conversation lightly edited for clarity kai ryssdal i want to start off with an easy one because it s not that often that you get a member of the board of governors of the fed on the line what do you do all day lael brainard well among other things stay very focused on the health of the u s economy try to gauge through a whole variety of different ways through contacts on main street and visits that we do all across the country as well as the data as well as the financial markets try to see just how healthy the u s economy is and that helps inform all the policy decisions that we make ryssdal how healthy is the american economy right now brainard well generally speaking the labor market is extremely healthy it s the strongest we ve seen it in a long time we ve got the lowest unemployment rate we ve seen in almost 50 years and we ve got our share of the population that s working again is really where we had seen it pre we re seeing that strong labor market spread to groups that have traditionally had the greatest challenges in labor markets so we re seeing historically low unemployment among african americans for instance and wages finally after a long period of not moving are now up at 3 percent so the labor market looks good and the u s consumer has been pretty resilient but there are some risks out there ryssdal yes so let s get there right because while the economy may be strong there is no small amount of i m going to go to the politics first there s no small amount of political tsuris out there right now you ve got the shutdown you ve got globally brexit you ve got discontent in washington where does that fall on your scale of things to worry about brainard so that is the list of risks that i m being very attentive to that i m sort of waiting and watching the shutdown let s start with that that means pain for a lot of families that are counting on those paychecks so you know that s going to really make a lot of stress for a lot of households that need to be paying their mortgages and their grocery bills and their medical bills and there s just uncertainty about how long that s going to continue you re right that there is other uncertainty out there people are wondering what s going to happen with trade and china and that s a big deal for a lot of american businesses that are sitting on the sidelines thinking about where their supply chain should be and whether they should make investments so that s another big source of uncertainty that we hear a lot about and then you know further afield as you said britain and the votes that they re having in parliament about their relationship to the eu that s another source of uncertainty so all of those things are risks that if they were to materialize would be negative for the economy we re not seeing as much risks out there that that would be a positive surprise ryssdal positive risks yeah but look the point is that those risks are materializing right the government is shut down china is slowing brexit is i mean who knows where as people listen to this interview they re going to be looking and listening for signs that perhaps there is more trouble to come brainard so i think you know we certainly for my own part as i look at that set of risks you know there are things that could get resolved in a very positive way if we had a good trade agreement come through that really fixes some of the issues that would be seen as as a boost obviously the quicker people in the federal workforce get back to work all over the country the quicker they ll get their paychecks and the quicker that source of uncertainty will be lifted so it is a set of downside risks right now with an economy that s been pretty healthy but of course as you say you know the longer these drag on the more i worry that they pile up and they really materially weigh on consumer confidence business confidence and then start to work their way through actual activity in the economy ryssdal the line from economists and members of the board of governors including past chair janet yellen and i think mr bernanke said this bunch and probably chair powell has said it you know economic expansions don t die of old age what it takes is a shock are we looking at a shock brainard well you know our job is to provide some stabilization to the economy and in that sense we re in a good place you know we have some time we can wait and watch be vigilant we have some capacity to buffer the economy so right now again you know we are at where you know congress wants us to be in terms of we ve got target inflation of 2 percent we ve got a strong labor market and now we have that capacity to sit back and carefully watch how the economy reacts to some of this uncertainty and be in a position to be able to to provide that stabilizing force ryssdal last question on the politics of the american economy and then i ll move on to something else but it s relevant here that you have been around the politics of the american economy for a good long while you ve been in washington for for a number of years even before your service on the board of governors have you ever seen anything like this brainard well you know every time that the economy gets to a shutdown or a debt limit you really do sense that desire from americans across the country for the government to function well and to be predictable and i think that s what we re seeing today people want to go back to work they want to get their paychecks this is affecting communities all over the country and so i think there is just a general desire for the u s economy to stay on that resilient track and for government to be a part of the solution ryssdal let me ask you a question about sort of the larger issue of financial stability in this country you chair i believe the fed s committee on financial stability right brainard i do ryssdal as you look at the big banks being bigger than they were after the crisis and profits coming in do you have a level of concern about too big to fail and systemic risk anymore in this economy brainard well i think we always have to be adjusting our framework and our regulatory tools to make sure that the banks are holding really resilient and thick buffers of capital to absorb losses thick buffers of liquidity to make sure that we don t see the kinds of runs and the kind of damage to main street that we saw in the crisis so we re very active on that front i certainly have been a proponent of making sure that our banks have really robust risk management really robust capital and we also have some tools this time around where we can ask banks to build more resilience as financial markets get a little stretched ryssdal this is kind of a subjective question but do you suppose the fed kind of writ large is still scarred by the crisis and how grave it was brainard well i d say it a little differently i think we learned a lot about how much more vigilant we need to be on regulations and on consumer protections from the crisis and we learned a lot about ways that our monetary policy can respond when a really deep crisis hits and so you know we re a different fed today than we were perhaps 10 years ago we ve got a lot more tools and we also i think are a lot more vigilant ryssdal you ll notice that i haven t asked you about interest rates or the dot plot or any of that good stuff that comes up every time you all have a meeting which is coming up in another 10 days or so and i haven t because that gets plenty of coverage but the question i want to ask you about that is is too much attention paid to every muttering of yourself and your colleagues on the board and your statements brainard well i certainly think that you know it s important for us on the monetary policy making committee to try to communicate in a way that the public understands how new developments in the data will affect you know how the outlook is likely to evolve and what that means for monetary policy so rather than reacting to every new sentence over time if we re doing our job well i think we would hope the public would understand and react to data similarly as we do and sort of understand that monetary policy is positioned to sustain the expansion that it can be patient and you know that we are actually achieving what congress asked us to do which is to be at full employment and to get inflation you know at a stable 2 percent level ryssdal do you suppose you don t get enough credit for actually doing what congress told you to do brainard well it s a hard job it s a big challenge and you know i would expect us to be held accountable for what is you know we do touch every household in america with our policies every american household is connected to the financial system and that s a very big responsibility so no i expect to be held accountable and i expect to have a really good debate about how we exercise the policy tools congress has given us ryssdal a question here about data since you ve mentioned it a couple of times with the government shutdown you are not getting the data tools that you usually have and yes the fed has its own economists in it and it does do some gathering of its own information how big a problem is it for you now that we are in a position where we are arguably knowing less every day about the american economy thanks to the shutdown brainard so it s certainly very important to us and to businesses around the country households around the country to continue to get that stream of data that gives us a kind of high frequency sense of just how robust consumer sales are for instance the jobs report as you know is extremely important and that one we

hyperinflation in venezuela is estimated to have reached a boggling 1 3 million percent in 2018 to reconcile runaway prices the wealthy and the technologically savvy have turned to the stock market and cryptocurrency venezuela s deteriorating economy turns people to cryptocurrencies fueled by rich oil reserves the country was once one of the fastest growing in south america during the 1990s and was an economic powerhouse in the region today decades of corrupt and neglectful policies have put venezuela on a road to economic disaster and it s accelerating the imf estimates that venezuela s inflation stands at around 1 3 million percent meaning that prices double in less than a month this has caused country wide shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicine adding to the hardships endured by venezuelan citizens conditions have become so bad that ten percent of the country s population has fled the country according to the economist the country s national currency the bolivar has plummeted in value to combat the issue maduro knocked five zeros off the currency by issuing new sovereign bolivar forbes called the move a scam and a mere facelift to the issue in desperation the local people have taken to volatile and oftentimes difficult to use cryptocurrencies on social media bitcoin dash and zcash are often cited as the number one choices for venezuelans looking to weather hyperinflation and people from around the globe are helping the country find its way to cryptocurrency for example airdropvenezuela is facilitating donations to tens of thousands of verified venezualans according to crypto statistics hub coin dance the trading volume for bolivars on localbitcoins has surged in 2018 the weekly trade volume for bitcoin rose from 170 to 2000 btc in 2018 adjusting for bitcoin s 75 percent fall in value since the beginning of the year weekly trading volume in venezuela still increased from 2 5 million to 7 3 million over a 190 percent increase cryptocurrency replacing stock market hedging although the poor in venezuela have been hit the hardest by inflation rich venezuelans have other options to combat the problem in the past many have used the stock market as a sort of inflation linked bank buying shares to deposit cash and selling them to withdraw it as said by the economist in july of 2018 according to barron s stocks in venezuela have done a better job of keeping up with inflation increasing in value in bolivar terms by 73 000 in the past year banco mercantil one of south america s largest banks which operates outside of venezuela is the most popular stock among the rich understandably however despite the astounding growth of the venezuelan stock market its trading volume adjusted to dollars is minuscule data from bloomberg suggest that the caracas exchange index had a daily trading volume that fluctuated between 50 000 and 3 9 million in the month of december numbers rivaled by the growing bitcoin trade the localbitcoins figure is also an estimate which doesn t account for bitcoin traded outside of the platform and with weekly volume consistently upwards of 500 00 in usd terms it seems that the country s appetite for some digital currencies is significant although conditions in venezuela are grim the natural and spontaneous use of bitcoin at such a scale hasn t been seen before the nascent digital currency could actually start behaving like peer to peer digital cash in the country one of bitcoin s original aspirations as things unfold in the troubled economy of venezuela it will be interesting to see if the country sets a new precedent for cryptocurrencies mentioned in this article

montana free press when lana zellner and her husband an architect and a software developer respectively moved to philipsburg from new york city five years ago seeking a quieter place to call home they joined the ranks of montana s remote workers in doing so they brought their professional incomes into a rural montana community that has long been hungry for good jobs the philipsburg chamber of commerce they discovered after they arrived had even produced a brochure aimed at attracting remote workers like them zellner and her husband liked the town with its restaurants brewery and nearby ski area but a year later they had moved on in part she said because of how hard it was to travel for business her work she said involved managing projects all over the globe but her firm preferred to operate through face to face meetings in new york city that meant cross country flights nightmare commutes that often started with leaving philipsburg in the wee hours to catch a 6 a m flight out of missoula more than an hour away before shuttling through a layover in minneapolis or salt lake city they would have liked for me to be out in new york more regularly she said but i didn t want to have to drive to the airport every two weeks zellner s experience underscores what economists and civic boosters alike say is a key piece of the economic development puzzle in rural montana communities the access that well connected airports give residents to the rest of the world in spite of the internet access we still need to see each other face to face said ray rasker executive director of headwaters economics in bozeman and that s what airports represent while the u s department of transportation s essential air service program subsidizes flights from seven remote montana towns and cities to ensure they stay connected it s no secret that residents in broad swaths of big sky country have long drives between their homes and flights a long streets analysis indicates that 29 montana towns of at least 400 residents are more than an hour s drive from a commercial airport another 24 are more than an hour from major airports in billings bozeman or other travel hubs that offer direct flights to at least five or more different destinations loading those figures are derived from open source data published by the university of oxford s malaria atlas project which has tabulated how long it takes to travel across every square kilometer on the planet in a format usable for generating travel time maps the same data was used last year in a washington post article that labeled glasgow montana the middle of nowhere in the lower 48 states based on travel time to major population centers when it comes to commercial air access though glasgow population 3 300 is in better shape than many of its neighbors that s thanks to the u s department of transportation s essential air service which supports a twice daily cape air route between glasgow and billings on nine seat prop planes passengers pay as little as 29 one way the glasgow route allocated 2 2 million in federal subsidies annually totaled just over 3 500 departures in 2017 according to the montana department of transportation without that service glasgow residents flying for business or pleasure would have to drive 2 5 hours to the airport in williston north dakota or 4 5 hours to billings it s a huge part of our community said lisa koski who runs the glasgow area chamber of commerce you can still get access to the united states or wherever you need to go with that one hour flight the cape air service koski said also allows dermatologists and oncologists out of billings make day trips to see patients who would otherwise have to travel for medical attention it s a lifeline as well she said for residents with out of state family annual subsidies for the seven montana towns served by essential air service routes glasgow glendive sidney havre wolf point west yellowstone and butte total 14 5 million a year for comparison that s about 40 percent of the operations budget for yellowstone national park montana airports with eas routes had a total of 56 642 departures in 2017 according to state figures including 20 665 from eastern and central montana communities essential air service was established by congress following 1970s era airline deregulation in order to protect commercial air service to small less profitable markets it s funded by a combination of federal tax dollars and fees paid by foreign aircraft traveling through u s airspace at a 288 million price tag nationally in 2018 up 49 percent over 2012 according to the congressional research service it s a consistent target of federal budget hawks in 2017 for example the trump administration proposed ending subsidies for the five eastern and central montana routes according to the billings gazette both sen jon tester a democrat and sen steve daines a republican expressed opposition we need to make government more efficient and effective without diminishing key capacities and programs and disconnecting rural communities daines said at the time if i was king of montana and i wanted to do something useful in eastern montana i would put a big airport there said rasker who has published research arguing that air access to major urban centers explains much of the difference between rural counties in the american west that have performed well in economic terms and those that have struggled in recent decades rasker and his co authors say that amenities like public lands make many places in the rural west attractive destinations for knowledge based workers people like the zellners but that airport access is often a limiting factor their analysis found that western counties closer to airports with several commercial flights a day generally had higher per capita incomes and more diverse economies in contrast to more isolated rural areas they said those connected rural counties were behaving in economic terms more like cities it s now possible rasker points out to catch a 7 a m flight from bozeman and gaining an hour with the time zone change make it to downtown seattle in time for a 9 a m meeting that means a bozeman based entrepreneur can conduct business in person in the pacific northwest s largest city on a day trip catching an afternoon or evening flight back home that s a serious competitive advantage for bozeman he said rasker credits bozeman s vibrant tech scene in part to the options available through bozeman yellowstone international airport which he said has punched above its population base for years as a result of big sky resort subsidizing airlines the bozeman airport has also tapped federal grants and chamber of commerce funds to support revenue guarantees that help persuade airlines to offer new routes today bozeman yellowstone international airport is the busiest in the state with 600 000 departures annually and 16 direct destinations as for zellner she eventually concluded that philipsburg was just too remote for her nyc based architecture job instead of finding a montana based architecture gig she said she decided to make a career change her husband still works remotely as a software developer but she now works as a traveling tattoo artist they re currently living in potomac about 30 minutes east of missoula but thinking about moving back to philipsburg it would help she said to have more mid day travel options out of the missoula airport saving travelers like her the lost sleep of early morning departures if there were later flights i think it would be a lot easier she said story edited by brad tyer this story was originally published by montana free press as part of the long streets project this work is supported in part by a grant from the greater montana foundation which encourages communication on issues trends and values of importance to montanans
