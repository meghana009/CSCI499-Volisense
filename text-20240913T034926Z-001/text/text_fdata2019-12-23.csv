by asia frontier capital ltd 2019 review trade tensions between china and the u s and geopolitical uncertainties in the middle east continued to consume most of the headlines in 2019 which hurt investor sentiment while worries not only about slower global economic growth but also the economic slowdowns in larger emerging markets like china and india dampened investor sentiment towards emerging and frontier markets in general the trade conflict between china and the u s continued with both ups and downs with market participants expecting a partial trade agreement on multiple occasions only to be disappointed with no agreements and at times an escalation between both parties however the workings of a phase one trade deal were announced on 13th december 2019 which should lead to more positive market sentiment going forward the tensions between the u s and its trading partners were the major factor for the international monetary fund reducing its global economic growth forecast to 3 0 a 30 basis point reduction from its april 2019 outlook the lowest global economic growth since the 2008 2009 financial crisis source international monetary fund in addition to trade and geopolitical tensions many countries across frontier and emerging markets had domestic policy issues to contend with which were unrelated to trade or geopolitical uncertainties asian frontier economies like bangladesh pakistan and sri lanka and emerging ones like china and india all had domestic related issues as well impacting economic growth and investor sentiment in 2019 however in some markets like pakistan and sri lanka the tide is turning for the better and we will discuss this further below and in our 2020 outlook after increasing interest rates aggressively in 2018 2019 saw central banks globally go on a loosening spree as worries over economic growth surfaced the u s fed cut interest rates three times by 25 basis points each with all three cuts happening in the second half of 2019 asia also saw almost all major central banks cut rates as the chart below shows source bloomberg from an overall macro environment though asian frontier countries are either in a strong position or are seeing a big improvement as the higher interest rates and currency weakness of 2018 lowered unnecessary imports and helped to improve current account balances bangladesh pakistan and sri lanka all of which suffered from widening current account deficits in 2018 witnessed a reduction in their current account deficits a much needed boost to macroeconomic stability vietnam on the other hand continues to post a current account surplus thanks to rising exports source international monetary fund gdp growth in asian frontier markets is also expected to be bottoming out for countries like pakistan and sri lanka while economic growth rates remain robust in bangladesh kazakhstan mongolia myanmar uzbekistan and vietnam however despite stable to improving macro economic indicators investor sentiment towards frontier and emerging markets was extremely weak in 2019 due to the factors mentioned above i e trade tensions and their impact on global economic growth rates source international monetary fund this is an important point as frontier and emerging equity markets despite having a stable to improving macro environment and or stable to improving gdp growth rates have been underperforming developed stock market indices i e the u s as the chart below shows the s p 500 index has outperformed frontier and emerging markets by a large margin over the past decade while valuations in frontier markets and more specifically in asian frontier markets have become very attractive relative to expected growth rates the afc asia frontier fund now trades at its lowest ever p e multiple while many of the fund s markets as well as stocks are trading at a big discount to historical valuations the s p 500 has outperformed frontier and emerging markets over the past decade source bloomberg data rebased to 100 while the valuation gap between frontier and emerging markets versus the s 500 has increased source bloomberg source asia frontier capital bloomberg attractive valuations and stable to improving gdp growth rates in asian frontier markets are backed by extremely favorable demographics with our universe hosting some of the most populous countries globally despite uncertainties about trade most of the countries in our universe are domestically driven and hence consumption by a large young population is a stronger longer term trend relative to ongoing trade tensions bangladesh kazakhstan myanmar pakistan sri lanka and uzbekistan at present do not have a large percentage of their gdp exposed to trade within our universe vietnam is the major economy which is highly exposed to global trade with total trade accounting for almost 200 of gdp but even here vietnam is actually benefiting from the trade tensions between china and the u s as it sees an increase in foreign direct investments and exports this is also an important trend in asian frontier markets as not only vietnam but also countries such as bangladesh cambodia and myanmar are expected to gain with wages in china increasing and asian frontier markets offering lower cost alternatives which are also geographically well positioned source united nations population division source world bank source bloomberg general statistics office of vietnam bangladesh export promotion bureau source china statistical bulletin wage indicator foundation bangladesh garment manufacturers exporters association general statistics office of vietnam despite asian frontier markets having had a tough year in 2019 correlations of asian frontier markets with the msci world index sustained their low attractive levels with some markets such as bangladesh continuing to have a negative correlation with the msci world index this reflects the sound diversification opportunity that asian frontier markets offer furthermore the fund s benchmark agnostic strategy has sustained its low volatility with the annualized volatility of the afc asia frontier fund at 8 9 much lower than most indices as shown below source asia frontier capital bloomberg correlations calculated on monthly returns since inception source asia frontier capital bloomberg annualized volatility calculated on monthly returns since inception importantly asian frontier markets remain under researched and this trend is continuing given the soft sentiment towards frontier markets the table below shows the number of sell side analysts covering well established blue chip companies within our universe relative to larger emerging markets in the current environment many of these companies besides being under researched are also now being ignored by a large set of investors due to the current sentiment towards frontier markets the result is that there are a number of bargains available furthermore in line with our policy of being on the ground for research our team conducted visits in 2019 to bangladesh cambodia iraq jordan kazakhstan mongolia myanmar oman pakistan sri lanka uzbekistan and vietnam through this our team carried out close to 200 one to one meetings with company management teams asian frontier companies are currently under researched and ignored source bloomberg below we discuss the 2019 performance for our key markets the stocks we like and the long term trends we observe the 2019 overview is according to country weights of the fund source asia frontier capital vietnam the macro economic story of vietnam remains one of the most superior in frontier markets as it benefits from the trade tension between china and the u s this is reflected in rising foreign direct investments fdi not only from traditional investors like japan and south korea but also from china as manufacturers look to shift production to vietnam to escape uncertainties over tariffs and higher costs exports manufacturing growth and retail sales were robust in 2019 while tourism arrivals grew strongly as well source general statistics office of vietnam source general statistics office of vietnam vietcapital securities from a stock market perspective the vn index gained 7 0 in 2019 but a large part of this performance has come from a few stocks namely the vingroup companies a handful of banks and petrovietnam gas jsc gas the strength in the market has not been broad based across market cap ranges which one usually sees when an economy is doing as strongly as vietnam s is though the fund does not hold some of these large cap names since it follows a benchmark agnostic approach and in certain cases cannot buy these names because the foreign ownership limit is full it has exposure to companies across small mid and large cap names amongst large cap names the fund owns airports corporation of vietnam acv vincom retail vre and vietnam engine agricultural machinery corporation vea vn index performance was led by a few large cap names broader market did not increase as much vn30 index and vn70 midcap index underperformed the vn index source bloomberg data rebased to 100 in last year s review we wrote that we like the tourism sector in vietnam because the growth of low cost carriers in the region is making it cheaper to travel while spending time as a tourist in vietnam is also very economical international tourist arrivals have grown by 15 4 in 2019 with the growth being led by asian tourists which increased by 18 2 this momentum in international arrivals has helped acv not only improve its growth rates but also its margins since international passengers provide higher margins revenues and net profits in the first nine months of 2019 have grown by 13 0 and 19 3 respectively while gross margins have improved by 110 basis points yoy to 51 8 furthermore higher margin non aeronautical revenues which also consist of duty free revenues have grown by 13 4 so far in 2019 at an ev ebitda of 11 5x based on 2020 earnings the stock remains attractively valued against other asian peers like airports of thailand and shanghai international airport which trade at an ev ebitda of 24 7x and 18 6x respectively source general statistics office of vietnam most asian airports have generated superior returns in the long run source bloomberg in last year s review outlook we also mentioned that we like the auto and modern retail sector the fund s auto holding vea which has equity stakes in the local operations of honda toyota and ford has witnessed a 6 growth in net profits so far in 2019 slightly lower than expected due to certain one off expenses however passenger car and commercial vehicle sales of honda toyota and ford grew by 36 39 and 59 respectively in the first nine months of 2019 with passenger car penetration in vietnam remaining very low compared to other regional countries vea s growth rates should improve going forward as consumers upgrade from motorbikes to passenger cars the stock remains very cheap at a trailing 12 months p e of 9 3x and a dividend yield of 7 8 the stock is up 24 year to date source international organization of motor vehicle manufacturersmotorization rate vehicles per 1 000 people assumes passenger and commercial vehicles in the modern retail sector we initiated a position in vincom retail vre the leading mall operator in vietnam as we believe it is a good proxy to rising consumerism disposable income and urbanization we believe vre has a strong business model due to its access to a large land bank anchor tenants and scale which therefore attracts international brands like h m uniqlo and zara to set up shop in vre malls in the first nine months of 2019 its leasing revenues and net profits have grown by 26 2 and 14 7 respectively while expansion plans remain in place to tap the under penetrated modern retail segment source central pattana we also like the industrial park segment due to increasing fdi coming into the manufacturing sector which has led to more demand for industrial land in manufacturing hubs outside of hanoi and ho chi minh city the fund owns kinh bac city one of the leading industrial park developers in vietnam whose industrial land sales have increased by 36 this year while net profits have grown by 22 furthermore selling prices per square meter in some of their industrial parks have increased by 34 40 yoy due to greater demand the stock is up 16 year to date we also wrote in last year s review that we like the logistics segment due to greater industrialization in vietnam the fund s holding petrovietnam transport has grown its net profits by 32 2 in the first nine months of 2019 on the back of increased transportation volumes of crude oil refined petroleum products and gas the stock currently trades at a trailing 12 months p e of 6 5x with a dividend yield of 6 during the year the fund sold its other logistics related holding saigon cargo services as it could be facing near term headwinds from slower global air freight volumes the other major holding the fund exited was masan group which was sold in march 2019 due to worries over the african swine flu impacting its animal feed business while its consumer business was also witnessing slower than expected growth rates source bloomberg vietcapital securities mongolia the main event in 2019 was the conflict surrounding the dubai agreement signed by rio tinto and the government of mongolia in 2015 regarding the execution of phase ii the underground portion of the gigantic oyu tolgoi copper and gold mine during 2019 the agreement s legitimacy was contested in the mongolian parliament and it became a serious concern among foreign investors as to whether the agreement would be nullified thereby causing a significant drop in investor confidence and therefore hurting the stock market s performance the weakness of the mongolian stock market has created some great value opportunities such as the opportunity to buy the local producer of heineken beer at a valuation of 11x 2019 earnings while in late november 2019 the government of mongolia determined the agreement would not be nullified it still caused a marked decrease in sentiment for foreign investors assuming the project can get back on track with the second mine shaft completed in december 2019 turquoise hill resources and entrée resources two listed companies involved in the project should undergo a revaluation in their share prices while broader investor sentiment should improve further it would not be a surprise to see the government eventually swap its 34 equity stake in the project for a royalty enabling near term revenue generation from the project for the country mongolia s negative market sentiment was the biggest detractor to fund performance in 2019 mongolia had a tough year but valuations now attractive source bloomberg data rebased to 100 bangladesh there were two main reasons why the dhaka stock exchange broad index dsex witnessed a weak 2019 despite the overall macro situation in bangladesh remaining broadly stable 1 grameemphone the biggest weight in the dsex with around 14 is currently going through a major legal battle with the telecom regulator regarding disputed taxes this issue is not new but has heated up in 2019 again which has led to weakness not only in grameenphone s stock price but also impacted broader investor sentiment 2 the other dampener on investor sentiment in bangladesh has been the banking sector which accounts for almost 18 of the index the government over the past year or so has made decisions which have impacted the funding costs of the banking sector leading to pressure on net interest margins as well as loan growth furthermore with worries of rising non performing loans within state run banks fear and uncertainty has spread across the banking sector which has led to a drop in private sector credit growth with grameenphone and the banking sector together accounting for 32 of the index weight weakness in these names has led to negative sentiment across the market the dhaka stock exchange broad index dsex was held down by high weights grameenphone and banking financial service companies source bloomberg data rebased to 100 with regulatory concerns expected to be an overhang for grameenphone the fund exited the stock in january 2019 while we continue to hold brac bank which has seen a correction in its stock price but stands out in terms of management quality and operating metrics amongst the private sector banks in bangladesh however despite these roadblocks in the telecom and banking sectors consumption and gdp growth have remained robust in bangladesh as consumer and pharmaceutical companies have declared strong earnings growth so far in 2019 and gdp growth is expected to remain in the 7 range the themes which we like in bangladesh consumer appliances and pharmaceuticals have both delivered good results singer bangladesh one of the leading consumer appliance companies in the country has delivered revenue and net profit growth of 14 6 and 13 2 in the first nine months of 2019 thanks to increased demand for air conditioners refrigerators and televisions as penetration of such products remain extremely low in bangladesh the company was acquired by turkey s arcelik in march 2019 and this should help singer bangladesh to launch new products as well as to reduce sourcing costs due to arcelik s scale and reach in the region source asia frontier capital in the pharmaceutical space the fund owns beximco pharmaceuticals whose fy19 net profits grew by 20 while its 1qfy20 september 2019 net profits increased by 15 4 yoy these growth rates over the past year have been better than its larger competitors while the stock continues to trade at a very attractive p e of 8 0x based on fy20 earnings the fund holds the london listed gdr of beximco pharmaceuticals which currently trades at a 30 discount to the local listing source world bank beximco pharmaceuticals outperforming larger competitors and trades at a much lower valuation source bloomberg tellimer source bloomberg despite the dsex index correcting by 17 4 in 2019 the fund s bangladeshi exposure remained flat due to positive moves in beximco pharmaceuticals and british american tobacco bangladesh bat this was possible thanks to our sale of grameenphone early in the year while the exposure to the problematic banking sector was only via brac bank in addition to this the fund also exited its position in square pharmaceuticals due to its growth rate lagging that of its peers this also helped with relative performance against the dsex index as square pharmaceuticals stock price is down 23 this year broadly besides the issues with grameenphone and the banking sector the macro environment in bangladesh remains stable relative to other markets total debt to gdp as well as external debt to gdp remain low foreign exchange reserves cover close to 7 months of imports while the current account deficit is expected to contract to 2 0 of gdp in 2019 from 2 7 in 2018 furthermore the government remains focused on infrastructure development which can help improve overall economic growth rates going forward source international monetary fund world bank uzbekistan uzbekistan s gdp is projected to have grown by 5 5 in 2019 according to the international monetary fund continuing the trend of robust growth experienced over the past several years inflation reached 15 6 as of november 2019 and is expected to decelerate towards the single digits into late 2020 as the central bank shifts to an inflation targeting regime from 1st january 2020 as the government works to lower inflation it is simultaneously eliminating blanketed subsidies for example in october bread flour prices were floated and instead of blanketed subsidies the ministry of finance issued targeted subsidies to the most vulnerable part of the population with inflation falling and subsidies being eliminated competition is rising in multiple sectors as the country continues its transformation towards a free market economy with credit being a key driver of continued economic growth on 25th november 2019 state owned uzpromstroy bank issued a usd 300 mln eurobond the eurobond is expected to be followed by several other banks looking to raise capital in order to service the high demand for credit as current consumer credit to gdp currently stands at a low 15 this reform momentum led to positive stock market sentiment which resulted in the afc uzbekistan fund gaining 7 6 so far in 2019 the afc asia frontier fund is invested in the afc uzbekistan fund sri lanka sri lanka began 2019 with political uncertainties due to the instability that was caused in the last quarter of 2018 when former president maithripala sirisena tried to dissolve parliament and dismiss former prime minister ranil wickremesinghe as if things could not get worse the tragic easter sunday attacks in april 2019 further hurt the economy since the tourism sector accounts for 5 of gdp and is the third highest foreign exchange earner for the country these events and the following stock market weakness made valuations in sri lanka very attractive with some companies trading at multiples last seen in 2009 during the civil war a divided coalition and question marks over security gave further momentum to the opposition prior to the presidential elections which took place in november 2019 as a result the opposition namely the rajapaksa led sri lanka podujana peramuna party slpp witnessed a decisive win for their candidate gotabaya rajapaksa due to a high probability of impending political change and very attractive valuations the fund began increasing its exposure to sri lanka in the second half of 2019 in the second half of 2019 the fund bought the conglomerate john keells holdings two consumer staple names ceylon tobacco and nestle lanka and two banks hatton national bank and commercial bank of ceylon the colombo all share index has had a much better second half than first half of 2019 with the index gaining 12 7 since the end of june 2019 in the same time period the fund s sri lankan holdings have returned 27 9 due to not only a broad based rally but also a 40 gain in dialog axiata the telecom company the fund holds in sri lanka sri lanka is still valued attractively relative to historywith a stable government in power the market can re rate further source bloomberg dialog axiata the fund s biggest position in sri lanka significant outperformance versus the colombo all share index in 2019 source bloomberg data rebased to 100 pakistan sentiment towards pakistan remained negative for most of 2019 and the fund rightly had a low weight to the country for most of the year the pakistan kse100 index had lost 29 5 in usd terms until the end of august 2019 however this drawdown had factored in most of the negatives such as the currency depreciation higher interest rates and slower economic growth with the international monetary fund imf deal coming through in the summer sentiment began to change as it gave investors more confidence on anticipated reforms while the weakened currency and high interest rates brought down imports significantly helping to lead to a large reduction in the current account deficit in addition to this on the fiscal side as well the government was able to reduce its primary deficit and the state bank of pakistan kept interest rates unchanged in its policy meetings in september and november 2019 after raising rates aggressively since the beginning of 2018 with an improving macro environment the fund began increasing its weight to pakistan from october 2019 onward as we believe that earnings for most sectors are close to bottoming if they haven t already and the state bank of pakistan could begin cutting interest rates from the second quarter of 2020 we therefore believe that cyclical stocks in the auto and cement sectors can do well over the next year as their valuations have corrected significantly over the past two years while their profit margins are also bottoming the fund has increased its exposure to pakistani auto and cement companies and this has already helped with performance as the kse100 index has rallied by 29 since the end of september 2019 making pakistan one of the best performing markets globally in the past three months the fund s pakistani holdings have returned 31 in the same time period the important point to remember is pakistan has a population of 200 mln people with very favorable demographics while the stock exchange offers a number of well established consumption focused names in the auto consumer staples and pharmaceutical space and more importantly valuations remain very attractive despite the recent run up in the market pakistan s stock market is still cheap and has lot of room to increase despite the recent rally source bloomberg pakistani cyclical names in the auto and cement sectors have outperformed the index and banks in the recent rally the fund has exposure to both auto and cement companies source bloomberg data rebased to 100 myanmar despite negative publicity due to the refugee crises myanmar is slowly but surely moving in the right direction as the insurance sector has been opened up to foreign investors and foreign banks are now allowed to lend to local businesses furthermore foreign direct investment fdi commitments grew by 77 in the first half of 2019 to usd 2 3 bln with most of these investments being committed to the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors the biggest event of the year in the country was the 20 stake sale by yoma strategic holdings yoma to ayala corporation a leading conglomerate from the philippines this is a big vote of confidence for yoma s core businesses in the food beverage financial services real estate and auto sectors as all these industries remain untapped in myanmar during the year yoma also increased its stake in wave money to 44 the leading mobile financial services platform in myanmar which is a joint venture with telenor we believe yoma offers the best available exposure to myanmar due to its focus on key growth areas which are all linked to growing consumption in the country source boston consulting group laos performance of the fund s holding in edl generation the listed company owning hydropower assets of the laotian government saw sizable losses due to growing debt service payments from its bonds issued in 2018 in thai baht which continue to drag the company s profitability low water levels in the company s dams especially in the mekong river exacerbated the issue with less than estimated electricity production kazakhstan in kazakhstan the fund owns one name halyk bank and this position has done exceptionally well in 2019 with a total return of 40 6 halyk bank s earnings increased by 53 3 in the first nine months of 2019 due to loan recoveries and lower provision expenses as the benefits of its acquisition of kazkommertsbank came through fundamentals remain solid with a roe of 29 7 and a capital adequacy ratio of 23 4 based on this it would not be surprising if the bank increases its dividend pay out which it has already guided to in june 2019 relative to fundamentals and earnings prospects the stock is valued very attractively at a price to book ratio of 1 2x and a dividend yield of 8 3 another tailwind for halyk bank has been the stable macro environment in kazakhstan in the first nine months of 2019 gdp growth was 4 3 the third year of more than 4 growth after the economic slowdown of 2015 16 growth has been led by the construction sector which grew by 13 5 while industrial production and retail sales increased by 3 3 and 5 5 respectively halyk bank in kazakhstan outperformed the kazakh index as well as most other leading banks in our universe source bloomberg data rebased to 100 2020 outlook for afc asia frontier fund universe as we move into the new year broader concerns remain similar to the start of 2019 namely slower global economic growth trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties though concerns about slower global economic growth remain the big difference between the start of 2020 and that of 2019 is that most central banks globally have cut interest rates to support growth compared to the beginning of 2019 when interest rates had yet to reverse their hawkish trend this leaves equity markets in a more comfortable position relative to the start of 2019 source bloomberg furthermore though trade relations between china and the u s may remain fickle the signing of a phase one trade deal between the two parties would give global markets some relief as we begin 2020 in addition to this the decisive victory for boris johnson and the tories in the recent u k general elections reduces market tensions over the brexit drama an unknown can be how the geopolitical issues in the middle east play out but from recent moves that we have seen it appears both the u s and saudi arabia want to avoid a severe escalation of conflict source international monetary fund in 2020 the u s will also see the start of a new presidential election cycle which could create some uncertainties in investors minds but it seems the current administration would want a strong economy and this is expected to be positive for global investor sentiment so how does this impact the outlook for asian frontier markets in 2020 and beyond as mentioned above the macro and geopolitical uncertainties which took up most of the headlines in 2019 are beginning to ease which is a big positive for investor sentiment furthermore with central banks in asia becoming more dovish stable economic growth in most of our markets will be supported by accommodating central bank policies more importantly the shift of manufacturing activities from high cost locations into lower cost asian frontier markets like bangladesh cambodia myanmar and vietnam will likely continue given rising wages in china as well as uncertainties over future tariffs source international monetary fund source kingmaker footwear yue yuen dream international keeping the above factors in mind and frontier market sentiment having been severely impacted in 2019 frontier markets look ripe for a re rating as lack of investor interest has made valuations extremely attractive going into 2020 while fundamentals remain broadly stable negative sentiment has made afc asia frontier fund valuations attractive while fundamentals are solid source asia frontier capital below is the 2020 outlook for our fund universe bangladesh improving market sentiment in bangladesh requires some very simple decisions but is there the political will gdp growth and overall macro metrics remain stable but until the authorities can resolve the grameenphone and banking sector issues which together account for 32 of the index overall sentiment may remain soft however on a bottom up basis we expect pharmaceutical and consumer discretionary companies to do well as consumption demand should remain strong due to under penetrated markets more specifically we expect good earnings growth from beximco pharmaceuticals and singer bangladesh with export growth weakening in the last few months of 2019 we believe that the bangladeshi taka bdt will depreciate moderately in 2020 to support export growth however with monthly import cover of 7 months we do not expect a sudden devaluation but a more gradual 3 5 depreciation going forward the current negative sentiment has made overall valuations very attractive with the msci bangladesh imi index trading at a trailing 12 months p e of 10 5x any positive moves on the policy front regarding grameenphone or the banking sector can lead to a big re rating in bangladesh as the macro fundamentals and earnings growth remain stable source international monetary fund cambodia 2020 will be a decisive year for cambodia as the country has benefited from the everything but arms agreement with the european union which has given cambodian exporters duty free access to the eu market worth nearly usd 6 bln due to the cambodian government s poor human rights record and hosting what was widely regarded as an unfair presidential election in 2018 the eu is undergoing a process of review whereby in february 2020 the eu may decide to rescind cambodia s access to its market on a duty free basis this could cause a significant slowdown in the country s robust 7 odd gdp growth in recent years iraq as 2019 draws to a close the iraqi equity market as measured by the rabee securities rsisx usd index rsisusd is likely to end the year down 2 5 which could mark the end of a brutal multi year bear market that saw declines of 15 0 in 2018 11 8 in 2017 17 3 in 2016 22 7 in 2015 and 25 4 in 2014 banks being the most leveraged sector to an economic recovery exhibited signs of a bottoming of fortunes in 2018 as seen from their full year earnings for the year with some resuming growth in loans and deposits in 2019 lending support to expectations for an economic recovery were upward revisions to non oil gdp by the imf for 2019 2020 from earlier estimates of 3 0 and 3 9 to 5 4 and 5 0 respectively much of this was confirmed by other macro figures which showed a strong recovery in imports in 2018 to satisfy increasing demands for consumer goods as well as continued growth of broad money or m2 as a proxy for economic activity the current demonstrations pose risks to an economic recovery as the government scrambles to meet the demands of an increasingly skeptical youth movement and many political developments have yet to happen the likely near term effect on the economy would be that the current caretaker government will follow up with implementing the current spending element of the 2019 expansionary budget in the near term extending well into 2020 the most important consequence of this would be the sustainable continuation of the consumer led economic recovery however lot of uncertainties remain kazakhstan kazakhstan should be able to continue posting steady gdp growth of close to 4 0 and we do not expect any near term pressures since the macro economic metrics of the country remain stable and the government continues to spend on infrastructure with uzbekistan opening up we expect the fund s kazakh bank holding halyk bank to take advantage of these growth opportunities as it has already begun operations in uzbekistan we expect to continue holding our investment in halyk bank kyrgyzstan kyrgyzstan is projected to grow its gdp by 3 4 in 2020 according to the international monetary fund while the kumtor gold mine generating roughly 10 of kyrgyz gdp halted production due to two workers having gone missing after a rockfall the kyrgyz government has since stated that the mine will produce 18 2 tons of gold in 2019 beating its initial forecast of 16 6 17 6 tons kyrgyzstan faces several structural issues due to its lack of competition in most sectors while also facing a high debt burden to china courtesy of the previous president s administration which is hindering growth now laos in 2020 the two items to watch will be the development of the usd 7 bln railway linking kunming china to vientiane laos as it is scheduled for completion in 2021 the impact of this infrastructure project on the laotian government s debt service is expected to grow and could impact the peg of the currency the laotian kip further persistent low water levels in the mekong is expected to lead to under utilization of the country s large dam capacity the country s largest source of foreign exchange which could impact the country s finances mongolia mongolia should see significant future upside in the value of copper exports as the commodity is already in a global deficit which is only expected to worsen into the 2020 s while the outlook for copper is bright coal exports continue to be restrained by china reaching its import quota for the year mongolia s largest bulk commodity export coal is a key contributor of gdp however as mongolia and china have grown increasingly close during the current presidency of kh battulga it would not be unreasonable to see china continuing to buy mongolian coal as long as mongolia remains politically correct in its dealings with china being the lowest cost foreign supplier of coal to china excluding north korea it makes sense for mongolia to maintain good relations with its southern neighbor in order to continue boosting its exports approximately 90 of which are to china furthermore the listing of state owned coal mine erdenes tavan tolgoi ett on the hong kong stock exchange can be a big trigger for an improvement in overall investor sentiment towards mongolian equities myanmar the myanmar government may be distracted by the ongoing investigations into the refugee crises but on the ground similar to previous years myanmar is expected to continue posting 6 gdp growth in 2020 though western governments could put more pressure on the myanmar government we believe support from china india and japan would help myanmar balance off some of this pressure on the policy front we could expect some more policy moves to attract foreign capital such as opening up the stock market to foreign investors finally from a company perspective we expect yoma strategic holdings to continue investing into its core businesses by leveraging its recent partnership with ayala corporation and we remain positive on the consumption related opportunities in myanmar pakistan a deal with the international monetary fund a devalued currency peaking interest rates a contracting current account deficit and more importantly attractive valuations have all led to a rally in the kse100 index since the end of august 2019 and we expect this positive sentiment to continue as 1 the kse100 index is still close to 50 below its may 2017 high in usd terms 2 valuations are still attractive with the kse100 index trading at a trailing 12 months p e of 9 6x 3 the state bank of pakistan sbp is expected to cut interest rates in 2020 4 profitability for cyclical companies is close to the bottom with earnings expected to see a rebound from the second half of 2020 we therefore like cyclical companies in the auto and cement sectors as their valuations and profitability have contracted significantly over the last two years and are well positioned for a rebound once interest rates ease and economic growth recovers though one caveat to the sbp cutting interest rates would be higher than expected food inflation which has picked up of late but is anticipated to ease going forward given the battering the pakistani stock market has taken over the past two years and with improving fundamentals pakistan can be a standout performer in 2020 source international monetary fund papua new guinea papua new guinea could post gdp growth of 3 4 in 2020 and this could increase once further investments in lng and mining projects kick in there are plans to double lng production and develop new gold copper and silver reserves the government is also trying to diversify its resource focused economy but this a longer term theme the fund s current exposure to papua new guinea is through one holding in the consumer space sri lanka gotabaya rajapaksa s win in the presidential election in november 2019 was a big positive for investor sentiment and the political momentum for his party the sri lanka podujana peramuna slpp making it likely that it could win the parliamentary elections in april 2020 in 2020 greater political cohesion will not only be positive for investor sentiment but also for policy making which should lead to a pick up in economic growth rates from a low base in 2019 greater policy certainty should also lead to a much needed increase in foreign direct investments to build out the country s infrastructure the tax breaks announced in the form of personal income tax concessions and lower value added taxes are expected to boost consumption as well as help consumer companies improve their volumes lower effective tax rates for the banking sector should improve the sector s return on equity while lower taxes on voice telecom services should lead to better revenue growth rates for telecom companies overall these moves should lead to higher earnings growth in 2020 the upcoming budget in april may 2020 may introduce some tweaks to these tax breaks given the country s fiscal deficit in the longer term the government would also need to contend with their debt repayments as well as debt to gdp which currently stands at 83 on balance though 2020 should be a better year for sri lankan equities due to higher earnings growth from the recent tax cuts a pick up in gdp growth and much better business sentiment due to political stability consumer companies and banks can do well in 2020 as both of these sectors are expected to see improved earnings for the above reasons source international monetary fund uzbekistan market oriented reforms should lead to uzbekistan posting gdp growth rates of 6 0 over the next five years speaking of reforms in october the capital markets development agency met with the president and agency for state asset management focused on privatizations and discussed the formulation of a capital markets strategy through the early 2020 s shortly thereafter this group announced it expects at least 4 ipo s spo s of state owned enterprises in 2020 which will help to increase liquidity and the attractiveness of the tashkent stock exchange the stock market ended november with a usd 4 8 bln market capitalization and 112 companies listed while there were significant rallies in certain listed companies 100 to 200 for the year valuations still remain highly attractive with dividends in the high single digit to low double digit range vietnam attaining gdp growth of 6 5 7 in 2020 for vietnam is realistic due to continued foreign direct investments in the manufacturing sector growth in exports and tourism and robust consumption whether china and u s stick to their phase one trade deal or not vietnam has positioned itself nicely as a manufacturing hub offering relatively lower wages improving infrastructure and political stability with respect to near term uncertainties though vietnam has outperformed the region in export growth in 2019 but the soft numbers for october and november 2019 could become a concern if such softness in export growth sustains we believe export growth of less than 6 7 in 2020 will be viewed slightly negatively by the market due to the role exports play not only in macro stability but also in job creation and consumption the african swine flu has also led to higher inflation in the past few months and though the november 2019 inflation number of 3 5 is still below the central bank s 4 0 target any move towards 4 0 or higher would make the state bank of vietnam edgy and this could lead to a pull back in loan growth similar to what we saw in the summer of 2018 however as of now the overall macro situation remains stable on the policy front we do not expect any major decisions in 2020 regarding the foreign ownership rules as the government machinery moves into planning for the change of power in 2021 so far vietnam has proved that it is a net beneficiary of trade tensions as reflected in the export and fdi numbers and we believe 2020 should be another year of stable growth as a result we continue to remain invested in companies linked to consumer discretionary industrial parks logistics and tourism which we believe are structural growth themes in vietnam to conclude the fund could see an increase in its weights to pakistan and sri lanka in 2020 due to improving fundamentals and consumer business sentiment in both of these markets our top market picks for 2020 are pakistan sri lanka uzbekistan bangladesh mongolia and vietnam some of the ways to get exposure to frontier markets in general are through etfs such as the ishares msci frontier 100 etf fm or the invesco frontier markets etf frn however besides giving exposure to asian frontier markets these etfs would also

hold saying dec 11 the current stance likely will remain appropriate unless the fed s favorable outlook for the economy sees a material reassessment he spoke after policy makers kept interest rates steady in a 1 5 to 1 75 target range following three consecutive cuts and published forecasts showing 13 of 17 officials projecting no change in rates through 2020 that would keep them on the

the scope of those purchases to short dated coupon bearing securities powell said they were not ready to take such a step but would do so if necessary what bloomberg s economists say the fed is comfortably on hold for the foreseeable future as policy makers are less concerned by the risks which justified their insurance cuts in the latter half of 2019 trade tensions below target inflation

rate such as squeezed bank profitability and risks to financial stability and christine lagarde draghi s successor at the helm of the institution has promised to assess them as part of the first strategic review since 2003 economists and investors expect rates to stay on hold and qe to continue through the whole of 2020 and beyond but the central bank may yet be tested again if the economy falters under trade uncertainties or the bloc s manufacturing meltdown spreads to the services sector what bloomberg s economists say mario draghi used the end of his tenure to shape the governing council s response to the persistent slowdown in the euro area economy president christine lagarde s first press conference confirmed policy makers are unlikely to change course over the next year

brighter after the launch of a government spending package to support growth and some signs of improvement in the global economy that s likely to keep the bank on hold for now with its key rate already in negative territory and assets on its balance sheet worth more than the nation s economy the hurdle to move again is high despite guidance the bank says is tilted toward easing still governor haruhiko kuroda will carefully monitor developments in the u s china trade talks and the economic hit from a sales tax increase in the autumn some economists are starting to doubt if the impact of the tax hike really will be smaller than on previous occasions as is hoped by policy makers but it may still take a damaging jump in the yen to move the needle at the boj what bloomberg s economists say the bank of japan heads into 2020 with significant less weight on its shoulders that s not to say the inflation and growth picture has improved but with a fiscal stimulus package in the pipeline and jgb yields comfortably within the target range there s much less urgency we expect the boj to keep its current policy framework unchanged through 2020 barring an unexpected shock yuki

cleared the way for his government to take the nation out of the european union on jan 31 and also name the u k s top regulator andrew bailey as the canadian s successor bailey who starts on march 16 will have to cope with a global slowdown and a persistent dearth of investment most worryingly another brexit deadline is already looming with the u k needing to secure a trade deal with the eu by the end of next year unless johnson asks for an extension for now concern about the outlook means two of the boe s nine policy makers want to cut interest rates all eyes will be on whether johnson s win as well as brexit developments change the picture what bloomberg s economists say weak growth momentum and below target inflation means the bank of england is likely to maintain its dovish bias in early 2020 but if our forecast plays out and the combination of looser fiscal policy and reduced brexit uncertainty lift growth next year we expect the central bank s tone to change we have penciled

year term comes to an end in june the bank of canada has cited two big reasons for resisting the global easing trend inflation has been near its 2 target for well over a year and policy makers are wary of fueling a further increase in debt one main downside from the central bank s outlier status has been a stronger currency that is hurting exporters but pressure on the bank of canada to match rate cuts by the federal reserve and others is easing there are signs the world economic outlook is stabilizing and markets are paring back bets that global monetary loosening has much left to go that

recent revision to 2018 gdp data means that the long standing goal to double the size of the economy this decade is more easily in reach that lifts some of the burden on the pboc to artificially boost the expansion what bloomberg s economists say the people s bank of china is pushing down lending rates steadily and incrementally the drop in the one year lpr in november underlines its effort to prop up growth and counter disinflationary pressures a similar fall in the five year lpr the benchmark for new mortgage loans was a surprise and suggests that a cooling housing sector is giving the

onions have pushed inflation closer to the upper end of the reserve bank of india s 2 6 target band limiting policy makers ability to support an economy expanding at its weakest pace in more than six years a much higher than expected spike in inflation was the reason for the rbi s surprise pause on rate cuts in december after delivering 135 basis points of easing in five back to back moves this year however governor shaktikanta das has made it clear that there s more space for monetary easing and a lot depends on how these actions are timed what bloomberg s economists say the reserve bank of india s shock hold on rates in december signaled that it s more concerned about a temporary surge in onion prices pushing headline inflation higher than slumping growth we expect the central bank to keep rates on hold again in february due to the further surge in onion prices since then rbi s accommodative stance signals that room for further easing is available abhishek gupta advertisement 10

points they mostly agree it should stay near the current level by end 2020 the unprecedentedly long spell of low interest rates is supported by the fact that inflation expectations remain within the official target for the next couple of years at least latin america s largest economy is also gaining traction after nearly three years of disappointing performance but the recovery remains gradual what bloomberg s economists say bcb started a new round of rate cuts last july but appears to be close to a pause anchored inflation expectations and ample economic slack base our expectation that it will remain at this level through end 2020 absent surprises an additional smaller 25bps cut in the february meeting cannot be ruled out if inflation and growth surprise on the downside or if the

rate cuts have so far failed to stoke price growth or do much to boost the sputtering economy partly because of a delay to government spending in the second half of 2019 nabiullina said in december that the effect of easing will take time and the central bank needs to wait to evaluate the impact another rate cut is possible at the next meeting in february or later in the first half but not guaranteed she said russian local currency government bonds have attracted inflows of about 16 billion this year due in part to faster than expected easing investors are waiting to see if 2020 will bring more of the same what bloomberg s economists say sliding inflation will keep one more rate cut on the table in 2020 but policy makers are likely to pause to assess the impact of 150 basis points of reductions since june if price pressure remains muted as we expect the next move could come as soon as march signs of a firmer rebound in inflation as president vladimir putin s fiscal stimulus

of 2 4 for 2020 from 2 5 4 5 this year pointing to more room for further rate cuts what bloomberg s economists say more rate reductions appear to be in the pipeline for 2020 though we expect the pace to slow dramatically the federal reserve signaled an end to its easing cycle which gives bank indonesia less room to maneuver if it wishes to maintain a wide interest rate differential in support of

expected to go up emboldened by the currency s stability in recent months the bank s monetary policy committee reduced its key rate a total of 12 percentage points exceeding all forecasts made six months ago now the return on the lira adjusted for inflation is barely on par with emerging market peers average it may prove extremely difficult for governor murat uysal to abide by his pledge to maintain a reasonable rate of return without upsetting the president who is adamant that inflation will continue to slow if the bank keeps slashing borrowing costs something that goes against accepted central bank assumptions what bloomberg s economists say the political pressure will be immense with the number of monetary policy committee meetings rising to 12 next year but the bank may be unable to deliver the president s orders high inflation will probably prevent rates from falling by more than 100 basis points although balance of risks is skewed toward deeper cuts ziad daoud advertisement

cent lower while emerging markets fell around 14 per cent with argentina turkey and venezuela plunging into crisis yet markets recovered strongly in 2019 and the post financial crisis bull run has continued so who were the winners and losers equities climb global stock markets soared an impressive 24 6 per cent in the year to november 29 while the rampant us market did even better up 27 9 per cent europe climbed nearly 20 per cent the uk more than 13 per cent and emerging markets a little more than 10 per cent msci figures show romain boscher global chief investment officer for equities at asset manager fidelity international says investor confidence grew as it became clear the us federal reserve was shifting tack on interest rate increases after four rate hikes in 2018 the fed warned of another three increases this year only to cut three times instead as growth slipped cheaper borrowing costs boosted markets by making consumers and businesses feel richer while also reducing the attraction of leaving money in low yielding cash or bonds mr boscher says company earnings also started to recover the continued resilience of the us consumer means we expect a soft landing for the global economy in 2020 emerging markets have trailed this year partly due to the impact on china of mr trump s continued trade war but kevin anderson head of investments in the asia pacific region at state street global advisers says emerging market shares offer value over the longer term investors may require a bit of patience though he says bonds hold steady the much feared bond market meltdown was averted once again and the fed can take much of the credit bonds pay a fixed rate of interest which makes them more attractive when interest rates are falling driving up bond prices david kohl head of currency research at private bank julius baer says falling inflationary expectations recession fears and ongoing trade tensions also supported bonds a traditional safe haven they posted very good returns in 2019 with moderate volatility however they offer little in the way of income with 10 year us treasuries yielding just 1 8 per cent while german and japanese government bonds have negative yields globally around 17 billion dh62 4bn of global bonds have negative yields which means investors are actually paying for the privilege of holding them cash slumps it has been another rotten year for savers with more than 30 central banks cutting interest rates around the world returns on cash continued to crash in europe switzerland and japan as well as the us mr kohl says offshore savings rates are wafer thin with hsbc s easy access saver account paying only 0 15 per cent in its us dollar version 0 10 per cent on sterling and nothing on euros forcing many to take a risk on shares to get a better return gold rises the last year has been good for gold the price up more than 17 per cent according to goldprice org the precious metal is a traditional safe haven and demand typically rises in uncertain times gold does not pay any income but that is less of a drawback given the current low or even negative yields on cash and bonds fawad razaqzada technical analyst at currency traders forex com says this has helped drive gold higher along with uncertainty over whether the stock market bull run can last gold is supported by historically low interest rates while

major currencies mr hassanain says it has had a wild ride as it plunged in the summer over fears the uk would exit the eu without a deal it only started to show signs of recovery after prime minister boris johnson struck a new withdrawal agreement with the eu he says the pound soared in the hours after mr johnson s shock election landslide which clears the path for the uk to finally exit the eu next year and put an end to all the uncertainty it then slammed into reverse after mr johnson ruled out extending the brexit transition period which means the uk will leave the eu on december 31 2020

little time to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement and means the clock is now ticking down to a cliff edge next december he says sterling nonetheless remains 10 per cent up against the dollar

fulfil possibly without negotiating an amicable future relationship us dollar still strong dr nannette hechler fayd herbe head of global economics and research at credit suisse says the dollar

gold vs cash in a financial crisis mattress stuffers or bullion holders who fares better in a crisis north american investors are divided between those who believe the decade long stock market bull is going to keep running into the 2020s and investors who wary of something terrible happening are hoarding cash and gold the hopeful and the fearful the beacon hopeful investors are following is best symbolized by analysts at bank of america merrill lynch who describe current market conditions as primed for q1 2020 net asset melt up based on continued monetary easing central bank asset purchases low interest rates and a pending resolution to the trade war a first round trade agreement between the us and china was reached last friday while roughly two in three investors polled in october said they see the global economy getting worse in 2020 in november a little more than half think the economy will improve next year never mind that melt ups typically happen at the end of asset bubbles and are usually followed by a significant stock market correction people planning to risk their money on equities next year are emboldened by strong stock market performances as the dow jones industrial average the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite indices mount their latest concerted assault on all time closing highs powered by hope that the u s and china can forge a preliminary trade accord to resolve a prolonged battle over import duties yahoo finance wrote in november year to date the three main stock market indexes have all posted impressive gains as of tuesday the s p had powered up 25 the dow was shown climbing 20 and the nasdaq had pushed a remarkable 29 higher than the start of the year among wealthy investors however a ubs survey published around the same time as the boa prognosis found a much different temperament the survey polling over 3 400 investors in 13 markets discovered these high net worth individuals are holding 25 of their portfolios in cash much higher than the 5 normally recommended by ubs global wealth management some have liquidated up to half of their investment portfolios more alarming 60 said they would think about increasing their cash holdings and 79 said the economy is moving towards higher volatility clearly these investors are reluctant to invest their hard earned capital in equities in case of an economic crisis they believe is coming while keeping one s powder dry can be a good defensive move if things truly do take a turn for the worse there are obvious risks in the form of opportunity costs over time cash heavy investors will be paid next to nothing in interest cash hoarders will also take an immediate hit to their purchasing power should the us dollar fall although the dollar has gained over the past five years due a number of reasons including low or negative interest rates interest rates minus inflation in other countries and strong us stock market returns that is far from the norm in the us there was an increase in inflation for every decade except the depression when prices shrunk nearly 20 the bureau of labor statistics consumer price index indicates that between 1860 and 2015 the dollar experienced 2 6 inflation every year meaning that 1 in 1860 was equivalent to 27 80 in 2015 the dollar has lost 98 2 of its purchasing power since 1900 while gold has become almost 54 times more valuable barron s quotes tim courtney chief investment officer of exencial wealth advisors saying over the last 40 years the dollar has done more declining than appreciating a combination of factors including the recent federal reserve rate cut a soaring u s budget deficit and lower gains for u s stocks could put the dollar back on its long term path of decline the us dollar index has seen a fair amount of volatility this year and no clear trend the buck against a basket of currencies fell to a low of 95 22 in january rose to a high of 99 38 high in september and only gained 1 year to date mattress stuffers even more interesting than hoarding cash instead of buying stocks is what nervous investors are doing with it as central banks print up to 100 billion per month to smooth volatility and goose economic growth an equivalent amount in hard currency and precious metals is disappearing according to the wall street journal banks are issuing more notes than ever and yet they seem to be disappearing off the face of the earth central banks don t know where they have gone or why and are playing detective trying to crack the same mystery for example in australia the number of bank notes issued relative to the size of its economy is near the highest in 50 years yet only about a quarter of these notes is used in everyday transactions up to 8 are used in the shadow economy to avoid taxes or make illegal payments and as much as 10 may have been lost an astonishing sum amounting to aud 7 6 billion usd 5 2 billion much of the 1 7 trillion in us cash circulating in 2018 went offshore where the dollars were either stashed in bank accounts or invested in hard assets like real estate and gold in 2016 a fed economist estimated about three quarters of 100 bills worth 900 billion left the country wsj points to a couple of strange cases of cash hoarding including construction workers on australia s gold coast digging up 140 000 in buried bill packages and a man in germany who sued a friend that inadvertently burned 500 000 euros he had hidden in a faulty boiler while on vacation gold hoarders investors are also turning to gold as a safe bet against market uncertainty the yellow metal is the ultimate store of value proven to have held its worth over time unlike paper or fiat currencies which are subject to inflationary pressures and over the years lose their value in laying out the case for gold goldman sachs recently noted that 2019 is looking to break another record for central bank gold purchases an estimated 750 tons beating the record 651 tons accumulated last year according to the world council 2018 s central bank gold haul was 74 more than 2017 and the highest amount since the gold standard ended in 1971 here s where it gets weird goldman also discovered over the past three years 1 200 tons of gold flows worth 57 billion that mysteriously disappeared from the official record check out the charts below showing the correlation between unexplained gold flows and increased global uncertainty figure 17 and how the amount of physical gold has soared higher than gold etf holdings figure 18 gold beats cash stocks that got me thinking in the event of a major meltdown such as the financial crisis or the dot com crash which fares better cash or gold according to forbes contributor olivier garrett it s a no brainer gold in the table below garrett highlights 2002 and 2008 the years corresponding to the dot com crash and the financial crisis in those years all asset classes except cash and treasury bills bled red ink treasuries gained a respective 10 3 and 5 2 while cash showed a more modest 1 6 and 1 4 uptick he therefore suggests investors worried about the next downturn should own both t bills and cash how did gold do in those recessionary years the precious metal was up 24 7 in 2002 and 2 7 in 2008 gold also beat stocks during the past two downturns the chart below shows gold finishing the year ahead of the s p 500 eight times since 2001 the only years that gold showed a negative return were 2012 and 2015 corresponding to gold s last bear market in 2002 when gold gained 24 7 the s p 500 was down over 20 its 2 7 gain in 2008 compares with the s p s awful 38 from early november 2008 to march 2009 the financial crisis market bottom the s p fell 30 while gold was up almost the same amount it s common knowledge that gold zigs when the market zags this has proven the case throughout history the table below from goldsilver blog depicts gold besting the s p 500 in all but two of the s p s biggest declines since 1976 the metal s only significant sell off 46 during the early 1980s came just after its biggest bull market in modern history however it s also important to recognize that gold doesn t necessarily perform well at the beginning of financial crises in the chart below from sunshine profits during the most significant crises of the 20th century in all cases gold declined initially this pattern held true during the 1982 latin american debt crisis the japanese stock market bubble burst in 1990 the asian financial crisis of 1997 the 2000 dot com bubble burst and the lehman brothers bankruptcy in 2008 the latter event resulted in a brief leg down for gold before its relentless climb to a record setting 1 900 an ounce over the next four years finally motley fool contributor reuben gregg brewer uses the financial crisis to demonstrate how gold and stocks behaved it s not a directly inverse correlation between december 1 2007 and may 30 2009 the s p 500 crashed 37 while gold rose 24 however one has to take a long view to realize gold s gains brewer notes that when the recession first hit gold went up nearly 30 but at one point it dropped 10 that kind of volatility might scare off some investors but sticking with it over the length of the recession would have been wise overall gold held its own at at time when stocks just kept falling states brewer and while gold and the stock market generally show an inverse correlation the world gold council found that between 1987 and 2010 only when stock prices moved dramatically ie two standard deviations from the norm did their relationship to gold turn negative it seems that for investors to jump into gold when all hell is breaking loose on the markets it needs to be a major crisis wondering how much gold you need to gold to make it through a financial crisis another interesting table from the same source is shown below based on 1 300 oz gold someone with 3 000 of monthly expenses would need 45 oz to last them through a two year crisis and 90 oz if the crisis drags on for four years ninety ounces equates to roughly 90 gold eagle coins 1 coin 1 0909 troy ounces a standard gold bar held by central banks weighs 400 troy ounces the coming debt crisis during the dot com crash it was up start overvalued internet companies that hit the skids during the financial crisis the us real estate bubble burst taking several american banks and a few overseas ones with it many are predicting the next asset bubble to pop will be unsustainable levels of debt the us national debt that is the amount of debt held by the federal government recently surpassed 23 trillion having jumped 1 3 trillion in the 12 months leading up to november the gross national debt driven by congressional borrowing rose 5 6 up to the third quarter compared to the same period last year against nominal gdp of just 3 7 in other words debt is outrunning economic growth wolfstreet asks a good question if the growth of the federal debt outruns the economy during these fabulously good times what will the debt do when the recession hits when government tax receipts plunge and government expenditures for unemployment and the like soar the federal debt will jump by 2 5 trillion or more in a 12 month period that s what it will do worldwide total debt including household corporate and sovereign loans during the first half of 2019 rose by 7 5 trillion to hit a record 250 trillion led by the us and china encouraged by lower interest rates governments went on a borrowing binge as they ramped up spending adding 3 trillion to world debt in q1 alone according to the world bank countries whose debt to gdp ratios are above 77 for long periods experience significant slowdowns in economic growth every percentage point above 77 knocks 1 7 off gdp according to the study via investopedia the united states current debt to gdp ratio is 106 5 according to its latest projections the congressional budget office says debt to gdp will reach 150 by 2047 well past the point where financial crises typically occur the budget deficit is also likely to rise nearly tripling from 2 9 of gdp to 9 8 in 2047 this can t go on forever it s not a stretch to envision a scenario whereby the world s reserve currency the us dollar collapses under the weight of unmanageable debt triggered say by a mass offloading of us treasuries by foreign countries that currently own about 6 trillion of us debt this would cause the dollar to crash and interest rates would go through the roof choking consumer and business borrowing import prices would skyrocket too the result of a low dollar hitting consumers in the pocket book for everything not made in the usa business confidence would plummet mass layoffs would occur growth would stop and the us would enter a recession all the countries that sold their treasuries would then face a major slump in demand for their products from american consumers their largest market eventually companies in these countries would begin to suffer plus all other nations that trade with the us like canada and mexico before long the recession in the us would spread like a cancer to the rest of the world it isn t just sovereign debt that is being constantly added to as governments around the world spend beyond their means it s also corporations and individuals according to the imf nearly 40 of the corporate debt of major economies including the us china japan germany britain france italy and spain is at risk of default in the event of another global economic downturn in china corporate bond debt defaults this year have surged almost 10 times 2014 levels meanwhile the average north american is going deeper and deeper in debt their confidence to spend fueled by continued low interest rates earlier this year consumer debt in the united states hit 4 trillion for the first time total credit card debt surpassed 1 trillion with the average american holding a balance of 4 923 a credit card survey quoted by cnbc says more than one third of americans 86 million people are afraid they ll max out their credit card when making a large purchase which most considered to be anything over 100 the interest rate on credit cards has risen from 15 11 in 2017 to a current average of 21 4 that is despite the us federal reserve lowering interest rates three times since august as incomes fail to keep up with spending the difference financed by credit the middle class is eroding made worse by a drop in the number of middle income jobs through off shoring and automation the share of adults living in middle income households declined from 61 in 1971 to just 50 in 2015 two thirds of the 11 that were no longer middle class migrated to upper income levels while a third became poorer and that gap continues to widen the richest 400 americans now control more wealth than the bottom 60 it s the greatest rich poor divide since the 1920s a 2019 report by mckinsey global institute piles on more evidence of inequality getting worse while the consulting firm notes the gap between developed and developing economies is shrinking particularly with the rise of china and india in many advanced economies the trend is for the rich to pull away from the middling and the poor yet politicians are oblivious to rising inequality and unsustainable debt while donald trump touts the us economy as the greatest of all time he is reportedly poised to sign a massive 1 4 trillion worth of government spending into law here in canada justin trudeau s liberals were re elected on a plan to double down on the nation s deficit which would peak at 27 4 billion next year far exceeding the 14 billion deficit recorded in 2018 19 the messages to the masses is obvious it s okay to spend beyond your means in fact the us government prefers even lower interest rates and more quantitative easing so it can go even deeper in debt and companies can keep buying back more of their own stock in order to boost their earnings per share and the stock market keeps rolling right along artificially low interest rates also hurt the average person although unemployment is reduced because companies borrow more and do more hiring easier credit and low mortgage rates encourage over spending and over borrowing sucking a lot of people into a debt trap from which it is hard to escape as one commentator aptly put it essentially the citizens become dreary rats on a treadmill while the government tells them they are winning the gold medal in the olympics conclusion the plains indians had an innovative way of hunting buffalo find a very steep cliff and drive the poor hapless creatures over it this is quite a good analogy for the current dangerously over leveraged situation many developed economies find themselves in here the hunters are the governments and the buffalo running to their deaths are their gullible populations who have drunk the cool aid of a consumptive lifestyle financed by endless debt the next bubble the debt bubble keeps building fed by growing inequality rapacious corporations who use tax breaks to buy back their own stock to artificially inflate their share prices individuals who remain enslaved to the banks that reap enormous profits from them as they descend further into debt and politicians who encourage the whole charade by cutting corporate tax rates keeping interest rates near zero and borrowing more through deficit financing to please the interest groups that keep them in power it s no wonder that people have taken to hoarding gold the only thing that matters when the shit hits the

let us remember that when macri started his mandate in december 2015 he accepted all the injunctions formulated by a new york magistrate who had ruled in the favor of vulture funds against argentina this has made it possible for those investment funds specializing in repurchasing sovereign securities at cut prices to garner 4 6 billion a 300 profit the vulture how billionaire rubio backer paul singer made billions off argentina debt crisis to compensate these vulture funds mauricio macri borrowed on the financial markets he claimed that everything would be fine since implementing neoliberal policies would make argentina more attractive to foreign investors and lenders international mainstream media supported him when invited to comment experts in economics presented macri s argentina as a success story issuing in 2017 bonds that would come to maturity one hundred years later 2117 was hailed as the ultimate proof of macri s pro market neoliberal success in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend in fact the success of those bonds had a completely different explanation the interest rate every year for one hundred years is 7 25 with an actual return on the initial purchase price of 7 917 for the bonds were sold at a cut price to attract investors at the same time in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend their success was thus in no way evidence of the argentine economy s good health there is such a huge amount of capital intended for speculation and not for productive investment that any state that issues sovereign securities with a return that is higher than average is likely to find takers here is an example of comments to be found in the press heralding the 100 year bonds argentina sold 2 75 billion of a hotly demanded 100 year bond in u s dollars on monday just over a year after emerging from its latest default according to the government the south american country received 9 75 billion in orders for the bond as investors eyed a yield of 7 9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds need to lock in long term returns this reuters report clearly celebrates the country s achievement argentina sees strong demand for surprise 100 year bond one year earlier in april 2016 reuters reported marking a rare bright spot among gloomy emerging markets argentina sold 16 5 billion of sovereign debt on tuesday in its first international bond issue since its record 2002 default investors seemed convinced of strategy argentina received offers worth 68 6 billion from investors around the world anybody will understand from such hyperbolic comments that major capitalist corporations all over the world were on the lookout for opportunities to obtain high yield by purchasing high risk securities it does not tell anything about argentina s economic health potential lenders such as investment funds or major banks thought that argentine securities would be guaranteed by the state of argentina and that if necessary they could seek favorable adjudication in the jurisdiction of new york they were right since the loan agreements were made in accordance with the law of the state of new york anyway they were also convinced that in case of necessity the imf would bail out the government of argentina so that it may repay its debt to private funds as it had always done another argument was the following argentina s underground resources are significant and if hard pressed argentina could increase production in order to meet lenders expectations in short in 2016 2017 while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital but the situation took a turn for the worse in 2018 as a consequence of several negative factors resulting from macri s policies such as a steep rise in the amount of interests to be paid which had to be financed by ever new loans massive flight of capital that was made possible by a most lax policy of complete freedom for capital to leave the country it showed that argentine capitalists had limited confidence in macri s future and preferred shopping elsewhere including buying argentine external debt securities in us dollars on wall street currency reserves sharply dropped production started to decline and argentina slipped into recession employment plummeted most people s purchasing power dropped as a consequence of the government s and bosses attacks as a result domestic consumption that accounted for 70 of argentina s gdp also dropped the argentine peso gradually sunk while 22 pesos bought one euro on 1st january 2018 32 pesos were needed on 16 june 2018 in this context in june 2018 macri called on the imf as foreign investors and argentine capitalists had anticipated the imf is back in argentina â an economic and social crisis even more serious than the present one looms large on the horizon the total credit promised by the imf rose to 57 billion with 44 1 billion actually paid up to now as a first step in june 2018 the amount of 50 billion had been announced and a few months later as the situation had not improved 7 more billion were added this is the highest ever loan granted by the imf the imf s loan to greece in 2010 was 30 billion as usual the imf demanded even stricter austerity policies that were even more unpopular than those already introduced by macri argentina in turmoil in october 2019 the argentine people turned away from macri and elected the peron political movement back into office after an intermission of four years alberto fernandez became president and cristina fernandez who was president from 2007 to 2015 vice president alberto and cristina are not related the cadtm s latin american and caribbean network cadtm ayna held its 8th annual assembly in preparation of alberto fernandez succeeding mauricio macri as president 10 december 2019 i participated in the meeting as well as in several talks and debates including one at the parliament of argentina i also gave four interviews fifteen minutes live on a popular private and anti macri tv channel a video for an information website canal abierto connected with the main civil service trade union one on the main website of the revolutionary left laizquierdadiario the daily paper of the left which has an average of two million visits per month and one to the main center left newspaper pagina 12 the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population in the days before macri left the presidency to the two fernandezs debt repayment was the most debated issue on the other hand we should emphasize that social and political movements in argentina are massive and well organized trade unions are still powerful the feminist movement is still able to mobilize on a large scale the unemployed too are well organized the cooperative movement is strong the various neoliberal experiments that started with the dictatorship 1976 1983 and that had their latest attempt under macri have not been able to fracture the argentine society and contrary to what is the case in neighboring chile education is free including at university level as indeed is health care the questions most often raised in argentine media during the november december 2019 period while the previous government had suspended repayment of part of the internal debt will the new government repay the accumulated debt and implement policies that have been rejected by a majority of the people what should be done with the imf agreements since the imf is expected to pay argentina 11 to 13 billion must the new government demand those payments or withdraw from them should not argentina suspend debt repayment for two years so as to make sure that economic activity resumes properly and make later debt repayment sustainable this is a suggestion by martin guzman an argentine economist who teaches in new york and works with joseph stiglitz nobel laureate for economy guzman has just been appointed minister for economy and finance in alberto fernandez new government meet martã n guzmán argentina s next economy minister a majority of the people clearly reject the imf whose deleterious impact on argentina is obvious to all and sundry it has to be remembered that after the second world war president juan domingo perón had turned down his country s adhesion to the imf an institution he exposed as an instrument of imperialism argentina only joined the imf in 1956 during the military dictatorship of general pedro eugenio aramburu silveti who overthrew the constitutional president juan domingo perón in 1955 twenty years later the imf actively supported the bloody dictatorship of general jorge rafael videla who was responsible for the assassination of over 30 000 left wing opponents in the 1990s the imf put argentina under pressure to turn it into one of the most active countries in terms of privatizations and structural adjustment this eventually resulted in the massive upheaval of december 2001 which led to the fall of president fernando de la rãºa during the public lectures organized by attac cadtm in collaboration with some ten other associations in buenos aires from 27 to 29 november 2019 i had the opportunity as international spokesperson for the cadtm to put forward a number of proposals to face the argentine debt crisis those proposals are the result of wide ranging debates within the cadtm network this was also the case at a hearing held in the parliament of argentina on 27 november at the initiative of economist fernanda vallejos an mp in the new presidential majority see my contribution in spanish deuda externa alternativas para una solución soberana the following is a summary of my points and proposals there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself according to this doctrine a debt is deemed odious and nullified if it fulfils two conditions it was taken on against the interests of the nation the people or the state the creditors are unable to prove that they were unaware that the debt was contrary to the interests of the nation it is to be pointed out that the nature of the political regime or the government is not taken into consideration in the doctrine the deciding factor is the use that is made of the debt if a democratically elected government puts its population into debt against their best interest this debt may be deemed odious it is erroneous to say that only debts taken on by dictatorial regimes may be deemed odious see the doctrine of odious debt from alexander sack to the cadtm there should be no hesitation in arguing the doctrine of odious debt because it is particularly applicable to the situation in which argentina finds itself it is fundamental that argentina unilaterally takes sovereign measures to improve its debt situation five principal examples pass laws prohibiting vulture funds suspend debt repayments bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities setting up a citizens debt audit repudiation of current agreements with the imf 1 pass laws prohibiting vulture funds as belgium showed in 2008 and again in 2015 it is possible to pass laws restricting vulture funds see renaud vivien analyse de la loi belge du 12 juillet 2015 contre les fonds vautours et de sa conformité au droit de l ue in french the act of law is quite simple an investment fund cannot reclaim sums superior to what it paid to acquire treasury bills in fact vulture funds purchase the sovereign debts of countries with repayment difficulties at junk prices and then apply legal pressure on the government concerned to pay in full and so make profits sometimes amounting to several hundred per cent of their initial layout if argentina passed a similar law it would have some protection against vulture funds if many countries did the same vulture funds would be neutralized the practice of designating foreign jurisdictions such as new york or london with laws that are favourable to creditors as competent in the case of sovereign debt litigations must end 2 suspend debt repayments suspending debt repayments is one of the possibilities that permit governments to deal with financial and or humanitarian crises the country may declare suspension unilaterally many have done so it was the case of argentina between 2001 and 2005 for a total of â 80 billion and the benefits followed in a collective book published by oup in 2010 stiglitz claims that russia in 1998 and argentina in the 2000s are proof that a unilateral suspension of debt repayment can be beneficial for countries that make this decision both theory and evidence suggest that the threat of a cut off of credit has probably been exaggerated p 48 when a country succeeds in enforcing debt relief on its creditors and uses funds that were formerly meant for repayment in order to finance an expansionist tax policy this yields positive results under this scenario the number of the firms that are forced into bankruptcy is lowered both because of the lower interest rates and because of the improved overall economic performance of the economy that follows as the economy strengthens government tax revenues increase â again improving the fiscal position of the government all this means that the government s fiscal position is stronger going forward making it more not less likely that creditors will be willing to again provide finance p 48 in an article published in journal of development economics under the title the elusive costs of sovereign defaults eduardo levy yeyati and ugo panizza two economists who worked for the inter american development bank set out the findings of their thorough inquiry into defaulting in some forty countries one of their main conclusions is that default episodes mark the beginning of the economic recovery it could not be better put as was already done in 2001 argentina should not hesitate to declare a new unlimited suspension of payments the recuperated amounts could be used to stimulate consumer spending and economic activities favouring the population two years would appear to be a minimum period to achieve lasting results with the possibility of prolonging the period it is recommended to suspend selectively small savers and shareholders as well as public pension schemes should be exempted from suspension on the domestic debt this means that they would continue to be paid it is quite right to make this discrimination in order to protect the weaker investors and public institutions it is the big private investors and the imf who are to be defaulted 3 bond holders must be registered with the buenos aires authorities argentine authorities should revive the practice of the first half of the 20th century that established lists of bond holders in the litigation between mexico and its creditors in the 1940s the creditors were obliged to make themselves known and have their certificates rubber stamped or be excluded from settlement this permitted the cancellation of 90 of the mexican debt see mexico proved that debt can be repudiated registering bond holders makes it possible to sort big and small private and public bond holders in order to favour small and public holders 4 setting up a citizens debt audit to have a clear idea of the stakes and sums involved and a solid legal arsenal it is essential to conduct an audit of the debt under citizens control an audit would show how much of the debt possibly an overwhelming part may be deemed illegal or odious and could be the way forward towards debt repudiation and or a unilateral restructuring the real reason the imf granted such a huge loan was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms 5 repudiation of current agreements with the imf as has been shown by many observers and argentine jurists the agreements made with the imf by mauricio macri are contrary to the country s and the people s interests when the imf granted a loan of 57 billion to the macri government it transgressed its own rules that state that the imf can only grant loans if as a consequence the borrowing country s debt becomes sustainable which is not at all the case as evidenced less than a year later macri also transgressed the argentine constitution that requires that the signature of such an agreement that has the value of an international treaty must be debated in parliament and then be ratified by parliament the real reason the loan was granted was because the us president donald trump wanted to help macri remain in power in spite of the crisis and win the 2019 elections to implement policies that favoured the us in political military and economic terms as the argentine electors have disavowed macri s policies and macri had transgressed the argentine constitution the new government would have the right to refuse to validate the agreement this is a text book case of odious debt when a country sees regime change the new government is not held to respect the debts of its predecessors if they were taken on against the interest of the nation or the people and in the former regime s own advantage in this case to remain in power and it is clear that the imf directors were aware of the context it is important that argentina does not make the same errors of debt negotiation as in the 2002 2010 period see the analysis by maud bailly and eric toussaint the mixed fortunes of argentina s 2005 and 2010 debt restructuring the above measures should be part and parcel of a larger programme that would include capital controls socialization of the banking sector tax reforms measures against the extractivist exportation market model and ecological policies among others in conclusion a new situation will arise in argentina as from december 2019 a new government must face up to a serious debt crisis it is fundamental that a large popular social and political front be created in order by all necessary means to promote the solutions that will liberate the argentine people from the burden of illegitimate and odious debt translated by mike krolikowski and christine pagnoulle for cadtm
let us remember that when macri started his mandate in december 2015 he accepted all the injunctions formulated by a new york magistrate who had ruled in the favor of vulture funds against argentina this has made it possible for those investment funds specializing in repurchasing sovereign securities at cut prices to garner 4 6 billion a 300 profit the vulture how billionaire rubio backer paul singer made billions off argentina debt crisis to compensate these vulture funds mauricio macri borrowed on the financial markets he claimed that everything would be fine since implementing neoliberal policies would make argentina more attractive to foreign investors and lenders international mainstream media supported him when invited to comment experts in economics presented macri s argentina as a success story issuing in 2017 bonds that would come to maturity one hundred years later 2117 was hailed as the ultimate proof of macri s pro market neoliberal success in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend in fact the success of those bonds had a completely different explanation the interest rate every year for one hundred years is 7 25 with an actual return on the initial purchase price of 7 917 for the bonds were sold at a cut price to attract investors at the same time in early june 2017 bankers could borrow at 0 from the ecb the bank of japan and the swiss national bank at 0 25 from the bank of england and at 1 00 from the federal reserve in the us while investment funds had huge amounts of cash and return on public debt securities in the north was very low or even negative argentine bonds at 7 25 over one hundred years was a godsend their success was thus in no way evidence of the argentine economy s good health there is such a huge amount of capital intended for speculation and not for productive investment that any state that issues sovereign securities with a return that is higher than average is likely to find takers here is an example of comments to be found in the press heralding the 100 year bonds argentina sold 2 75 billion of a hotly demanded 100 year bond in u s dollars on monday just over a year after emerging from its latest default according to the government the south american country received 9 75 billion in orders for the bond as investors eyed a yield of 7 9 percent in an otherwise low yielding fixed income market where pension funds need to lock in long term returns this reuters report clearly celebrates the country s achievement argentina sees strong demand for surprise 100 year bond one year earlier in april 2016 reuters reported marking a rare bright spot among gloomy emerging markets argentina sold 16 5 billion of sovereign debt on tuesday in its first international bond issue since its record 2002 default investors seemed convinced of strategy argentina received offers worth 68 6 billion from investors around the world anybody will understand from such hyperbolic comments that major capitalist corporations all over the world were on the lookout for opportunities to obtain high yield by purchasing high risk securities it does not tell anything about argentina s economic health potential lenders such as investment funds or major banks thought that argentine securities would be guaranteed by the state of argentina and that if necessary they could seek favorable adjudication in the jurisdiction of new york they were right since the loan agreements were made in accordance with the law of the state of new york anyway they were also convinced that in case of necessity the imf would bail out the government of argentina so that it may repay its debt to private funds as it had always done another argument was the following argentina s underground resources are significant and if hard pressed argentina could increase production in order to meet lenders expectations in short in 2016 2017 while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital while argentina s real economy was collapsing the government managed to find lenders and its right wing government was praised in international media as well as by the imf and by other governments in the hold of big capital but the situation took a turn for the worse in 2018 as a consequence of several negative factors resulting from macri s policies such as a steep rise in the amount of interests to be paid which had to be financed by ever new loans massive flight of capital that was made possible by a most lax policy of complete freedom for capital to leave the country it showed that argentine capitalists had limited confidence in macri s future and preferred shopping elsewhere including buying argentine external debt securities in us dollars on wall street currency reserves sharply dropped production started to decline and argentina slipped into recession employment plummeted most people s purchasing power dropped as a consequence of the government s and bosses attacks as a result domestic consumption that accounted for 70 of argentina s gdp also dropped the argentine peso gradually sunk while 22 pesos bought one euro on 1st january 2018 32 pesos were needed on 16 june 2018 in this context in june 2018 macri called on the imf as foreign investors and argentine capitalists had anticipated the imf is back in argentina â an economic and social crisis even more serious than the present one looms large on the horizon the total credit promised by the imf rose to 57 billion with 44 1 billion actually paid up to now as a first step in june 2018 the amount of 50 billion had been announced and a few months later as the situation had not improved 7 more billion were added this is the highest ever loan granted by the imf the imf s loan to greece in 2010 was 30 billion as usual the imf demanded even stricter austerity policies that were even more unpopular than those already introduced by macri argentina in turmoil in october 2019 the argentine people turned away from macri and elected the peron political movement back into office after an intermission of four years alberto fernandez became president and cristina fernandez who was president from 2007 to 2015 vice president alberto and cristina are not related the cadtm s latin american and caribbean network cadtm ayna held its 8th annual assembly in preparation of alberto fernandez succeeding mauricio macri as president 10 december 2019 i participated in the meeting as well as in several talks and debates including one at the parliament of argentina i also gave four interviews fifteen minutes live on a popular private and anti macri tv channel a video for an information website canal abierto connected with the main civil service trade union one on the main website of the revolutionary left laizquierdadiario the daily paper of the left which has an average of two million visits per month and one to the main center left newspaper pagina 12 the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population the rate of poverty strongly increased over the four years of macri s mandate going from 27 to 40 of the population in the days before macri left the presidency to the two fernandezs debt repayment was the most debated issue on the other hand we should emphasize that social and political movements in argentina are massive and well organized trade unions are still powerful the feminist movement is still able to mobilize on a large scale the unemployed too are well organized the cooperative movement is strong the various neoliberal experiments that started with the dictatorship 1976 1983 and that had their latest attempt under macri have not been able to fracture the argentine society and contrary to what is the case in neighboring chile education is free including at university level as indeed is health care the questions most often raised in argentine media during the november december 2019 period while the previous government had suspended repayment of part of the internal debt will the new government repay the accumulated debt and implement policies that have been rejected by a majority of the people what should be done with the imf agreements since the imf is expected to pay argentina 11 to 13 billion must the new government demand those payments or withdraw from them should not argentina suspend debt repayment for two years so as to make sure that economic activity resumes properly and make later debt repayment sustainable this is a suggestion by martin guzman an argentine economist who teaches in new york and works with joseph stiglitz nobel laureate for economy guzman has just been appointed minister for economy and finance in alberto fernandez new government meet martã n guzmán argentina s next economy minister a majority of the people clearly reject the imf whose deleterious impact on argentina is obvious to all and sundry it has to be remembered that after the second world war president juan domingo perón had turned down his country s adhesion to the imf an institution he exposed as an instrument of imperialism argentina only joined the imf in 1956 during the military dictatorship of general pedro eugenio aramburu silveti who overthrew the constitutional president juan domingo perón in 1955 twenty years later the imf actively supported the bloody dictatorship of general jorge rafael videla who was responsible for the assassination of over 30 000 left wing opponents in the 1990s the imf put argentina under pressure to turn it into one of the most active countries in terms of privatizations and structural adjustment this eventually resulted in the massive upheaval of december 2001 which led to the fall of president fernando de la rãºa during the public lectures organized by attac cadtm in collaboration with some ten other associations in buenos aires from 27 to 29 november 2019 i had the opportunity as international spokesperson for the cadtm to put forward a number of proposals to face the argentine debt crisis those proposals are the result of wide ranging debates

that the pipeline makes europe even more reliant on russia which supplies about a third of europe s gas needs germany and the eu condemned the us sanctions but do not appear prepared to impose

simple conceit radical actions ballooning balance sheet merry christmas and the happiest new year ignoring problems rarely solves them you need to deal with them not just the effects but the underlying causes or else they usually get worse the older you get the more you know that is true in almost every area of life in the developed world and especially the us and even in china our economic challenges are rapidly approaching that point things that would have been easily fixed a decade ago or even five years ago will soon be unsolvable by conventional means there is almost no willingness to face our top problems specifically our rising debt the economic challenges we face can t continue which is why i expect the great reset a kind of worldwide do over it s not the best choice but we are slowly ruling out all others last week i talked about the political side of this our embrace of either crony capitalism or welfare statism is going to end very badly ideological positions have hardened to the point that compromise seems impossible central bankers are politicians in a sense and in some ways far more powerful and dangerous than the elected ones some recent events provide a glimpse of where they re taking us hint it s nowhere good and when you combine it with the fiscal shenanigans it s far worse simple conceit central banks weren t always as responsibly irresponsible as my friend paul mcculley would say as they are today walter bagehot one of the early editors of the economist wrote what came to be called bagehot s dictum for central banks as the lender of last resort during a financial or liquidity crisis the central bank should lend freely at a high interest rate on good securities the federal reserve came about as a theoretical antidote to even worse occasional panics and bank failures clearly it had a spotty record through 1945 as there were many mistakes made in the 20s and especially the 30s the loose monetary policy coupled with fiscal incontinence of the 70s gave us an inflationary crisis paul volcker s recent passing rip reminds us of perhaps the fed s finest hour stamping out the inflation that threatened the livelihood of millions however volcker had to do that only because of past mistakes recently reader mourad rahmanov who has thought provoking and sometimes lengthy reactions to almost every letter kindly sent me some of his personal favorite john mauldin quotes one was this passage which succinctly captures my feelings about the fed context this was part of my response to ray dalio s comments on modern monetary theory beginning with greenspan we have now had 30 years of ever looser monetary policy accompanied by lower rates this created a series of asset bubbles whose demises wreaked economic havoc artificially low rates created the housing bubble exacerbated by regulatory failure and reinforced by a morally bankrupt financial system and with the system completely aflame we asked the arsonist to put out the fire with very few observers acknowledging the irony yes we did indeed need the federal reserve to provide liquidity during the initial crisis but after that the fed kept rates too low for too long reinforcing the wealth and income disparities and creating new bubbles we will have to deal with in the not too distant future this wasn t a beautiful deleveraging as you call it it was the ugly creation of bubbles and misallocation of capital the fed shouldn t have blown these bubbles in the first place the simple conceit that 12 men and women sitting around the table can decide the most important price in the world short term interest rates better than the market itself is beginning to wear thin keeping rates too low for too long in the current cycle brought massive capital misallocation it resulted in the financialization of a significant part of the business world in the us and elsewhere the rules now reward management not for generating revenue but to drive up the price of the share price thus making their options and stock grants more valuable coordinated monetary policy is the problem not the solution and while i have little hope for change in that regard i have no hope that monetary policy will rescue us from the next crisis let me amplify that last line not only is there no hope monetary policy will save us from the next crisis it will help cause the next crisis the process has already begun radical actions in september of this year something still unexplained at least to my satisfaction although i know many analysts who believe they know the reasons happened in the repo short term financing market liquidity dried up interest rates spiked and the fed stepped in to save the day i wrote about it at the time in decoding the fed story over no the fed has had to keep saving the day every day since then we hear different theories the most frightening one is that the repo market itself is actually fine but a bank is wobbly and the billions in daily liquidity are preventing its collapse who might it be i have been told by well connected sources that it could be a mid sized japanese bank i was dubious because it would be hard to keep such a thing hidden for months but then this week bloomberg reported some japanese banks badly hurt by the boj s negative rate policy have turned to riskier debt to survive so perhaps it s fair to wonder whatever the cause the situation doesn t seem to be improving on dec 12 a new york fed statement said its trading desk would increase its repo operations around year end to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures notice at the link how the ny fed describes its plans the desk will offer at least 150 billion here and at least 75 billion there that s not how debt normally works lenders give borrowers a credit limit not a credit guarantee plus an implied promise of more the us doesn t yet have negative rates but the fed is giving banks negative credit limits in a very precise violation of bagehot s dictum we have also just finished a decade of the loosest monetary policy in american history the partial tightening cycle notwithstanding something is very wrong if banks still don t have enough reserves to keep markets liquid part of it may be that regulations outside the fed s control prevent banks from using their reserves as needed but that doesn t explain why it suddenly became a problem in september necessitating radical action that continues today here s the official line from minutes of the unscheduled oct 4 meeting at which the fomc approved the operation staff analysis and market commentary suggested that many factors contributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid september in particular financial institutions internal risk limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the distribution of liquidity across the system at a time when reserves had dropped sharply and treasury issuance was elevated so the fed blames internal risk limits and balance sheet costs at banks what are these risks and costs they were unwilling to accept and why we still don t know there are lots of theories some even make sense whatever the reason it was severe enough to make the committee agree to both repo operations and the purchase of 20 billion a month in treasury securities and another 20 billion in agencies they insist the latter isn t qe but it sure walks and quacks like a qe duck so i and many others call it qe4 as we learned with previous qe rounds exiting is hard remember that 2013 taper tantrum ben bernanke s mild hint that asset purchases might not continue forever infuriated a liquidity addicted wall street the fed needed a couple more years to start draining the pool and then did so in the stupidest possible way by both raising rates and selling assets at the same time i don t feel good saying i told you so but well i did having said that i have to note the fed has few good choices as mistakes compound over time it must pick the least bad alternative but with each such decision the future options grow even worse so eventually instead of picking the least bad they will have to pick the least disastrous one that point is drawing closer ballooning balance sheet underlying all this is an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the us government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted this week foreign selling of us notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling us rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy us debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the us treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially given the fact that president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not many factors are at work here but it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the gavekal chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening louis gave wrote a brilliant essay recently behind their pay wall but perhaps he will make it more public considering four possible reasons for the present valuation dichotomies i ll quote the first one because i believe it is right on target 1 the fed s balance sheet expansion is only temporary the argument the fed s current liquidity injection program is not a genuine effort at quantitative easing by the us central bank instead it is merely a short term liquidity program to ensure that markets and especially the repo markets continue to operate smoothly in about 15 weeks time the fed will stop injecting liquidity into the system as a result the market is already looking through the current liquidity injections to the time when the fed goes cold turkey once again this explains why bond yields are not rising more why the us dollar isn t falling faster and so on my take this is a distinct possibility but then as milton friedman used to say nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program the question here is why did the repo markets freeze in mid to late september was it just a technical glitch or did the spike in short rates reflect the fact that the appetite of the us private sector and foreign investors for short dated us government debt has reached its limit in short did the repo market reach its wafer thin mint moment if it was a technical glitch then the fed will indeed be able to back off come the spring however if as i believe the repo market was not the trouble but merely a symptom of a bigger problem excessive growth in us budget deficits then it is hard to see how six months before a us election the fed will be able to climb back out of the full on us government monetization rabbit hole in which it is now fully immersed in this scenario the markets will come to an interesting crossroads around the ides of march at that point the fed will have to take one of two paths 1 the fed does indeed stop its non qe qe program in this scenario us and global equities are likely to take a nasty spill in an election year that will trigger a twitterstorm of epic proportions from the us president 2 the fed confirms that the six month temporary liquidity injection program is to be extended for another temporary six months at this point bond yields everywhere around the world will shoot up the us dollar will likely take a nasty spill global equities will outperform us equities and value will outperform growth etc looking at the us government s debt dynamics i believe the second option is much more likely and it is all the more probable since triggering a significant equity pull back a few months before the us presidential election could threaten the fed s independence still the first option does remain a possibility which may well help to explain the market s cautious positioning despite today s coordinated fiscal and monetary policies ex china just this week congress passed and president trump signed massive spending bills to avoid a government shutdown there was a silver lining both parties made concessions in areas each considers important republicans got a lot more to spend on defense and democrats got all sorts of social spending that kind of compromise once happened all the time but has been rare lately maybe this is a sign the gridlock is breaking but if so their cooperation still led to higher spending and more debt as long as this continues as it almost certainly will for a long time the fed will find it near impossible to return to normal policy the balance sheet will keep ballooning as they throw manufactured money at the problem because it is all they know how to do and or it s all congress will let them do nor will there be any refuge overseas the nirp countries will remain stuck in their own traps unable to raise rates and unable to collect enough tax revenue to cover the promises made to their citizens it won t be pretty anywhere on the globe luke gromen of forest for the trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers like louis gave he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing us deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow as i have often noted the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist my 2020 forecast issue which you ll see after the holiday break i m planning to call the decade of living dangerously sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as the beginning this period will be rough but survivable if we prepare now in fact it will bring lots of exciting opportunities more on that in coming letters merry christmas and the happiest new year perhaps i should say feliz navidad as i will be spending christmas in puerto rico with some of my children coming to visit not much chance for a white christmas but shane and i really enjoy living in this tropical paradise there will be no letter next week the first issue of january will be my annual forecast letter this is the time of year when i think deeply about my goals for the future and reflect on how i responded to life s challenges in the past perhaps it is just my age but as i approach each new year i become a great deal more reflective and appreciative of the time that i have to enjoy with family and friends one of the greatest gifts i receive is your attention and time to reading these hopefully thoughtful musings one serious challenge of the age of transformation is the overwhelming amount of information demanding our attention that you would give me part of your time is a greater honor than i can possibly imagine my pledge to you in 2020 is to continue treating it with the respect you deserve and with that i will hit the send button and wish you a truly merry christmas and the best of new years may you spend it with friends and have the most prosperous year ever
published monday 23 december 2019 print disqus simple conceit radical actions ballooning balance sheet merry christmas and the happiest new year ignoring problems rarely solves them you need to deal with them not just the effects but the underlying causes or else they usually get worse the older you get the more you know that is true in almost every area of life in the developed world and especially the us and even in china our economic challenges are rapidly approaching that point things that would have been easily fixed a decade ago or even five years ago will soon be unsolvable by conventional means there is almost no willingness to face our top problems specifically our rising debt the economic challenges we face can t continue which is why i expect the great reset a kind of worldwide do over it s not the best choice but we are slowly ruling out all others last week i talked about the political side of this our embrace of either crony capitalism or welfare statism is going to end very badly ideological positions have hardened to the point that compromise seems impossible central bankers are politicians in a sense and in some ways far more powerful and dangerous than the elected ones some recent events provide a glimpse of where they re taking us hint it s nowhere good and when you combine it with the fiscal shenanigans it s far worse simple conceit central banks weren t always as responsibly irresponsible as my friend paul mcculley would say as they are today walter bagehot one of the early editors of the economist wrote what came to be called bagehot s dictum for central banks as the lender of last resort during a financial or liquidity crisis the central bank should lend freely at a high interest rate on good securities the federal reserve came about as a theoretical antidote to even worse occasional panics and bank failures clearly it had a spotty record through 1945 as there were many mistakes made in the 20s and especially the 30s the loose monetary policy coupled with fiscal incontinence of the 70s gave us an inflationary crisis paul volcker s recent passing rip reminds us of perhaps the fed s finest hour stamping out the inflation that threatened the livelihood of millions however volcker had to do that only because of past mistakes recently reader mourad rahmanov who has thought provoking and sometimes lengthy reactions to almost every letter kindly sent me some of his personal favorite john mauldin quotes one was this passage which succinctly captures my feelings about the fed context this was part of my response to ray dalio s comments on modern monetary theory beginning with greenspan we have now had 30 years of ever looser monetary policy accompanied by lower rates this created a series of asset bubbles whose demises wreaked economic havoc artificially low rates created the housing bubble exacerbated by regulatory failure and reinforced by a morally bankrupt financial system and with the system completely aflame we asked the arsonist to put out the fire with very few observers acknowledging the irony yes we did indeed need the federal reserve to provide liquidity during the initial

african business looks forward to 2020 with analysis of political and economic trends and predictions of what lies ahead from the region s top economists 2019 has been a year of cataclysmic political and economic change on the continent revolutions con vulsed algeria and sudan deposing long time strongmen omar al bashir and abdelaziz bouteflika in april public anger and discontent stretched to the southernmost reaches of the continent in september as mobs looted foreign owned stores in south africa while other citizens took to the streets to protest a spate of violent attacks against women it was hardly ideal timing for embattled president cyril ramaphosa who was forced to avert his gaze from the expensively hosted world economic forum meanwhile as regional policy makers scrambled to make sense of the continental free trade deal which got its final ratification from gambia in june nigeria raised the drawbridge halting the free movement of goods in an anti smuggling crackdown that sent shockwaves through west africa south africa s story in south africa a year of hope has turned into a frustrating continuation of economic and institutional inertia as ramaphosa struggles to turn promises into reform growth continues to stall while unemployment languishes but the new year will see more storm clouds gathering as the country faces the real prospect of a credit downgrade if the government s new budget released in february fails to deliver a viable turnaround plan that promises big results to international investors if south africa s debt falls into sub investment grade it could spark a sell off by institutional investors across the the globe including pension funds hedge funds and banks says chris va ndome a research associate at chatham house s africa program that could result in 15 billion leaving south africa effectively says vandome citing figures released by bank of new york mellon this enormous financial fallout would raise borrowing costs at a time when the country desperately needs loans and portfolio investment to balance its deficit with south africa s growth projections lowered from 1 2 to 0 7 by the international monetary fund imf this year and popular discontent brewing there is little room for error one thing that could boost south africa is the easing of trade tensions following a mooted deal agreed in december by washington and beijing a pick up of global trade after a poor year could provide a lift for commodities such as south african palladium which provides 40 of the global market says charlie robertson the global chief economist at russian investment bank renaissance capital we re seeing palladium prices reach record highs in south africa at least in the past few years with platinum and palladium making up 10 of their exports but only meaningful political change will truly help south africa to achieve much needed growth the crises at state owned power utility eskom and south african airways which was placed in receivership offer a final chance for the government to impose competent leadership and remove the stain of underperformance and corruption ramaphosa has had to tread carefully in a faction ridden anc but he no longer has the luxury of time elsewhere southern africa s second largest economy angola is expected to struggle in 2020 shrinking 1 9 compared to a 3 6 contraction in 2019 according to the economist intelligence unit continuing oil reforms following the end of the dos santos era could bode well for the future however turning its back on the world meanwhile in west africa nigeria s re elected p resident buhari has unwisely escalated anti trade policies and import restrictions the government moves which benefits only a few industrialists are shaping th e economic climate of africa s biggest economy with dramatic spill over effects on neighbouring countries like benin and togo warns john ashbourne capital economics africa economist in august buhari ordered the central bank to stop providing foreign currency to food importers to spur domestic agricultural production by october he closed the country s porous borders to all imported goods without warning in an apparent bid to curb rampant smuggling and boost rice production that s one big political event that really has changed the fortunes of that whole part of the continent if not the continent as a whole ashbourne says nigeria s central bank governor godwin emefiele told a bankers dinner in lagos in november that he intended to advise the government to maintain border closures to boost economic output in the non oil sector such efforts to industrialise the economy through latin american style import substitution is a policy that precedes buhari and is expected to continue next year and beyond his tenure which ends in 2023 says robertson i don t think buhari will change his views on this and if nigeria carries on with this latin american approach it is likely to produce less growth then if they chose an open more export orientated model elsewhere in west africa uncertainty over cote d ivoire s october elections is spooking investors as an unpredictable outcome looms over president alassane ouatta ra s pledge to run for a third term investors will be more relaxed about francophone africa s other key market senegal where the reelection of macky sall in february promised continuity for international oil companies and sound oversight of the multi billion hydrocarbons sector which expects to see first production in 2022 cfa countries will continue the trend of investment led growth good stories and responsible policy making from the presidents in the year ahead robertson says yet they will be operating under a different monetary system the cfa franc will be renamed the eco but will remain pegged to the euro in eight west african countries from july 2020 african countries in the bloc will no longer have to keep 50 of their reserves in the french treasury as financial ties to former colonial master paris weaken stars of the east meanwhile in east africa a transport race is unfolding tanzania and rwa nda are making an aggressive push to depose kenya as the regional transit hub tanzanian president john magufuli is building a 2 5bn bullet train with the help of rwanda in a bid to capture east africa s inland trade and drive it through the port of dar es salaam the project expected to be completed in 2022 will run from the western tanzanian town of isaka to the rwandan capital kigali in direct competition with a rival route in mombasa just 500km up the coast tanzania s railway is the raison d être of kenya s railway says aly khan satchu the ceo of nairobi based investment advisory firm rich management compromising kenya s regional transit routes further is oil rich qatar who are fronting the funds for rwanda to build a gleaming international airport in kigali in return for a 60 stake in the project and a foothold in east africa s aspiring service hub you can imagine the qataris will build something really serious that will represent big competition for kenya whose airline lies in tatters satchu says kenyan airways posted record losses in 2019 as it flounders with pilot shortages and an industrial dispute kagame is more nimble he s quicker and he makes optimal economic decisions much faster and that s his big advantage i think kenya is paying the price for that in the year to come ethiopia and tanzania will continue to grow at 7 2 and 4 5 respectively the imf predicts their sophisticated economies will be tempered only by liquidity constraints and political contestation with impending elections in both countries ethiopia s election is scheduled to take place by may while magafuli whose protectionist policies have spooked investors and partners plans to run for re election in april abiy s prospects for re election are bright the energetic reform minded leader has succeeded in sketching out a positive vision for africa s future which resonates with youth forget ramaphosa and mnangagwa they re yesterday s dinosaurs is the guy who is able to connect with people of the new generation which is 99 5 of africa satchu says that was confirmed with abiy s stunning nobel peace prize win for his successful efforts in resolving a decades long conflict with eritrea yet ongoing political and ethnic tensions tied to his dramatic reforms could test abiy and the country to the limit in 2020 the imf is poised to approve landmark 3bn loan which could offset a liquidity crunch in the cash strapped nation and give it a great deal of momentum as abiy seeks to keep ethnic nationalist forces at bay and win the election business reforms including privatisations remain on the cards if the prime minister can hold it together ethiopia will be a star performer over the next two to three years says satchu in kenya president uhuru kenyatta has overseen growth estimated at 5 6 and will hope to continue growing the economy the imf has praised the country s progress but warned in november of an outsized budget deficit and the need for further tax and expenditure reforms to help the country continue on its path making it north africa s industrial revolution in north africa morocco s manufacturing sector is barrelling ahead as it continues to attract foreign direct investment the sector contributes more than 20 to the country s gdp and employs 11 of the labour force it s leading the second industrialisation wave in africa says robertson the question for me is do we see tunisia and egypt follow that with tunisia s elections out of the way and egypt s prospects buoyed by a stable and strong currency which has seen inflation drop to 3 6 international investors may be tempted to build new factories in the country this could harness egypt s 100m people into a manufacturing power house that feeds into europe robertson says that s something i m certainly going to be watching in 2020 down about debt africa s three largest economies which account for almost 40 of the continent s gdp will continue to disappoint next year causing sub saharan africa s growth to reach 3 2 in 2019 and 3 6 in 2020 according to the imf while growth in africa s fastest growing economy ghana is expected to fall from 7 5 in 2019 to 5 6 in 2020 in anticipation of erratic spending during the election cycle ethiopia and cote d ivoire tell a much different growth story from the region s largest economies says john ashbourne from capital economics a major trend that will carry over next year is how african countries will manage their debt moving forward the imf warns that while the continent s debt load is stabilising indebted countries could face headwinds as slowing global growth weighs on exports seven african countries including mozambique south sudan and zimbabwe are in debt distress according to the imf nine others including ethiopia ghana and cameroon are at high risk of debt creeping up to distressing levels in kenya the penny has dropped now that the debt is in amber territory says satchu the africa continent as a whole has got to get a bit more realistic about how they are going to manage their debt moving forward we re going to see some crises developing in the next 12 months as government looks beyond 2020 they are also waking up to the reality of the long road ahead in implementing the african free trade agreement says john ashbourne it s a very long process and its not going to kick off any time soon the future of african investment the key hubs for investment in 2020 are expected to be morocco egypt ghana cote d ivoire namibia botswana rwanda ethiopia and kenya predicts rob hersov the ceo of investment platform invest africa not south africa until president ramaphosa starts to send the zuma gupta molefe mob to jail and shows he can fix eskom and the soe s he adds with the continent s two largest economies south africa and nigeria growing on average about 1 2 for the past five years they re just not producing the figures that will excite global investors says charlie robertson will we see investor appetite in africa pickup in 2020 not when south africa is on the verge of recession and not when nigeria s growth is as sluggish as 2 3 says robertson in both cases gdp has been growing below population growth now for the last four years so people are getting poorer that s not the mark of an exciting continent that people want to pour money into

false flag infiltrators gold hating fiat money inflationists inside the libertarian conservative movement from 2009 a web page by ellen brown is making the rounds it is here ellen brown is a lawyer she is anti federal reserve so she gets a hearing in conservative circles this is unfortunate there is nothing conservative about her she is an apologist for statism and the united states treasury a wholly owned subsidiary of goldman sachs her article is about the hyperinflation of germany 1921 23 she has no understanding of what happened or why but she talks as if she does if you want the real story on the german hyperinflation you can get it on the mises org site all of these are available for free first there is hans sennholz s article hyperinflation in germany second there is adam fergusson s book when money dies for even more detail read this the economics of inflation 1931 by constantino bresciani turroni these books show that price inflation in germany was exclusively the result of the central bank of germany which expanded the monetary base ms brown offers a different explanation for the german inflation schacht lets the cat out of the bag light is thrown on this mystery by the later writings of hjalmar schacht the the lost science of money by stephen zarlenga who writes that in schacht s 1967 book the magic of money he let the cat out of the bag writing in german with some truly remarkable admissions that shatter the accepted wisdom the financial community has promulgated on the german hyperinflation what actually drove the wartime inflation into hyperinflation said schacht was speculation by foreign investors who would bet on the mark s decreasing value by selling it short short selling is a technique used by investors to try to profit from an asset s falling price it involves borrowing the asset and selling it with the understanding that the asset must later be bought back and returned to the original owner the speculator is gambling that the price will have dropped in the meantime and he can pocket the difference short selling of the german mark was made possible because private banks made massive amounts of currency available for borrowing marks that were created on demand and lent to investors returning a profitable interest to the banks to say that this is economically erroneous does not do justice to how wrong it is first short selling is as legitimate as going long buying speculators forecast future prices they do not cause those prices for every long position there is a short those speculators long or short who guess wrong lose money for every gain made by shorting the german mark there was a loss imposed on a speculator who was long second she describes short selling on the stock market she does not mention commodity futures the rules on the commodity futures market are different these contracts do not involve borrowing the asset this woman hasn t a clue about financial markets third the argument was refuted as long ago as 1931 in the still definitive book the economics of inflation the author reports the accusation that the collapse of the german exchange was provoked by bold groups of professional speculators seems better founded the objection to that is that speculation cannot be the original cause of the depreciation of the currency of a country on the contrary speculation appears when for certain reasons such as the budget deficit the continual issues of paper money the disequilibrium of the balance of trade and the political situation the exchanges are unstable speculation weakens and eventually disappears when the causes which provoked the original depreciation of the currency become less speculation in austrian crowns flourished so long as that currency was unstable but it disappeared as soon as the stabilization plan was adopted directly the monetary reform of november 1923 made the german exchange stable speculation ceased after some fruitless attempts to prevent the success of the operation pp 100 101 fourth the banks were destroyed with the currency bankers suffered along with everyone fifth schacht was a fascist economist he was the minister of economics from 1934 to 1937 in short he ran hitler s economy sixth it was central bank policy that caused the inflation commercial banks merely lent the money created by the central bank the head of the central bank helfferich refused to stop printing money professor bresciani turroni s analysis has stood since 1931 he began with a quotation from the head of the central banks helfferich to follow the good counsel of stopping the printing of notes would mean as long as the causes which are upsetting the german exchange continue to operate refusing to economic life the circulating medium necessary for transactions payments of salaries and wages etc it would mean that in a very short time the entire public and above all the reich could no longer pay merchants employees or workers in a few weeks besides the printing of notes factories mines railways and post office national and local government in short all national and economic life would be stopped the authorities therefore had not the courage to resist the pressure of those who demanded ever greater quantities of paper money and to face boldly the crisis which although painted in unduly dark colours by helfferich would be undeniably the result of a stoppage of the issue of notes they preferred to continue the convenient method of continually increasing the issues of notes thus making the continuation of business possible but at the same time prolonging the pathological state of the german economy seventh schacht served as the currency commissioner of the country beginning in late 1923 he had tried to get the job as the head of the central bank he later did take over as the head of the reichsbank he was a central banker so he wanted to blame foreigners not the central bank those evil speculators as hans sennholz pointed out in 1970 this was the argument of the central bank the speculators did it as he wrote when all other explanations are exhausted modern governments usually fall back on the speculator who is held responsible for all economic and social evils what the witch was to medieval man what the capitalist is to socialists and communists the speculator is to most politicians and statesmen the embodiment of evil he is said to be imbued with ruthless and fickle selfishness that is capable of wrecking the national economy government plans and in the case of german inflation the national currency no matter how blatantly contradictory this explanation may be it is most popular with government authorities in search of a convenient explanation for the failure of their own policies the same german officials who denied the very existence of inflation lamented the depreciation caused by speculators or they blamed the allied reparation burdens and simultaneously denounced speculators for the depreciation dr havenstein the president of the reichsbank embracing every conceivable theory that exculpated his policies also pointed at the speculators before a parliamentary committee he testified on the 28th of march began the attack on the foreign exchange market in very numerous classes of the german economy from that day onwards thought was all for personal interests and not for the needs of the country ms brown believes the self serving explanation by the central bankers who destroyed the german currency at first the speculation was fed by the reichsbank the german central bank which had recently been privatized but when the reichsbank could no longer keep up with the voracious demand for marks other private banks were allowed to create them out of nothing and lend them at interest as well ms brown has no understanding of central banking she repeats the very argument of the head of the german central bank the bank could not keep up with demand for money the destroyers of germany s currency thought they were doing the nation a favor she believes them if schacht is to be believed not only did the government not cause the hyperinflation but it was the government that got the situation under control the reichsbank was put under strict regulation and prompt corrective measures were taken to eliminate foreign speculation by eliminating easy access to loans of bank created money schacht is not to be believed the german central bank stopped inflating in 1923 because it had destroyed the currency the entire nation had gone to barter or foreign currencies to re establish central bank control over the economy the bank reformed the currency schacht was one of those in charge of that revaluation he was an also an apologist for the bank yet zarlenga and brown praise his understanding i really do get weary of what passes for historical and economic analysis in conservative political circles who is zarlenga a statist fiat money promoter here is a recent interview with him how free market does this sound stephen zarlenga it was understood at the time and harvard finally did something valuable in this area and did a study which showed that to coin money meant also the paper our colonial period has many examples of fiat paper money thom hartmann right stephen zarlenga and in fact that s what built the infrastructure of our country until we started using it the country was in trouble because the brits and the dutch did not allow coinage to come over to america it was against their laws thom hartmann right and we didn t have that much gold and silver here that we could make our own stephen zarlenga no no we re not going to make our own and in fact the very nature of money as aristotle told us in the fourth century bc money exists not by nature but by law it s not something that comes out of a mine it s not something that comes out of a farm it s an abstract legal power thom hartmann right stephen zarlenga so all money is ultimately all true money is fiat money and that s what built the colonies you want more i ll give you more thom hartmann right now i in reading your work one of the things that i noted unless i m misremembering but i don t think so was that you are suggesting that a that the treasury department should be issuing our money and if i have this right and b that the value of the money should be defined by the government but it should not be defined by it should not be an intrinsic value in other words we should not go back to gold coins and a gold standard stephen zarlenga yeah thom hartmann why is that i agree with that but i know that there are a lot of particularly the libertarians this is really big with a lot of conservatives let s go back to the gold standard stephen zarlenga well ok we know how to handle that question with them and first of all you never did have a gold standard it was always a fraudulent thing there were promises to pay gold it was never really there but what they ve done and the ron paul people especially are tuned into this that we need gold for money they are confusing an investment with a money now they like gold as an investment and at certain times gold s a fine investment other times it s terrible but you want an investment to go up and up and up you don t want money to go up and up and up you want money to be relatively stable so what you need out of an investment which might be gold at a time and what you need out of money totally separate and the ron paul people they understand this when tell them and as to the fiat part any ron paul person listening in now will understand the following completely the problem is not fiat money the problem is the private issue of fiat money then it operates like a tax

in the absence of a new ideological framework neoliberalism hung over the obama presidency but now in a new form although neoliberalism had little to offer in the absence of a new ideological framework it hung over the obama presidency but now in a new form many on the center left adopted what we might call the technocratic ideology a rebranded version of the policy minimalism of the 1990s that replaced minimalism s tactical and pragmatic foundations with scientific ones the term itself is somewhat oxymoronic as technocrats seem like the opposite of ideologues but an ideology is simply a system of ideas and beliefs like liberalism neoliberalism or socialism that shapes how people view their role in the world society and politics as an ideology technocracy holds that the problems in the world are technical problems that require technical solutions it is worth pointing out what this implies first it means that the structure of the current system isn t broken or flawed it thus follows that most problems are relatively minor and can be fixed by making small tweaks in the system second the problems are not a function of deep moral conflicts that require persuading people on a religious emotional or moral level instead they are problems of science and fact in which we can know right answers and figure out what works because there is consensus about what the end goals are together the result is that the technocratic ideology largely accepts the status quo as acceptable the technocratic ideology preserves the status quo with a variety of tactics we might call the first the complexity canard technocrats like to say that entire sectors of public policy are very complicated and therefore no one can propose reforms or even understand the sector without entry into the priesthood of the technocracy the most frequent uses of this tactic are in sectors that economists have come to dominate international trade antitrust and financial regulation for example the result of this mind set is that bold structural reforms are pushed aside and highly technical changes adopted instead financial regulation provides a particularly good case given the 2008 crash and the great recession when it came time to establish a new regulatory regime for the financial sector there wasn t a massive restructuring despite the biggest crash in 70 years instead for the most part the dodd frank act was classically technocratic it kept the sector basically the same with a few tweaks here and there there was no attempt to restructure the financial sector completely efforts to break up the banks went nowhere no senior executives went to jail with the exception of creating the consumer financial protection bureau most reforms were relatively minor greater capital requirements for banks or increased reporting mandates where proponents claimed they were doing something bold dodd frank still fell prey to the technocratic ideology the volcker rule for example sought to ban banks from proprietary trading but instead of doing that through a simple clean breakup rule like the one enacted under the old glass steagall regime the volcker rule was subject to a multitude of exceptions and carve outs measures that federal regulators were then required to explain and implement with hundreds of pages of technical regulations
in a looming trade war between the world s two largest economies american companies in china may have a bull s eye on their backs the trump administration is pushing china to cut its trade surplus with the united states by 200 billion by the end of 2020 and give up policies that favor domestic companies the core of beijing s state led economic model as the two sides exchange threats of tariff hikes their lopsided trade balance means china will run out of imports for retaliation before president donald trump does but beijing has other ways to inflict pain chief among those is harassing american companies that make autos operate restaurant chains sell computer software and do other business in china s heavily regulated economy other possible options include selling u s government debt or disrupting diplomatic efforts over north korea but those would damage beijing s own interests trump has threatened higher tariffs on 150 billion of chinese goods in response to complaints beijing violates its free trade commitments by stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology beijing reacted to his first round with a 50 billion list including american aircraft soybeans and pork for possible retaliation if it raises that to match trump s total that would be nearly equal to china s 2017 imports of u s goods the commerce ministry has warned that no option is off the table target american companies chinese regulators have wide discretion and an arsenal of tools to disrupt u s businesses from withholding licenses to launching tax anti monopoly or other investigations the u s chipmaker qualcomm inc might serve as an early example china is the final major government withholding approval of qualcomm s proposal for its 44 billion acquisition of rival nxp semiconductors in april the commerce ministry said qualcomm s proposal has difficulty resolving concerns of chinese anti monopoly regulators qualcomm and nxp said april 19 that at the chinese ministry s request the companies withdrew and refiled an application for beijing to clear the acquisition china s entirely state controlled media have encouraged consumer boycotts against japanese south korean and other products during previous disputes with those governments china can harm the interests of the united states by limiting the operations of multinational corporations said jin canrong a foreign relations specialist at beijing s renmin university in comments to the website wallstreetcn com jin pointed to the example of south korean retailer lotte whose business was destroyed by beijing last year after it sold land to the seoul government for an anti missile system opposed by chinese leaders beijing retaliated by closing most of lotte s 99 supermarkets and other outlets in china seoul and beijing later mended relations but south korean news reports said lotte has given up on china and is trying to sell its stores already we are hearing that approvals for some types of licenses for u s firms operating are being put on hold the eurasia group said in a report financial leverage chinese commentators say beijing has financial weapons though using them would cost china s own economy and international standing nationalists point to china s 1 2 trillion holdings of u s government debt as leverage but beijing would suffer losses if it sold enough of that to influence u s debt financing costs and there are few other places to store such vast foreign currency reserves beijing also could obstruct u s investment in china wrote commentator ren zeping on money 163 com but that also would impose a cost by worsening an investment slump chinese leaders are trying to reverse regulators could depress the state controlled exchange rate for china s yuan against the dollar that could help chinese exporters and make u s imports more expensive but it would carry a political cost by hurting other trading partners and making beijing look reckless possibly destabilizing financial markets diplomatic pressure beijing can appeal for support to u s allies that are miffed by trump s america first approach and the u s withdrawal from the paris climate pact and the proposed trans pacific partnership a regional trade agreement trump s unilateral actions have allowed china the most closed major economy to position itself as a defender of free trade that could help beijing win over governments that have criticized trump for acting outside the world trade organization china is a central pillar of the global trading system and we want to fully cooperate with china u n secretary general antonio guterres said during a visit to beijing last month beijing also has potential support from american companies and business groups that have criticized trump and favor globalization more broadly chinese commentators have suggested beijing also could disrupt diplomatic work over north korea s nuclear and missile programs or other initiatives but analysts say that would risk setting back work chinese leaders see as a priority
note there will be no weekly column next week we will return january 3 from all of us at mma to all of you from around the world thank you for your support of this weekly column for the past 21 years best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a most prosperous and happy new year it s going to be a big year in terms of the cosmic patterns three conjunctions of the outer planets in capricorn as outlined in the forecast 2020 book it s a year for heroes and villains be brave and honest and choose your actions with a sense of their consequences as a hero would review and preview markets are shrugging off the impeachment of president donald trump because he is not expected to be removed from office and there should be no negative impacts on fiscal or monetary policy as a result investors have instead focused on recent positive developments like the trade agreement being worked out between the trump administration and china which should stop some strains on the economy and earnings trump needed his victories he s got nafta we got a china deal and we got a budget he got all these victories while he was under impeachment said daniel clifton head of policy research at strategas patti domm here is why the stock market is ignoring trump s impeachment by the house www cnbc com december 19 2019 the three month house inquiry has failed to build majority support among americans for or against impeaching president trump leaving the nation evenly divided 48 to 48 on whether to remove the president from office a new wall street journal nbc news poll finds among independents 50 support impeachment and removal while 44 oppose it aaron zitner americans evenly divided on trump removal wsj nbc news poll finds www wsj com december 18 2019 last week was a perfect example of interplay between the positive jupiter transits in effect through december 27 and the much harsher 32 37 year saturn pluto conjunction aspect that will take place on january 12 but whose orb of influence is in force 11 months either side the week started off with the glow of trade agreements reached between the u s and china and then the house approved usmca trade deal between the u s mexico and canada the middle of the week also witnessed the historic impeachment of president donald trump by the u s house of representatives for only the third time in u s history in a partisan political battle but the stock market did not care about the political strife it was focused on the historical week of trade deals that opened up a whole new world of economic opportunities for growth via trade jupiter and on that note the u s stock market continued to break to new all time highs carrying many other global equity markets upward with it on this count it is hard to argue with the success of president trump s handling of the economy he closed annoying trade tensions that worried markets and corporations consistent with jupiter trine uranus on december 15 and the sun translating this favorable trine december 23 27 conventional wisdom suggests that people vote according to their economic sense of well being that s not entirely true as new polls suggest he is not gaining much traction in his favorability ratings still below 50 it appears that half of americans may vote according to the size of their pocketbook the other half votes on the basis of character and this is where the president continues to fall short this accounts for the even split of americans who want him to remain in office and those who want him removed it is interesting that more independents want him removed will he be removed probably not as it will require 2 3 of the senate to vote for removal with a 53 47 majority the republicans are not likely to break ranks heading into an election and it is clear this is a partisan battle however president trump is under powerful transits from pluto and neptune during the next two years pluto which pertains to threats to one s power will be in opposition to his natal venus and saturn venus is associated with love and popularity while saturn relates to one s position and authority neither appears about to improve especially after june through the election when mars will transit through aries making this into a warlike cardinal t square at the same time transiting neptune is making a t square to the president s natal sun uranus conjunction which opposes his natal moon he was born under a lunar eclipse involving uranus he is different as is often the case with strong uranian charts if people think he has been behaving bizarrely and inappropriately hence the character issue with the populace they ain t seen nothing yet he s not about to normalize as a result of the impeachment vote probably to the contrary to some he may be about to become more entertaining even less constrained but such behavior may actually bring him closer to being removed for pluto is also the planet of removal from power most analysts think that the longer this drags out the more it hurts democrats and favors trump my understanding of astrology and the fact that pluto in capricorn judgement gets more powerful in his chart as we near the election suggests the opposite and do not forget that the reason the democrats won so may new seats in the house in the 2018 election was because those newly elected dems opposed the president and many said they would work towards his impeachment they delivered what they promised to do if elected it is naive neptunian for republicans to think that those same voters will now punish those representatives for doing what they were voted in to do when pluto hits you like it is hitting the president you usually encounter a reality you never thought you would have to deal with in life and approaching it the same way you have approached matters all of your life will no longer work getting out of this requires some kind of personal transformation in values beliefs and or behaviors if this is not done willingly then change is often forced upon you and your life is transformed unwillingly a pluto transit especially to saturn is a solemn period in one s life one way or the other things are no longer the same and things don t work the same as before for you short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts our readers are concerned about the financial markets ahead more than anything else so let me give a holiday gift to readers a quick overview on how i see the u s and world stock markets in 2020 for more elaborate details please refer to the forecast 2020 book which covers the geocosmic and cyclical patterns that are now in effect through the next 1 3 years i find it very interesting that the all time high of october 3 2018 was followed by that 19 decline into december 26 27 2018 this year october 3 2019 was a primary cycle low and here we are making new all time highs as we approach december 26 27 2019 the pattern is exactly the opposite from last year s so far most stock markets of the world exhibit a 15 18 month cycle with an orb of three months in the u s it is a 15 5 month cycle range 13 18 months this is a 1 3 phase of the greater 4 year cycle which bottomed one year ago december 26 27 2018 other world indices as in europe have a 3 year cycle that breaks down into two 18 month phases this 3 year cycle also bottomed december 26 27 2018 same in japan and one week later in china a simple calculation shows that the next 15 5 month cycle in the u s stock market is due april 2020 3 months whereas in europe it is due june 2020 3 months during that time venus will turn retrograde may 13 june 25 this would be a very good time to buy global stock markets if indeed they are falling the decline is likely to be greater than any decline experienced in 2019 but not as great as the decline into december 26 27 2018 in the u s the greatest decline in 2019 was 7 5 the decline into december 26 2018 was over 19 thus the decline in u s stocks is forecast to be 8 19 to a low due april 2020 3 months following that low studies related to the jupiter saturn conjunction on december 21 2020 correlate with a crest 5 months at this point it is indeterminable if that high will be greater or less than the high of the first part of the year however once that second high is completed the saturn uranus waning square of 2021 suggests that the market will decline sharply to its 6 5 year cycle low ideally due 2021 2023 this is our road map for the next year we hope that you will find this to be a useful guide in your investment planning after all the secret to success under the powerful capricorn conjunctions of 2020 is planning it is one of creation s greatest gifts to humanity and astrology is one of the greatest tools to assist in one s planning and of course these projections will be refined and narrowed as the year progresses through our daily weekly and monthly reports based on the patterns that unfold within each of these cycles with these thoughts may each and everyone one of you have a joyful holiday season see you next year holiday publication schedule mma will take a holiday vacation there will be no subscription reports or columns written after december 23 until january 3 have fun with all this jupiter energy in effect through december 27 there is no reason why we should not enjoy this season however you may have to be careful of having too much fun jupiter oftentimes has difficulty knowing its boundaries or the boundaries of others but with common sense and a little respect for others the promise for a great holiday season is possible for businesses and individuals alike it may actually feel like we are working in harmony with one another that we recognize those things that connect us with one another rather than those things that set us apart except possibly impeachment enjoy this jupiterian holiday season announcements note 1 the icr international cycles reports from mma was issued last

political and economic events is fascinating especially the research on the longest of these planetary cycles beginning this year the 32 37 year saturn pluto conjunction it is unlikely you will find a more complete examination and explanation of the saturn pluto conjunction taking place on january 12 2020 than you will find in forecast 2020 in addition to the english edition of forecast 2020

on the last full week of 2020 trading us stocks hit record highs this strong performance combined with better than expected data breathed new life into the us dollar on friday the greenback ended the day up against all of the major currencies except for the australian dollar and sterling however on a weekly basis it is not nearly as strong rising only versus the euro and sterling falling against the swiss franc australian and new zealand dollars and holding steady against other currencies personal incomes grew more than expected the personal consumption component of q3 gdp was revised higher along with the university of michigan consumer sentiment index for the month of december these numbers were encouraging enough to drive eur usd to its weakest level in more than week but even so it is important to remember the central bank s cautious outlook softness in consumer spending manufacturing activity and decline in home sales the us economy is not improving as fast as everyone hopes the central bank has no plans to tighten although the chance of further easing is slim as well trade talks appear to be progressing but investors are skeptical considering that everyone is talking about a january date to finalize the phase 1 us china trade deal we don t expect any significant positive headlines over the next 2 weeks which means that the risk for the dollar is still to the downside although consolidation is the most likely euro was hit the hardest on friday by anti dollar flows while german consumer confidence weakened in the month of january this was more of a technical break eur usd had been consolidating for 6 days straight and when it dropped below 1 11 selling pressure intensified the problem for the euro is that while ecb president lagarde was decidedly optimistic at her first monetary policy meeting data has not supported her views this week we saw manufacturing activity slow inflationary pressures ease and consumer confidence weaken while business confidence improved these and other reports combined with ecb staff forecasts that showed scope for easing was just the excuse that investors needed to sell the currency the canadian dollar also tumbled sharply on the back of weaker retail sales instead of rising 0 5 retail sales dropped 1 2 in the month of october canadian gdp numbers are due on monday and this decline does not bode well for growth slower economic activity would be consistent with the central bank s cautious outlook usd cad turned higher on friday and could extend its gains above 1 32 in the week ahead sterling and the new zealand dollars consolidated with the former edging slightly higher after gdp upgrades the australian dollar on the other rallied for the third straight day on positive trade developments and this week s strong employment report with that said aud usd hit the 200 day sma which is the perfect place for pullback there are no major economic reports scheduled for release in the week ahead with many markets closed for christmas and boxing day therefore big moves in currencies should be limited

neog earnings call for the period ending november 30 2019 neogen corp neog 1 92 q2 2020 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the neogen s second quarter earnings results conference call my name is sylvia and i ll be your operator for today s call i will now turn the call over to john adent ceo of neogen mr adent you may begin john adent president chief executive officer thank you sylvia good morning and welcome to our regular quarterly conference call for investors and analysts today we ll be reporting on the second quarter of our 2020 fiscal year which ended on november 30th as usual some of the statements made here today can be termed as forward looking statements these statements of course are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the actual results may differ from those that we discuss today the risks associated with our business are covered in part in the company s form 10 k as filed with the securities and exchange commission in addition to those of you who are joining us by live telephone conference we also welcome those of you joining us via the internet following our prepared comments this morning we will entertain questions from participants who ve joined this live conference i m joined this morning by our chief financial officer steve quinlan who ll provide more detail on our results for the quarter earlier today neogen issued a press release announcing the results of our second quarter as stated in the release our net income for the quarter was approximately 16 3 million or 0 31 a share up slightly from the prior year quarter when we reported 0 31 per share our year to date net income was approximately 31 million or 0 59 per share down from the same period a year ago when we reported 0 60 a share our revenue for the quarter were up 1 from our prior year to about 108 million on a year to date basis our revenues improved 1 over 209 million we had a number of strong performances in the quarter at our international locations as our revenues from international sources grew 41 of our total revenues up from 39 in the prior year second quarter however like most american companies with significant international sales neogen continues to be adversely affected by the recent strength of the dollar against most other currencies in a neutral currency environment sales would have been approximately 1 million higher in the second quarter as we previously stated we believe that two thirds of our growth potential exists outside the us we see significant opportunities throughout the more than a 120 countries we have served in the past year in some cases these opportunities come through meeting expanded regulatory requirements as with the recent introduction of our test for ergot alkaloids to meet expect the new regulations in the european union other even more significant opportunities exists on meeting the needs of the expanding middle classes in china and india who are demanding the same high quality food products available in other parts of the world i just returned from visiting our teams in australia and despite the current difficult environment of extreme heat fires and floods they re really excited about numerous growth opportunities we have i also met with several customers and distributors to discuss new offerings that were developed specifically for the australian market in meeting after meeting i saw our neogen team is providing unique and valuable solutions to help our customers meet their needs at this point i m going to turn it over to steve for more detail on the quarter steve steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president thanks john and welcome to everyone listening this morning john s reported the overall sales and profit performance for the second quarter and first six months of our fiscal year in the next few minutes i ll give you some color behind those results as john mentioned we continue to be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate revenues would have been 1 million higher for the quarter in a neutral currency environment with the euro 4 lower than this time last year and the pound 3 lower on a positive note the pound was 6 higher at the end of the second quarter than at the beginning of the quarter on optimism regarding a possible brexit dilution the brazilian real continues to hurt our comparative results as that currency was 6 lower than a year ago and the aussie dollar was 5 lower about 875 000 of the comparative revenue shortfall is in the food safety segment as the majority of our international business is reporting through this segment revenues for the food safety segment were 56 9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 an increase of 6 compared to 53 7 million in last year s second quarter our brazilian food safety operations had a 15 increase in sales of diagnostic products led by continued market share gains in aflatoxin sales during the country s corn harvest and a 15 increase in dairy antibiotic test kit sales additionally we recorded a 900 000 non recurring sale of insecticides to the nicaraguan government and two smaller sales of insecticides totaling about 300 000 to brazilian government agencies now these sales are non recurring and that they are tenders or bids that are won for a set period of time with no assurance that the business will be put out for bid the next year this business is somewhat opportunistic and it is what we characterize as lumpy business resulting in tough year over year comparison but it is good profitable business if you recall we discussed on our first quarter call a 1 million sale on last year s first quarter which did not repeat this year overall our brazilian business has achieved revenue growth of 20 in the quarter even after taking into account a 700 000 sales shortfall from their loss of the forensic testing customer we also talked about in the first quarter call our european operations had solid results for the quarter with revenues up 10 in local currency and growth across the entire product portfolio with particular strength in the culture media line which is up 15 a 9 increase in cleaners disinfectants and vet instruments and a 48 increase in aflatoxin test kit due to increased business and an outbreak in africa now this was a nice recovery off of fairly sluggish first quarter genomics revenues which grew at a double digit pace throughout 2019 and 30 in last year s second quarter rose 3 in the second quarter of this year in europe the 10 growth overall in europe was reduced to 7 after currency conversion neogen latinoamerica our business based in mexico city had strong 20 growth in sales of our food safety products with sales up across all of the diagnostic product lines sales of cleaners disinfectants and rodenticides declined 15 due primarily to continued sluggish demand from our largest distributor in central america and this resulted in an overall increase in revenues of 5 for the quarter for this group our operations in china reported a revenue increase of 40 aided by increased sales of cleaners and disinfectants driven by increased awareness of the importance of biosecurity products to counter the african swine fever outbreak in that country our domestic food safety diagnostic business grew by 6 for the quarter with nice areas of growth within the business revenues for our industry leading product line to detect inadvertent allergen contamination which includes diagnostic tests to determine the presence of milk peanuts and processed soy among others were up 17 domestically in the quarter gliadin egg and milk test kit sales were particularly strong up 27 21 and 15 respectively for the period and we ve continued to strengthen our allergen test kit portfolio and have seen commercial success with our recently introduced test to detect coconut contamination which grew nicely for the quarter our accupoint line which is used to detect general sanitation and cleanliness in food processing environments had a strong 21 increase in revenues during the quarter on strength in both equipment and disposable sampler sale year to date this line is up 16 our domestic natural toxin product sales declined 7 compared to last year s second quarter this year s crop was planted late due to the severe spring weather and is not yet fully harvested and has been relatively clean with only small pockets of deal and outbreaks revenues for our tests to detect the presence of antibiotics in milk declined by 30 in the quarter and are down 18 for the year to date due primarily to lower demand from a large european distributor now to address this loss in business which has been steadily occurring over the past few years we ve modified our contract with the distributor to make them non exclusive and we ll begin direct sales in these markets in the third quarter our domestic culture media business which had declined 13 in the first quarter of this year recovered somewhat to post a 2 gain for the quarter now there is still weakness in this market resulting from lower end market demand from a number of our larger customers particularly those in animal vaccine production and orders have been pushed into the second half of the year the animal safety segment continued to be adversely impacted by the trade impasse between the us and china during the second quarter and recorded revenues of 50 9 million for the quarter down 4 from the 53 3 million achieved in last year s second quarter there appear to be a truce called in the trade war near the end of the quarter with an agreement signed to increase agricultural exports to china as yet it s too soon to have seen positive impact on our market animal care products sold out of our lexington kentucky based manufacturing and distribution center such as small animal supplements wound care and antibiotic decreased 13 and vet instruments declined 10 for the quarter primarily the result of lower sales for our largest us distributors due to lower end market demand and related destocking efforts by these distributors rodenticide sales declined 8 in the quarter and insecticide revenues were down 30 for the same period due primarily to lower rodent and insect pressure in certain areas of the country domestic cleaner and disinfectant sales also declined 14 during the quarter due to reduced demand from our larger us distributors as they work to reduce their inventory levels partially offsetting the weak market conditions in the majority of our animal safety market was a robust 18 increase in service revenue at our domestic genomics testing and bio informatics business located at lincoln nebraska with market share gains in the companion animal parentage and wellness testing markets which more than doubled during the quarter a 21 increase in revenues to the porcine market and continued strength in the commercial beef and dairy cattle market worldwide genomics revenues rose 17 with strong growth in the us australia and canada offset by slower growth in europe gross margins were 47 3 for the quarter compared to 46 7 in last year s second quarter improved margins are due to a shift in mix toward food safety products which have higher gross margins and margin improvements at our domestic genomics business resulting from a product mix shift toward higher margin companion animal services and efficiencies achieved with the higher volume for the year to date gross margins are at 47 4 versus 46 8 last year overall operating expenses were up 3 compared to last year s second quarter and 4 for the year to date sales and marketing expenses decreased 3 and are down 1 for the year to date from lower commissions shipping and other variable expenses tied to revenues and a reduction in bad debt expense due to the reversal of reserves for collected receivables general and administrative expenses rose 9 for the quarter due primarily to increased non cash stock based compensation higher legal and professional fees and increased depreciation expenses resulting from our ongoing investments in information technology infrastructure r d expenses increased 615 000 or 19 over the prior year as we continue development spending on a number of new products which are scheduled to be launched in late fiscal 2020 or early 2021 the 3 8 million we spent this quarter is similar to the run rates for the past two quarters and this run rate will continue to be elevated throughout fiscal 2020 operating income for the second quarter was 18 3 million compared to 18 2 million in last year s second quarter expressed as a percent of revenues operating income was 16 9 compared to 17 last year we recorded 1 3 million in interest income for the quarter compared to 1 million last year reflecting our higher cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates on those balances yields on our investments have a dropped in this quarter compared to the first due to the impact on fixed income investments from the fed lowering the prime rate three times this year foreign currency losses totaling 350 000 in the second quarter compares to 70 000 in the same period last year our pre tax profit of 19 2 million compares to the 19 7 million in last year s second quarter our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 15 3 compared to 18 5 in last year s second quarter with reduction in rate driven primarily by the recognition of tax benefits of 1 2 million from the exercise of stock option in last year s second quarter those benefits totaled 484 000 as i ve mentioned on previous calls and will continue to point out the volume of option exercises the strike price and the stock price at time of exercise can all result in large fluctuations in the effective tax rate for these comparative periods on the balance sheet our inventory levels at 86 4 million are essentially flat with year end levels and we continue to work on improving our inventory turn we generated 40 5 million in cash from operations during the first half of the year and have invested 12 8 million of that in property plant and equipment and other asset included in that total are investments in companies and technologies which we believe will give us competitive edge going forward i ll stop here to say that although the numbers were sluggish we were encouraged that we were able to get back to growth in the food safety segment and also capitalize on some significant growth opportunities in the genomics business we know what we need to do to return to growth in the rest of the animal protein markets we serve our more than 1700 employees worldwide believe in our cause are excited about our future and appreciate your support at this point i ll turn it back to john for further comments john adent president chief executive officer thanks steve while we didn t meet all of our performance expectations for the quarter i m really optimistic about where we re going from here first and foremost neogen is in the right markets helping our customers improve the safety of the worldwide food supply is a dynamic and growing market and with our products and services that reach from behind the farm gate all the way to the dinner plate we re uniquely positioned in that market the demand for our products are only going to increase going forward for example i just want to report this data that more than 650 food products were recalled last year in the united states alone and one of the leading causes might just be the easiest to prevent that s food allergens according to the report undeclared allergens are the leading cause of us food recalls accounted for about 48 of the food recalls from the fda and 63 of the food pounds recall by the usda you know that stat becomes even more alarming when you consider that roughly 11 of the adults in the us have a food allergy so we can do even more to help the global food industry protect its consumers we d recently signed up our first major users for our neogen analytics product a world class food safety and risk management system that will allow our customers to reduce their food safety risks we believe combining neogen analytics with our leading food safety diagnostics creates a powerful combination that provides neogen a distinctive competitive advantage the success that we ve had in developing and marketing food safety tests has led to an almost overwhelming amount of data that our customers must sort through to protect their consumers and businesses our new platform will help our food safety diagnostic customers efficiently aggregate analyze and act on all the data we ve also made recent advancements in the development of blockchain technology that s going to benefit our customers and their customers as consumers are increasingly demanding transparency on the origin and supply chain processes of the products they purchase blockchain technology is being developed to deliver just that for example let s consider a production of premium beef products our customer is a cattle rancher who is going to start with the dna data produced by neogen analytics test for an animal and then we re going to connect additional blocks of information on that animal which could include it s health it s medical history what it ate it s diet the ranch environment and other production variables information on that animal could then be shared with processors retailers or even consumers who are seeking that level of transparency blockchain technology enables our customers to tell the story of their brand mitigate the risks in their supply chains and as well as enhance our operational efficiencies we believe our markets are moving quickly toward more informed data driven decisions and we re working to be at the movement s forefront as we work to improve and expand what we can offer our customers we re also looking to acquire additional technologies and capabilities while i m not ready to announce anything we have an active acquisition program and a number of acquisition targets under investigation as shown on our balance sheet we re perfectly positioned there is plenty of dry powder as jim herbert used to say to pursue any of our growth strategies going forward but i can do is encourage you today to stay tuned for upcoming announcements from us i m excited about our future and i look forward to stronger performances going forward let me stop at this point to entertain any questions from those of you who ve joined us on the call questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question comes from paul knight from janney montgomery paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst hi john could you give us some granularity on these distributors specifically you mentioned on vet instruments and animal care within the animal safety market your distributors are destocking could you tell us what s going on with those distributors for them to take these kind of actions john adent president chief executive officer sure so paul i think when you look at some of the results as you ve seen on move out and i saw the patterson results our livestock business was down 1 mwi s livestock business was down their companion animal is up but what matters to us is their livestock business and what s happening is as their sales are slowing to their customers distributor margins are very thin they need to make sure they re controlling their operating working capital and they re forcing their management groups who are looking at their businesses and they re tightening up their inventory days and that s something that we ve seen happen before when markets are a little soft distributors tighten up inventory when markets grow they loosen up inventory so that s what s happening on the animal safety side in the us steve also mentioned fall of distributor with our food safety product in europe and we worked with them for a long time they re a good company they just have not had the growth that we ve seen across all of our other businesses for that same line and we ve been working with them to try to find ways to grow and we ultimately sat down and worked out a solution they re going to continue to be a distributor but it s going to be on a non exclusive basis paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst in this weak demand that they re facing is it a commodity driven event is it the trade restrictions that they re seeing in the pork markets due to china what do you think are those key factors john adent president chief executive officer i think its profitability for the producer you ve got to look at it again by segmentation i saw today exports report were actually up in the quarter they are still down versus last year but i saw a tweet the other day that said watch out for a big big news on ag export so this could be something that would help those customers reopen an ag market specifically for pork dairy business is still an interesting challenge we continue to see smaller and smaller dairy farmers going out of business which number of cows are staying the same it s just move into larger farms but that has an impact on how those type of entity spend money so i think the thing to watch is really trying to understand what are the producers profitability i mean if they re making money they tend to expand and grow if they are losing money and it s a cash flow issue even though they know it makes good economic sense to use our products from a cash flow standpoint they just tighten their belt paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst okay and then lastly on my last question would be your cash and investments totaling 313 million is your pipeline getting richer due to this blockchain and it outlook that you have or what s your view on this building cash that isn t being deployed of the note john adent president chief executive officer paul you re talking to a guy that s just as disappointed as you about deploying cash i mean i want to go buy stuff and we looked at in the last six months we looked at 15 different businesses and said no on 13 so we re shaking the trees we re looking at opportunities but we re still going to be judicious in what we want to buy and i think it goes back to what jim had talked about all along is do we understand it can we make it do we have a market for it and those types of things those questions still resonate us when we look at acquisition opportunities so we are looking at some right now that are very exciting to us that answer yes to all three of those things and we re executing we re working to execute to get those deals done paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst okay thanks john john adent president chief executive officer you bet thank you operator our following question comes from kevin ellich from ace research kevin ellich ace research analyst hey john thanks for taking the questions just wondering with african swine fever in china you guys saw some pretty strong growth there how much benefit did you see from increased sales of disinfectant and cleaners with biosecurity measures john adent president chief executive officer we did see increased sales but i know steve is looking right now to see what that number was so we are seeing that kevin and i think that s going to continue as we can train the smaller customers to understand biosecurity the larger swine guys in china understand biosecurity and that s what we do really well with the smaller backyard is harder because those pigs are one common fence touching noses and that s how that disease spreads really quickly through the backyards in china so reaching that group is highly fragmented you ve got to do a lot of dealers it s a lot of training so there is opportunity for that but most of our growth has been with the large swine producer kevin ellich ace research analyst got you i mean while steve looks that up can you give us an update you know do you think the spread has slowed a little bit or do you think we re still on pace like we ve seen in the last six months john adent president chief executive officer kevin i don t know i haven t heard anything one way or the other i mean i think we talked about this i think it was last quarter or two quarters ago that we d seen some large guys repopulate and then get hit again which is really devastating for them but i i haven t heard anything that kind of changed what s happening over there so and i think i would take that as a good thing it doesn t seem like it s continuing to escalate but it s been such a dramatic impact on losing half their animals you would think we re losing half the animals it would slow just from a number standpoint see we have the steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president kevin that was about 0 5 million now the only caveat there is it may not all be directly african swine fever related it s really biosecurity and the importance of having a clean environment to raise your animals not all directly going into the pork production market kevin ellich ace research analyst sure ok and then steve while i got you so sales and marketing expense was actually down in terms of absolute dollar basis right for the first time in a while just wondering what caused this i mean should we expect it to continue to decrease and then kind of on the other hand you talked about going direct i think over a year wondering if you need to add any salesforce or infrastructure and could that lead to a little bit of higher cost in the second half of the year steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president yeah i guess i would say as long as our sales on the animal safety side are sluggish or in this case declining you d see related sales expenses would kind of follow along with that our goal is to stay positive we want our sales and marketing expenses to grow that means our revenues are growing and all the related commissions and shipping and advertising and promotional things that means the markets are growing and those are good things for us we are for the distribution business in europe we have added staff to market those products there i don t think it s going to have a material impact on our sales expenses in the second quarter because we are also using our existing salesforce to go after that business john adent president chief executive officer right we ve got kevin we ve got existing teams in lot of those markets so they weren t allowed to sell those because there was an exclusive relationship and now they re going to be able to kevin ellich ace research analyst okay and then lastly john your veterinary instruments and other business in both disposals and animal care pretty weak this quarter and i know you had a tough comp on the animal care side with vaccines just wondering what s going on there and do you think that s going to continue will that continue to decline or should we see a reversal on the second half john adent president chief executive officer i think you know i ve got to go back and look but i think we have pretty strong growth in those last quarter kevin ellich ace research analyst you did well and instruments was up 9 last quarter john adent president chief executive officer yeah and so i was so that s the one that stuck out for me kevin as i m wondering if there is a little bit of if you average the two you re going to see it a little bit as a normalized somewhat this market is and it was kind of a little bit of timing on we re up one quarter down on the other i don t think there s anything fundamentally different going on other than it s a tough animal safety market kevin ellich ace research analyst got you that s all i have thanks guys have a good holiday john adent president chief executive officer thank you kev yeah you too operator and our next question comes from david westenberg from guggenheim securities david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question so glad to see the tick up in r d i think you guys developed some good product so how should we expect on those new products to hit the market is that fiscal year 21 is they get to you said that we expect the spending to continue and how big are these the products that might be coming out in 2021 should we expect a growth lift in our models to come then john adent president chief executive officer sure thanks david look we re excited about the r d that s why we re doing it i mean you saw the ergot testing that s the only one available for rapid testing today worldwide we re the only one that has it we re trying to stay ahead of some of the regulations we think that s the position that we want to be in that was driven by our european team our r d group out of europe did a fantastic job of taking that and driving that with the help of the group here in lansing and we re excited we ve got some new products coming in the second half of the year now again i love for all of them to be blockbuster but we ve got some new things from a technology standpoint that s coming and from a product offering that s coming in the second half of the year and then into next year i don t know what and steve i don t think we ve ever talked about what we ve forecasted for those other than that has always been a key piece of our growth and we know that it needs to be and that s why we invest in it and it s something that we re focusing on to continue to drive growth in the second half of the year and next year steve do you want to comment along david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst no i think you ve john adent president chief executive officer some product growth there ok yeah yeah david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst so then in terms of the alternative meat i know stock price wise they ve been hit are you seeing an increase in demand from these producers of alternative meat how do you see that business playing out as kind of a i mean in terms of products food producers as kind of a market let s just say john adent president chief executive officer yeah no david i think it s just like any other segmentation i mean you remember one organics came on the market and everyone said it s niche and it s grown into a nice mark i think the plant based proteins is going to continue to be a nice market i think it s got consumers who want it and as long as consumers want it it s going to continue to drive and grow and what s interesting to me is they have the same issues whether are there making plant base hamburger pattys or meat based hamburger pattys you still have to check for allergens you still have the check for e coli you still have to check for listeria you still have to check for everything so whether it s plant based or meat based we sell the same products into those types of customers and so it s really around food production and anything around food production that s where we re there to help those producers make the safest product they can for their consumers david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it no thank you and then i know there is not much you can say in terms of m a here but can you maybe talk about some of the priorities whether it s a technology or maybe a product or is it something of interest and then maybe if you can talk about what s more interesting animal safety versus food safety i get that you can t be specific so any sort of generalities might be helpful here thank you john adent president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think you ve seen kind of what we ve done on the technology side with neogen analytics and blockchain right this is something where we heard about it and we heard loud and clear from our customers that they re still keeping a lot of our customers still keep paper records for when the fda comes in to do an audit to provide paper record keeping which you know you just kind of shake your head and think we ought to be able to help so we got working with different outside groups and vetted what we felt was the best plant mapping software and risk management software available and partnered with them to develop neogen analytics same type of thing for blockchain right is i just read about this i think it was well about six months ago mcdonald s said that in the future and that was the timeline they gave that half of their meat beef was going to be antibiotic free well how are they going to be able to prove that without a blockchain solution and really we re on the forefront we re leading that today to be able to provide that type of transparency for customers and consumers so the it side continues to drive i think you have to it s if you just do tests and you don t give the customers ways to capture and analyze and then act on data it s kind of a waste so we re really pushing that the other areas we look out to and you mentioned it properly is where is a technology that we have a hold in the portfolio so where should we be looking where is the market going what are those types of technologies and we have a scientific advisory council where we are constantly vetting new technologies and what s coming down the pipeline that we can it s either being done in another market on the human side that we can bring into our segmentation or its brand new and we try to find those types of things and say ok how is this going to change the future or the way we do business and then lastly we look at geographic markets where are we underrepresented i think that kind of led this discussion even with our european distributor was they did a good job for us but they weren t growing at the rate that we wanted they weren t happy with the growth rate we weren t happy with the growth rate and we came up with a solution that we think is going to help both parties grow because we were under represented in specific markets so where are we underrepresented and what are the things we can do to accelerate those growth rates and that could be geographically it could be by a product it could be in a product segmentation that s how we look at it david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you and enjoy your holidays john adent president chief executive officer yeah thanks david you too operator at this time we have no further questions i d like to turn the call back over to mr adent for closing remark john adent president chief executive officer thanks sylvia i just want to thank all of you for your time today and i wish everyone on the call and listening a happy holidays and a prosperous new year thank you very much everyone operator duration 37 minutes call participants john adent president chief executive officer steven j quinlan

in the nearly three years since president trump took office the expansion that began in 2009 has defied expectations that it would run out of gas and instead has set a record for longevity but amid the turmoil over impeachment climate change gun violence immigration the list goes on there has been a surprising constant the resiliency of the us economy in the face of slowdowns overseas and the trade war with china job growth has been solid enough to push unemployment to a 50 year low wages are edging up and the stock market hit a new high friday the administration cut taxes and regulations moves cheered by businesses renegotiated the north american free trade agreement and reached a tariff truce with china advertisement now just seven weeks before voters start winnowing the crowd of candidates seeking to replace trump how americans assess the economy becomes very much a matter of politics get trendlines a business newsletter from globe columnist larry edelman covering the trends shaping business and the economy in boston and beyond enter email sign up with his trademark hyperbole trump tweeted earlier this month that he s responsible for the best economy in the history of our country exaggeration aside history tells us trump should win reelection since the start of the last century no incumbent has lost a reelection bid when the economy was expanding but democrats are hoping that this time will be different and they point to data that suggest the economy is hardly going gangbusters including average growth in gross domestic product gdp in the 11 quarters of the trump presidency so far was 2 6 percent the same as it was in the 11 quarters prior to his move into the white house hiring increased at an average rate of 193 000 a month over the first full 34 months of trump s term compared with 227 000 in the final 34 months of the obama administration advertisement under trump the federal deficit ballooned to an estimated 960 billion in the most recent fiscal year from 665 4 billion in fiscal 2017 my conclusion is that the economy is not doing noticeably better under the current administration and the improvements that can be identified have come at a very high cost in terms of deficit increases and additional debt said raul elizalde a former wall street investment strategist who is now chief executive of path financial a financial advisory firm in sarasota fla all presidents are quick to take credit for good times even when their influence over the economy is limited compared to the federal reserve whose three rate cuts this year arguably did more to support growth than trump s tax cuts still democrats know it s hard to argue with an unemployment rate of 3 5 percent the lowest since 1969 instead the candidates seeking to unseat trump are pushing a broad narrative the benefits of the good economy are going largely to the wealthy and big businesses while the poor and the middle class are left to pick up the crumbs the tax cuts passed by a gop controlled congress in 2017 flowed largely to corporations and the rich perpetuating decades of widening inequality the share of wealth held by the richest top 0 1 percent of american families has risen nearly threefold to 20 percent from the late 1970s through 2016 according to emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman economists at the university of california berkeley who have advised massachusetts senator elizabeth warren the share of the bottom 90 percent has dropped to 25 percent from 35 percent advertisement the concern over inequality has deepened the outrage of democrats over trump s behavior and it has fueled the populist campaigns of warren and vermont senator bernie sanders in particular it has also helped spur a revived labor movement including strikes at general motors and by chicago s public school teachers there are many complex and often interrelated factors behind income and wealth inequality which have widened during democratic and republican administrations alike they include globalization the long term decline of unions and an economy that s increasingly reliant on knowledge workers have squeezed wages a recent study by the brookings institution found that 53 million americans ages 18 to 64 or 44 percent of all workers are employed in low wage jobs with a median hourly wage of 10 22 and median annual earnings of about 18 000 at the top of the income ladder superstar ceos athletes entertainers and others are seeing their incomes growing faster than others in the top 10 percent stock market gains go mostly to the rich a survey by gallup found that 55 percent of americans say they own stock down from 62 percent as recently as 2008 more telling 84 percent of all stocks owned by americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households according to research by edward n wolff an economist at new york university advertisement barriers to good education and health care coupled with racial and gender discrimination create a cycle of poverty that is hard to escape it s too soon to tell whether the democrats theme that a rigged system caters to the rich will resonate with enough voters to defeat trump as with most issues many voters view the economy through their already largely established politically charged prism said mark hamrick a senior economic analyst at bankrate com in other words trump supporters see the glass half full while opponents see it half empty those opinions are well ensconced and mostly unlikely to change he said meanwhile the economic winds are blowing in the president s favor most forecasters believe the economy will continue to grow through 2020 at a rate of about 2 percent roughly the same pace as now unemployment should remain in the range of 3 4 percent to 4 percent according to fed estimates while inflation remains subdued all bets are off of course if there is a shock to system from overseas or an escalation of the trade fight with china but for now trump will tout his tax cuts and low unemployment while the democrats will argue that too many americans are being left behind you can reach me at larry edelman globe com and follow me on twitter globenewsed
neogen corp nasdaq neog q2 2020 earnings call 11 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator welcome to the neogen s second quarter earnings results conference call my name is sylvia and i ll be your operator for today s call i will now turn the call over to john adent ceo of neogen mr adent you may begin john adent president chief executive officer thank you sylvia good morning and welcome to our regular quarterly conference call for investors and analysts today we ll be reporting on the second quarter of our 2020 fiscal year which ended on november 30th as usual some of the statements made here today can be termed as forward looking statements these statements of course are subject to certain risks and uncertainties the actual results may differ from those that we discuss today the risks associated with our business are covered in part in the company s form 10 k as filed with the securities and exchange commission in addition to those of you who are joining us by live telephone conference we also welcome those of you joining us via the internet following our prepared comments this morning we will entertain questions from participants who ve joined this live conference i m joined this morning by our chief financial officer steve quinlan who ll provide more detail on our results for the quarter earlier today neogen issued a press release announcing the results of our second quarter as stated in the release our net income for the quarter was approximately 16 3 million or 0 31 a share up slightly from the prior year quarter when we reported 0 31 per share our year to date net income was approximately 31 million or 0 59 per share down from the same period a year ago when we reported 0 60 a share our revenue for the quarter were up 1 from our prior year to about 108 million on a year to date basis our revenues improved 1 over 209 million we had a number of strong performances in the quarter at our international locations as our revenues from international sources grew 41 of our total revenues up from 39 in the prior year second quarter however like most american companies with significant international sales neogen continues to be adversely affected by the recent strength of the dollar against most other currencies in a neutral currency environment sales would have been approximately 1 million higher in the second quarter as we previously stated we believe that two thirds of our growth potential exists outside the us we see significant opportunities throughout the more than a 120 countries we have served in the past year in some cases these opportunities come through meeting expanded regulatory requirements as with the recent introduction of our test for ergot alkaloids to meet expect the new regulations in the european union other even more significant opportunities exists on meeting the needs of the expanding middle classes in china and india who are demanding the same high quality food products available in other parts of the world i just returned from visiting our teams in australia and despite the current difficult environment of extreme heat fires and floods they re really excited about numerous growth opportunities we have i also met with several customers and distributors to discuss new offerings that were developed specifically for the australian market in meeting after meeting i saw our neogen team is providing unique and valuable solutions to help our customers meet their needs at this point i m going to turn it over to steve for more detail on the quarter steve steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president thanks john and welcome to everyone listening this morning john s reported the overall sales and profit performance for the second quarter and first six months of our fiscal year in the next few minutes i ll give you some color behind those results as john mentioned we continue to be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate revenues would have been 1 million higher for the quarter in a neutral currency environment with the euro 4 lower than this time last year and the pound 3 lower on a positive note the pound was 6 higher at the end of the second quarter than at the beginning of the quarter on optimism regarding a possible brexit dilution the brazilian real continues to hurt our comparative results as that currency was 6 lower than a year ago and the aussie dollar was 5 lower about 875 000 of the comparative revenue shortfall is in the food safety segment as the majority of our international business is reporting through this segment revenues for the food safety segment were 56 9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 an increase of 6 compared to 53 7 million in last year s second quarter our brazilian food safety operations had a 15 increase in sales of diagnostic products led by continued market share gains in aflatoxin sales during the country s corn harvest and a 15 increase in dairy antibiotic test kit sales additionally we recorded a 900 000 non recurring sale of insecticides to the nicaraguan government and two smaller sales of insecticides totaling about 300 000 to brazilian government agencies now these sales are non recurring and that they are tenders or bids that are won for a set period of time with no assurance that the business will be put out for bid the next year this business is somewhat opportunistic and it is what we characterize as lumpy business resulting in tough year over year comparison but it is good profitable business if you recall we discussed on our first quarter call a 1 million sale on last year s first quarter which did not repeat this year overall our brazilian business has achieved revenue growth of 20 in the quarter even after taking into account a 700 000 sales shortfall from their loss of the forensic testing customer we also talked about in the first quarter call our european operations had solid results for the quarter with revenues up 10 in local currency and growth across the entire product portfolio with particular strength in the culture media line which is up 15 a 9 increase in cleaners disinfectants and vet instruments and a 48 increase in aflatoxin test kit due to increased business and an outbreak in africa now this was a nice recovery off of fairly sluggish first quarter genomics revenues which grew at a double digit pace throughout 2019 and 30 in last year s second quarter rose 3 in the second quarter of this year in europe the 10 growth overall in europe was reduced to 7 after currency conversion neogen latinoamerica our business based in mexico city had strong 20 growth in sales of our food safety products with sales up across all of the diagnostic product lines sales of cleaners disinfectants and rodenticides declined 15 due primarily to continued sluggish demand from our largest distributor in central america and this resulted in an overall increase in revenues of 5 for the quarter for this group our operations in china reported a revenue increase of 40 aided by increased sales of cleaners and disinfectants driven by increased awareness of the importance of biosecurity products to counter the african swine fever outbreak in that country our domestic food safety diagnostic business grew by 6 for the quarter with nice areas of growth within the business revenues for our industry leading product line to detect inadvertent allergen contamination which includes diagnostic tests to determine the presence of milk peanuts and processed soy among others were up 17 domestically in the quarter gliadin egg and milk test kit sales were particularly strong up 27 21 and 15 respectively for the period and we ve continued to strengthen our allergen test kit portfolio and have seen commercial success with our recently introduced test to detect coconut contamination which grew nicely for the quarter our accupoint line which is used to detect general sanitation and cleanliness in food processing environments had a strong 21 increase in revenues during the quarter on strength in both equipment and disposable sampler sale year to date this line is up 16 our domestic natural toxin product sales declined 7 compared to last year s second quarter this year s crop was planted late due to the severe spring weather and is not yet fully harvested and has been relatively clean with only small pockets of deal and outbreaks revenues for our tests to detect the presence of antibiotics in milk declined by 30 in the quarter and are down 18 for the year to date due primarily to lower demand from a large european distributor now to address this loss in business which has been steadily occurring over the past few years we ve modified our contract with the distributor to make them non exclusive and we ll begin direct sales in these markets in the third quarter our domestic culture media business which had declined 13 in the first quarter of this year recovered somewhat to post a 2 gain for the quarter now there is still weakness in this market resulting from lower end market demand from a number of our larger customers particularly those in animal vaccine production and orders have been pushed into the second half of the year the animal safety segment continued to be adversely impacted by the trade impasse between the us and china during the second quarter and recorded revenues of 50 9 million for the quarter down 4 from the 53 3 million achieved in last year s second quarter there appear to be a truce called in the trade war near the end of the quarter with an agreement signed to increase agricultural exports to china as yet it s too soon to have seen positive impact on our market animal care products sold out of our lexington kentucky based manufacturing and distribution center such as small animal supplements wound care and antibiotic decreased 13 and vet instruments declined 10 for the quarter primarily the result of lower sales for our largest us distributors due to lower end market demand and related destocking efforts by these distributors rodenticide sales declined 8 in the quarter and insecticide revenues were down 30 for the same period due primarily to lower rodent and insect pressure in certain areas of the country domestic cleaner and disinfectant sales also declined 14 during the quarter due to reduced demand from our larger us distributors as they work to reduce their inventory levels partially offsetting the weak market conditions in the majority of our animal safety market was a robust 18 increase in service revenue at our domestic genomics testing and bio informatics business located at lincoln nebraska with market share gains in the companion animal parentage and wellness testing markets which more than doubled during the quarter a 21 increase in revenues to the porcine market and continued strength in the commercial beef and dairy cattle market worldwide genomics revenues rose 17 with strong growth in the us australia and canada offset by slower growth in europe gross margins were 47 3 for the quarter compared to 46 7 in last year s second quarter improved margins are due to a shift in mix toward food safety products which have higher gross margins and margin improvements at our domestic genomics business resulting from a product mix shift toward higher margin companion animal services and efficiencies achieved with the higher volume for the year to date gross margins are at 47 4 versus 46 8 last year overall operating expenses were up 3 compared to last year s second quarter and 4 for the year to date sales and marketing expenses decreased 3 and are down 1 for the year to date from lower commissions shipping and other variable expenses tied to revenues and a reduction in bad debt expense due to the reversal of reserves for collected receivables general and administrative expenses rose 9 for the quarter due primarily to increased non cash stock based compensation higher legal and professional fees and increased depreciation expenses resulting from our ongoing investments in information technology infrastructure r d expenses increased 615 000 or 19 over the prior year as we continue development spending on a number of new products which are scheduled to be launched in late fiscal 2020 or early 2021 the 3 8 million we spent this quarter is similar to the run rates for the past two quarters and this run rate will continue to be elevated throughout fiscal 2020 operating income for the second quarter was 18 3 million compared to 18 2 million in last year s second quarter expressed as a percent of revenues operating income was 16 9 compared to 17 last year we recorded 1 3 million in interest income for the quarter compared to 1 million last year reflecting our higher cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates on those balances yields on our investments have a dropped in this quarter compared to the first due to the impact on fixed income investments from the fed lowering the prime rate three times this year foreign currency losses totaling 350 000 in the second quarter compares to 70 000 in the same period last year our pre tax profit of 19 2 million compares to the 19 7 million in last year s second quarter our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 15 3 compared to 18 5 in last year s second quarter with reduction in rate driven primarily by the recognition of tax benefits of 1 2 million from the exercise of stock option in last year s second quarter those benefits totaled 484 000 as i ve mentioned on previous calls and will continue to point out the volume of option exercises the strike price and the stock price at time of exercise can all result in large fluctuations in the effective tax rate for these comparative periods on the balance sheet our inventory levels at 86 4 million are essentially flat with year end levels and we continue to work on improving our inventory turn we generated 40 5 million in cash from operations during the first half of the year and have invested 12 8 million of that in property plant and equipment and other asset included in that total are investments in companies and technologies which we believe will give us competitive edge going forward i ll stop here to say that although the numbers were sluggish we were encouraged that we were able to get back to growth in the food safety segment and also capitalize on some significant growth opportunities in the genomics business we know what we need to do to return to growth in the rest of the animal protein markets we serve our more than 1700 employees worldwide believe in our cause are excited about our future and appreciate your support at this point i ll turn it back to john for further comments john adent president chief executive officer thanks steve while we didn t meet all of our performance expectations for the quarter i m really optimistic about where we re going from here first and foremost neogen is in the right markets helping our customers improve the safety of the worldwide food supply is a dynamic and growing market and with our products and services that reach from behind the farm gate all the way to the dinner plate we re uniquely positioned in that market the demand for our products are only going to increase going forward for example i just want to report this data that more than 650 food products were recalled last year in the united states alone and one of the leading causes might just be the easiest to prevent that s food allergens according to the report undeclared allergens are the leading cause of us food recalls accounted for about 48 of the food recalls from the fda and 63 of the food pounds recall by the usda you know that stat becomes even more alarming when you consider that roughly 11 of the adults in the us have a food allergy so we can do even more to help the global food industry protect its consumers we d recently signed up our first major users for our neogen analytics product a world class food safety and risk management system that will allow our customers to reduce their food safety risks we believe combining neogen analytics with our leading food safety diagnostics creates a powerful combination that provides neogen a distinctive competitive advantage the success that we ve had in developing and marketing food safety tests has led to an almost overwhelming amount of data that our customers must sort through to protect their consumers and businesses our new platform will help our food safety diagnostic customers efficiently aggregate analyze and act on all the data we ve also made recent advancements in the development of blockchain technology that s going to benefit our customers and their customers as consumers are increasingly demanding transparency on the origin and supply chain processes of the products they purchase blockchain technology is being developed to deliver just that for example let s consider a production of premium beef products our customer is a cattle rancher who is going to start with the dna data produced by neogen analytics test for an animal and then we re going to connect additional blocks of information on that animal which could include it s health it s medical history what it ate it s diet the ranch environment and other production variables information on that animal could then be shared with processors retailers or even consumers who are seeking that level of transparency blockchain technology enables our customers to tell the story of their brand mitigate the risks in their supply chains and as well as enhance our operational efficiencies we believe our markets are moving quickly toward more informed data driven decisions and we re working to be at the movement s forefront as we work to improve and expand what we can offer our customers we re also looking to acquire additional technologies and capabilities while i m not ready to announce anything we have an active acquisition program and a number of acquisition targets under investigation as shown on our balance sheet we re perfectly positioned there is plenty of dry powder as jim herbert used to say to pursue any of our growth strategies going forward but i can do is encourage you today to stay tuned for upcoming announcements from us i m excited about our future and i look forward to stronger performances going forward let me stop at this point to entertain any questions from those of you who ve joined us on the call questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session and our first question comes from paul knight from janney montgomery paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst hi john could you give us some granularity on these distributors specifically you mentioned on vet instruments and animal care within the animal safety market your distributors are destocking could you tell us what s going on with those distributors for them to take these kind of actions john adent president chief executive officer sure so paul i think when you look at some of the results as you ve seen on move out and i saw the patterson results our livestock business was down 1 mwi s livestock business was down their companion animal is up but what matters to us is their livestock business and what s happening is as their sales are slowing to their customers distributor margins are very thin they need to make sure they re controlling their operating working capital and they re forcing their management groups who are looking at their businesses and they re tightening up their inventory days and that s something that we ve seen happen before when markets are a little soft distributors tighten up inventory when markets grow they loosen up inventory so that s what s happening on the animal safety side in the us steve also mentioned fall of distributor with our food safety product in europe and we worked with them for a long time they re a good company they just have not had the growth that we ve seen across all of our other businesses for that same line and we ve been working with them to try to find ways to grow and we ultimately sat down and worked out a solution they re going to continue to be a distributor but it s going to be on a non exclusive basis paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst in this weak demand that they re facing is it a commodity driven event is it the trade restrictions that they re seeing in the pork markets due to china what do you think are those key factors john adent president chief executive officer i think its profitability for the producer you ve got to look at it again by segmentation i saw today exports report were actually up in the quarter they are still down versus last year but i saw a tweet the other day that said watch out for a big big news on ag export so this could be something that would help those customers reopen an ag market specifically for pork dairy business is still an interesting challenge we continue to see smaller and smaller dairy farmers going out of business which number of cows are staying the same it s just move into larger farms but that has an impact on how those type of entity spend money so i think the thing to watch is really trying to understand what are the producers profitability i mean if they re making money they tend to expand and grow if they are losing money and it s a cash flow issue even though they know it makes good economic sense to use our products from a cash flow standpoint they just tighten their belt paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst okay and then lastly on my last question would be your cash and investments totaling 313 million is your pipeline getting richer due to this blockchain and it outlook that you have or what s your view on this building cash that isn t being deployed of the note john adent president chief executive officer paul you re talking to a guy that s just as disappointed as you about deploying cash i mean i want to go buy stuff and we looked at in the last six months we looked at 15 different businesses and said no on 13 so we re shaking the trees we re looking at opportunities but we re still going to be judicious in what we want to buy and i think it goes back to what jim had talked about all along is do we understand it can we make it do we have a market for it and those types of things those questions still resonate us when we look at acquisition opportunities so we are looking at some right now that are very exciting to us that answer yes to all three of those things and we re executing we re working to execute to get those deals done paul knight janney montgomery scott llc analyst okay thanks john john adent president chief executive officer you bet thank you operator our following question comes from kevin ellich from ace research kevin ellich ace research analyst hey john thanks for taking the questions just wondering with african swine fever in china you guys saw some pretty strong growth there how much benefit did you see from increased sales of disinfectant and cleaners with biosecurity measures john adent president chief executive officer we did see increased sales but i know steve is looking right now to see what that number was so we are seeing that kevin and i think that s going to continue as we can train the smaller customers to understand biosecurity the larger swine guys in china understand biosecurity and that s what we do really well with the smaller backyard is harder because those pigs are one common fence touching noses and that s how that disease spreads really quickly through the backyards in china so reaching that group is highly fragmented you ve got to do a lot of dealers it s a lot of training so there is opportunity for that but most of our growth has been with the large swine producer kevin ellich ace research analyst got you i mean while steve looks that up can you give us an update you know do you think the spread has slowed a little bit or do you think we re still on pace like we ve seen in the last six months john adent president chief executive officer kevin i don t know i haven t heard anything one way or the other i mean i think we talked about this i think it was last quarter or two quarters ago that we d seen some large guys repopulate and then get hit again which is really devastating for them but i i haven t heard anything that kind of changed what s happening over there so and i think i would take that as a good thing it doesn t seem like it s continuing to escalate but it s been such a dramatic impact on losing half their animals you would think we re losing half the animals it would slow just from a number standpoint see we have the steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president kevin that was about 0 5 million now the only caveat there is it may not all be directly african swine fever related it s really biosecurity and the importance of having a clean environment to raise your animals not all directly going into the pork production market kevin ellich ace research analyst sure ok and then steve while i got you so sales and marketing expense was actually down in terms of absolute dollar basis right for the first time in a while just wondering what caused this i mean should we expect it to continue to decrease and then kind of on the other hand you talked about going direct i think over a year wondering if you need to add any salesforce or infrastructure and could that lead to a little bit of higher cost in the second half of the year steven j quinlan chief financial officer vice president yeah i guess i would say as long as our sales on the animal safety side are sluggish or in this case declining you d see related sales expenses would kind of follow along with that our goal is to stay positive we want our sales and marketing expenses to grow that means our revenues are growing and all the related commissions and shipping and advertising and promotional things that means the markets are growing and those are good things for us we are for the distribution business in europe we have added staff to market those products there i don t think it s going to have a material impact on our sales expenses in the second quarter because we are also using our existing salesforce to go after that business john adent president chief executive officer right we ve got kevin we ve got existing teams in lot of those markets so they weren t allowed to sell those because there was an exclusive relationship and now they re going to be able to kevin ellich ace research analyst okay and then lastly john your veterinary instruments and other business in both disposals and animal care pretty weak this quarter and i know you had a tough comp on the animal care side with vaccines just wondering what s going on there and do you think that s going to continue will that continue to decline or should we see a reversal on the second half john adent president chief executive officer i think you know i ve got to go back and look but i think we have pretty strong growth in those last quarter kevin ellich ace research analyst you did well and instruments was up 9 last quarter john adent president chief executive officer yeah and so i was so that s the one that stuck out for me kevin as i m wondering if there is a little bit of if you average the two you re going to see it a little bit as a normalized somewhat this market is and it was kind of a little bit of timing on we re up one quarter down on the other i don t think there s anything fundamentally different going on other than it s a tough animal safety market kevin ellich ace research analyst got you that s all i have thanks guys have a good holiday john adent president chief executive officer thank you kev yeah you too operator and our next question comes from david westenberg from guggenheim securities david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst hi thanks for taking the question so glad to see the tick up in r d i think you guys developed some good product so how should we expect on those new products to hit the market is that fiscal year 21 is they get to you said that we expect the spending to continue and how big are these the products that might be coming out in 2021 should we expect a growth lift in our models to come then john adent president chief executive officer sure thanks david look we re excited about the r d that s why we re doing it i mean you saw the ergot testing that s the only one available for rapid testing today worldwide we re the only one that has it we re trying to stay ahead of some of the regulations we think that s the position that we want to be in that was driven by our european team our r d group out of europe did a fantastic job of taking that and driving that with the help of the group here in lansing and we re excited we ve got some new products coming in the second half of the year now again i love for all of them to be blockbuster but we ve got some new things from a technology standpoint that s coming and from a product offering that s coming in the second half of the year and then into next year i don t know what and steve i don t think we ve ever talked about what we ve forecasted for those other than that has always been a key piece of our growth and we know that it needs to be and that s why we invest in it and it s something that we re focusing on to continue to drive growth in the second half of the year and next year steve do you want to comment along david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst no i think you ve john adent president chief executive officer some product growth there ok yeah yeah david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst so then in terms of the alternative meat i know stock price wise they ve been hit are you seeing an increase in demand from these producers of alternative meat how do you see that business playing out as kind of a i mean in terms of products food producers as kind of a market let s just say john adent president chief executive officer yeah no david i think it s just like any other segmentation i mean you remember one organics came on the market and everyone said it s niche and it s grown into a nice mark i think the plant based proteins is going to continue to be a nice market i think it s got consumers who want it and as long as consumers want it it s going to continue to drive and grow and what s interesting to me is they have the same issues whether are there making plant base hamburger pattys or meat based hamburger pattys you still have to check for allergens you still have the check for e coli you still have to check for listeria you still have to check for everything so whether it s plant based or meat based we sell the same products into those types of customers and so it s really around food production and anything around food production that s where we re there to help those producers make the safest product they can for their consumers david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it no thank you and then i know there is not much you can say in terms of m a here but can you maybe talk about some of the priorities whether it s a technology or maybe a product or is it something of interest and then maybe if you can talk about what s more interesting animal safety versus food safety i get that you can t be specific so any sort of generalities might be helpful here thank you john adent president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think you ve seen kind of what we ve done on the technology side with neogen analytics and blockchain right this is something where we heard about it and we heard loud and clear from our customers that they re still keeping a lot of our customers still keep paper records for when the fda comes in to do an audit to provide paper record keeping which you know you just kind of shake your head and think we ought to be able to help so we got working with different outside groups and vetted what we felt was the best plant mapping software and risk management software available and partnered with them to develop neogen analytics same type of thing for blockchain right is i just read about this i think it was well about six months ago mcdonald s said that in the future and that was the timeline they gave that half of their meat beef was going to be antibiotic free well how are they going to be able to prove that without a blockchain solution and really we re on the forefront we re leading that today to be able to provide that type of transparency for customers and consumers so the it side continues to drive i think you have to it s if you just do tests and you don t give the customers ways to capture and analyze and then act on data it s kind of a waste so we re really pushing that the other areas we look out to and you mentioned it properly is where is a technology that we have a hold in the portfolio so where should we be looking where is the market going what are those types of technologies and we have a scientific advisory council where we are constantly vetting new technologies and what s coming down the pipeline that we can it s either being done in another market on the human side that we can bring into our segmentation or its brand new and we try to find those types of things and say ok how is this going to change the future or the way we do business and then lastly we look at geographic markets where are we underrepresented i think that kind of led this discussion even with our european distributor was they did a good job for us but they weren t growing at the rate that we wanted they weren t happy with the growth rate we weren t happy with the growth rate and we came up with a solution that we think is going to help both parties grow because we were under represented in specific markets so where are we underrepresented and what are the things we can do to accelerate those growth rates and that could be geographically it could be by a product it could be in a product segmentation that s how we look at it david westenberg guggenheim securities analyst got it thank you and enjoy your holidays john adent president chief executive officer yeah thanks david you too operator at this time we have no further questions i d like to turn the call back over to mr adent for closing remark john adent president chief executive officer thanks sylvia i just want to thank all of you for your time today and i wish everyone on the call and listening a happy holidays and a prosperous new year

argentina s center left government approved on monday a package of emergency measures aimed at lifting the south american country out of its worst economic crisis in years argentina is in a recession caused by a currency collapse that struck 18 months ago poverty levels in the country of 44 million still top 40 percent in a country that was among the world s wealthiest in the early 20th century the emergency economic package was announced by new president alberto fernandez who took office two weeks ago with a vow to put argentina back on its feet the emergency measures were announced just after 5 00 pm in the government s official bulletin several hours after it was expected due to some last minute changes fernandez s plan involves tax hikes on foreign currency purchases agricultural exports and car sales the government says the tax hikes will only affect the upper and middle classes the bill passed the lower house of congress on friday and the senate on saturday fernandez has described this crisis as almost as bad as that of 2001 when argentina defaulted on a 100 billion debt its current foreign debt stands at around 90 percent of gdp it is not the same as 2001 but it is similar at that time poverty was at 57 percent today we have 41 percent poor people then we had a debt default today we are in virtual default fernandez said in an interview with tv program la cornice on sunday tackle hunger the new law will allow the executive extra powers over finance tax administration pensions tariffs energy health and social issues the government s aim is to attend to the needs of the most vulnerable sectors and to spark growth social security administration chief alejandro vanoli said the government has vowed to tackle hunger and has announced a 10 000 160 peso bonus for pensioners and a six month freeze on public utility prices it s a difficult situation it s a country that has had to restructure its debt with a deep fiscal and financial deficit in a situation of recession and inflation said vanoli the state is putting all its efforts into those suffering the most from the social situation market friendly liberal ex president mauricio macri had planned in september to negotiate a restructuring of debt repayments with the international monetary fund with which he d agreed a 57 billion bailout loan last year argentina has already received 44 billion of that loan but fernandez has said that he will refuse the remaining disbursements he told reporters on monday an imf delegation is due in argentina in the next few days huge freefall argentina s economy is expected to shrink by 3 1 percent in 2019 inflation is hovering around 55 percent and unemployment is rising to 10 5 percent that s what we inherited we can t face up to it and pay the obligations that we ve been landed with fernandez said on sunday as he made comparisons with the 2001 crisis we had massive unemployment we also have that now what we didn t have then is inflation but now we have it economist claudio loser of the washington based centennial group says fernandez wants to make it clear to creditors that they re going to have to negotiate a restructuring with argentina he s referring to a virtual default to dramatize the situation and show that macri left him a huge problem on friday argentina unilaterally postponed a 9 billion maturities payment until august a move that saw rating agencies fitch and s p downgrade its credit rating on monday though fitch restored argentina s rating to cc from restricted default but warned of a high probability of another default of some kind we re in a huge freefall in two years argentina has massively increased its debt said fernandez argentina owes 335 billion just over 90 percent of its gross domestic product that figure was a little over 50 percent in 2016 soon after macri came to power one of argentina s main problems is its people prefer to hold dollars rather than pesos meaning they try to sell their local currency and often keep their dollars in foreign bank accounts argentina has no more dollars macri lost 100 billion argentina needs dollars to come back in said fernandez who has maintained the monthly 200 limit of buying foreign currency imposed by macri last august dollars are scarce as there aren t any they have to be expensive to buy he said argentina s center left

washington one side of the democratic party wants the nation s billionaires to pay a slightly higher tax rate on their income through an unprecedented wealth tax the other side would target the stock holdings real estate and other property of the nation s billionaires to raise trillions of dollars of new revenue one side has virtually no plans to have the government take over private industry the other has an armada of proposals for federal interventions spanning from government control of american health insurance to public production of prescription drugs to mandating worker control over their companies with democrats set to debate again this week the democratic presidential primary has revealed a sharp split in the party over core tenets of american capitalism as the months long campaign has exposed disagreements about fundamental aspects of the nation s economic system the leading democratic presidential candidates have split into two camps with sens bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts leading a liberal flank in the polling and former vice president joe biden and pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana leading the moderate side the eventual nominee will determine the party s position on the taxes paid by the richest americans the size of the federal welfare state the makeup of the health care industry and the relationship between workers and corporations among other vital economic questions the gap is so large that warren and sanders would spend up to 10 times as much as biden over the next 10 years and about eight times as much as buttigieg at the heart of this primary is a debate over the future of american capitalism said timothy naftali an associate professor of history at new york university the democratic party is trying to come to terms with where it stands on the kinds of issues warren and sanders raise on the tax system on debt and education on the nature of how we deliver health care he said these are big issues and sanders and warren are on one side and most of the other democrats appear to be on the other the jostling comes as president donald trump and white house officials have seized on recent economic news to argue that their agenda of low taxes reduced regulations and a shake up in trade policy has helped push the stock market and labor market to record levels the white house has tried to seize on the more liberal proposals emanating from the democratic primary and accuse trump s eventual rival of running on a platform of socialism sanders and warren have aggressively pushed this pretty far left agenda on the economy and biden has tried to run up the middle said stephen moore a conservative at the heritage foundation who advises trump but at the end of the day if you have a president biden or a president buttigieg with a democratic congress you could get much higher taxes a green new deal and a pretty aggressive step toward socialized medicine democrats say the recent spate of strong economic data overlooks the deeper economic suffering confronting broad swaths of the working class but their solutions to that suffering are markedly different adding up his various policy proposals sanders is calling for new federal spending that would amount to more than 50 trillion over the next decade a number about equal to one fifth of the entire u s economy over that time warren who has called herself a capitalist to my bones but agrees with many of sanders s policies is proposing upward of 30 trillion in new spending part of the difference between warren and sanders is she has a less costly estimate of what it would take to pay for expanding medicare to all americans his climate housing and student debt plans are also significantly bigger than hers by contrast buttigieg is proposing about 6 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade while biden has laid out how he would pay for about 3 trillion in spending over that time warren and sanders have also pushed a wealth tax that could raise more than 4 trillion taxing accumulated wealth and assets rather than the traditional democratic policy of taxing income biden released a significantly less aggressive tax plan earlier this month that would raise taxes on investors and firms a plan much closer to the position of the obama administration toward the end of his second term some academics said the current division on economic policy between the democratic party s leading presidential candidates may be wider than that between republican and democratic presidential candidates in recent general elections judging by their tax policies for instance sanders and biden are about 10 times further apart today than john mccain and barack obama were in the 2008 presidential campaign the last time a party faced such divergent paths may have been the 2016 gop primary when most republican candidates pledged a conventional approach to fiscal conservatism including entitlement cuts and free trade while trump promised to leave medicare and social security untouched and criticized trade agreements the democratic campaigns will continue to announce new economic policies biden s campaign for example is working on a trade policy aimed at seeking a contrast with trump by highlighting the former vice president s experience working with countries worldwide according to two people familiar with the campaign s internal planning and buttigieg aides are crafting a tax plan he is the only candidate in the top tier without one that would probably aim to tax the rich but not go as far as sanders and warren two other people said these diverging approaches reflect not only differences in the value of specific policies some experts say but also philosophical questions about the degree to which american capitalism requires massive federal intervention a central part of the divide includes divergent paths over how to reform the nation s welfare state with sanders and warren pushing for universal programs such as a medicare for all health care system and tuition free colleges and universities and sanders also calling for eliminating all student debt sanders has long pitched universal programs as generating greater political support and reducing administrative inefficiencies while buttigieg has critiqued the liberals plan for universal free college as benefiting the children of millionaires and billionaires sanders responded earlier this month by telling msnbc i m very glad that mr buttigieg is worried that i have been too easy on upper income people and the millionaires and billionaires the camps also split over the extent to which they target certain powerful financial interests with warren and sanders calling for significantly curbing the influence of actors such as wall street banks the fossil fuel industry private health insurance companies and the nation s approximately 750 billionaires part of the split with the moderates emerges from a belief among those on the left that the harm created by these special interests cannot be mitigated if their clout and influence over the political system is not significantly reduced both warren and sanders would make the democratic party a social democratic one it would really change the fundamental basis of the party said dean baker a left leaning economist who is supporting warren and called the primary without a doubt the starkest policy choice in democrats modern history if they get the nomination democrats would be proposing to make us look a lot like france or germany or even closer to some of the nordic countries but whereas there were vast differences between sanders and hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic primary that campaign turned more on questions of whether the party wanted to break with its establishment sanders and warren have in 2020 expanded the policy fight into additional spheres producing sweeping plans on antitrust regulation government production in key areas and worker control over corporate america warren for instance has called for breaking up silicon valley tech firms including amazon and google while sanders has released a broad antitrust policy that would establish new rules for breaking up monopolies warren began her campaign with a proposal that would create a government run drug producer to bring down pharmaceutical prices sanders announced a plan to create publicly owned internet providers and universal broadband access both liberals have called for giving workers some voting power over large corporations although sanders s would apply to many more companies and also give them a percentage of their stock holdings public ownership ideas have suddenly become core parts of the economic agenda said peter gowan an economic expert at the democracy collaborative a left leaning think tank we re not just talking about the welfare state now it s the welfare state plus plans to democratize the economy to some of the moderates defenders their approach represents a more pragmatic attempt to address some of the economy s bigger challenges quickly providing help to those who need it most rather than pursuing sweeping programs with little likelihood of being enacted in a divided political system some also view the sanders and warren plans as inadvisable either because they aim to raise taxes too steeply or would force americans to give up their private insurance it s not just about being realistic he just doesn t like the idea said one adviser to biden who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign s thinking about the single payer plan we don t think you can raise 3 trillion a year in taxes it s absurd biden and buttigieg have also ridiculed the math of their opponents as overly optimistic and said the middle class would be hurt by the tax increases required in their large government expansions but they have also dismissed the idea that they are less concerned about the social crises in american life the distinction is between the economic issues on the minds of most americans and big transformative ideas that capture a primary voters attention but aren t great general election issues said andy slavitt a former health administrator who served in the obama administration or as minnesota sen amy klobuchar put it at the last debate i have bold ideas just because they re different than elizabeth s doesn t mean they re bold still there are signs that candidates are under pressure to make adjustments biden told cnbc earlier this month that he would support a new financial transaction tax on wall street his comments came one day after his campaign released tax proposals that rejected the idea if one side wins it s economic disruption in advantage of the people with the losers being billionaires and defense contractors said alex lawson president of social security works a liberal group and if the other side wins it s less clear but it probably looks basically similar to how it looks now but without trump

part i of five part series austerity on the island puerto rico with more than 70 billion of bonds at stake has become the latest testing ground of austerity as the right prescription for an economy in decline the oversight board has embarked on a strategy that leans toward conservative prescriptions to restore fiscal discipline and economic growth as the territory undergoes its historic debt restructuring in this five part series the bond buyer examines whether the board s approach is likely to succeed and reviews academic research on economies where the strategy has been applied and the impact austerity has had on vulnerable populations such as puerto rico s it also explores alternative measures that may be needed to guard against a repeat of the crisis that led to the biggest municipal bankruptcy in u s history now after nearly two years of economic growth following hurricane maria s devastation reports from the economic development bank for puerto rico signal the economy may have resumed the decline experienced from 2006 to hurricane maria s arrival in september 2017 the bank s economic activity index has declined four out of the last five months on a year over year basis the negative economic readings have raised concern that the austerity measures may undercut the island s recovery putting bondholders on a path for a second round of restructuring in a few years regardless of any deal they work out in puerto rico s bankruptcy court there s no reason to assume that long term population and economic decline won t resume said matt fabian partner at municipal market analytics this doesn t on its own mean puerto rico will default again but it suggests puerto rico s finances and infrastructure will still be fragile when the next shock occurs in its fiscal plan the board outlined a schedule requiring 12 78 billion in spending cuts and revenue increasing measures from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2024 most of these adjustments are scheduled to be carried out in coming years the board which the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act established in 2016 also set out to reform governmental policies the board s measures were greeted with skepticism from more liberal economists from the start the proposals that have been put forward are likely to make the depression in which puerto rico has been continue nobel prize winning economist joseph stiglitz said in april 2017 i ve seen policies like this in other countries around the world and they have almost never worked in fact i can t think of a single example when it s worked though the oversight board itself projects its measures will reduce puerto rico s growth in the short term executive director natalie jaresko said stiglitz s criticisms were misguided he has to look at where our reality is this is a sustainability issue she said in a dec 5 interview with the bond buyer unlike some countries stiglitz may be familiar with puerto rico can t print money or change its interest rates jaresko said in u s congress where the committee overseeing u s territories is weighing amendments to promesa the board s fiscal approach has also come under fire austerity alone does not work and will only lead to further economic contraction said house natural resources committee chairman raúl grijalva d ariz at a committee hearing concerning puerto rico on may 2 board policies from its foundation the board has had the task of bringing structural balance to a budget that then gov alejandro garcía padilla in 2016 projected to be short 58 7 billion from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2026 the board is supposed to do that without decimating essential social services or cutting too much into pension funding and ultimately restore access to the capital markets and to do so in a manner that will open a way to economic growth creating the board s fiscal plan which lays out the board s policies was an extraordinarily complex process jaresko said yet there are some indications that the board had decided upon its approach very early in its tenure without getting expert or public input at the board s first meeting in september 2016 board member andrew biggs said that he had done a study showing that countries in fiscal crises that focus on cutting spending much more than raising taxes have better outcomes the first version of the board fiscal plan released in march 2017 had the same balance of fiscal measures also at the first meeting board member arthur gonzález said the board members had to present a united front concerning their policies consistent with this board discussions of policy prior to then and largely since then have been held in private jaresko said the creation of the board s fiscal plan started with then governor alexandro garcía padilla s submission of a proposed fiscal plan in october 2016 subsequent governor ricardo rosselló submitted his own proposed fiscal plan in early 2017 however the board didn t hold any public meetings on the plan before releasing its first version in march 2017 most of the board s overall approach was found in that document even if the board has revised it several times since then according to jaresko in creating the plans the board solicited advice from consultants and professional economists and demographers for ideas on how to promote economic growth it turned to the local business community jaresko said board members and jaresko provided input all along she said after major hurricanes hit the island in late summer 2017 the board held three public hearings to help it revise the plan to address the structural deficit puerto rico s government needed to be smaller the board s cuts to government spending thus didn t stem from an ideological belief that island s government should be smaller she said nevertheless the board s approach to addressing puerto rico s problems is at least partly drawn from conservative prescriptions for example the board plans to introduce a work requirement for recipients to participate in the nutrition assistance program it also pressed to change puerto rico s employment law to make island employment at will though it dropped that measure from the fiscal plan in the face of opposition from the local government the board s approach is also conservative in that its fiscal plan s approach to economic growth is usually to reduce impediments to business as discussed later some economists suggest other paths the board s fiscal plan includes a range of steps to ease doing business on the island among these are steps to speed construction permits and make it easier to fill out tax forms and register property with the cooperation of the local government the board plans to introduce a local version of the federal earned income tax credit the board plans to work with the local government to update a program that trains the workforce it seeks to take steps to increase electricity reliability and lower electrical prices to make the island a more competitive place for businesses to work in the board s quest to achieve a balanced budget it plans to raise taxes and cut spending such policy actions will generate a contractionary impact on the economy in the short term but are necessary to drive fiscal sustainability in the long term the board said in a may 2019 fiscal plan by the board s own reckoning its taxing and spending policies will cost puerto rico 5 3 of gross national product growth from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2024 in the same period the board projects expenditure cuts of 11 7 billion offset by spending 1 billion for a new earned income tax credit for a net expenditure cut of 10 7 billion the board s net spending cuts and tax and revenue increases amount to 13 2 billion in the period compared with anticipated puerto rico government spending of 82 2 billion after the measures it anticipates its tax and revenue measures will generate an additional 2 5 billion in the period the board usually doesn t call its measures austerity instead it describes them as right sizing and right rating among other things however the fiscal policies follow wikipedia s definition of austerity austerity is a political economic term referring to policies that aim to reduce government budget deficits through spending cuts tax increases or a combination of both in december jaresko cited several examples of political entities in fiscal crises that had pursued policies similar to those of the board and had succeeded she mentioned ukraine under her tenure as minister of finance in 2014 to 2016 when it had a fiscal debt and military challenges jaresko also cited peru in the early and mid 2000s turkey from 2001 to 2007 colombia in 2003 and the former soviet state of georgia from 2014 to the present as examples peru s government reduced spending in the period and saw poverty drop to 21 in 2015 from 58 in 2001 turkey made budget cuts and introduced performance management and saw gross domestic product increased by an average of 7 1 annually from 2002 to 2007 colombia introduced taxes in 2003 and saw gdp growth better than the latin american average during the period finally georgia in the period reduced spending and experienced healthy gdp growth rates from 2016 to the present but puerto rico has its own problems arguably bigger than most of those political entities jaresko pointed to and some say the board s approach isn t the right way to go next on 12 24 history provides lessons as austerians battle fiscal crises

last week we reported that something strange was going on at the same time that central banks are injecting 100 billion each month in electronic money to crush volatility and ramp markets a similar amount in physical currency and precious metals was literally disappearing the mystery in a nutshell was as follows while banks are printing more bank notes than ever these seem to be disappearing off the face of the earth and nobody knows where or why or as the wsj notes central banks don t know where they have gone or why and are playing detective trying to crack the same mystery and while readers can read up much more on the topic of disappearing hard assets here a few days after fox business picked up on this thread writing that almost 1 5 trillion of the world s physical cash with 100 dollar bills making up the vast majority was reportedly unaccounted for so what happened to the money to get to the bottom of this mystery this was the question fox business anchor lou dobbs asked the man who literally signs every single us dollar bill treasury secretary steven mnuchin the response literally a lot of these 100 bills are sitting in bank vaults all over the world mnuchin said mnuchin pointed to the negative interest rates causing people to turn to american dollars as a solid investment the dollar is the reserve currency of the world and everybody wants to hold dollars mnuchin said on lou dobbs tonight and the reason why they want to hold dollars is because the u s is a safe place to have your money to invest and to hold your assets mnuchin said it s interesting that in a increasingly digital world the demand for u s currency continues to go up adding that there s a lot of benjamins all over the world actually it s not that interesting the world s growing appetite for physical assets such as paper dollars and gold coupled with the continued interest in cryptocurrencies and other traditional currency alternatives merely confirms that faith in artificially levitated markets is approaching a tipping point meanwhile the world s top 0 001 ers continue to quietly cash out literally and put their benjamins in secret vaults in the middle of somewhere even as central banks do everything in their power to reduce the amount of physical currency in circulation and replace it with easily trackable digital alternatives as we reported back in august there are now more 100 bills in circulation than 1 bills according to data from the federal reserve which found there are more 100s than any other denomination of u s currency and as an indication of just how much demand there is for physical stores of value consider this the number of bills featuring a picture of benjamin franklin has about doubled since the start of the recession in 2018 the federal reserve bank of chicago illustrated a correlation between low interest rates and high currency demand though it also noted outside factors could help explain swelling demand the bank estimated that 80 of all 100 bills last year were actually in circulation in foreign countries and explained that residents in other countries particularly those with unstable financial systems often use the notes as a safe haven to watch the exchange click on the image below and fast forward to 7 minutes 30 seconds in it s not just us dollar that are disappearing however few are as perplexed by the fate of the missing cash as the german central bank according to the bundesbank more than 150 billion euros are being hoarded in germany this has led the european central bank and others to ask the public for help everyone says that they are not hoarding cash but the money is clearly somewhere said henk esselink head of the issue and circulation section in the ecb s currency management division people hide their money everywhere said sven bertelmann head of the bundesbank s national analysis centre in mainz germany sometimes bank notes are buried in the garden where they start decomposing or hidden in attics where they are used by mice for building nests it happens again and again that people keep money in an envelope and then they shred it by mistake bertelmann said we pick up the bank notes with tweezers and then start to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle australia s central bank says its best guess is that only around a quarter of the bank notes in circulation are used for everyday transactions up to 8 of cash is used in the shadow economy tax avoidance or illegal payments while as much as 10 could have been lost that is 7 6 billion australian dollars 5 2 billion missing at the beach or in couch cushions or simply lost in a boating accident to avoid the taxman until the rainy days arrive the biggest use of cash is as a store of wealth in safes under beds and at the back of cupboards both here in australia and elsewhere around the world mr lowe the rba governor said swiss national bank officials likewise found that hoarding of swiss francs jumped around the year 2000 likely motivated by fear of the y2k bug infecting computer systems the bursting of the dot com bubble the september 11 terrorist attacks and introduction of the euro the financial crisis that began in 2007 encouraged people to stash even more meanwhile with a financial crisis looming and getting closer by the day for some countries such as new zealand making money disappear is becoming a national pastime around a third of new zealand s new bank notes headed overseas in 2017 up from 6 four years earlier that happened around the time that tourism overtook dairy as the country s main export money spinner leading officials to speculate on the role played by currency exchanges especially in asia the trail mostly ran cold after that the bank could only identify the whereabouts of around 25 of new zealand s cash the rest of about 75 has disappeared our sense is that we re in the same boat as a lot of other central banks out there said christian hawkesby assistant governor at the rbnz we can t fully explain why holdings of cash are rising and where they are going

in his famous book one up on wall street peter lynch discussed his philosophy of finding stocks that would deliver at least a 1 000 percent return aka ten baggers while his process involves identifying high growth under covered companies a macro economy focused approach could also deliver stellar returns if the right industry can be identified at the right time in 2019 the information

drive equity markets for instance in 2019 rate cuts by the federal reserve boosted investor confidence and played a role in the positive market performance source lpl financial as illustrated above the market performance after three consecutive 25 basis point cuts has been positive in each instance going back to 1975 and 2019 did not come as an exception however interest rates will likely remain unchanged in 2020 the below excerpt from the statement issued by the federal open market committee in december confirms this the committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is

similar upside but we see the balance of risks around our constructive macro scenario consistent with a tactical preference for europe vs the u s we find current european equity valuations attractive compared to the u s there are multiple reasons to be bullish on this region first the majority of companies have continued to increase their capital investments in the last four years and these will help earnings grow in 2020 and beyond source schroders second consumer spending can be expected to remain strong in the year ahead as well which is evident from the strong growth of eurozone wages in

than their u s peers from a valuation perspective the below graph plots the price earnings ratio of a few major markets around the world source reuters even though chinese markets are more attractive considering the growth opportunities and the current earnings multiple european markets provide more value for money than the u s at present graham secker the chief european equity strategist at

these regions have underperformed developed markets in the last five years morgan stanley upgraded emerging market equities from underweight to equal weight on dec 13 and released a report in which they forecast strong growth in these markets in 2020 source morgan stanley the improving trade situation between the u s and china will provide a much needed boost to equities in the asia pacific

security posture capital markets last week was light on rate movement seemingly echoing the main impeachment defense proffered by republicans so what maybe it s because president donald trump seems certain to survive a senate trial or maybe it s because home sales remain strong as does consumer spending this week figures to be even less important in the mortgage market with most releases scheduled for today and tomorrow and many employees off their desks at some point or for the whole week due to the christmas day holiday recent economic data continues to show the us economy continuing to expand despite many headwinds leading economic indicators were unchanged in november however both the coincident and lagging indexes increased for the month and overall the data was better than october personal income also increased in november showing that the personal savings rate increased to 7 9 percent real gdp remained at 2 1 for the third quarter following the final revision industrial production picked up in november following the end of the uaw strike at gm new housing starts increased to a 1 365 000 annual rate and single family starts were at an annual rate of 928 000 the highest pace since january existing home sales declined slightly however inventory remains at a tight 3 7 months supply as we close out the year the us economy continues to expand despite deteriorating global conditions while growth has slowed from one year ago the fed believes current monetary policy will provide enough support to maintain the current expansion despite a relatively light economic calendar last week the markets had plenty of headlines to digest first president trump was officially impeached in the house of representatives following in the footsteps of bill clinton and andrew johnson for the most part as noted above the markets shrugged it off as it is unlikely that the senate will follow suit on the trade front the usmca continues to move forward which will provide some much needed certainty for businesses operating in north america additionally boeing announced it would halt production of the 737 max which is estimated to negatively impact q1 gdp by up to 0 5 percentage points the announcement of a phase one trade deal between the us and china eased some of the uncertainly surrounding global trade although there are details to be finalized before the complete impact can be measured regardless a reduction in tariffs and backing down from combative rhetoric should improve the economic outlook heading into the new year how about some good news from washington the house overwhelmingly approved the new united states mexico canada agreement this past thursday the result of an unusual partnership between trade representative lighthizer and speaker pelosi the deal which comes after nearly a year of negotiations fulfills president trump s pledge to revise the north american free trade agreement it also satisfies nearly every democratic

the flood of obituaries that noted the passing of paul volcker 1927 2019 last week have almost all lauded his achievement as fed chair 1979 1987 in reining in the double digit inflation that ravaged the us economy during the 1970s volcker was referred to as the former fed chairman who fought inflation here inflation tamer and a full fledged inflation warrior here and the fed chairman who waged war on inflation and led the federal reserve s brute force campaign to subdue inflation here mr volcker certainly deserves credit for curbing the great inflation of the 1970s however he also merits a lion s share of the blame for unleashing the great inflation on the us and the world economy in the first place for it was mr volcker who masterminded the program that president nixon announced on august 15 1971 which unilaterally suspended gold convertibility of us dollars held by foreign governments and central banks imposed a fascist wage price freeze on the us economy and slapped a 10 percent surcharge on foreign imports tragically by severing the last link between the dollar and gold volcker s program scuttled the last chance of restoring a genuine gold standard more than two years before nixon slammed down the gold window volcker the recently appointed undersecretary of the treasury for monetary affairs gave an oral presentation to nixon and his closest advisors on us balance of payments problems the presentation was based on a memo that the secret volcker group initiated by henry kissinger spent five months preparing the case for gold lar lehrman lewis best price 16 94 buy new 10 00 as of 01 10 utc details among other things volcker recommended a continuation of capital controls to prop up the inflated dollar s overvalued exchange rate and a massive appreciation or revaluation of the currencies of less inflationary countries such as west germany placing the burden of adjustment to unrestrained us inflation on these countries volcker then planted the time bomb that would eventually detonate and seal the fate of the gold standard he suggested to nixon that if these measures did not work to sustain the pseudo gold standard of the bretton woods system a run on the us gold stock could only be avoided by unilaterally repudiating the postwar us pledge to convert foreign official dollar holdings into gold unfortunately the volcker group report summarily dismissed the alternative of raising possibly doubling the dollar price of gold i e devaluing the dollar which would have increased the value of the us gold stock and facilitated the restoration of a genuine gold standard only a real gold standard could have halted and reversed the slow motion collapse that the international monetary system had been undergoing since the mid 1960s due to large and persistent us payments deficits driven by profligate dollar creation volcker however hated and wanted to get rid of the last vestiges of the gold standard and replace it with a fixed exchange rate system dominated by the us fiat dollar to further enhance the power and prestige of the us in international affairs according to volcker the stability and strength of our currency was important to sustaining the broad role of the united states in the world years later volcker revealed i have never been able to shake the feeling that a strong currency is generally a good thing and that it is typically a sign of vigor and strength and competitiveness one of his biographers intimated that volcker s longstanding regret at having been rejected for military service during world war ii because of his height was at the root of his single minded determination to maintain the supremacy of the american dollar as the world s premier currency indeed volcker struggled mightily to make the dollar appear strong even while rampant money printing to finance great society welfare programs and the vietnam war inexorably weakened it but volcker bitterly opposed raising the price of gold because he feared that open devaluation of the inflated dollar would not only diminish the status and reputation of the us but also reward people and countries he detested namely speculators in gold and gold producing countries such as the soviet union and south africa he especially loathed and wanted to punish president charles de gaulle and the french for embarrassing and discrediting the us by withdrawing from nato and exposing the weakness of the dollar by insisting on converting their dollars into gold in the face of us threats to remove military protection against the soviet union to add insult to injury de gaulle had sent naval ships to retrieve french gold when a full blown run on us gold stock appeared imminent in early 1971 volcker prepared a memorandum for the new treasury secretary former texas governor and master political operative john connally the memo contained three main proposals first countries with less inflationary monetary policies and therefore balance of payments surpluses such as west germany and japan would be imposed upon to substantially appreciate the value of their currencies thereby encouraging us exports and stifling its imports while sparing the it the embarrassment of openly devaluing the dollar second volcker recommended a preemptive strike against gold in the form of a cold blooded suspension of gold convertibility volcker s final proposal was a temporary wage price freeze as one of volcker s biographers characterized his motivation e wanted america to act preemptively to avoid appearance of defeat at the hands of currency speculators emphasis added secretary connally bought into volcker s program when a severe dollar crisis struck a few months later he used all his substantial political wiles to persuade nixon of the merits of the volcker plan then fed chairman and nixon advisor arthur burns for all his erroneous monetary ideas and policy failures was convinced that gold should play at least nominally a central role in the international monetary system in fact fter nixon took office burns proposed to end the balance of payments problem by increasing the official price of gold which would have effectively devalue the dollar in burns s view this would maintain gold as the anchor of a fixed exchange rate system an outcome that volcker would have detested not surprisingly burns was troubled by volcker who he thought had given a stupid reply to nixon about raising the price of gold burns also recognized and bemoaned volcker s influence over connally somehow poor and wretched volcker never knowing where he stood on any issue had succeeded in instilling an irrational fear of gold in his tyrannical master whom he tried constantly to please by catering to his hatred of foreigners particularly the french unfortunately burns had badly underestimated volcker and had mistaken his tact and strategic compromising for vacillation and indecisiveness as his biographer noted volcker admired john connally s social skills and had learned much from the master politician he preferred to equivocate qualify and risk being branded a poor communicator rather than feign certainty in the end the wily connally volcker axis prevailed over the politically naïve burns burns s biographer clearly recognized volcker s political cunning in winning over nixon the president decided against burns paul volcker convinced him that suspension was inevitable and that delay would only create financial chaos perhaps more important nixon realized if he announced the move as part of a new economic package he would appear to be acting decisively to take charge of the crisis making as volcker put it the devaluation of the dollar into a political triumph which was no mean feat thus it was that volcker s memo was used as the basis of the new economic policy that was hammered out by nixon and his advisors including volcker at camp david and announced in nixon s fateful sunday address to the nation end the fed ron paul best price 2 18 buy new 5 68 as of 09 55 utc details one obituarist listed volcker s great public accomplishments thusly he was the point man at the treasury department in 1971 who managed the dollar s untethering from gold he quelled the double digit inflation that took root in the u s in the late 1970s he helped guide the country s response to the 2008 financial crisis unfortunately this list grossly overstates volcker s public accomplishments because it does not reveal the causal connection between his vanquishing the last remnants of the gold standard and the ensuing inflation

twenty years ago a court denied the reserve bank of india s request for swift justice for banks against a large loan defaulter saying don t twist arms so hard that they break but last week s rs 42 000 crore recovery from loan defaulter essar steel demonstrates the power of policy when the executive legislature and courts together take on vested interests precedence and history the 1 658 days that have elapsed since the ibc work began the delay of 1 297 days since the ibc became law and the 863 days since essar was admitted into bankruptcy symbolise the fixed costs for bold change in our democracy but it also symbolises the upsides of policy boldness and persistence arcelor s takeover of essar clears the judicial legislative and commercial path for speedy bank recovery from the next 200 large defaulters i believe that the current challenges faced by the indian economy represent short term pain for the long term gain imposed by multiple structural changes and that economic growth in 2020 will be higher than in 2019 because structural reform will start paying off economies are more like human bodies than machines doctors know that post mortems have a certainty that prescriptions don t they obsess about iatrogenic risks or unintended consequences of their treatment and recognise that acute patients need an icu but chronic patients need rehabilitation poverty is not like cancer where every malignant cell must be eliminated or it will come back instead poverty is like being obese the fight is hard and slow victories are partial sometimes you regress but keeping up the fight by all necessary means can mitigate obesity eventually diet and exercise will become a way of life and a healthier body will yield tangible benefits india s economy in 2020 is not heading into the icu but is heading out of a broad and deep rehab independent monetary policy and fiscal discipline have halved inflation the gst has cut indirect tax categories from 100 to 5 and nearly doubled payers to 12 million an awake rbi the ibc and mergers of nationalised banks make bank accounting cleaner bank balance sheets stronger and blunt crony capitalism the real estate

the gross capital formation as a percentage of gdp is rising after bottoming in 2017 food production growth is now substantially higher than population growth making inflation decline structural and yes even onions we produce 23 million tonnes and consume only 15 million and stock markets now largely offer valuation premiums to growth and governance the economic slowdown explanations must be mindful of what writer chimamanda adichie called the dangers of a single story a thoughtful paper by arvind subramanian and josh felman lists multiple stories land and labour market constraints income inequality impact of agriculture on aggregate demand demonetisation and gst monetary tightness and policy uncertainty i disagree with their icu conclusion a sustained rehab of structural reforms and monetary and fiscal intervention will work the monetary policy s 135 basis point cut in 2019 brings the rbi s benchmark repo rate to its lowest since 2010 the fiscal response for 2019 delivered a corporate tax cut accelerated capex created a fund for stalled housing projects and for buying out nbfc assets arcelor s investment an outcome of multiple court cases multiple ibc amendments and multiple rbi directives will accelerate resolution of the 1 497 pending ibc cases particularly of the 535 that have crossed the 270 day deadline the best expression of gratitude and duas to the remarkable public servants in the ministry of finance ministry of corporate affairs the courts and the rbi for this accomplishment will be replicating their boldness and teamwork in five areas labour

people in california why is india s gdp today 20 per cent of china s when they were equal in 1991 why did the world s largest democracy created on the infertile soil of the world s most hierarchical society not create the world s largest economy only because of the low productivity of our government cities sectors firms and people my recent overseas investor roadshow suggests that structural reforms the developments in china and negative interest rates make india attractive the world wants us to succeed if we want to the great new book bridgital nation by n chandrasekaran and roopa purushothaman suggests that india is an antarlaapika sanskrit for a puzzle in which the answer is hidden in the puzzle itself their observation that great entrepreneurship advice is only a traffic jam

market movers today as the festive season approaches and christmas calm settles in the markets the data flow in europe and the us will slow this week in the uk pm boris johnson continues to aim to get his brexit bill through parliament ahead of the 31 january deadline in the us core capital goods orders and new home sales for november are released the former showed a surprising rise in october and the november data will shed light on how robust this trend is and whether the worst of the capital spending cutbacks are behind for the us economy we remain sceptic about a marked rebound in capex investment despite the recent accord around a phase one deal see also us macro outlook two pace economy selected market news following the us china phase one deal the imf is set to revise its china gdp forecast higher for 2020 to around 6 from 5 8 this was the message from the new imf director kristalina georgieva in an interview with caixin consensus seems to be forming around 6 growth in 2020 the signal coming out of the recent china economic work conference was also that the new growth target for 2020 will be around 6 it will not be revealed officially though until the national people s congress starting on 5 march eur usd took a step lower on friday from having hovered above 1 11 to now being slightly below although we recently took our 12m forecast to 1 15 we still believe the lack of rate support for eur caps upside in the pair i e the ecb is essentially a constant in fx markets for now improving global growth expectations rising commodity prices inflation expectations and broadly rising equity prices continue to have little to no correlation to moves in the eur but have been quite supportive for sek and nok on the other hand we thus look for eur usd to trade close to 1 11 on 1 3m uk consumer and business confidence rose marginally in december but both remain subdued both surveys were conducted before the election so based on these numbers we cannot say anything about consumers business sentiment after the clear victory by boris johnson looking ahead continued weakness or slightly improving sentiment data will be highly important for whether and or when bank of england will cut interest rates though we expect such to happen in q1 emerging market currencies continue to appear solid with notably the russian ruble and latin america in the lead whereas pln czk and huf have not strengthened much the lag in eastern europe is likely a result of german data continuing to be less than impressive and eur usd remaining flat turkey s lira is the underperformer in emerging markets which in our view is likely due to the rising oil price and increased fx fragility from interest rates having been lowered significantly in the past year fixed income markets we are approaching the holiday season and activity is going to be low until next year there are no major key economic data releases from the eurozone or scandinavia today but we have an italian auction today where the italian debt office will sell up to eur 2bn in a 2y 0 coupon bond most of the european government debt agencies have released their funding plans for 2020 on friday we got details from finland and italy finland plans to sell some eur 14bn in long term bonds rfgbs and emtns as they plan to finance 60 of the gross funding need of eur 23 2bn by rfgbs an emtns they plan a new 10y benchmark bond in q1 2029 as well as a 5y or a 15y benchmark later in 2020 the second action normally takes place by the end of august hence there was no big surprises in the funding statement relative to the investor relationship presentation released at an earlier stage italy will also become a green bond issuer in 2020 according to their funding plan for 2020 italy will sell eur 240 245bn in medium to long term bonds this is more or less unchanged from 2019 and in line with our own estimate they plan to sell in the 50y segment if the market conditions allow for it this will be the first time in four years that they look at issuing in the 50y segment the rating agencies have issued all issued their rating calendar dates for 2020 fx markets eur usd took a step lower on friday from having hovered above 1 11 to 10 82 although we recently took our 12m forecast to 1 15 we still believe the lack of rate support for eur caps upside in the pair i e the ecb is essentially a constant for fx markets for now and thus look for eur usd to trade close to 1 11 on 1 3m the cny has traded in close correlation with developments in the us china trade war when trump pushed the tariff button once again over the summer usd cny jumped higher from below 6 90 to close to 7 20 but since the phase one talks starting in the autumn the cny has regained some of the lost territory following the announcement of the phaseone deal usd cny dropped but has since been treading water around the 7 level awaiting further developments we look for further downside in usd cny towards 6 8 in 2020 due to our view of easing trade tensions and moderate recovery in china it will probably not be such a straight line though as we expect bumps in the road in trade talks see more in the china

terms too not exactly shoddy a mirror image of 2018 when almost everything fell perhaps but there have been a couple of important drivers one was china showing it was serious about stimulus for its 14

the impeachment process was a nauseating display of moral hypocrisy the sound bites by republicans and democrats swiftly became predictable the democrats despite applauding the announcement of the voting results before being quickly silenced by house speaker nancy pelosi sought to cloak themselves in gravitas and solemnity pelosi s calculated decision to open the impeachment proceedings with the 1954 under god version of the pledge of allegiance was an appropriate signal given the party s new mccarthyism the democrats posited themselves as saviors the last line of defense between a constitutional democracy and tyranny the republicans as cloyingly sanctimonious as the democrats offered up ludicrous analogies to attack what they condemned as a show trial including rep barry loudermilk s statement that pontius pilate afforded more rights to jesus than the democrats have afforded to this president the republicans shamelessly prostrated themselves throughout the 10 hour process at the feet of their cult leader donald trump offering abject and eternal fealty they angrily accused the democrats of seeking to overturn the 2016 election in a legislative coup it was a mind numbing spectacle devoid of morality and ethics the kind of political theater that characterizes despotic regimes no one in the house chamber was protecting the constitution no one was seeking to hold accountable those who had violated it no one was fighting to restore the rule of law the two parties which have shredded constitutional protections and rights and sold the political process to the highest bidders have engaged in egregious constitutional violations for years and ignored them when they were made public moral stances have a cost but almost no one in congress seems willing to pay trying to tar trump as a russian agent failed now the democrats hope to discredit him with charges of abuse of power and contempt of congress the politicization of the impeachment process has only exacerbated the antagonisms and polarization in the country it has ironically increased support for trump who in this toxic environment may well be reelected his approval rating has jumped to 45 percent up from 39 percent when the impeachment inquiry was launched according to the latest gallup survey conducted from dec 2 to dec 15 this is the third consecutive increase in trump s approval rating among republicans trump has a job approval rating of 89 almost nine in 10 in the gop fifty one percent of americans oppose impeachment and removal up five percentage points since the house inquiry began gallup reports yes trump s contempt of congress and attempt to get volodymyr zelensky the ukrainian president to open an investigation of joe biden and his son hunter in exchange for almost 400 million in u s military aid and allowing zelensky to visit the white house are impeachable offenses but trivial and minor ones compared with the constitutional violations that the two parties have institutionalized and i fear made permanent these sustained bipartisan constitutional violations not trump resulted in the failure of our democracy trump is the pus coming out of the wound if the democrats and the republicans were committed to defending the constitution why didn t they impeach george w bush when he launched two illegal wars that were never declared by congress as demanded by the constitution why didn t they impeach bush when he authorized placing the entire u s public under government surveillance in direct violation of the fourth amendment why didn t they impeach bush when he authorized torture along with kidnapping terrorist suspects around the world and holding them for years in our black sites and offshore penal colonies why didn t they impeach barack obama when he expanded these illegal wars to 11 if we count yemen why didn t they impeach obama when edward snowden revealed that our intelligence agencies are monitoring and spying on almost every citizen and downloading our data and metrics into government computers where they will be stored for perpetuity why didn t they impeach obama when he misused the 2002 authorization for use of military force to erase due process and give the executive branch of government the right to act as judge jury and executioner in assassinating u s citizens starting with the radical cleric anwar al awlaki and two weeks later his 16 year old son why didn t they impeach obama when he signed into law section 1021 of the national defense authorization act in effect overturning the 1878 posse comitatus act which prohibits the use of the military as a domestic police force there are other bipartisan constitutional violations including violating treaty clauses that are supposed to be ratified by the senate violating the constitution by making appointments without seeking senate confirmation and the routine abusive use of executive orders but the two major political parties salivating at the thought of wielding the king like power that now comes with the presidency have no desire to curb these far more dangerous violations the selective use of the two violations to impeach trump is a weaponization of the impeachment process should the democrats take control of the white house and the republicans control of the congress impeachment with or without merit will become another form of political pressure exerted within our dysfunctional and divided political system the rule of law will be a pretense as in the current process of impeachment and senate trial the impeachment circus which will culminate in a preordained choreographed and televised show in the senate coincided with the washington post s release of what is being called the afghanistan papers the post through a three year legal battle obtained more than 2 000 pages of internal government documents about the war the papers detail bipartisan lies fraud deceit corruption waste and gross mismanagement during the 18 year conflict the longest in u s history it is a blistering indictment of the ruling class which as the papers note since 2001 has seen the defense department state department and u s agency for international development spend or win appropriation of between 934 billion and 978 billion according to an inflation adjusted estimate calculated by neta crawford a political science professor and co director of the costs of war project at brown university these figures the post adds do not include money spent by other agencies such as the cia and the department of veterans affairs which is responsible for medical care for wounded veterans this window into the inner workings of our bankrupt ruling elite responsible for widespread destruction and the loss of tens perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives in afghanistan was largely ignored by the media during the impeachment proceedings neither political party and none of their courtiers on the cable news shows is interested in exposing the bipartisan failure lying and grotesque incompetence on the part of the united states in the years it has occupied afghanistan afghan and u s officials concede that the taliban is stronger now than at any other time since the 2001 invasion in a functioning democracy the publication of the afghanistan papers would see generals and politicians who knowingly deceived the public hauled before congressional committees the fulbright hearings during the vietnam war although they did not lead to prosecutions at least aggressively held u s officials to account and made public their duplicity and failure but in the wake of the new disclosures no one in either political party or the military will be held accountable for the debacle in afghanistan a conflict that saw a vast waste of resources including nearly a trillion dollars that could have been used to address our pronounced social inequality rebuild our decaying infrastructure and help end our reliance on fossil fuels the afghanistan papers lay bare a truth the hyperventilating republican and democratic mandarins in congress prefer to mask on all the major structural issues war the economy the use of militarized police and the world s largest prison system for social control the infusion of corporate money to deform the electoral and legislative processes slashing taxes for the wealthy and corporations exploitative trade deals austerity the climate emergency and the rapidly accelerating government debt there is little or no difference between the republicans and the democrats the political clashes are not substantive despite what we heard in the impeachment hearings they are rhetorical and largely inconsequential the republicans and the democrats recently passed a 738 billion defense bill for fiscal year 2020 a 21 billion increase over what was enacted for fiscal year 2019 the vote was a lopsided 377 to 48 the u s spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined also a day after the impeachment of president trump the republicans and democrats in the house passed a thinly veiled rewrite of the clinton administration s north american free trade agreement nafta the 25 year old free trade agreement that hollowed out our manufacturing centers and sent u s jobs and production to mexico again the vote was lopsided 385 to 41 when the wealthy and our corporate masters want something done it gets done our elected officials serve them not us we are to be controlled the republican and democratic politicians like the generals government bureaucrats and intelligence chiefs once they leave their government posts will be generously rewarded by being given jobs as lobbyists and consultants or being appointed to corporate boards these politicians are the mutant products of our system of legalized bribery shameless kleptocrats the only interests they serve are their own this truth binds half the country to trump who although a con artist and himself flagrantly corrupt at least belittles and mocks the ruling elites who have betrayed us trump and his supporters are not wrong in condemning the deep state the generals bankers corporatists lobbyists intelligence chiefs government bureaucrats and technocrats who oversee domestic and international policy no matter who is in power the afghanistan papers while detailing the quagmire in afghanistan where more than 775 000 americans were deployed over the 18 years more than 2 300 soldiers and marines killed and more than 20 000 wounded also illustrate how seamlessly the two ruling parties and the deep state work together what did we get for this 1 trillion effort was it worth 1 trillion jeffrey eggers a retired navy seal and white house staffer for bush and obama is quoted as saying by the washington post after the killing of osama bin laden i said that osama was probably laughing in his watery grave considering how much we have spent on afghanistan the post writes the documents also contradict a long chorus of public statements from u s presidents military commanders and diplomats who assured americans year after year that they were making progress in afghanistan and the war was worth fighting several of those interviewed described explicit and sustained efforts by the u s government to deliberately mislead the public they said it was common at military headquarters in kabul and at the white house to distort statistics to make it appear the united states was winning the war when that was not the case as commanders in chief bush obama and trump all promised the public the same thing the post notes they would avoid falling into the trap of nation building in afghanistan on that score the presidents failed miserably the united states has allocated more than 133 billion to build up afghanistan more than it spent adjusted for inflation to revive the whole of western europe with the marshall plan after world war ii there is no difference the afghanistan papers make clear in the mendacity and incompetence of the policymaking apparatus no matter who controls congress or the white house no party or elected official dares defy the military industrial complex or other titans of the deep state the democrats through impeachment have no intention of restoring constitutional rights that would curb the power of the deep state and protect democracy the deep state funds them it sustains them in office the democrats are seeking to replace the inept and vulgar face of empire that is trump with the benign and decorous face of empire that is joe biden what the democrats and the deep state that has allied itself with the democratic party object to is the mask not what is behind it if you doubt me read the six part series on afghanistan in the post

mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in jp cortez with the sound money defense league a nonpartisan national public policy organization working to restore sound money at the state and federal level jp is a proponent of and has studied in the austrian school of economics and his role at smdl as policy director has him regularly testifying at legislative hearings and speaking at various events around the country his articles and analysis have appeared in many national news publications including the washington examiner huffington post mises institute foundation for economic education and many more and he s a frequent guest on various podcasts and national radio shows to talk about the importance of sound money legislation and it s a real pleasure to have him back on here with us on the money metals podcast jp thanks for the time today welcome and how are you jp cortez mike thanks for having me on i m doing great how are things over there mike gleason well we re doing well excited to talk about this topic and as many of our regular listeners know we had you on several months back to talk about this issue and we figured it was time to have you on again and talk about it and get an update from you on the state of the state if you will when it comes to sound money here in the u s as things are continuing to develop on that front some of which is good and some of which is not what we would term as positive and then we ll also get into your group s latest release of the sound money index for 2019 but first let s begin with having you lay out for us what your group does what is the mission and why is there a sound money defense league to begin with let s start there jp cortez well like you mentioned earlier we re a nonpartisan national public policy group and we work to restore sound money and that mostly happens on the state level but we work on the federal level as well so primarily what we re doing here is re monetizing gold and silver by removing the taxes that surround its use its sale its purchase because that s most of the reason why people don t use gold or silver today it has nothing to do with its legal tender status or anything like that it s just that you would practically need a cpa by your side every time if you had to calculate your cost basis every time you wanted to buy a gallon of milk at the store and you d have to go through this onerous process so by removing the taxes on precious metals we hope to have the metals naturally find their way back into the system mike gleason talk about the successes that you ve had there jp because i know it s been a busy couple of years at the state legislative level on the sound money front now there s obviously a lot more work to be done there we ll get into that but talk about some of the achievements of the sound money defense league thus far jp jp cortez the sound money defense league was started in 2015 and since then it s grown as a real leader on this issue we ve been a part of and we ve led efforts to introduce and pass legislation to remove sales tax on gold and silver in alabama georgia west virginia wyoming and louisiana wisconsin in arizona and wyoming we ve also worked to eliminate capital gains taxes from the sale of precious metals and we ve also defended a couple existing exemptions this past session in washington and nebraska in washington s case this was an exemption that was passed back in the mid eighties that revenue hungry politicians were trying to appeal or were trying to repeal but thankfully we were able to get that stopped and we hope this year to pick up a couple more victories in states like tennessee and mississippi on the sales tax issue mike gleason okay so let s get into the 2019 sound money index which you just released first why don t you give us an overview of how the index was created and what it tells us about the various states about their friendliness or lack thereof towards sound money jp cortez yeah the sound money index is the first index of its kind where we ve ranked all 50 states using a variety of criteria to kind of determine which states offer the most pro and anti sound money climate this was a project that we started last year so this is our second annual report in the first iteration of the index we used nine criteria but and this year we ve expanded that to 12 different indicators we did that because we think that this gives us a more robust picture of where each state is at where each state stands on sound money and so the index evaluates each state s sales and income tax policies involving precious metals whether a state has holds any precious metals in its pension funds or reserve funds whether a state has passed or imposed any of these very onerous very restrictive precious metals dealers or investor harassment laws is what we call them and some more mike gleason yeah so i wanted to dive into some of that criteria and so forth but what did the top rank states do right that led to their high scores on the index and then what were those states who scored well jp cortez this year wyoming texas and utah kind of rounded out our top three and these are three states that are all excellent on the issue of sales tax on precious metals they ve each got a full sales tax exemption on all gold and silver coins and bullion that is wyoming texas and utah they ve also taken steps to exempt the gold and silver from the income tax utah was the first to do so i believe texas has no income tax and wyoming while it does not have a state income tax passed legislation two years ago now that does not allow for a capital gains tax on precious metals if an income tax were ever to be introduced mike gleason so what states are the worst on sound money jp jp cortez so arkansas new jersey maine ohio tennessee vermont unfortunately there are a couple of kind of a real baddies here and these are the worst states in the country these are states that levy sales tax on precious metals they hammer you with income tax on the sale of sound money they hold no metals in any of their reserve funds any of their pension funds they restrict dealers and investors with some of these crazy regulations regarding collecting personal data reporting regular submission to police and these states the ones i just mentioned are rife with these kinds of onerous laws and just generally they have high rates of taxation compared to the rest of the country ohio here kind of stands out last year in the first annual sound money index ohio ranked 17th this past year unfortunately ohio voted to repeal its sound money sales tax exemption and it fell talk about a fall from grace all the way from 17th to tied for 49th place mike gleason yeah ouch we re of course well familiar with that here at money metals exchange we are now collecting sales tax in a half dozen states ohio is one of those this all happens in the wake of the wayfair supreme court decision that forces out of state companies to charge tax and submit it to the states where there is no sales tax exemption for precious metals wayfair obviously was dealing with this not necessarily precious metals related but we re now sort of falling under law so there s about 15 to 20 states that don t have a sales tax exemption for precious metals and we and other national dealers are having to charge sales tax now and collect those in those jurisdictions even though we don t have a physical business presence in those states that s what wayfair a addressed kind of hitting those online retailers so this is a very important issue and passing laws in the remaining states that haven t passed a bill exempting sales tax on precious metals yet would be huge for the citizens in those states but yet sales tax is not the only thing we have to deal with when it comes to taxes jp you alluded to this a moment ago with some of those states that don t have this but we also have the income tax in most states and certainly at the federal level that are owed when there is a gain and i say the word gain in quotes because it s really just an illusory gain as we know because it s not that the price of gold and silver has risen necessarily it s more a matter of the fact that the dollar has lost value but yet the governments both at the state and federal level wants to tax you on the inflation that they ve created that s caused that nominal gain talk about that jp jp cortez that s right like you just said that this gain many times isn t an actual gain it s not a real gain it s just a nominal gain that results from the inflation caused by the federal reserve an ounce of gold is still an ounce of gold the value of the ounce of gold hasn t changed it just takes more individual federal reserve notes to purchase the same ounce of gold the federal reserve note is losing value it s not the gold is gaining value and yet like you mentioned this gain is taxed at the federal level and then again at the state level to make things worse in states with no sales tax exemption then you re hit with a nefarious kind of double taxation here where you re taxed on the purchase of your metals and then taxed again on the sale mike gleason not to mention that the gain is at the 28 a collectibles rate to begin with and in many cases this isn t collectible this is bullion and yet it s still taxed at an onerous 28 rate jp cortez yeah that s right long term capital gains rate discriminatorily high 28 so that s taxed just as if you were talking about beanie babies or baseball cards or art the irs unilaterally decided that precious metals are collectibles and so now here we are mike gleason yeah it s the height of ridiculousness i know at the federal level our good friend alex mooney a congressman from west virginia has i believe introduced a bill in congress to repeal that tax at the federal level at anything you can tell us there i do i have that right jp cortez yeah that is correct congressman mooney from west virginia has introduced a couple of laws to remove these capital gains that we see here and hopefully these get passed there are a couple of these laws that are coming down the pipes and hopefully we can kind of gain some traction and get some or one or maybe some of these passed mike gleason yeah obviously many things happen at the state level and that sort of builds the momentum nationally and i know that s where you re focusing most of your efforts and it s very important to do that that s where things often get started when it comes to change at a federal level as well well what other kinds of owner s restrictions do states place on dealers and investors is there anything else that we haven t covered aside from the tax issue that your group is focusing on fighting and bringing to light jp cortez yeah this is a new criteria that we ve included this year on the sound money index we call it a dealer harassment laws investor harassment laws and some of these are really quite ridiculous some states require collecting your fingerprints your physical measurements your height your weight your hair color your eye color your social security number other forms of identification all of these things that the state requires precious metals dealers or sellers to collect and then you couple that with the requirements to submit all of the sensitive information to law enforcement in some cases daily and some cases weekly so it s really quite restrictive and quite pervasive some states have made it to where you can t sell any gold or silver purchased from the public for a specified amount of time in an industry like precious metals where prices are regularly changing asking dealers to hold on to inventory for days or weeks could make a huge difference and could cause huge harm additionally if you consider that now dealers have to hold more inventory maybe than they would feel comfortable with otherwise by law now it s a liability now the dealer has to provide security has to provide insurance to adequately safeguard these now these precious metals that they re being forced to hold and then i think the worst of all probably in my opinion is that a few states prohibit cash transactions when buying gold or silver the argument being of course that sales are better tracked safety is a priority and so we need digital records of every transaction but this is nearly unprecedented in american commerce to restrict metals purchases to digitally tracked credit purchases or checks only is quite invasive mike gleason yeah i couldn t agree more obviously we ve got the 10 000 cash payments money laundering sort of restriction form 8 300 that people have to fill out if you re buying over 10 000 in cash in anything where there s gold and silver a vehicle or what have you you re supposed to submit that form if you re taking payment that way in that amount but yeah extending it beyond that and lower thresholds is pretty ridiculous there is a nearby cities here and we re in idaho which is a pretty friendly state when it comes to precious metals but there s a nearby city that has a lot of those laws in place and as it stands there s zero precious metals dealers there s zero local coin shops because they don t want to have to fingerprint everybody submit it to the local police just completely ridiculous they ve driven several businesses out of the city completely it s a real shame jp it also looks like there s zero states that have at least 10 of their reserve funds held in in gold and silver i know you re trying to work to change that talk about that jp cortez well frankly the financial powers that be simply haven t allowed for it an allocation of gold and silver provides many helpful things to investors and to states if they choose to invest in gold and silver that is a hedge against inflation debt default risks stock market declines volatility and yet there isn t a single state that s holding at least 10 of its reserves in the metals and of course that it is more egregious when it s coupled with the fact that their portfolios are full of nothing but risky assets a considerable amount of emerging market debt risky bonds etfs different trading instruments people chasing returns rather than protecting and taking prudent care of money that retirees and savers and pensioners rely on mike gleason yeah they certainly should not be risking that money and of course gold and silver and the ultimate safe havens gold specifically and you would think that there would be at least some appetite for some of those states to put some of those reserves in in some kind of a gold fund or physical gold better yet none has really done yet i guess texas has is it the state teacher s pension funds that that has some physical gold is that the only one that s done that jp cortez yeah mike that s correct the texas teacher pension fund they re holding about a billion dollars worth of physical gold wyoming considered a few measures this past year to protect some of their reserve funds their rainy day funds their pension funds with physical metals held within the state or near the state and believe it or not these measures were not received warmly by different constituencies by the pension fund managers the reserve fund managers banking there were several constituencies that were not too keen on this idea mike gleason imagine that the financial elites or wall street types not wanting to see money leave the system and go into gold and silver i can t say i can t imagine why they wouldn t like that well before we let you go here is there anything else you would like to share with our listeners today maybe that we haven t covered yet or certain things that you see in movements of sound money that you think people should be keeping in mind jp cortez yeah i think just one more note on the sound money index we ve taken the time this year to kind of extend out what we re doing and so we ve scored different states on a number of interesting criteria some of the stuff we didn t get to hear in this conversation like the enforcement of gold cost contracts for example or holding metals in state reserve funds like we mentioned whether a state has established an in state depository of course texas and then this year we ve included a section on whether or not a state has issued a gold bond so it s really interesting stuff we encourage everyone to check out the sound money index mike gleason yeah they can do that either at soundmoneydefense org or on the moneymetals com site as well that information will be available there keep up the great work jp in our industry the sales tax issue has become quite a big one so the work you re doing there is vitally important and we appreciate all you re doing to defend sound money we appreciate the time today and look forward to having you on again in the future to update us on a lot of these legislative fronts because i know you ll have your finger on that pulse as much as anyone and we wish you continued success in those efforts take care and thanks for coming on jp cortez great thanks a lot mike mike gleason well that will do it for this week thanks again to jp cortez policy director at the sound money defense league for more information or to follow these ongoing sound money efforts or even to make a donation to help support the mission of sound

the central economic work conference report issued on dec 12 said that china will focus on economic stability maintaining its proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy yi gang governor of the people s bank of china in an article published in qiushi journal in november explained why the central bank will not use quantitative easing or qe which is very large rapid infusions of money into the system by having the central bank buy many types of financial assets the pboc will instead maintain a prudent normal monetary policy not too tight or too loose qe should be an extreme emergency policy it s a way for a central bank to pour funds into an economy to raise the prices of specific target assets however it causes many long term problems and economic distortions the chinese economy is slowing as part of a long term transition to a higher value added production model but the slowing is far from an emergency unemployment rose to 5 1 percent in november this is low by international standards and is unexpectedly low during a structural transition and the inflation rate rose to 4 5 percent year on year in november up from 2 percent last year however according to national bureau of statistics data 2 6 percentage points of the inflation rate was due to a rapid rise in pork prices due to african swine fever it does not reflect a systemic problem three episodes in american history illustrate the problems caused by loose monetary policy and loose banking regulation 1 the stagflation combined inflation and slow growth of the 1970s 2 the savings and loan bank default crisis of the 1980s 3 the debt driven boom of the 1990s and 2000s that resulted in the global financial crisis of 2008 which in turn compelled the us government to use qe to escape from a possible great depression from november 2008 through 2012 the federal reserve the central bank of the united states bought more than 4 5 trillion of home mortgage backed securities commercial bonds and other assets about 30 percent of annual gdp in effect the fed was printing money to boost asset prices and to keep the interest rates on us treasury bonds low one key problem with qe is that it transfers wealth to richer people away from average and poor people in practice this means that qe drives up housing prices and the prices of stocks and drives down the interest rate depositors and other savers can get on their savings this is great for asset owners but terrible for average savers or young people trying to buy a house qe rewards banks and money managers for taking high risks they get the upside if the bets pay off but the government bears the downside risk because bank deposits are insured loose monetary policy increases the prices of a limited number of assets instead of financing real investment opportunities companies and people are rewarded for their ability to manipulate financial assets rather than for real productivity increases the us economy slowed sharply in the early 1970s in the aftermath of the war in vietnam throughout the 1960s and 1970s many economists and policymakers believed in a theory called the phillips curve which stated that the unemployment rate could be permanently lowered by loose monetary policy so the fed continuously pumped more money into a slowing economy this worked for short periods but soon the economy returned to high unemployment and slow growth with even higher rates of inflation by 1980 the inflation rate reached an all time high of 13 3 percent with an unemployment rate of 8 percent in this desperate situation new federal reserve chairman paul volcker who died recently sharply raised interest rates causing what was by far the steepest recession in post wwii us history many businesses failed and unemployment rose steeply many people lost their homes because of the incredibly high interest rates which reached 18 percent on home mortgages only very stimulative fiscal policy and large tax cuts saved the country from greater disaster the second episode shows the dangers of loose banking regulation that encourages banks to invest in risky assets the us had long had a special kind of small local bank called a savings and loan bank that received local deposits such banks were restricted to making very safe investments primarily in local home mortgages george bailey s bank in the movie it s a wonderful life was an s l bank by the mid 1980s banking deregulation had allowed a few big city banks to outbid the small s l banks for deposits so the old safe s l business model was no longer viable regulators decided the way out of this dilemma was to allow the s l banks to invest in riskier and riskier assets primarily large suburban shopping centers and other commercial property in out of the way areas as should have been expected this bet on risky investments did not work and many s l banks went bankrupt since the deposits were insured by the government the taxpayers were on the hook to pay for the s l banks losses which amounted to more than 2 percent of gdp you might think that banks can make reasonable judgments about the riskiness of their investments the problem is that they are not risking their own money they are risking their depositors and ultimately the government s money in the s l banks case a successful bet on a risky investment led to a very high return for s l bank owners and managers an unsuccessful bet stuck taxpayers with the bill in the late 1990s into the 2000s the us appeared to have a magnificent economy first stock prices boomed after the nasdaq collapse in march 2000 housing prices soared the problem is that these booms turned out to be bubbles driven by loose monetary policy and low interest rates the money flowing into the economy had to go somewhere it drove up the price of assets mostly housing and stocks largely to the benefit of upper income people most disastrously low interest rates meant that banks could not make money from safe loans so they turned to riskier investments especially sub prime housing loans regulation of banks was very loose and little attempt was made to control the immense risks any bank employee who did not want to approve the risky investments which were highly profitable in the short run was simply replaced naturally this led to a huge mess culminating in the crisis in the fall of 2008 and the taxpayers were again stuck with the bill qe probably was necessary to prevent an economy wide disaster after the banking collapse in 2008 the week beginning with the lehmann collapse on monday sept 15 was certainly scary there were very legitimate fears that this could be the start of a new great depression any policymaker at the time certainly would have done everything possible including qe to help the economy survive in the short term but it is much better to adopt prudent monetary policy and strong banking regulations as china is now doing to prevent such a crisis from ever arising
first a review of last week s events eur usd starting on monday from the level of 1 1110 the pair went up as expected by most experts the market did not react to the initiated impeachment of the us president trump and the s p500 index once again updated the historical maximum however the end of the year is the end of the year and the associated fall in volatility therefore the pair failed to reach the target the height of 1 1200 and recorded the maximum of the week at 1 1175 then everything happened again according to the scenario described by us in the previous forecast the pair turned around and went south braking at 1 1110 this was followed by several unsuccessful attempts to break through this support then on thursday 19 december there was a rebound up on the background of the weak economic statistics from the us and then again a return to the 1 1110 zone it should be noted that in addition to the horizontal support this level coincided with the lower limit of the uptrend which began on november 29 which is why the bulls stood up for it so fiercely but their strength was exhausted at the very end of the week and the support was broken according to experts this was facilitated by the decline in quotations for a number of cross pairs the release of positive statistics on the us consumer market as well as the narrowing of the yield spread on us and german government bonds in addition at the time of the breakdown many stop orders placed on long positions worked which allowed the pair to fall to the level of 1 1065 this was followed by a slight rebound and it ended the week at 1 1075 gbp usd last week was not the most successful for the british currency the negative dynamics in the debt market where the yield of uk securities fell in comparison with the bonds of the us and germany weighed on the pound statistics on the consumer market also disappointed investors retail sales fell in november at the highest pace for the whole year by 0 6 whatever prime minister boris johnson and his supporters say british consumers fear brexit and therefore limit themselves in spending the bank of england contributed to the overall gloomy picture as well by lowering its economic growth forecast as a result the pound moved according to the scenario developed for it by experts for the whole week recall that the majority of analysts 65 supported by 90 of indicators on d1 expected that the gbp usd pair will once again rush to storm the height of 1 3500 and that this storm will end in collapse indeed on monday december 16 the pound went up but was able to overcome only 85 points then turned around and continued the fall which had begun on friday december 13 75 of analysts supported by graphical analysis voted for this development according to their forecast the pair should have reached the 1 3100 1 3200 zone very quickly which happened on tuesday but the fall did not end there and it was only on friday 20 december thanks to positive gdp data for the third quarter growth of 0 4 instead of the forecast 0 3 that the pound was able to find support at the level of 1 2990 this was followed by a rebound up to 1 3080 supported by the adoption of the brexit act by the uk parliament and again a drop of 100 points the final chord sounded at the level of 1 3000 usd jpy the news background on the yen is quite diverse there is a strong rise in the us treasury yields with which the japanese currency is strongly correlated and the continuation of the oil uptrend and hopes for the imminent completion of a comprehensive deal between washington and beijing it is necessary to pay attention to the inflation figures in japan at the end of november it was at the level of 0 5 that is it grew by 0 3 which is though not powerful but still a favorable signal for the bank of japan and the economy as a whole the yen reacts as the weathervane to the multidirectional statistics on the state of the american economy as well as a result the most accurate forecast was the one supported by a quarter of analysts according to which the pair will remain in the side channel 108 40 109 70 until the end of the year in reality the channel was even narrower 109 15 109 70 and the pair ended the trading session in its central zone at the level of 109 45 cryptocurrencies on saturday december 14 the benchmark cryptocurrency went south more precisely it did not just go but flew headlong updating the six month low by wednesday and losing weight by more than 11 according to the main version voiced by bloomberg analysts the fall was caused by the sale by crypto pyramid plustoken of bitcoins worth about 2 billion followed by other coins the total capitalization of the crypto market decreased by 9 in just 5 days and some analysts rushed to put a death cross on bitcoin giving such a name to the intersection by the 50 day moving average from top to bottom of the 200 day ma however rumors about the death of bitcoin as it has repeatedly happened were greatly exaggerated on wednesday evening it became known that the bakkt platform demonstrates record volumes of trading in btc futures and having found support at the level of 6 470 bitcoin quickly began to make up for losses just in a few hours getting 1000 15 after that the btc usd pair returned to where it all started to the values of december 14 as for such top altcoins as ripple xrp usd ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd in general they followed in the wake of the reference cryptocurrency it is just that the results of the seven day trip were unprofitable for them if bitcoin fully recovered its losses ripple lost 12 5 of its value ethereum lost 11 5 and litecoin lost 10 this result suggests that investors are getting rid of altcoins redirecting financial flows towards the first cryptocurrency as for the forecast for the coming 10 days perhaps we will not make a discovery saying that christmas and new year holidays are ahead in this regard december 24 forex trading closes at 17 00 cet december 25 trading is closed december 26 trading opens at 00 00 cet december 31 trading closes at 17 00 cet 01 january trading is closed 02 january trading opens at 00 00 cet eur usd gbp usd usd jpy with a high probability we expect quite sluggish trading in a narrow range throughout this time although due to the subtlety of the market emissions in one direction or another are not excluded gaps can be expected at the opening of markets after the new year holidays if we talk about the forecasts of experts for the upcoming ten day period it is impossible to give preference to either bulls or bears because the opinions of experts are divided either in half 50 for the growth and 50 for the fall or equally in three parts a third for the growth a third for the decline and a third for a sideways trend the forecasts of analytical departments of global banks for the entire year 2020 are much more interesting we will publish them exactly one week later naturally they are based on fundamental factors and as for the fans of technical analysis we have gathered together in one table the indicator readings on the daily d1 and weekly w1 timeframes which we hope will help you form an opinion about the main trends and market sentiment cryptocurrencies unlike forex the crypto market never sleeps and even if crypto traders celebrate holidays they do not take their eyes off the trading terminal in general the news background is positive banking giant bank of america merrill lynch has named the best and the worst assets by investment performance over the past ten years according to the bank s calculations 1 invested in the first cryptocurrency in 2010 has now turned into 90 026 sweden s central bank riksbank is exploring the possibility of creating a digital swedish krona the success of bakkt was mentioned above and this is a very positive signal for the crypto market as it suggests that institutional investors at least some of them consider the current situation a good one to buy analysts have given their forecasts of the bitcoin price for the beginning of 2020 executives of south korean cryptocurrency exchanges bithumb korbit and hanbitco argue that 2020 will be the best year for the crypto market due to demand for cryptocurrencies from institutional investors and people of generation y millennials amsterdam stock exchange analyst michael van de poppe is confident that the coin will rise to 8000 in early 2020 and a month after that it will rise to 9500 alistair milne investment director of the altana ds fund is also confident in the growth of the bitcoin value in his opinion the coin will become more expensive in the run up to the halving in parallel the sale of altcoins in favor of the main cryptocurrency will continue another point of view is held by the founder of signal profits jacob kenfield who predicts a decline in the rate of bitcoin to 5500 but the worst news for today is that more than 20 thousand btc tokens remain on the accounts of the plustoken cryptopyramid and if it continues to sell according to bloomberg forecasts there is a risk of a fall in the price of bitcoin down to 4000 however this is not the limit calculations for asic miners have shown that bitmain s s17 is a device in which mining will become unprofitable only if the price of bitcoin falls below 3600 this means that it is at this level that the main support is situated for now the crypto fear greed index is still in its lower third at 29 which corresponds to the moderate fear of investors
the fed celebrates while americans drown in financial despair the federal reserve system is supposed to be independent but it s not and as much as donald trump doesn t like it the fed shouldn t follow the president s orders the fed operates under a legal mandate from congress its monetary policy role is to promote maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates so how is it doing long term rates are certainly moderate employment is historically high though wages and job quality aren t always great as for that stable prices part it depends on what you are buying as you see below for many goods the price is nowhere near stable unfortunately if you are in the bottom 60 70 of the income brackets these are some of the things you buy the most source sebastian sienkiewicz the fed believes that 2 annual inflation equals stable prices yet that small amount adds up over time to almost 50 in 20 years which is about where cpi lands in this 20 year chart so the fed is succeeding by that yardstick but cpi doesn t reflect real life spending for most people prices have risen dramatically more than average for some of life s basic necessities while fed officials may think they have tamed inflation their zirp and qe actually drove real world prices considerably higher than cpi or pce show it showed up mainly in asset valuations like stocks and real estate these in turn drove up other prices like housing aggregate inflation isn t higher because technology and globalization reduced manufactured goods costs and the shale revolution kept energy costs low try to look at this like an average worker your rent keeps rising your kids can t go to college without racking up debt your health insurance is astronomical and your wages while up a bit aren t keeping up with your living costs meanwhile the people who are supposed to be looking out for you keep talking about how the economy is improving thanks to their brilliant policies my friend philippa dunne at the liscio report showed two charts demonstrating older generations read boomers are doing much better than gen xers and especially millennials source the liscio reportsource the liscio report i understand the economic theories that gdp growth will eventually spread widely enough to ease the angst but i am not sure we can wait that long people are hurting now and they are increasingly willing to embrace radical solutions just wait for better times is not cutting it as technology eats into higher paying jobs and aggravates the stress of lower income jobs that s doubly true if the economy weakens some of the data improved a bit in recent weeks the november jobs report showed much stronger growth than we ve seen in a while that s good to see and suggests we might postpone recession past 2020 but merely avoiding recession isn t enough another year of sub 2 growth which is my base case will be another year of suffering for the millions whom this weak recovery hasn t helped and it s not clear that we can avoid a recession one third of economists surveyed by the wall street journal think we will see a recession next year and almost two thirds see a recession by 2021 no one should be surprised the lower 80 of the income pyramid is anxious and depressed you would be too in their situation and there s a good chance you will be in their situation in a few years because angst ridden people can still vote economic theories aren t relevant to them they look at their own situations and want change history suggests that president trump should win re election unless recession strikes by next november but even if we avoid a recession in 2020 what happens if there is one in 2021 or 2022 democrats could gain power by 2024 if not sooner the already growing annual budget deficit will soar to over 2 trillion how do we finance that without creating more angst i can easily imagine a populist democrat winning the white house followed by higher taxes and an echo recession then even higher deficits and the national debt spinning out of control the fed will give us massive quantitative easing and zero rates but it may be in fact pushing on a string we don t have much time to get our house in order either in the us or globally we can and should take steps to protect our individual families and lives but that s not enough at the national level i m beginning to fear only an enormously stressful great reset will deliver the deep but necessary sacrifices the partisan divide inhibits compromise so nothing happens and the problems grow think about the late 1930s hopefully with just economic turmoil not kinetic war it will be hard but without the kind of motivation i really question whether we will do what it takes sigh the great reset the collapse of the biggest bubble

albert einstein famously defined insanity as repeatedly doing the same thing yet expecting different results he wasn t commenting on the trump administration s trade policy but he just as well could have been after three years of unsuccessfully using a restrictive tariff policy to reduce the u s trade deficit with china the administration appears poised to lead the country down the same path with europe over the past three years the trump administration has pursued an american first trade policy aimed at eliminating the country s trade deficit this policy has included the widespread imposition of aluminum and steel tariffs a trade war with china and the renegotiation of nafta it has also included repeated refusals to sign g 20 communiqués committing countries including the united states to refrain from intensifying trade protection for all that effort the results have been underwhelming far from narrowing the trade deficit has widened by around 30 percent under president trump s watch to its present annual level of around 700 billion meanwhile ignoring trump s repeated calls for a weaker dollar the dollar s consistent strength continues to undermine u s export competitiveness yet more disturbing trump s shift to a protectionist trade policy has done major damage to the global economy by injecting turmoil into chinese markets and heightening investor uncertainty about the stability of global supply chains according to the imf largely as a result of u s trade policy the global economy has shifted from a position where 75 percent of the world s economies were experiencing economic upswings in 2018 to one in which 90 percent of the world s economies are experiencing economic slowdowns today most economists subscribe to the view that a country s trade deficit is arithmetically the difference between what a country saves and what it invests if a country saves less than it invests it will run a trade deficit while if it saves more than it invests it will run a trade surplus unlike the trump administration most mainstream economists who view the trade balance as the difference between savings and investment have not been surprised that the u s trade deficit has widened despite increased import tariffs after all under trump s watch the u s budget deficit has ballooned to around 1 trillion a year as a result of his large unfunded corporate tax cut of 2017 that in turn has reduced the country s savings level and has brought in its wake budget and trade deficits reminiscent of the reagan years undaunted by his tariffs failure to reduce the trade deficit the trump administration now appears to be gearing up for a trade war with europe in a recent interview u s trade representative robert lighthizer suggested that the trump administration was ready to escalate its confrontation with the eu potentially through new tariffs with the goal of reducing the large trade deficit that the u s has with europe those new tariffs would add to the 7 5 billion in tariffs that the u s recently imposed as part of its dispute over european aircraft subsidies the last thing that an already weak european economy needs is a trade war with the united states the german economy is already practically in a recession as a direct result of the chinese economic slowdown while brexit uncertainty has placed the u k economy on the cusp of recession meanwhile the heavily indebted and sclerotic italian economy has continued to stagnate which is bound soon to raise questions about its ability to service its public debt despite the america first moniker it would seem not to be in the american interest to weaken the european economy any further such a shock is bound to have collateral effects on the rest of the global economy and put further upward pressure on the dollar nor would it be in the u s interest to invite european retaliation to our imposition of tariffs on its exports over the past three years the trump administration has made numerous import tariff threats only to back away when it grasped the economic damage that tariffs were doing hopefully the same will prove true of the most recent round of saber rattling otherwise we should brace ourselves for renewed european sovereign debt crises and their unwelcome spillover effects on the u s economy desmond lachman is a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute he was formerly a deputy director in the international monetary fund s policy development and review department and the chief emerging market economic strategist at salomon smith barney
the central economic work conference report issued on dec 12 said that china will focus on economic stability maintaining its proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy yi gang governor of the people s bank of china in an article published in qiushi journal in november explained why the central bank will not use quantitative easing or qe which is very large rapid infusions of money into the system by having the central bank buy many types of financial assets the pboc will instead maintain a prudent normal monetary policy not too tight or too loose qe should be an extreme emergency policy it s a way for a central bank to pour funds into an economy to raise the prices of specific target assets however it causes many long term problems and economic distortions the chinese economy is slowing as part of a long term transition to a higher value added production model but the slowing is far from an emergency unemployment rose to 5 1 percent in november this is low by international standards and is unexpectedly low during a structural transition and the inflation rate rose to 4 5 percent year on year in november up from 2 percent last year however according to national bureau of statistics data 2 6 percentage points of the inflation rate was due to a rapid rise in pork prices due to african swine fever it does not reflect a systemic problem three episodes in american history illustrate the problems caused by loose monetary policy and loose banking regulation 1 the stagflation combined inflation and slow growth of the 1970s 2 the savings and loan bank default crisis of the 1980s 3 the debt driven boom of the 1990s and 2000s that resulted in the global financial crisis of 2008 which in turn compelled the us government to use qe to escape from a possible great depression from november 2008 through 2012 the federal reserve the central bank of the united states bought more than 4 5 trillion of home mortgage backed securities commercial bonds and other assets about 30 percent of annual gdp in effect the fed was printing money to boost asset prices and to keep the interest rates on us treasury bonds low one key problem with qe is that it transfers wealth to richer people away from average and poor people in practice this means that qe drives up housing prices and the prices of stocks and drives down the interest rate depositors and other savers can get on their savings this is great for asset owners but terrible for average savers or young people trying to buy a house qe rewards banks and money managers for taking high risks they get the upside if the bets pay off but the government bears the downside risk because bank deposits are insured loose monetary policy increases the prices of a limited number of assets instead of financing real investment opportunities companies and people are rewarded for their ability to manipulate financial assets rather than for real productivity increases the us economy slowed sharply in the early 1970s in the aftermath of the war in vietnam throughout the 1960s and 1970s many economists and policymakers believed in a theory called the phillips curve which stated that the unemployment rate could be permanently lowered by loose monetary policy so the fed continuously pumped more money into a slowing economy this worked for short periods but soon the economy returned to high unemployment and slow growth with even higher rates of inflation by 1980 the inflation rate reached an all time high of 13 3 percent with an unemployment rate of 8 percent in this desperate situation new federal reserve chairman paul volcker who died recently sharply raised interest rates causing what was by far the steepest recession in post wwii us history many businesses failed and unemployment rose steeply many people lost their homes because of the incredibly high interest rates which reached 18 percent on home mortgages only very stimulative fiscal policy and large tax cuts saved the country from greater disaster the second episode shows the dangers of loose banking regulation that encourages banks to invest in risky assets the us had long had a special kind of small local bank called a savings and loan bank that received local deposits such banks were restricted to making very safe investments primarily in local home mortgages george bailey s bank in the movie it s a wonderful life was an s l bank by the mid 1980s banking deregulation had allowed a few big city banks to outbid the small s l banks for deposits so the old safe s l business model was no longer viable regulators decided the way out of this dilemma was to allow the s l banks to invest in riskier and riskier assets primarily large suburban shopping centers and other commercial property in out of the way areas as should have been expected this bet on risky investments did not work and many s l banks went bankrupt since the deposits were insured by the government the taxpayers were on the hook to pay for the s l banks losses which amounted to more than 2 percent of gdp you might think that banks can make reasonable judgments about the riskiness of their investments the problem is that they are not risking their own money they are risking their depositors and ultimately the government s money in the s l banks case a successful bet on a risky investment led to a very high return for s l bank owners and managers an unsuccessful bet stuck taxpayers with the bill in the late 1990s into the 2000s the us appeared to have a magnificent economy first stock prices boomed after the nasdaq collapse in march 2000 housing prices soared the problem is that these booms turned out to be bubbles driven by loose monetary policy and low interest rates the money flowing into the economy had to go somewhere it drove up the price of assets mostly housing and stocks largely to the benefit of upper income people most disastrously low interest rates meant that banks could not make money from safe loans so they turned to riskier investments especially sub prime housing loans regulation of banks was very loose and little attempt was made to control the immense risks any bank employee who did not want to approve the risky investments which were highly profitable in the short run was simply replaced naturally this led to a huge mess culminating in the crisis in the fall of 2008 and the taxpayers were again stuck with the bill qe probably was necessary to prevent an economy wide disaster after the banking collapse in 2008 the week beginning with the lehmann collapse on monday sept 15 was certainly scary there were very legitimate fears that this could be the start of a new great depression any policymaker at the time certainly would have done everything possible including qe to help the economy survive in the short term but it is much better to adopt prudent monetary policy and strong banking regulations as china is now doing to prevent such a crisis from ever arising
sound money state index identifies friends enemies of precious metals investors an interview with jp cortez by mike gleason mike gleason it is my privilege now to welcome in jp cortez with the sound money defense league a nonpartisan national public policy organization working to restore sound money at the state and federal level jp is a proponent of and has studied in the austrian school of economics and his role at smdl as policy director has him regularly testifying at legislative hearings and speaking at various events around the country his articles and analysis have appeared in many national news publications including the washington examiner huffington post mises institute foundation for economic education and many more and he s a frequent guest on various podcasts and national radio shows to talk about the importance of sound money legislation and it s a real pleasure to have him back on here with us on the money metals podcast jp thanks for the time today welcome and how are you jp cortez mike thanks for having me on i m doing great how are things over there mike gleason well we re doing well excited to talk about this topic and as many of our regular listeners know we had you on several months back to talk about this issue and we figured it was time to have you on again and talk about it and get an update from you on the state of the state if you will when it comes to sound money here in the u sâ as things are continuing to develop on that front some of which is good and some of which is not what we would term as positive and then we ll also get into your group s latest release of the sound money index for 2019 but first let s begin with having you lay out for us what your group does what is the mission and why is there a sound money defense league to begin with let s start there jp cortez well like you mentioned earlier we re a nonpartisan national public policy group and we work to restore sound money and that mostly happens on the state level but we work on the federal level as well so primarily what we re doing here is re monetizing gold and silver by removing the taxes that surround its use its sale its purchase because that s most of the reason why people don t use gold or silver today it has nothing to do with its legal tender status or anything like that it s just that you would practically need a cpa by your side every time if you had to calculate your cost basis every time you wanted to buy a gallon of milk at the store and you d have to go through this onerous process so by removing the taxes on precious metals we hope to have the metals naturally find their way back into the system mike gleason talk about the successes that you ve had there jp because i know it s been a busy couple of years at the state legislative level on the sound money front now there s obviously a lot more work to be done there we ll get into that but talk about some of the achievements of the sound money defense league thus far jp jp cortez the sound money defense league was started in 2015 and since then it s grown as a real leader on this issue we ve been a part of and we ve led efforts to introduce and pass legislation to remove sales tax on gold and silver in alabama georgia west virginia wyoming and louisiana wisconsin in arizona and wyoming we ve also worked to eliminate capital gains taxes from the sale of precious metals and we ve also defended a couple existing exemptions this past session in washington and nebraska in washington s case this was an exemption that was passed back in the mid eighties that revenue hungry politicians were trying to appeal or were trying to repeal but thankfully we were able to get that stopped and we hope this year to pick up a couple more victories in states like tennessee and mississippi on the sales tax issue mike gleason okay so let s get into the 2019 sound money index which you just released first why don t you give us an overview of how the index was created and what it tells us about the various states about their friendliness or lack thereof towards sound money jp cortez yeah the sound money index is the first index of its kind where we ve ranked all 50 states using a variety of criteria to kind of determine which states offer the most pro and anti sound money climate this was a project that we started last year so this is our second annual report in the first iteration of the index we used nine criteria but and this year we ve expanded that to 12 different indicators we did that because we think that this gives us a more robust picture of where each state is at where each state stands on sound money and so the index evaluates each state s sales and income tax policies involving precious metals whether a state has holds any precious metals in its pension funds or reserve funds whether a state has passed or imposed any of these very onerous very restrictive precious metals dealers or investor harassment laws is what we call them and some more mike gleason yeah so i wanted to dive into some of that criteria and so forth but what did the top rank states do right that led to their high scores on the index and then what were those states who scored well jp cortez this year wyoming texas and utah kind of rounded out our top three and these are three states that are all excellent on the issue of sales tax on precious metals they ve each got a full sales tax exemption on all gold and silver coins and bullion that is wyoming texas and utah they ve also taken steps to exempt the gold and silver from the income tax utah was the first to do so i believe texas has no income tax and wyoming while it does not have a state income tax passed legislation two years ago now that does not allow for a capital gains tax on precious metals if an income tax were ever to be introduced mike gleason so what states are the worst on sound money jp cortez so arkansas new jersey maine ohio tennessee vermont unfortunately there are a couple of kind of a real baddies here and these are the worst states in the country these are states that levy sales tax on precious metals they hammer you with income tax on the sale of sound money they hold no metals in any of their reserve funds any of their pension funds they restrict dealers and investors with some of these crazy regulations regarding collecting personal data reporting regular submission to police and these states the ones i just mentioned are rife with these kinds of onerous laws and just generally they have high rates of taxation compared to the rest of the country ohio here kind of stands out last year in the first annual sound money index ohio ranked 17th this past year unfortunately ohio voted to repeal its sound money sales tax exemption and it fell talk about a fall from grace all the way from 17th to tied for 49th place mike gleason yeah ouch we re of course well familiar with that here at money metals exchange we are now collecting sales tax in a half dozen states ohio is one of those this all happens in the wake of the wayfair supreme court decision that forces out of state companies to charge tax and submit it to the states where there is no sales tax exemption for precious metals wayfair obviously was dealing with this not necessarily precious metals related but we re now sort of falling under law so there s about 15 to 20 states that don t have a sales tax exemption for precious metals and we and other national dealers are having to charge sales tax now and collect those in those jurisdictions even though we don t have a physical business presence in those states that s what wayfair a addressed kind of hitting those online retailers so this is a very important issue and passing laws in the remaining states that haven t passed a bill exempting sales tax on precious metals yet would be huge for the citizens in those states but yet sales tax is not the only thing we have to deal with when it comes to taxes jp you alluded to this a moment ago with some of those states that don t have this but we also have the income tax in most states and certainly at the federal level that are owed when there is a gain and i say the word gain in quotes because it s really just an illusory gain as we know because it s not that the price of gold and silver has risen necessarily it s more a matter of the fact that the dollar has lost value but yet the governments both at the state and federal level wants to tax you on the inflation that they ve created that s caused that nominal gain talk about that jp jp cortez that s right like you just said that this gain many times isn t an actual gain it s not a real gain it s just a nominal gain that results from the inflation caused by the federal reserve an ounce of gold is still an ounce of gold the value of the ounce of gold hasn t changed it just takes more individual federal reserve notes to purchase the same ounce of gold the federal reserve note is losing value it s not the gold is gaining value and yet like you mentioned this gain is taxed at the federal level and then again at the state level to make things worse in states with no sales tax exemption then you re hit with a nefarious kind of double taxation here where you re taxed on the purchase of your metals and then taxed again on the sale mike gleason not to mention that the gain is at the 28 a collectibles rate to begin with and in many cases this isn t collectible this is bullion and yet it s still taxed at an onerous 28 rate jp cortez yeah that s right long term capital gains rate discriminatorily high 28 so that s taxed just as if you were talking about beanie babies or baseball cards or art the irs unilaterally decided that precious metals are collectibles and so now here we are mike gleason yeah it s the height of ridiculousness i know at the federal level our good friend alex mooney a congressman from west virginia has i believe introduced a bill in congress to repeal that tax at the federal level at anything you can tell us there do i have that right jp cortez yeah that is correct congressman mooney from west virginia has introduced a couple of laws to remove these capital gains that we see here and hopefully these get passed there are a couple of these laws that are coming down the pipes and hopefully we can kind of gain some traction and get some or one or maybe some of these passed mike gleason yeah obviously many things happen at the state level and that sort of builds the momentum nationally and i know that s where you re focusing most of your efforts and it s very important to do that that s where things often get started when it comes to change at a federal level as well well what other kinds of owner s restrictions do states place on dealers and investors is there anything else that we haven t covered aside from the tax issue that your group is focusing on fighting and bringing to light jp cortez yeah this is a new criteria that we ve included this year on the sound money index we call it a dealer harassment laws investor harassment laws and some of these are really quite ridiculous some states require collecting your fingerprints your physical measurements your height your weight your hair color your eye color your social security number other forms of identification all of these things that the state requires precious metals dealers or sellers to collect and then you couple that with the requirements to submit all of the sensitive information to law enforcement in some cases daily and some cases weekly so it s really quite restrictive and quite pervasive some states have made it to where you can t sell any gold or silver purchased from the public for a specified amount of time in an industry like precious metals where prices are regularly changing asking dealers to hold on to inventory for days or weeks could make a huge difference and could cause huge harm additionally if you consider that now dealers have to hold more inventory maybe than they would feel comfortable with otherwise by law now it s a liability now the dealer has to provide security has to provide insurance to adequately safeguard these now these precious metals that they re being forced to hold and then i think the worst of all probably in my opinion is that a few states prohibit cash transactions when buying gold or silver the argument being of course that sales are better tracked safety is a priority and so we need digital records of every transaction but this is nearly unprecedented in american commerce to restrict metals purchases to digitally tracked credit purchases or checks only is quite invasive mike gleason yeah i couldn t agree more obviously we ve got the 10 000 cash payments money laundering sort of restriction form 8300 that people have to fill out if you re buying over 10 000 in cash in anything where there s gold and silver a vehicle or what have you you re supposed to submit that form if you re taking payment that way in that amount but yeah extending it beyond that and lower thresholds is pretty ridiculous there is a nearby cities here and we re in idaho which is a pretty friendly state when it comes to precious metals but there s a nearby city that has a lot of those laws in place and as it stands there s zero precious metals dealers there s zero local coin shops because they don t want to have to fingerprint everybody submit it to the local police just completely ridiculous they ve driven several businesses out of the city completely it s a real shame jp it also looks like there s zero states that have at least 10 of their reserve funds held in in gold and silver i know you re trying to work to change that talk about that jp cortez well frankly the financial powers that be simply haven t allowed for it an allocation of gold and silver provides many helpful things to investors and to states if they choose to invest in gold and silver that is a hedge against inflation debt default risks stock market declines volatility and yet there isn t a single state that s holding at least 10 of its reserves in the metals and of course that it is more egregious when it s coupled with the fact that their portfolios are full of nothing but risky assets a considerable amount of emerging market debt risky bonds etfs different trading instruments people chasing returns rather than protecting and taking prudent care of money that retirees and savers and pensioners rely on mike gleason yeah they certainly should not be risking that money and of course gold and silver and the ultimate safe havens gold specifically and you would think that there would be at least some appetite for some of those states to put some of those reserves in in some kind of a gold fund or physical gold better yet none has really done yet i guess texas has is it the state teacher s pension funds that that has some physical gold is that the only one that s done that jp cortez yeah mike that s correct the texas teacher pension fund they re holding about a billion dollars worth of physical gold wyoming considered a few measures this past year to protect some of their reserve funds their rainy day funds their pension funds with physical metals held within the state or near the state and believe it or not these measures were not received warmly by different constituencies by the pension fund managers the reserve fund managers banking there were several constituencies that were not too keen on this idea mike gleason imagine that the financial elites or wall street types not wanting to see money leave the system and go into gold and silver i can t say i can t imagine why they wouldn t like that well before we let you go here is there anything else you would like to share with our listeners today maybe that we haven t covered yet or certain things that you see in movements of sound money that you think people should be keeping in mind jp cortez yeah i think just one more note on the sound money index we ve taken the time this year to kind of extend out what we re doing and so we ve scored different states on a number of interesting criteria some of the stuff we didn t get to hear in this conversation like the enforcement of gold cost contracts for example or holding metals in state reserve funds like we mentioned whether a state has established an in state depository of course texas and then this year we ve included a section on whether or not a state has issued a gold bond so it s really interesting stuff we encourage everyone to check out the sound money index mike gleason yeah they can do that either at soundmoneydefense org or on the moneymetals com site as well that information will be available there keep up the great work jp in our industry the sales tax issue has become quite a big one so the work you re doing there is vitally important and we appreciate all you re doing to defend sound money we appreciate the time today and look forward to having you on again in the future to update us on a lot of these legislative fronts because i know you ll have your finger on that pulse as much as anyone and we wish you continued success in those efforts jp cortez great thanks a lot mike mike gleason thanks again to jp cortez policy director at the sound money defense league for more information or to follow these ongoing

the central economic work conference report issued on dec 12 said that china will focus on economic stability maintaining its proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy yi gang governor of the people s bank of china in an article published in qiushi journal in november explained why the central bank will not use quantitative easing or qe which is very large rapid infusions of money into the system by having the central bank buy many types of financial assets the pboc will instead maintain a prudent normal monetary policy not too tight or too loose qe should be an extreme emergency policy it s a way for a central bank to pour funds into an economy to raise the prices of specific target assets however it causes many long term problems and economic distortions the chinese economy is slowing as part of a long term transition to a higher value added production model but the slowing is far from an emergency unemployment rose to 5 1 percent in november this is low by international standards and is unexpectedly low during a structural transition and the inflation rate rose to 4 5 percent year on year in november up from 2 percent last year however according to national bureau of statistics data 2 6 percentage points of the inflation rate was due to a rapid rise in pork prices due to african swine fever it does not reflect a systemic problem three episodes in american history illustrate the problems caused by loose monetary policy and loose banking regulation 1 the stagflation combined inflation and slow growth of the 1970s 2 the savings and loan bank default crisis of the 1980s 3 the debt driven boom of the 1990s and 2000s that resulted in the global financial crisis of 2008 which in turn compelled the us government to use qe to escape from a possible great depression from november 2008 through 2012 the federal reserve the central bank of the united states bought more than 4 5 trillion of home mortgage backed securities commercial bonds and other assets about 30 percent of annual gdp in effect the fed was printing money to boost asset prices and to keep the interest rates on us treasury bonds low one key problem with qe is that it transfers wealth to richer people away from average and poor people in practice this means that qe drives up housing prices and the prices of stocks and drives down the interest rate depositors and other savers can get on their savings this is great for asset owners but terrible for average savers or young people trying to buy a house qe rewards banks and money managers for taking high risks they get the upside if the bets pay off but the government bears the downside risk because bank deposits are insured loose monetary policy increases the prices of a limited number of assets instead of financing real investment opportunities companies and people are rewarded for their ability to manipulate financial assets rather than for real productivity increases the us economy slowed sharply in the early 1970s in the aftermath of the war in vietnam throughout the 1960s and 1970s many economists and policymakers believed in a theory called the phillips curve which stated that the unemployment rate could be permanently lowered by loose monetary policy so the fed continuously pumped more money into a slowing economy this worked for short periods but soon the economy returned to high unemployment and slow growth with even higher rates of inflation by 1980 the inflation rate reached an all time high of 13 3 percent with an unemployment rate of 8 percent in this desperate situation new federal reserve chairman paul volcker who died recently sharply raised interest rates causing what was by far the steepest recession in post wwii us history many businesses failed and unemployment rose steeply many people lost their homes because of the incredibly high interest rates which reached 18 percent on home mortgages only very stimulative fiscal policy and large tax cuts saved the country from greater disaster the second episode shows the dangers of loose banking regulation that encourages banks to invest in risky assets the us had long had a special kind of small local bank called a savings and loan bank that received local deposits such banks were restricted to making very safe investments primarily in local home mortgages george bailey s bank in the movie it s a wonderful life was an s l bank by the mid 1980s banking deregulation had allowed a few big city banks to outbid the small s l banks for deposits so the old safe s l business model was no longer viable regulators decided the way out of this dilemma was to allow the s l banks to invest in riskier and riskier assets primarily large suburban shopping centers and other commercial property in out of the way areas as should have been expected this bet on risky investments did not work and many s l banks went bankrupt since the deposits were insured by the government the taxpayers were on the hook to pay for the s l banks losses which amounted to more than 2 percent of gdp you might think that banks can make reasonable judgments about the riskiness of their investments the problem is that they are not risking their own money they are risking their depositors and ultimately the government s money in the s l banks case a successful bet on a risky investment led to a very high return for s l bank owners and managers an unsuccessful bet stuck taxpayers with the bill in the late 1990s into the 2000s the us appeared to have a magnificent economy first stock prices boomed after the nasdaq collapse in march 2000 housing prices soared the problem is that these booms turned out to be bubbles driven by loose monetary policy and low interest rates the money flowing into the economy had to go somewhere it drove up the price of assets mostly housing and stocks largely to the benefit of upper income people most disastrously low interest rates meant that banks could not make money from safe loans so they turned to riskier investments especially sub prime housing loans regulation of banks was very loose and little attempt was made to control the immense risks any bank employee who did not want to approve the risky investments which were highly profitable in the short run was simply replaced naturally this led to a huge mess culminating in the crisis in the fall of 2008 and the taxpayers were again stuck with the bill qe probably was necessary to prevent an economy wide disaster after the banking collapse in 2008 the week beginning with the lehmann collapse on monday sept 15 was certainly scary there were very legitimate fears that this could be the start of a new great depression any policymaker at the time certainly would have done everything possible including qe to help the economy survive in the short term but it is much better to adopt prudent monetary policy and strong banking regulations as china is now doing to prevent such a crisis from ever arising

columnist had just celebrated his 22nd birthday those in the obama administration were far less cheerful s p global ratings announced it would downgrade america s credit rating for the first time ever even though lawmakers had finally agreed to a hard fought compromise on raising the debt ceiling the downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that congress and the

government from cnbc s rick santelli in february 2009 it ushered in a wave of hard line republicans in the 2010 midterm elections like senator mike lee of utah and senator rand paul of kentucky who vowed to save the u s from a mountain of debt that is devouring us grover norquist president of americans for tax reform praised the debt limit deal saying that in five to 10 years it will lead to a different country norquist was right but probably not in the way he expected since august 2011 the u s public debt has increased by almost 9 trillion to 23 trillion and virtually no one has batted an eye s p included benchmark 10 year treasury yields are lower not higher 2 main street hasn t faced any hint of runaway inflation government debt hasn t crowded out companies from borrowing and investing simply put nothing the tea party warned about has come to pass perhaps this is why in what may ultimately be seen as a watershed moment the house budget committee last month held a hearing titled reexamining the economic costs of debt the session included testimony from four economists including randall wray a senior scholar at the levy economics institute of bard college and a leading thinker in modern monetary theory though he wasn t given much time to speak when he did he told lawmakers this we do not have to repay the debt what we have to do is make the interest payments advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content if there were one sentence that captured the drastic change in economic thought over the past decade that might just be it as a reminder mmt argues that sovereign governments with their own currency can t go broke and can spend until inflation becomes an issue the shift from the tea party to mmt reveals two crucial and interrelated themes of the past 10 years first it shows that former federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke was right monetary policy cannot be a panacea to cure all that ails developed market economies second relying solely on central banks tends to create financial asset distortions that foster income inequality and dissatisfaction among broad swaths of the world s population wray says americans don t seem to have confidence in their elected representatives to do the right thing when it comes to the economy and perhaps congress doesn t believe in itself either in the aftermath of the global financial crisis there was a tremendous overreaction against fiscal policy in favor of putting all the trust in monetary policy he said in a

who rely on salary bumps have fallen behind an mmt inspired fiscal policy in theory would hope to change that none other than ray dalio founder of bridgewater associates has said he sees mmt as inevitable policy makers he says have to figure out how to get the economic machine to produce economic well being for most people when typical central bank tools fail he sees a coordination of fiscal and monetary policy as the only answer advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the big question dalio says is whether elected officials can responsibly push and pull on the economy wray thinks they can give the policy makers the truth and if you believe in democracy you ve got to trust them to do the right thing he said i don t think there s any danger that just because they realize the government can t run out of money let s spend until the cows come home i ve never met any politician who wants inflation of course there are still any number of lawmakers mostly but not exclusively republicans whose views are rigid as ever about the budget i certainly don t want my grandkids to see the crisis scenario in which the interest rate on the debt will skyrocket abruptly because investors will no longer have confidence in our government s ability to pay its bills lamented steve womack an arkansas republican at the house hearing ralph norman a republican from south carolina peppered wray with questions including if he had ever run a business or knew the inflation rates in chile peru and venezuela hyperinflation hurts the little man he warned advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content and for every big name investor like dalio who s sanguine about mmt there s at least one who dismisses it outright jeffrey gundlach chief investment officer at doubleline capital has blasted it as a crackpot idea by now mmt economists are no strangers to ad hominem attacks the most important thing is just the weight of the evidence says stephanie kelton a professor of economics and public policy at stony brook university who is also an adviser to the bernie sanders campaign and has written occasionally for bloomberg opinion at some point people become increasingly willing to rethink the theories the models the conventional wisdom because all of the things that were supposed to happen kept not happening kelton points to japan which is running a debt to gdp ratio of about 238 with low inflation and interest rates locked near zero as an example of failing conventional wisdom increasingly you re hearing central bankers talking openly and candidly about a need for a fiscal partner she said in a phone interview there s growing but reluctant acceptance of the idea that fiscal policy is going to have to take on a bigger supporting role and maybe even a starring role advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content this is where representative alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal or something like it comes into the picture wray co wrote a paper titled how to pay for the green new deal in a nod to john maynard keynes s 1940 book how to pay for the war to consider how far mmt still has to go just consider wray s view of taxes it is possible that we will need to constrain domestic consumption in order to release resources for the gnd effort in a noninflationary manner the problem is not that we cannot financially afford the gnd government can always bid resources away from private use by paying higher prices but spending on the gnd will generate private income that can support higher bids in competition with the government for scarce resources this is the real reason that tax hikes might be desirable to reduce private income and thereby remove competition for resources to condense the argument taxes are not about raising revenue for the government they re to reduce spending power to avoid price inflation for many people who have just a cursory understanding of the u s monetary system this can be difficult to grasp 1 after all it has been a long time since fiscal policy has played a starring role as kelton says it s why wray has to go back to world war ii for any sort of comparable government initiative advertisement 8 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content it s still far too soon to say whether mmt will catch on in the 2020s but in some ways the trump administration has washed away what remained of the tea party s resolve in a bipartisan move the house this month passed two spending bills that provide 1 4 trillion to fund the u s government the u s will almost certainly run at least a 1 trillion annual deficit in the coming years the peterson foundation one of the last voices calling for fiscal restraint bemoaned the budget deal another 400 billion in debt is the worst possible holiday gift for our children the group said we should be looking at ways to reduce our interest burden so that we can fund important national priorities that sounds awfully familiar one of peterson s tweets last month was flooded with replies of the ok boomer meme it s one example of how mmt has a passionate and growing base of supporters who are tired of the way washington has operated for decades for all its connotations with sanders ocasio cortez and democratic socialism wray doesn t see mmt as some sort of showdown with capitalism quite the opposite he imagines what a world war ii like effort would look like if instead of producing guns and bombs the government turbocharged renewable energy projects that would last for generations advertisement 9 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the past 10 years have been

reason to believe it s not going to be this new era of high productivity with environmental sustainability high wages and full employment 1 jpmorgan chase co for instance estimated that the downgrade

the central economic work conference report issued on dec 12 said that china will focus on economic stability maintaining its proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy yi gang governor of the people s bank of china in an article published in qiushi journal in november explained why the central bank will not use quantitative easing or qe which is very large rapid infusions of money into the system by having the central bank buy many types of financial assets the pboc will instead maintain a prudent normal monetary policy not too tight or too loose qe should be an extreme emergency policy it s a way for a central bank to pour funds into an economy to raise the prices of specific target assets however it causes many long term problems and economic distortions the chinese economy is slowing as part of a long term transition to a higher value added production model but the slowing is far from an emergency unemployment rose to 5 1 percent in november this is low by international standards and is unexpectedly low during a structural transition and the inflation rate rose to 4 5 percent year on year in november up from 2 percent last year however according to national bureau of statistics data 2 6 percentage points of the inflation rate was due to a rapid rise in pork prices due to african swine fever it does not reflect a systemic problem three episodes in american history illustrate the problems caused by loose monetary policy and loose banking regulation 1 the stagflation combined inflation and slow growth of the 1970s 2 the savings and loan bank default crisis of the 1980s 3 the debt driven boom of the 1990s and 2000s that resulted in the global financial crisis of 2008 which in turn compelled the us government to use qe to escape from a possible great depression from november 2008 through 2012 the federal reserve the central bank of the united states bought more than 4 5 trillion of home mortgage backed securities commercial bonds and other assets about 30 percent of annual gdp in effect the fed was printing money to boost asset prices and to keep the interest rates on us treasury bonds low one key problem with qe is that it transfers wealth to richer people away from average and poor people in practice this means that qe drives up housing prices and the prices of stocks and drives down the interest rate depositors and other savers can get on their savings this is great for asset owners but terrible for average savers or young people trying to buy a house qe rewards banks and money managers for taking high risks they get the upside if the bets pay off but the government bears the downside risk because bank deposits are insured loose monetary policy increases the prices of a limited number of assets instead of financing real investment opportunities companies and people are rewarded for their ability to manipulate financial assets rather than for real productivity increases the us economy slowed sharply in the early 1970s in the aftermath of the war in vietnam throughout the 1960s and 1970s many economists and policymakers believed in a theory called the phillips curve which stated that the unemployment rate could be permanently lowered by loose monetary policy so the fed continuously pumped more money into a slowing economy this worked for short periods but soon the economy returned to high unemployment and slow growth with even higher rates of inflation by 1980 the inflation rate reached an all time high of 13 3 percent with an unemployment rate of 8 percent in this desperate situation new federal reserve chairman paul volcker who died recently sharply raised interest rates causing what was by far the steepest recession in post wwii us history many businesses failed and unemployment rose steeply many people lost their homes because of the incredibly high interest rates which reached 18 percent on home mortgages only very stimulative fiscal policy and large tax cuts saved the country from greater disaster the second episode shows the dangers of loose banking regulation that encourages banks to invest in risky assets the us had long had a special kind of small local bank called a savings and loan bank that received local deposits such banks were restricted to making very safe investments primarily in local home mortgages george bailey s bank in the movie it s a wonderful life was an s l bank by the mid 1980s banking deregulation had allowed a few big city banks to outbid the small s l banks for deposits so the old safe s l business model was no longer viable regulators decided the way out of this dilemma was to allow the s l banks to invest in riskier and riskier assets primarily large suburban shopping centers and other commercial property in out of the way areas as should have been expected this bet on risky investments did not work and many s l banks went bankrupt since the deposits were insured by the government the taxpayers were on the hook to pay for the s l banks losses which amounted to more than 2 percent of gdp you might think that banks can make reasonable judgments about the riskiness of their investments the problem is that they are not risking their own money they are risking their depositors and ultimately the government s money in the s l banks case a successful bet on a risky investment led to a very high return for s l bank owners and managers an unsuccessful bet stuck taxpayers with the bill in the late 1990s into the 2000s the us appeared to have a magnificent economy first stock prices boomed after the nasdaq collapse in march 2000 housing prices soared the problem is that these booms turned out to be bubbles driven by loose monetary policy and low interest rates the money flowing into the economy had to go somewhere it drove up the price of assets mostly housing and stocks largely to the benefit of upper income people most disastrously low interest rates meant that banks could not make money from safe loans so they turned to riskier investments especially sub prime housing loans regulation of banks was very loose and little attempt was made to control the immense risks any bank employee who did not want to approve the risky investments which were highly profitable in the short run was simply replaced naturally this led to a huge mess culminating in the crisis in the fall of 2008 and the taxpayers were again stuck with the bill qe probably was necessary to prevent an economy wide disaster after the banking collapse in 2008 the week beginning with the lehmann collapse on monday sept 15 was certainly scary there were very legitimate fears that this could be the start of a new great depression any policymaker at the time certainly would have done everything possible including qe to help the economy survive in the short term but it is much better to adopt prudent monetary policy and strong banking regulations as china is now doing to prevent such a crisis from ever arising

via as i first read bryan caplan s open borders are a trillion dollar idea in foreign policy besides disbelief my thoughts were that this person must not get out much or must not read much a quote from writer upton sinclair came to mind as well it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it what is just open borders are not only just but the most promising shortcut to global prosperity writes caplan this raises the question of who determines what just is just is not a defined term that someone can easily review as caplan seems to imply and determine whether a particular policy is just or unjust in fact each individual probably has a different definition of what just is but in the united states i believe the vast majority of citizens see open borders as a totally unjust policy it is unjust because it is generally accepted that the population of a country has entered into a social contract with the leaders and government of a country under this contract the population will follow the rule of law and the government will pass and enforce policies that have beneficial impact upon the population of the country there is no social contract between the leaders and government of one country and people who live in another country as an example from across the pond the new italian government recently released figures showing that the state will allocate 50 million next year 200 million in 2021 and 300 million in 2022 to the disability and self reliance fund of italy some 2 million disabled in italy rely on these state benefits which work out to just 54 cents per day in welfare insufficient for even a subsistence diet in contrast italy is providing migrants 20 euros a day most italians are likely to see this policy as unjust similar per capita spending differentials exist in funds furnished to needy citizens and migrants in the united states that is also unjust what missed opportunity caplan writes to see the massive missed opportunity of which i speak consider the migration of a low skilled haitian from port au prince to miami in haiti he would earn about 1 000 per year in miami he could easily earn 25 000 per year how is such upward mobility possible simply put human beings are much more productive in florida than in haiti thanks to better government policies better management better technology and much more he continues the central function of existing immigration laws is to prevent this wealth creation from happening to trap human talent in low productivity countries out of all the destructive economic policies known to man nothing on earth is worse i m not joking standard estimates say open borders would ultimately double humanity s wealth production how is this possible because immigration sharply increases workers productivity and the world contains many hundreds of millions of would be immigrants multiply a massive gain per person by a massive number of people and you end up with what the economist michael clemens calls trillion dollar bills on the sidewalk the real problem with this statement is that if you move a person from port au prince to miami you may be more likely to get a street person than you are to get a person earning 25 000 one of the policy suggestions in the u s and the world that is being floated by some u s presidential candidates and others is universal basic income this idea has arisen with technology leaving large groups unemployed usually the most undereducated and unskilled of the population among other reasons if it is so easy for people to become and stay productive members of the u s workforce then why would such a policy be proposed would it not be more likely that our haitian immigrant would just accept this handout another element missing from this argument is the need for capital both at the individual level and at the work level an individual coming to this country requires capital to set up a residence obtain transportation put food on the table and pay for health care until he can get a job and start if ever producing those the writer would welcome to the u s would come to this country with barely the shirts on their backs just as the individual needs capital capital is required to put a person to work this is true of even the most basic position a ditch digger requires a shovel but the u s does not generate many ditch digger positions instead capital is required to establish a place for an employee to work equipment for the person to use be it a personal computer a cash register a harvester or a forklift and training this could run into tens of thousands of dollars per worker during the last 10 years there has been very little capital spending to expand capacity in the u s accordingly caplan s basic assertion is ridiculous any new immigrant who just crossed the border would require tens of thousands of dollars to get started without this s he will just become another street person wandering the streets of america another issue overlooked by the author is that an individual earning 25 000 in miami would not even be living at subsistence level according to the miami new times to simply pay for necessities an average miamian should make 38 529 a year to live comfortably a resident would need to make 77 057 a year thus in actuality caplan either is advocating to dramatically increase the level of homelessness or the welfare rolls in this country we can look to sweden as a good example of how migration has increased unemployment even though sweden has thrown substantial monetary support to migrants unemployment is among the highest in the european union in some towns upwards of 80 percent of migrants taken in have remained on welfare instead of large positive economic impacts sweden has encountered significant financial costs and negative impacts creating financial crises in some municipalities unification compared to migration there is a significant difference in a rather confusing manner caplan attempts to equate current migration to the unification of germany many european countries most notably west germany during the cold war have swiftly absorbed much larger inflows in the past german unification was not a mass migration but instead was the combining of two separate countries which 45 years earlier had been a single country unification is not equivalent to the migration issue in addition understand that people from eastern germany did not show up without assets they brought a whole country with them which included farmland schools universities homes factories roads and infrastructure certainly investments needed to be made to upgrade these assets but it was not as though east germans showed up with only the clothes on their backs further the people of east and west germany shared the same language the same culture and a few thousand years of history many people in west germany were related to people in east germany and the people of east germany were highly educated all that said the unification was extremely difficult and expensive and today a large rift is growing in germany with the grand coalition run by angela merkel and the two centralist parties bifurcating into the left led by die linke the remnant of the east german communist party and the right led by afd the new face of anti immigration and fiscally responsible germans crime we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us caplan next downplays the amount of crime due to migrants stating native born citizens also frequently worry that immigrants supposedly lacking western culture s deep respect for law and order will be criminally inclined at least in the united states however this is the reverse of the truth the incarceration rate of the foreign born is about a third less than that of the native born this is an untrue statement for example in arizona according to a study by the federation for american immigration reform an illegal alien is four times more likely to be incarcerated for a crime than a legal resident or a citizen in new jersey illegal immigrants are incarcerated five times more often than legal residents and citizens and rates of incarceration of illegal aliens on the west coast are triple that of legal residents and citizens according to a 2004 article in city journal in los angeles a city where illegal aliens represent approximately 23 percent of the population illegal aliens accounted for 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for homicide which totaled 1 200 to 1 500 up to two thirds of all fugitive felony warrants 17 000 were for illegal aliens can the situation be better now in 2019 in what is now officially a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state again looking abroad in sweden the last government report that collected statistics on immigration and crime was a 2005 study by the swedish national council for crime prevention brå it found that people of foreign background were 2 5 times more likely to be suspected of crimes than people with a swedish background immigrants were four times more likely to be suspected of lethal violence and robbery five times more likely to be investigated for sex crimes and three times more likely to be investigated for violent assault the report was based on statistics for those suspected of offenses the brå said that there was little difference in the statistics for those suspected of crimes and those actually convicted further politics caplan then goes on to discuss how migrants impact the politics of a country native born citizens of developed countries have a long track record of voting for the policies that made their industries thrive and their countries rich who knows how vast numbers of new immigrants would vote indeed shouldn t we expect people from dysfunctional polities to bring dysfunctional politics with them these are fine questions but the answers are not alarming at least in the u s the main political division between the native and foreign born is engagement even immigrants legally able to vote are markedly less likely than native born citizens to exercise this right in the 2012 u s presidential election for example 72 percent of eligible native born citizens voted versus just 48 percent of eligible immigrants wherever they politically stand then immigrants opinions are relatively inert this is really a nonargument what has been true in the past about the percentage of eligible immigrants voting is not necessarily going to be true in the future in addition this is a case of lies damn lies and statistics if the above referenced 48 percent of eligible immigrants vote mostly one way which they probably do then it can tip the scale significantly away from the long term voting track record of native born citizens of developed countries which made their industries thrive and their countries rich do no harm caplan wraps up his article by referencing his book in open borders i have the space to address many more concerns about immigration in more detail what i can t do i confess is address the unmeasured and the unmeasurable in real life however everyone routinely copes with ambiguous dangers unknown unknowns how do we cope it is difficult to understand exactly what caplan s point is here is he trying to say well we really do not know what the impact would be from open borders but what the hell let s do it and see what happens if that is what he is saying that is a reckless approach considering it could impact the lives of more than 300 million people in the u s alone this is an issue that should be studied to death before any decisions are taken the ramifications of failure are just too catastrophic to consider in the petri dish of life there are several real world examples of failure of these ideas in sweden the ex ceo of a major company recently said the country is on the edge of civil war over its immigration policy neighboring norway has put its military on the swedish border to prevent incursion from immigrants located in sweden other countries experiencing unrest over immigration issues are germany italy and the netherlands one country which is not having problems is switzerland which is taking a measured approach to immigration looking back in time argentina provides lessons to the negative impact of mass immigration argentina is a country gifted with a large amount of natural resources prior to wwi argentina was looked upon as a superior place to emigrate to over the u s with buenos aires earning the moniker of the paris of south america during the 1870s and up until ww1 argentina experienced an economic boom the scarcity of labor and abundance of land induced a high marginal product of labor per wikipedia european immigrants chiefly italians spaniards french and germans tempted by the high wages arrived in droves the government subsidized european immigration for a short time in the late 1880s but immigrants arrived in massive numbers even with no subsidy in general these immigrants were low skilled and poorly educated the population grew from 1 9 million in 1870 to 15 9 million in 1947 during the same period argentina allowed in 6 6 million immigrants with most of these people settling in the cities even though the country had an economy driven largely by agriculture a side effect of the high immigration levels was the importing of ideas such as labor unionism anarchism and other forms of popular organization the great depression caused the economy to turn down and within a few years there was high unemployment which resulted in labor unrest this led to political instability and a military junta began running the country in 1943 in 1946 juan perón came to power on the backs of the descamisados or shirtless ones perón basically ran on a socialist program leaning towards corporatism similar to mussolini fascism with several five year programs implemented similar to communist ussr per wikipedia beginning in 1947 perón took a leftward shift after breaking up with the catholic nationalism movement which led to gradual state control of the economy reflected in the increase in state owned property interventionism including control of rents and prices and higher levels of public inversion mainly financed by the inflationary tax the expansive macroeconomic policy which aimed at the redistribution of wealth and the increase of spending to finance populist policies led to inflation it should be recognized that the translated name of the peronist party or justicialist party is the social justice party it has governed argentina most of the time since perón assumed power in 1947 the backbone of the social justice party was the millions of poor and uneducated immigrants who settled largely in argentina s cities from the mid 1800s through 1943 open borders is not the only reason that argentina has experienced continuous financial crises since the 1940 however it was a major contributor and indirectly contributed to bringing in the ideas of socialism and corporatism to argentina which severely damaged argentina s economy to date argentina has defaulted on its debt eight times more than any other country the imf is preparing for a ninth default in the near future since the peronists returned to power late in

beijing will lower tariffs on over 850 goods and products coming into the country from jan 1 including frozen pork medicine and some high tech components analysts say this signals a commitment to more open trade and could also boost china s flagging growth china s finance ministry said yesterday that the latest move was meant to expand china s imports and increase imports of products facing a relative domestic shortage or foreign speciality goods for everyday consumption beijing will temporarily reduce tariff rates for goods below most favoured nation mfn tariff levels which china has agreed to extend to fellow members of the world trade organisation the reductions come as tensions between the united states and china have cooled over trade both sides recently announced they have reached a phase one trade agreement that will see beijing ramp up purchases of american agricultural products and other goods in return for a rollback of some us tariffs the fresh tariff cuts will see reduced tax rates for a wide range of products such as frozen pork avocados asthma medication and electronic components frozen pork for instance will see its tariff rate cut to 8 per cent from the mfn duty of 12 per cent china is trying to boost pork imports to plug shortages as its hog herds have been decimated by an african swine flu epidemic and demand is expected to spike ahead of chinese new year in addition goods from countries such as singapore new zealand australia and south korea will be subject to lower duties than agreed under the trade agreements they have with china singapore which has a free trade agreement with china that covers 95 per cent of the republic s exports will see tariff rates on goods such as petroleum products electronic components and some food products reduced further
climate strike is the collins dictionary s 2019 word of the year reflecting how climate demonstrations have drawn millions of participants worldwide while these have been relatively small in russia there are signs that the country may now be paying closer attention to climate risks russia is the world s fourth largest emitter of greenhouse gases and its carbon based wealth is facing increased risk as the world moves towards a low carbon future russia will need to rethink how it will address both its exposure to climate risk and increase its contribution to curbing climate change but what exactly is wealth in a recent world bank report titled how wealthy is russia we looked at how russia s wealth has changed over time wealth in our framework is the sum of human capital produced capital natural capital and net foreign assets while human capital comprises the largest share of the country s wealth at 46 per cent this is still well below the oecd average of 70 per cent clearly oecd countries have done more to convert other forms of wealth to more productive human capital there is no question that russia has abundant oil and gas resources this is reflected in its 15 per cent share of natural capital which is well above the average for upper middle and high income countries other than the gulf countries but when it comes to renewable natural assets the role of russia s forests also stands out russia is home to 20 per cent of the world s forest resources the carbon absorption of its european forests is comparable to finland that of its siberian forests to canada and that of its forests in the north caucasus to those in the united states as a rough approximation we estimate that russia s forests excluding reserve forests provide a carbon absorption value worth over half a trillion us dollars over their lifetime there is an important caveat this sequestration value of russia s forests is the net present value of the global public good while the economic return to russia is only a fraction of it unless the rest of the world is willing to pay for carbon sequestration services this further underscores the need for a functioning global forest carbon market given russia s extraordinary forest resources a pressing priority for the country is reduction of forest fires this year witnessed one of the worst siberian fires on record and between 2015 18 fires on both forest and non forest lands in russia more than doubled greenpeace estimates that the country s average annual loss of forests due to fires is equivalent to a territory the size of germany there are some promising developments as part of the six year 400 billion us dollar fiscal stimulus that the government has embarked on a national priority project called ecology could increase the value of timber and forest ecosystem services for people and the economy if successfully implemented this would enhance russia s role as an ecological donor to the planet paradoxically while russia s forests make an important contribution in curbing climate change the country remains the fourth largest co 2 emitter as its economy continues to depend on fossil fuel assets in 2018 fossil fuels accounted for 65 per cent of total exports up from 59 per cent in 2017 and the structure of the country s produced capital is skewed towards the industries and skills related to fossil fuels such as mining refining and emissions intensive heavy industry this increases russia s exposure to policies of its trade partners that restrict market access to products with a high environmental footprint what can russia do in the short term the heavy and polluting industries that currently generate the bulk of russia s revenue could lower their environmental footprint by adopting modern environmental management systems the payoffs are likely to be swift for example russian aluminum already enjoys a low carbon footprint by relying on hydropower and this may give it a price and market access premium in a low carbon future in the medium to long term and with the necessary political and social backing it would be important for russia to increase fuel excise taxes and differentiate tax rates by the social and environmental cost of fuel use this could include among other things eliminating non transparent subsidies to producers and consumers for example an earlier world bank study found that as of 2013 russia was wasting more energy than france consumed exploring carbon taxes or other forms of carbon pricing and harmonising these within broader trade and technology agreements with prospective trading partners would also help diversify and modernise russia s economy while preventing environmentally motivated trade measures or consumers actions russia can also engage more proactively in global climate policies its recent adoption of the paris agreement is a step in this direction some note that russia s adoption is no big deal after all emissions today are about 30 per cent below their 1990 peak so adopting the agreement is essentially non binding for russia nonetheless this is a welcome step to regain trust and enhance international cooperation on the relatively neutral ground of environmentally sustainable technologies with 2020 fast approaching don t be surprised if the environment once again makes it to the word of the year

the first part of this article published on dec 9 highlighted how china is dominating the global production of lithium ion batteries libs and how pakistan stands to learn from its experience globally electric vehicles evs have been the main drivers of investment in lib production libs constitute 40 50 per cent of the cost of an ev over 80pc of the future lib demand is expected to come from evs the remaining demand will come from applications like stationary storage and consumer electronics the government recently announced its national electric vehicles policy nevp 2019 the policy covers not only evs but also its related industries like libs and charging stations it ambitiously targets 100 000 cars 500 000 two wheelers three wheelers and 1 000 buses and trucks as evs by the end of 2024 it further targets a 30pc share of evs in new car sales by 2030 and 90pc by 2040 the policy also aims to convert 3 000 idle cng stations into ev charging stations these targets come with a generous fiscal incentive package for investment the policy allows the ev imports of completely built units cbu at zero duty for five years while only 1pc sales tax will be collected from ev assemblers for the first seven years with electric vehicles in play surplus electricity can be put to use in charging stations which will dilute fixed capacity charges and drive down power tariffs for all user segments the registration of vehicles and token tax will also be free on prospective buyers benefits under the auto development policy 2016 21 also apply to new entrants in electric vehicles except that the nevp offers further benefits in addition used ev imports will also be allowed for the first two years all these incentives are expected to bring ev prices in parity with conventional vehicles the policy argues that evs will not only help cut our fuel import bill expected annual savings of about 2 billion but also significantly reduce traffic pollution which currently accounts for about 40pc of total greenhouse gas emissions in the country almost twice those in developed countries clearly the nevp has to be acknowledged as a step in the right direction if done right this can be truly transformational for our industrial landscape it is imperative for the government to treat this policy and ensuing ev investments as a means to an end rather than an end in itself the policy must aim to drive investment in other allied industries like renewable energy and power storage it will be useful to see how china essentially preloaded the lib demand and production by pushing investments in evs an interesting example of how evs can influence other seemingly unrelated industries in pakistan is its impact on the local energy sector pakistan is currently sitting on a huge pile of idle power generation capacities almost all of which are in the independent power producer ipp mode these ipps which are commissioned under take or pay contracts with the government charge dollar denominated capacity payments irrespective of the plant usage since the government passes these capacity charges on to existing consumers the end user rate of electricity has been increasing exponentially now with evs in play this surplus generation capacity can be put to use in ev charging stations which will dilute the fixed capacity charges and drive down electricity tariffs for all other user segments like industrial commercial and residential pakistan will thus be in a unique situation vis à vis other developed countries where an increase in power demand from evs will end up reducing rather than increasing the consumers cost of electricity similarly another major application of libs the stationary storage can help meet the intermittence issue of renewable energy especially solar energy stationary storage whether used for on site applications like homes and office buildings or grid scale applications can help shave off the solar generation peaks during sun hours the solar generation consumption mismatch known as the duck curve has been a challenge for many developed countries with ramped up solar generation capacities the lib storage here can solve this problem by storing excess power in daytime and discharging it in the after sun hours in the context of pakistan the above mentioned applications of libs can trigger a continuous circuit of green investments where ev demand will create demand for libs and supply of libs for stationary storage solutions will incentivise further investment in renewable energy finally with cheap renewables in the energy mix energy tariffs can be brought down that will in turn drive further demand for evs this self perpetuating ev lib solar ev green loop can truly set off a paradigm shift in our economy but in order to truly harness the potential of libs the government will have to do this the right way leveraging the china pakistan economic corridor cpec the government should encourage chinese led jvs in lib manufacturing with local partners responsible for local fund raising regulatory approvals and organisational setup until the local ev market takes shape these will primarily be export oriented projects targeting the united states and europe with some local demand anchorage coming from stationary storage applications the chinese partner will ideally be an existing lib manufacturer looking to relocate expand its capacities in pakistan besides other fiscal incentives under the nevp the relocation will provide a location arbitrage to the chinese partner where the united states has recently imposed a 10 15pc import duty on made in china libs lastly these large scale giga factories can be set up in various special economic zones sezs envisaged under cpec the sez framework offers its own set of incentives like duty free imports of plant machinery and a 10 year tax holiday moreover their locations provide for easy connectivity to main highways airports and seaports karachi the economic fundamentals for evs and libs are exceptionally strong in pakistan investments in evs and libs can spur technology transfer improve urban air quality reduce noise pollution save expensive foreign exchange employ idle power capacity lower consumer tariffs and trigger capital flows towards multiple industries and yet like almost always the macro risks emanating from policy inconsistencies and bureaucratic red tape weigh heavier whether the fate of the auto policy 2016 21 in the wake of the nevp comes under question or the dismal condition of operational sezs is up for review the gap between what is promised as policy and what is delivered as action is too wide to ignore these factors form the basis of any investment decision and will thus have to be addressed to conclude the government has taken a major first step in unveiling the ev policy a federal minister also announced the entry of a chinese lib manufacturer in pakistan these are all positive developments but these words will now have to be backed by right actions for the stakes are too high and the storage opportunity too huge the writer heads the business advisory function at a large industrial and services group in islamabad published

help me here president trump loves to claim the nation is living through the greatest economy in american history but job growth was higher in president obama s second term the growth in gross domestic product a standard measure of economic performance is about the same as it was to this point in obama s second term according to the washington post mosads and this year u s manufacturing has fallen into an official recession recording two successive quarters of negative growth these facts produce a politically explosive possibility of blue collar trump voters revolting against his failed economic promises heading into the 2020 presidential election the president stirred up populist passions in 2016 with talk of bringing manufacturing industries coal mines and steel mills back to life the heart of that pledge was his call to get rid of the north american free trade agreement nafta a trade agreement with mexico and canada that trump called one of the worst trade deals ever last week the house passed a trump backed replacement for nafta the united states mexico canada agreement usmca and the senate caught in trump s grip is highly likely to pass the bill in january so will the new deal produce a spike in manufacturing jobs or increase stagnant wages the u s international trade commission says the usmca will only result in a modest 0 35 percent gdp growth and fewer than 200 000 jobs after six years and economists across the political spectrum predict prices will go up on cars for example without producing a big jump in manufacturing jobs i know what republican readers are thinking there goes another trump critic trying to deny the president a victory as he heads into the 2020 campaign oh really well listen to stephen moore the conservative economist and a man trump wanted to put on the federal reserve earlier this year asked in a september c span interview whether the usmca had drastic differences from the current nafta deal he replied not really and here is sen pat toomey r pa on nbc s meet the press earlier this month the new deal has all kinds of new provisions to diminish trade and that s why i hope republicans reconsider this senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky is not exactly happy either from my perspective it s not as good as i had hoped but we ll have to take a look at the whole package mcconnell said last week so why are mcconnell and other republicans making excuses for a bill they don t like the answer is fear the gop is backing this bill out of fear that if it doesn t quietly go along trump is capable of doing a head first dive into america first style economic protectionism in other words he is capable of killing any trade deal with mexico and canada that would damage the u s economy and hurt republican prospects in the 2020 elections mossecondads even in the face of those threats the free traders who write conservative editorials for the wall street journal can t hide their discontent with the current political reality the shame is that in many respects the new deal is worse than nafta especially its bows to politically managed trade the journal editorialized last week the new deal raises the cost of manufacturing making north american products less competitive worldwide the editorial said after explaining that they see themselves doing damage control in the face of trump s protectionist instincts the bottom line is that the president has succeeded in muzzling conservative critics of his economic policies that s why congressional republicans have little to say about how the president s tax cut sent the lion s share of its benefits to people and companies in the top income brackets not to middle income wage earners and they have only silence when it comes to the nation s ballooning deficit as a result of the tax cut and increased spending under trump trump s specific failure to deliver for blue collar workers is being hidden by the gop out of fear that it is too late to be honest with voters about trump s empty bluster if they dare challenge him on his failed economic promises he will remind them that he is their best bet to keep a republican in the white house the president s hunger for any new trade deal with canada and mexico led speaker nancy pelosi d calif to tell her caucus last week we ate their lunch she was referring to changes made to the bill at democrats behest that attracted more support from unions trump is grabbing at the proposed deal so he can go out on the 2020 campaign trail and paper over his failures with the vacuous claim that he produced a better trade agreement republicans in congress have no choice but to play along but their private grumbling is increasingly public as the nation approaches election day 2020 juan williams is an author and a political analyst for fox news channel

year in review 2019 turning point for investors in china china s 2019 was a remarkable year but generally for all the wrong reasons facing domestic crises and international disputes the chinese government was under a high level of scrutiny throughout the year yet despite the unpredictable environment china s economic performance in 2019 was surprisingly stable another year of gradual economic deceleration and modest reform in a logical continuation of structural trends thus as 2019 comes to a close china is wrapping up another year of growth at a notch above six percent china has taken the slowdown in its stride continuing to improve on its business environment through targeted reforms like the new foreign investment law and strengthening intellectual property ip protections here we review some of the major developments that gripped china in 2019 and offer key takeaways for foreign investors seeking to understand how the regional business landscape is changing for foreign investors us china relations see bumps on the road while the us china trade dispute started the year before in 2019 it transformed from a short term conflict with the potential for a quick remedy into an entrenched standoff at the start of 2019 investors and financial markets closely monitored trade talks hoping for the two sides to strike a deal throughout the year however american and chinese trade negotiators frequently expressed optimism for a trade deal that was seemingly close at hand only to be inevitably followed by backsliding days later now with the trade war lasting over 500 days and counting tariffs and trade tensions are increasingly being priced in as a given in the us china relationship trade negotiators have apparently become less ambitious at the end of the year what were once negotiations for a comprehensive trade deal devolved into talks for a phase one deal leaving fundamental disagreements unresolved while trade negotiations have been unpredictable from the start they may become even more so with the us presidential elections only a year away in an election year us president donald trump is likely not to concede to anything that makes him look weak however if trump believes that signing a trade deal can be sold as a win to please key constituents negotiations may be sped up chinese president xi jinping for his part might calculate that trump is too unreliable and hold out on a deal in the hopes that an alternate candidate will win the presidency and prioritize resolving the dispute further complicating matters has been the inclusion of other political issues driving up us china tensions namely china s policy in hong kong and xinjiang hong kong has been experiencing social unrest since the summer and it is still active at the close of 2019 the protest movement is the biggest repudiation of party authority in hong kong since the territory s handover in 1997 though the movement seeks to protect hong kong s autonomy and rule of law it along with the government s response has brought the city s economy to a standstill in the third quarter of 2019 hong kong s gdp contracted by 2 9 percent year on year while hong kong still plays an important role for foreign investors and for china s economy the threats to the rule of law it faces risks challenging its status as asia s premier financial center in light of heightened political risks many investors are now looking to singapore as an alternative the geopolitical tensions have not just resulted in slower growth and higher tariffs but also a more complicated public relations environment for foreign businesses the nba cathay pacific shutterstock and dc comics are among the many brands that experienced pr crises in china in 2019 if foreign businesses have not learned the lesson already it is clear that businesses across all industries need to be extra careful in their behavior not just in china but around the world or risk a fierce backlash pressure on regional economies to diversify industrial scope tighten finances despite the trade war and other economic headwinds china managed steady growth in 2019 while gdp growth fell to a low of six percent in q3 china is on pace to hit the lower end of its growth target of 6 6 5 percent for the year but beneath the surface signs of economic weakness became more visible as the year progressed because the chinese state continues to exercise high levels of control over the economy gdp growth is in many ways as much of an input as it is an output growth is not necessarily indicative of the real state of the economy but how much credit the government is willing to inject into it a closer look at sector specific performance shows that the economy has shown signs of vulnerability in 2019 for example profits in the manufacturing sector declined by 4 9 percent from january to october while profits for industrial firms fell by 2 9 percent in the same period in october auto sales declined for the 16th consecutive month as consumers held off on big ticket purchases amid economic uncertainty moreover regional disparities in economic growth grew wider throughout the year while china s most developed cities like beijing and shenzhen are successfully transitioning to knowledge led economies the country s northern industrial regions are stagnating meanwhile while china s inland regions generally continue to grow more rapidly they are at greater risk of being hit by the government s continued debt derisking campaign because of their higher reliance on investment by the end of the year china is likely to surpass its record for corporate bond defaults that it set last year that the government continued its debt derisking campaign despite economic headwinds in 2019 is a positive for the long term sustainability of the chinese economy in the short term though it may continue to pose challenges for investors targeted economic policies introduced in place of widespread reforms in terms of practical economic reforms 2019 was a relatively quiet year in the face of domestic challenges party leadership prioritized ensuring political stability over experimenting with new reforms nevertheless while 2019 was not a marquee year for economic reforms the government still rolled out some notable new laws and policies the most significant of these is the foreign investment law which introduces a new legal framework for managing fdi in china the foreign investment law streamlines disparate laws and regulations governing foreign investment and adds additional protections including explicitly banning forced technology transfers while foreign investors are still waiting on additional guidelines and circulars to add more details to the law some are wary of vague language that may limit the law s protections the chinese government also introduced various new intellectual property protections in 2019 besides new protections included in the foreign investment law china released an updated trademark law which came into effect on november 1 the trademark law increases protections against bad faith trademark filings and punishment for infringement is now more severe additionally the chinese government sought to stimulate various local economies with the introduction of six new free trade zones ftzs while the last significant expansion of ftzs concentrated on opening up china s inland regions this round includes regions from all over the country jiangsu shandong hebei heilongjiang guangxi and yunnan in another bid to boost consumption and stimulate the economy the government also cut value added tax vat rates and increased the scope of vat deductions despite these various reforms 2019 did not boast any major changes such as the vat and transfer pricing reforms of previous years however the vat rates were lowered this year in a move that helped businesses amid a prolonged slowdown the lack of major reforms activity might be related to the trade war as the chinese government could be holding off until a deal with the us is reached many of the demands from the us side involve china adopting more market oriented policies which the chinese government could in turn use as concessions turning point for investors china s 2019 was defined by geopolitical challenges for foreign investors this has meant prolonged uncertainty and heightened risk exposure these tensions along with rising costs and slowing growth led many investors to take steps to diversify their exposure and relocate parts of their business to other asian markets including to vietnam indonesia and india the partial pivot away from china is however in large part due to natural market factors relating to china s heightened level of economic development and has been years in the making yet 2019 may eventually be looked back upon as a turning point for many foreign governments and businesses in determining how they interact with china in 2019 china s tensions increased not just with the us but several other countries including australia canada and some european states going into 2020 these geopolitical tensions show no signs of letting up regardless of whether a us china trade deal is finally signed the actions to be taken by chinese and foreign leaders will determine whether 2019 is remembered as the year when relations between china and the west permanently fell apart or as a low point in advance of a reconciliation
