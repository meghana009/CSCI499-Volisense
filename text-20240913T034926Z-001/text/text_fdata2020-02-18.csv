minutes of the february 4 monetary policy meeting of the rba members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting the international monetary fund s forecast for global growth to pick up in 2020 and 2021 the easing in trade tensions between the united states and china and ongoing stimulus delivered by central banks had supported a modest improvement in the growth outlook for a number of economies global manufacturing and trade indicators notably export orders had continued to show signs of stabilising in late 2019 inflation had remained low and below most central banks targets members also discussed the coronavirus outbreak which was a new source of uncertainty regarding the global outlook in china a range of activity indicators had picked up in the december quarter which suggested that targeted fiscal and monetary easing had been working to stabilise economic conditions in east asia the growth outlook had been supported by signs of a turnaround in the global electronics cycle and more stimulatory fiscal and monetary policies in some economies in the region on the other hand the outlook for output growth in india had been revised lower given the broad based slowing in economic activity there in major advanced economies indicators for manufacturing and services activity had ticked up slightly and tight labour markets had supported growth in consumption in the united states lower interest rates had supported a pick up in residential investment business investment intentions had stabilised japanese economic activity had slowed as expected following the increase in the consumption tax in october 2019 but the fiscal stimulus that had been announced was expected to support growth in the euro area survey indicators of conditions in the manufacturing sector appeared to have bottomed out but investment had remained weak the progress in addressing the us china trade and technology disputes had alleviated an important downside risk to global growth however given the nature of the phase one deal and the potential for tensions to re escalate this risk had not been eliminated members discussed the coronavirus outbreak noting that it was a new source of uncertainty for the global economy with the situation still evolving members observed that it was too early to determine the extent to which growth in china would be affected or the nature of the international spillovers it was noted that previous outbreaks of new viruses had had significant but short lived negative effects on economic growth in the economies at the centre of the outbreak members observed that it was difficult to know how representative these earlier episodes could be china now accounted for a much larger share of the global economy and was more closely integrated including with australia than in 2003 at the time of the sars outbreak the economic effects would depend crucially on the persistence of the outbreak and measures taken to contain its spread some commodity prices notably for industrial metals iron ore and oil had fallen on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak would disrupt production in china and reduce chinese commodity demand in the near term by contrast rural prices had been little changed domestic economic conditions the australian economy had grown modestly in the september quarter while growth in public demand and exports had been relatively strong growth in household spending and investment had remained weak the output of the farm sector had also subtracted from growth over the preceding year reflecting the effects of ongoing drought conditions members noted that the recent bushfires had devastated some regional communities and that this was expected to have reduced gdp growth over the december and march quarters the effects of the coronavirus outbreak were also expected to subtract from growth in exports over the first half of 2020 overall economic growth was expected to be weaker in the near term than had been forecast three months earlier partly because of the effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak however gdp growth was still expected to pick up over the forecast period supported by accommodative monetary policy a pick up in mining investment and recoveries in dwelling investment and consumption the recovery from the bushfires was expected to add to growth in the second half of 2020 the central forecast for growth remained unchanged since november at 2¾ per cent over 2020 and around 3 per cent over 2021 an increase in mining investment was expected in the near term and a turnaround in dwelling investment was likely to have occurred by the end of 2019 however the recovery in consumption was less certain and more consequential for overall demand there was also uncertainty around estimates of the effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak it was difficult to assess potential indirect effects on activity from these events and relevant data were yet to be published household consumption had been lower than expected in the september quarter despite strong growth in household disposable income supported by the receipt of tax offset payments and lower interest payments following the recent reductions in the cash rate information from the abs retail sales release and the bank s liaison program had suggested that retail sales volumes were likely to have grown only modestly in the december quarter although nominal retail sales had increased strongly in the month of november much of this increase was likely to have been purchases brought forward to take advantage of black friday sales measures of consumer sentiment had declined over recent months but consumers views on their personal financial situation which historically have had a stronger link to consumption had been little changed members noted that a number of factors had contributed to the slowdown in consumption growth since mid 2018 the downturn in the housing market had reduced households wealth and the extended period of weak growth in household income had probably lowered expectations of future income growth members observed that the prolonged period of slow growth in income was expected to continue to weigh on consumption over coming quarters furthermore recent data had suggested that households were directing more income to saving and reducing their debt looking ahead the bank s forecast was for growth in consumption to increase gradually sustained by moderate growth in household disposable income and the recovery in the housing market growth in housing prices had picked up in most capital cities and parts of regional australia over recent months prices had increased very strongly in sydney and melbourne in recent months higher housing prices and the associated increase in housing turnover were expected to support consumption and dwelling investment dwelling investment had continued to decline in the september quarter however and was expected to decline further in the near term nonetheless leading indicators were consistent with the forecast of a trough in dwelling investment towards the end of 2020 followed by a recovery through 2021 private residential building approvals had increased in the december quarter contacts in the bank s business liaison program had reported an increase in sales of new homes and greenfield land in recent months business investment declined in the september quarter with both mining and non mining investment weaker than expected as at november mining investment had been considerably lower because work on new liquefied natural gas plants had continued to wind down information from business liaison contacts and the recent abs capital expenditure survey continued to support the view that mining investment was passing through a trough non mining investment was expected to be subdued in the near term but then to increase modestly consistent with the expected pick up in domestic activity public investment had been stronger than expected in the september quarter and information from government budgets had suggested public spending would continue to support growth in the near term including through funding of initiatives for bushfire recovery and drought relief the unemployment rate had declined slightly to 5 1 per cent in december employment growth had moderated in the december quarter but had remained at 2 1 per cent over the year all the growth in the quarter had been in part time employment the bank s forecast of employment growth had been revised downwards for the first half of 2020 reflecting the overall signal from leading indicators and the downward revision to forecast gdp growth in the near term the unemployment rate was expected to remain in the 5 5¼ per cent range for some time before declining to around 4¾ per cent in 2021 as gdp and employment growth picked up members noted that the inflation data for the december quarter had been in line with expectations headline cpi inflation had been 0 6 per cent in the quarter and 1 8 per cent over 2019 trimmed mean inflation had been 0 4 per cent in the quarter and 1 6 per cent over 2019 housing inflation had continued to be a significant drag on overall inflation with little change in rents both in the quarter and over the year new dwelling prices had risen in the december quarter following earlier declines because smaller discounts had been offered by developers inflationary pressures were expected to remain subdued underlying and headline inflation were expected to increase a little to around 2 per cent over the following couple of years as spare capacity in the economy declined wages growth was expected to be largely unchanged over the following couple of years because mild upward pressure on growth in the wage price index would likely be offset by downward pressure from the increase in the superannuation guarantee from mid 2021 members noted that the risks around the wage and price inflation forecasts were evenly balanced wages growth could pick up faster than expected if labour market conditions tightened by more than expected the increase in the superannuation guarantee in 2021 was forecast to constrain wages growth for some wage earners although the timing and extent of this was uncertain and broader measures of earnings growth could be expected to be boosted a little domestic inflationary pressures would depend on a range of factors including how fast the economy recovered from the soft patch over the preceding year the persistence of the effect of the drought on food prices and developments in the housing market financial markets members noted that developments in global financial markets had reflected evolving perceptions of key risks up until mid january concerns over global downside risks had eased following stabilisation in a range of forward looking indicators of growth the passage of the phase one us china trade deal and improved prospects for an orderly brexit in response long term government bond yields and equity prices had risen the us dollar and japanese yen had depreciated a little while the chinese renminbi had appreciated there had also been renewed capital flows into emerging markets however since then these moves in financial markets had been partly reversed as market participants became concerned about the potential effect of the coronavirus on the prospects for global economic growth in particular government bond yields had declined noticeably to be back at very low levels in australia the 10 year government bond yield had declined in line with movements abroad to below 1 per cent also the us dollar and japanese yen had appreciated while the chinese renminbi had depreciated the australian dollar had also depreciated to be around its lowest level since 2009 overall global financial conditions remained accommodative in part because of ongoing stimulus delivered by central banks after some easing of monetary policies in 2019 central banks in the major advanced economies had indicated that their current policy settings were likely to remain appropriate for some time central banks in the united states europe and japan had recently left policy settings unchanged noting that some downside risks had receded for the time being however they had also signalled that they were prepared to ease policy further if necessary and markets were expecting some further easing in the united states the united kingdom and canada in the year ahead in china the central bank had recently implemented targeted measures to support economic growth including by providing additional liquidity to the financial system corporate financing conditions had generally remained favourable including in australia credit spreads were at low levels and global equity prices had been higher over recent months notwithstanding the volatility associated with the coronavirus outbreak members noted that equity market valuations were high relative to earnings in a number of economies which could be explained partly by low long term bond yields keeping overall discount rates low relative to history domestically the reductions in the cash rate in 2019 had seen bank funding costs and lending rates reach historic lows the major banks were estimated to be paying interest of 25 basis points or less on a little over one quarter of their deposit funding around 60 basis points of the 75 basis point reduction in the cash rate since mid 2019 had been passed through to standard variable mortgage rates however the actual rates that households were paying on their outstanding variable rate loans had declined by more than this with the average rate declining by almost 70 basis points over the same period this additional decline reflected strong competition among lenders for high quality borrowers and households continuing to switch from more expensive interest only loans if this were to continue by around mid 2020 the average rate paid on outstanding variable rate mortgages would have declined by around 75 basis points since may 2019 households total mortgage payments increased in the december quarter with a rise in principal and excess payments more than offsetting the decline in interest payments members discussed whether this increase reflected a change in behaviour by households and the potential for it to persist they noted that some households were likely to be repaying their debts faster in response to low growth of their incomes and the earlier fall in housing prices the process of balance sheet adjustment had been facilitated in part by the reductions in the cash rate as well as by the higher tax refunds for low and middle income earners both of which had boosted disposable incomes consistent with stronger conditions in some established housing markets housing loan commitments had continued to rise that had been driven largely by owner occupiers and growth in credit extended to owner occupiers had increased to 5½ per cent on a six months ended annualised basis in december despite accommodative funding conditions for large businesses growth in business debt had slowed over the six months to december financial market pricing at the time of the meeting suggested that market participants expected a further 25 basis point cut in the cash rate by mid 2020 before turning to the policy decision members reviewed the policy and academic discussions taking place around the world regarding the operation of macroeconomic policy and monetary policy frameworks in an environment where interest rates are low because of structural factors these discussions focused on a range of issues including the appropriate level and specification of inflation targets the cases for and against more aggressive monetary policy easing when policy interest rates are near the effective lower bound the role of forward guidance and strategies for lowering long term interest rates and their potential side effects and the role of fiscal policy members also reviewed the international discussions regarding possible changes in the monetary transmission mechanism at low interest rates considerations for monetary policy in considering the policy decision members observed that the outlook for the global economy remained reasonable with signs that the slowdown in global growth was coming to an end the progress in addressing the us china trade and technology disputes had reduced but not eliminated an important downside risk to global growth the coronavirus outbreak was a new source of uncertainty while it was too early to tell what the overall effect would be the outbreak presented a material near term risk to the economic outlook for china and for international trade flows and thereby the australian economy global financial conditions remained positive this partly owed to ongoing stimulus delivered by central banks and financial market participants expected some further monetary easing in some economies long term government bond yields were back at very low levels including in australia borrowing rates for households and businesses were at historically low levels and there was strong competition among lenders for borrowers of high credit quality conditions in some established housing markets had strengthened and mortgage loan commitments had also picked up the australian dollar had depreciated to be around its lowest level since 2009 the outlook for the australian economy was for growth to improve supported by a turnaround in mining investment and further out dwelling investment and consumption in the short term the effects of the bushfires were temporarily weighing on domestic growth but the recovery was likely to reverse the negative effects on gdp by the end of the year the forecast recovery in consumption growth remained a key uncertainty for the outlook consumption had been weak as households had been gradually adjusting their spending to the protracted period of slow growth in incomes and to the fall in housing prices although housing prices had been rebounding nationally it was too soon to see the response to this in household spending and it was unclear for how long the period of balance sheet adjustment would continue the unemployment rate had declined a little to 5 1 per cent and was expected to remain around this level for some time before declining further to a little below 5 per cent as economic growth picked up wages growth was expected to be largely unchanged over the following couple of years members agreed that a further gradual lift in wages growth would be a welcome development and was needed for inflation to be sustainably within the 2 3 per cent target range in the december quarter cpi inflation had been broadly as expected at 1 8 per cent over the year inflationary pressures had remained subdued held down by flat housing related costs inflation was expected to increase gradually to 2 per cent over the following couple of years in response to some tightening in labour market conditions given this outlook members considered how best to respond members reviewed the case for a further reduction in the cash rate at the present meeting this case rested largely on the only gradual progress towards the bank s inflation and unemployment goals lower interest rates could speed progress towards the bank s goals and make it more assured in the face of the current uncertainties in considering this case the board took into account that interest rates had already been reduced to a low level and that there are long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy the board also recognised that the incremental benefits of further interest rate reductions needed to be weighed against the risks associated with very low interest rates internationally concerns had been raised about the effect of very low interest rates on resource allocation in the economy and their effect on the confidence of some people in the community notably those reliant on savings to finance their consumption a further reduction in interest rates could also encourage additional borrowing at a time when there was already a strong upswing in the housing market the board concluded that the cash rate should be held steady at this meeting members agreed that it was reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates would be required in australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target the board would continue to monitor developments carefully including in the labour market and remained prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time the decision the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 0 75 per cent
overview apple s warning that it will miss q1 revenue due to the knock on effects of the coronavirus seemed to be a modest wake up call to investors who judging from the equity market were looking beyond equities have fallen and bonds have rallied japan hong kong and south korean stocks fell by more than 1 and only china and indonesia were able to post gains the msci asia pacific index fell for

opened above last friday s high after yesterday s holiday and has proceeded to sell off through last friday s lows a break below 50 80 would undermine the technical outlook asia pacific japan s 5 year bond auction was 4 4 times oversubscribed a little higher than last month s reception reports continue to point to strong foreign demand the demand for japanese government bonds though is not the same as the demand for yen dollar based investors for example can buy jgbs and hedge the yen back into dollars and thereby earn a yield that is comparable and often better than us treasuries japanese investors appear to like long dated jgbs which may be cheap relative to swaps or currency hedged european bonds the minutes from the february 4 meeting of the reserve bank of australia did reveal anything new to investors the coronavirus represents a near term material risk to the economy it reviewed the case for a rate cut after three cuts last year it judged that the risk of spurring more leveraging and house price increases offset the marginal benefits the central bank s framing of the issue offers important insight to businesses and investors between the adverse shocks from the wildfires and the coronavirus the market expected the trade offs to shift toward the middle of the year and allow for the rba to cut the cash rate to 50 bp some estimates suggest that china is operating at around half of what it was before the lunar new year however other reports looking at transportation data see this month s traffic at around 15 of the level seen last year the arrivals to hong kong in february have collapsed to about 3k a day a drop of 99 according to reports the australian dollar fell every week since the start of the year until last week when it rose by 0 6 the push

signal a test on jpy109 00 the dollar rose by about 0 35 against the chinese yuan to resurface above cny7 0 and reached its highest level cny7 0070 since february 4 europe the uk employment data was somewhat better than expected but could not lift the pall that hangs over sterling as harsh rhetoric by uk negotiator frost keeps the risk of a no deal exit from the standstill agreement at the end of

a significant decline in steel shipments in argentina operating income in 2019 decreased 1 2 billion year over year mainly due to 66 lower revenue per ton a 30 increase in operating cost per ton and a 440 000 ton decrease in shipments revenue per ton decreased in 2019 principally as a result of declining steel prices in ternium s north american markets in 2019 following a strong pricing environment in 2018 the increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 mainly reflected higher raw material and energy costs and higher depreciation of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower labor costs and maintenance expenses shipments in 2019 reflected a 240 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a softer commercial market in 2019 and a strong level of shipments in 2018 in anticipation of rising steel prices and a 363 000 ton decrease in the southern region mainly due to weaker steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 163 000 ton increase in other markets due to higher sales of slabs to third parties the company s net income in 2019 was 630 0 million compared to net income of 1 7 billion in 2018 the 1 0 billion year over year decrease was mainly due to lower

fourth quarter 2019 was 92 2 million with low operating margin and seasonally weak shipments operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 136 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 23 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 139 000 ton decrease in shipments including lower finished steel shipments and lower slab shipments to third parties steel revenue per ton decreased sequentially as it continued to reflect the lagged effect in contract pricing of a weak pricing environment in north america during the second half of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 290 5 million due mainly to an year over year 115 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 46 000 ton decrease in shipments partially offset by an 11 decrease in steel operating cost per ton revenue per ton decreased mainly as a result of lower steel prices in the nafta markets which turned from particularly strong during the second half of 2018 to remarkably weak during the same period in 2019 the year over year decrease in shipments was mainly the result of a 46 000 ton decrease in other markets principally on lower slab sales to third parties and a 21 000 ton decrease in the southern region partially offset by a 20 000 ton increase in mexico operating cost per ton decreased year over year in the fourth quarter 2019 mainly reflecting lower purchased slab and raw material costs lower maintenance expenses and lower labor costs the company s net income in the fourth quarter 2019 was 89 9 million compared to net income of 111 9 million in the third quarter 2019 net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 22 0 million mainly as a result of lower operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate relative to the prior year period net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 345 5 million due mainly to lower operating income and lower financial results partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the year over year decrease in financial results was principally due to the effect of the argentine peso s and mexican peso s fluctuation against the us dollar in the fourth quarter 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 change in the functional currency of ternium s argentine subsidiaries ternium s subsidiary ternium argentina has performed a review of its functional currency and has concluded that the currency that most faithfully represents the economics effects of the entity is the us dollar and therefore its functional currency has changed from the argentine peso to the us dollar this change is prospective from january 1 2020 and does not affect the balances at december 31 2019 nor results or cash flows for the year then ended annual dividend proposal ternium s board of directors proposed that an annual dividend of 0 12 per share 1 20 per ads or approximately 235 6 million in the aggregate be approved at the company s annual general shareholders meeting which is scheduled to be held on april 27 2020 if the annual dividend is approved at the shareholders meeting it will be paid on may 5 2020 with record date of april 30 2020 outlook following a challenging 2019 during which apparent steel consumption decreased in most markets in the americas steel demand in 2020 is expected to recover in brazil and colombia and to a lesser degree in the united states and mexico the company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in north america recently has come to an end ternium expects ebitda to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin mainly as a result of slightly lower costs with marginally improving steel market sentiment in mexico the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019 demand in mexico s industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement in addition the recent ratification by the usa of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca has reduced uncertainty which should help foster economic activity and investment in mexico in the years to come in argentina ternium expects shipments to seasonally decrease in the first quarter 2020 to levels similar to those in the first quarter 2019 the country s macroeconomic environment in 2020 will continue to be highly dependent on the normalization of the country s public debt situation steel market conditions for slab production at ternium s brazilian facility recently improved with an increase in seaborne slab prices and a decrease in raw material costs consequently the facility is bringing production back to normal levels after decreasing it last year to reduce overall costs analysis of full year 2019 results net income attributable to ternium s equity owners in 2019 was 564 3 million compared to 1 5

finance secretary arturo herrera is predicting that the economy will bounce back in 2020 after a gdp contraction of 0 1 last year in an interview with the news agency bloomberg herrera said that last year s recession was natural considering the decade of continual growth since the global financial crisis he also said that the contraction was in line with disappointing levels of growth around the world the secretary told bloomberg at the national palace in mexico city that there are various reasons for optimism in 2020 citing inflation and debt levels that are under control the stability of the peso and pemex s halting of an extended production decline but the main boost to the mexican economy is the pending ratification of the new north american free trade agreement the usmca he said mexico and the united states have already ratified the new pact but canada has not the mexican economy s performance is very different with this agreement herrera said this is one of the great advantages we have now the secretary said that companies that supply production chains may boost their investment in north america as a result of the certainty provided by the new pact a modified version of which was signed by mexico the united states and canada in december especially considering that competing countries in asia especially china are facing trade wars and a health crisis namely the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus in mainland china bloomberg noted that the secretariat of finance and public credit shcp which herrera heads has maintained its 2020 growth outlook at 2 even as economists have cut their forecasts to an average of just 1 compared to 1 7 six months ago the official who succeeded former finance secretary carlos urzúa last july declined to say whether the shcp will lower its outlook when it presents a preliminary budget proposal to congress in april with regard to interest rates cut to 7 by the bank of méxico last thursday herrera said that low inflation 3 24 in january and the stability of the peso currently 18 6 to the greenback mean that the central bank clearly has room to continue lowering borrowing costs i m not the only one saying it it s something that s said by the western hemisphere director of the international monetary fund he said the bank of méxico has cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point at each of its last five board meetings yet mexico still has one of the highest inflation adjusted interest rates in the world bloomberg said adding that analysts predict that the bank will lop another half point off this year to close 2020 with a 6 5 rate with regard to the exchange rate herrera said that the government is committed to a stable and flexible currency explaining that the government s fiscal responsibility and the relatively high interest rates were behind the strength of the peso which hit its highest intraday level against the us dollar in almost a year and a half on monday it s very risky for somebody to start playing with the exchange rate policy he said it has cost mexico a lot of work to understand this and we re very respectful source bloomberg en

reduction of working capital net debt position5 of 1 5 billion at the end of december 2019 with a net debt to last twelve months ebitda ratio of 1 0 ternium s operating income in 2019 was 864 6 million reflecting a more sustainable operating margin after an extraordinary year in 2018 with soft steel demand in mexico and a significant decline in steel shipments in argentina operating income in 2019 decreased 1 2 billion year over year mainly due to 66 lower revenue per ton a 30 increase in operating cost per ton and a 440 000 ton decrease in shipments revenue per ton decreased in 2019 principally as a result of declining steel prices in ternium s north american markets in 2019 following a strong pricing environment in 2018 the increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 mainly reflected higher raw material and energy costs and higher depreciation of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower labor costs and maintenance expenses shipments in 2019 reflected a 240 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a softer commercial market in 2019 and a strong level of shipments in 2018 in anticipation of rising steel prices and a 363 000 ton decrease in the southern region mainly due to weaker steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 163 000 ton increase in other markets due to higher sales of slabs to third parties the company s net income in 2019 was 630 0 million compared to net income of 1 7 billion in 2018 the 1 0 billion year over year decrease was mainly due to lower operating income partially offset by a lower income tax expense and

partially offset by lower effective tax rate free cash flow9 in the fourth quarter 2019 of 85 5 million after capital expenditures of 307 4 million ternium s operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 was 92 2 million with low operating margin and seasonally weak shipments operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 136 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 23 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 139 000 ton decrease in shipments including lower finished steel shipments and lower slab shipments to third parties steel revenue per ton decreased sequentially as it continued to reflect the lagged effect in contract pricing of a weak pricing environment in north america during the second half of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 290 5 million due mainly to an year over year 115 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 46 000 ton decrease in shipments partially offset by an 11 decrease in steel operating cost per ton revenue per ton decreased mainly as a result of lower steel prices in the nafta markets which turned from particularly strong during the second half of 2018 to remarkably weak during the same period in 2019 the year over year decrease in shipments was mainly the result of a 46 000 ton decrease in other markets principally on lower slab sales to third parties and a 21 000 ton decrease in the southern region partially offset by a 20 000 ton increase in mexico operating cost per ton decreased year over year in the fourth quarter 2019 mainly reflecting lower purchased slab and raw material costs lower maintenance expenses and lower labor costs the company s net income in the fourth quarter 2019 was 89 9 million compared to net income of 111 9 million in the third quarter 2019 net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 22 0 million mainly as a result of lower operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate relative to the prior year period net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 345 5 million due mainly to lower operating income and lower financial results partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the year over year decrease in financial results was principally due to the effect of the argentine peso s and mexican peso s fluctuation against the us dollar in the fourth quarter 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 change in the functional currency of ternium s argentine subsidiaries ternium s subsidiary ternium argentina has performed a review of its functional currency and has concluded that the currency that most faithfully represents the economics effects of the entity is the us dollar and therefore its functional currency has changed from the argentine peso to the us dollar this change is prospective from january 1 2020 and does not affect the balances at december 31 2019 nor results or cash flows for the year then ended annual dividend proposal ternium s board of directors proposed that an annual dividend of 0 12 per share 1 20 per ads or approximately 235 6 million in the aggregate be approved at the company s annual general shareholders meeting which is scheduled to be held on april 27 2020 if the annual dividend is approved at the shareholders meeting it will be paid on may 5 2020 with record date of april 30 2020 outlook following a challenging 2019 during which apparent steel consumption decreased in most markets in the americas steel demand in 2020 is expected to recover in brazil and colombia and to a lesser degree in the united states and mexico the company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in north america recently has come to an end ternium expects ebitda to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin mainly as a result of slightly lower costs with marginally improving steel market sentiment in mexico the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019 demand in mexico s industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement in addition the recent ratification by the usa of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca has reduced uncertainty which should help foster economic activity and investment in mexico in the years to come in argentina ternium expects shipments to seasonally decrease in the first quarter 2020 to levels similar to those in the first quarter 2019 the country s macroeconomic environment in 2020 will continue to be highly dependent on the normalization of the country s public debt situation steel market conditions for slab production at ternium s brazilian

440 000 ton decrease in shipments revenue per ton decreased in 2019 principally as a result of declining steel prices in ternium s north american markets in 2019 following a strong pricing environment in 2018 the increase in the steel segment s operating cost per ton6 mainly reflected higher raw material and energy costs and higher depreciation of property plant and equipment partially offset by lower labor costs and maintenance expenses shipments in 2019 reflected a 240 000 ton decrease in mexico mainly due to a softer commercial market in 2019 and a strong level of shipments in 2018 in anticipation of rising steel prices and a 363 000 ton decrease in the southern region mainly due to weaker steel demand in argentina partially offset by a 163 000 ton increase in other markets due to higher sales of slabs to third parties the company s net income in 2019 was 630 0 million compared to net income of 1 7 billion in 2018 the 1 0 billion year over year decrease was mainly due to lower

fourth quarter 2019 was 92 2 million with low operating margin and seasonally weak shipments operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 136 4 million sequentially mainly due to a 23 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 139 000 ton decrease in shipments including lower finished steel shipments and lower slab shipments to third parties steel revenue per ton decreased sequentially as it continued to reflect the lagged effect in contract pricing of a weak pricing environment in north america during the second half of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 the company s operating income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 290 5 million due mainly to an year over year 115 decrease in steel revenue per ton and a 46 000 ton decrease in shipments partially offset by an 11 decrease in steel operating cost per ton revenue per ton decreased mainly as a result of lower steel prices in the nafta markets which turned from particularly strong during the second half of 2018 to remarkably weak during the same period in 2019 the year over year decrease in shipments was mainly the result of a 46 000 ton decrease in other markets principally on lower slab sales to third parties and a 21 000 ton decrease in the southern region partially offset by a 20 000 ton increase in mexico operating cost per ton decreased year over year in the fourth quarter 2019 mainly reflecting lower purchased slab and raw material costs lower maintenance expenses and lower labor costs the company s net income in the fourth quarter 2019 was 89 9 million compared to net income of 111 9 million in the third quarter 2019 net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 22 0 million mainly as a result of lower operating income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate relative to the prior year period net income in the fourth quarter 2019 decreased 345 5 million due mainly to lower operating income and lower financial results partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the year over year decrease in financial results was principally due to the effect of the argentine peso s and mexican peso s fluctuation against the us dollar in the fourth quarter 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 change in the functional currency of ternium s argentine subsidiaries ternium s subsidiary ternium argentina has performed a review of its functional currency and has concluded that the currency that most faithfully represents the economics effects of the entity is the us dollar and therefore its functional currency has changed from the argentine peso to the us dollar this change is prospective from january 1 2020 and does not affect the balances at december 31 2019 nor results or cash flows for the year then ended annual dividend proposal ternium s board of directors proposed that an annual dividend of 0 12 per share 1 20 per ads or approximately 235 6 million in the aggregate be approved at the company s annual general shareholders meeting which is scheduled to be held on april 27 2020 if the annual dividend is approved at the shareholders meeting it will be paid on may 5 2020 with record date of april 30 2020 outlook following a challenging 2019 during which apparent steel consumption decreased in most markets in the americas steel demand in 2020 is expected to recover in brazil and colombia and to a lesser degree in the united states and mexico the company anticipates steel price volatility to decrease in 2020 as uncertainty caused by global and regional trade negotiations appears to have moderated after significant turbulence during the past two years and a prolonged steel inventory destocking in north america recently has come to an end ternium expects ebitda to increase in the first quarter 2020 compared to the fourth quarter 2019 with higher shipments and a recovery in steel margin mainly as a result of slightly lower costs with marginally improving steel market sentiment in mexico the company anticipates steel shipments in the country to increase in the first quarter of the year after a seasonally weak fourth quarter 2019 demand in mexico s industrial markets remains stable and public construction activity in the country is beginning to show some signs of improvement in addition the recent ratification by the usa of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca has reduced uncertainty which should help foster economic activity and investment in mexico in the years to come in argentina ternium expects shipments to seasonally decrease in the first quarter 2020 to levels similar to those in the first quarter 2019 the country s macroeconomic environment in 2020 will continue to be highly dependent on the normalization of the country s public debt situation steel market conditions for slab production at ternium s brazilian facility recently improved with an increase in seaborne slab prices and a decrease in raw material costs consequently the facility is bringing production back to

for 30 years sudan s economic development was stifled by president bashir and his cronies but as the transition to democracy progresses new opportunities are opening up tom collins reports from khartoum the monte carlo recreational club in downtown khartoum sits as a faded reminder of sudan s forgotten past the unused gym and swimming pool show the signs of former use while the courtyard restaurant functions as an impromptu office for the club s owner adil gabir abo elizz a businessman elizz recounts what the past 30 years were like for those not aligned to the regime of president omar al bashir who came to power in a 1989 coup and fell in last year s revolution my father started three businesses in 1959 tanneries contracting and some carpentry and steelwork workshops he says our main business was contracting before 1989 we used to get 60 of the tenders we were one of the biggest contracting companies in the past 30 years we haven t got a single tender along with dragging sudan into 60bn of external debt and crippling the local currency bashir obliterated the country s free market through the creation of a parallel economy that unfairly favoured the regime and its cronies especially military and security entities while easily exploitable sectors like livestock and gold mining were turned into government cash cows those on the sidelines avoided government interference by investing in riskier sectors or abroad in places like egypt and the uae it was very tough from the beginning we always had to avoid being in competition with any of the politicians says amin nefeidi group president of elnefeidi group one of sudan s largest conglomerates they tried their best but they couldn t make it in transportation it is one of those tough businesses where you need to closely monitor trucks travelling all over sudan the elnefeidi group now runs a fleet of well over 1 000 lorries extending into central africa from bases in cameroon and tanzania it made its name transporting humanitarian aid for the united nations world food programme to places like darfur and neighbouring ethiopia under the marxist derg while most businessmen kept a relatively low profile during the period many look forward to opportunities in a new sudan osama abdo the new head of sudan s business federation once dominated by bashir allies told african business this is our first step towards free competition and transparent fair and free trade overcoming the barriers to a revitalised economy yet while the country s prime minister abdalla hamdok who came to power with the support of the civilian elements on the country s interim sovereign council has had an encouraging start the barriers to revitalising the economy are many hamdok says the government needs up to 8bn in external aid over the next two years to cover the huge import bill and an immediate cash injection of 2bn to slow down the depreciation of the sudanese pound this year s budget which has an estimated overall deficit of 1 62bn was financed by the friends of sudan a group providing political and economic assistance including the us france germany britain ethiopia saudi arabia and egypt however sudan remains on the us state department s state sponsors of terrorism sst list which means the us opposes financial institutions such as the international monetary fund imf agreeing bailouts and reform packages with the government making them effectively impossible us restrictions also apply to commercial banks thwarting any hope the country might have of attracting foreign direct investment fdi as companies are unable to repatriate their earnings to avoid what amounts to continuing sanctions much of sudan s international commerce takes place in secondary hubs like dubai pushing up domestic inflation as imported goods bear added costs sanctions continue to bite in early december the prime minister returned from washington after unsuccessfully lobbying the us to remove sudan from the list the negotiations which began under the previous regime have focused on five tracks including counterterrorism measures ending interference in south sudan and allowing humanitarian groups to access conflict zones within sudan while it is generally thought that hamdok s efforts will eventually bear fruit washington has voiced concerns over the continued presence of terrorist groups and the ongoing influence of sudan s military and paramilitary forces during the transition to democracy us courts have demanded billions of dollars in compensation from the government for the suspected involvement of sudanese nationals in the bombing of the uss cole in 2000 and the 1998 nairobi and dar es salaam embassy bombings it s of course unfair says mohamed nagy alassam from the sudanese professionals association spa a civil society organisation that acted as a key driver of the revolution the sudanese people were the main victims of the past regime so it s unfair to ask us to pay for their crimes parallel economy persists despite washington s concerns some believe that sudan is headed towards a more secular future during the revolution a broad coalition of civil society activists communists women and youth came together in an alliance known as the forces for freedom and change ffc the ffc played a major role in the overthrow of bashir and is now represented on the sovereign council which plays the role of head of state during the political transition bashir s national congress party an islamist party has been dissolved and its assets seized but dismantling the security and military apparatus may prove much harder as a result the parallel economy is yet to be dismantled and military companies continue to operate outside the free market dissolved enterprises formerly belonging to the intelligence services are even being transferred to the military rather than the government for me this is a serious source of concern because the military has its own budget they could become a state within a state start to exercise influence entrench their position and sabotage the democratic process itself says mohamed osman general manager of inmaa for poultry and feed sudan s leading poultry company subsidies burden economy apart from fears about the military and the islamists a major donor concern is the burden placed on the economy by subsidies despite the imf encouraging bold and comprehensive decisions the sudanese government backtracked from removing fuel subsidies in the 2020 budget after fierce protests from the spa and the ffc in one of the world s poorest countries the government is hesitant to undertake reforms that will hit those already suffering the hardest cuts to wheat subsidies in december 2018 and the resultant spike in the price of bread sparked the protests that ultimately led to the downfall of bashir s government lifting subsidies without improving the livelihood of the people will lead to turmoil and people taking to the streets says osman demanding that the current government lift subsidies without looking at the consequences is not sensible you need to do it over time and ensure that the government finds other sources of income huge opportunities governance issues aside sudan remains a country rich in minerals and although mostly desert it is nonetheless well endowed with fertile land livestock accounts for a quarter of exports according to the world bank much of this to import hungry gulf countries like qatar saudi arabia and the uae investing in the sector along with other export led forms of agriculture is an obvious way to tackle the debilitating dollar shortage that was made worse when khartoum lost three quarters of its oil revenue after the independence of south sudan in 2011 being able to transport chilled chicken in less than 24 hours to urban centres like riyadh gives sudan great export potential says osman another key sector which has already undergone positive regulatory changes is gold previously sudan s central bank was the only entity legally allowed to buy and export it because the law enabled the bank to buy it at a heavy discount to the international price smuggling became rife and the state lost out on the proceeds regime figures had interests in the trade a company owned by the leader of the government s rapid support forces mohammed hamdan hemedti dagalo was flying gold bars worth millions of dollars to dubai in 2018 as the regime imploded according to a reuters investigation regulations that came into force on 1 january now allow the private sector to export gold and the central bank has said it will stop purchasing the precious commodity entirely although sudan is currently the third largest gold producer in africa after ghana and south africa the relatively underdeveloped sector promises much more if properly exploited ammar hassan abdalah a small scale gold miner based in khartoum says the current industry has only scratched the surface it is a new era for gold in sudan there are not many companies that are operating on an industrial level most people are digging with manual tools for artisanal mining if the government can attract foreign companies who have the necessary capital to modernise sudan s gold industry the sector could act as a source of wealth for the entire country looking forward to the promise of a new era after 30 years of dereliction the owner of the monte carlo club is eagerly awaiting the promise of a new era reopening long closed factories as well as a trading company that deals in cement and steel elizz is cautiously banking on sudan s successful transition to democracy if this revolution fails then it will be a big disaster for the surrounding region and africa he warns the international community has to support sudan
by china s economy is often presented as a powerful engine this is however only one face of it it has also been marked by vulnerabilities and these have become more obvious over time as the costs of high speed growth have rebounded on the country giving rise to social tensions that are straining the capacity of the reigning communist party to contain them uneven development among regions has been one of legacies of the chinese road to capitalism with most of the benefits of growth being cornered by the eastern and southeastern coastal region that led the integration of china into the global economy while the growth of income disparities has slowed overtime it continues with the inland provinces particularly in northwestern and southwestern china lagging behind guangdong jiangsu and zhejiang the powerhouses of china s export led industrialization the inland provinces continue to supply cheap labor to china s gold coast where migrants endure legalized discrimination owing to the hukou residential system that prevents them from enjoying housing and social security benefits in the areas where they work overcapacity stalks industry china is meanwhile burdened with an overcapacity problem especially in heavy industry and many medium industries there has been significant overcapacity in the steel iron aluminum and automobile industries leading to practically flat prices and causing some analysts to say that china is now suffering from industrial deflation since china accounts for a great part of global production and trade in heavy goods its surpluses in these goods have brought down global prices contributing to global deflationary pressures overcapacity is a symptom of overproduction and overaccumulation and it is a product of the chinese way of capitalism specifically it is due to repression of domestic consumption and excessive investment repression of consumption was a policy dictated by the need to channel people s savings to the industrial export sector excessive investment stemmed from the decentralized economic strategy where local areas were given a great deal of autonomy in investment decisions many local authorities says ho fung hung perhaps the leading expert in china s overproduction act developmentally that is they pick industrial winners and act proactively to set these up at the local level the sum of these efforts however produces anarchic competition among localities resulting in uncoordinated construction of redundant production capacity and infrastructure as early as the 2000s in fact more than 75 percent of the country s industries were already suffering from overcapacity and fixed asset investment in industries already experiencing overinvestment accounted for 40 to 50 per cent of china s gdp growth the situation however has worsened since then with state media admitting that 21 industries suffer from serious overcapacity including steel aluminum cement shipbuilding power generation heavy engineering solar panels wind turbines construction machinery chemicals textiles paper glass shipping and oil refining for instance since 2014 china has produced more than half of all the steel in the world but of the 1 1 billion tons of steel chinese factories were capable of making in 2015 only 70 percent was actually produced that year more than half of china s steel companies posted a loss and prices were driven so low that as one account observed steel was cheaper than cabbage as was the popular observation at the time to solve the overcapacity problem china has tried to shut down the less efficient enterprises and rationalize the remainder this is however easier said than done because officials are scared to death of provoking worker unrest since the ability to maintain social stability is one of the key justifications used by the communist party for its continued political dominance moreover shutting down enterprises may be demanded from the center but it is the local authorities that have to deal with the consequences and so the natural response of the latter is to resist the end result is that keeping zombies which are mainly state owned enterprises soes alive has been extremely costly overcapacity brings down prices bringing down profits throughout an industry indebtedness becomes a permanent condition so that one can speak of a permanent line of credit to banks which is never repaid calculations of the levels of debt of the public and private corporate sector in china are not easy to come by but china s companies went from owing 3 4 trillion to 12 5 trillion between 2007 and mid 2014 a faster buildup of debt than in any other country in modern times as a mckinsey report points out finance the economy s achilles heel massive indebtedness mainly to chinese state banks clearly poses a threat to the economy but china is no ordinary capitalist economy under normal capitalism when loans are nonperforming the banks come calling on the debtor and either collect or force them into bankruptcy but in china the fact that the state enterprises and the banks are all owned by the government places the day of reckoning far into the future as dinny mcmahon writes the real advantage of china s system of state ownership isn t that the cleanup is easier than in market economies it s that the clean up is easier to put off sure bank profits erode after all a big chunk of their loans aren t paying interest but otherwise no one has to take responsibility for mounting bad loans and most importantly deadbeat companies are kept alive but though put off indefinitely the day of reckoning will arrive and it has perhaps been advanced by the negative synergy between the mountain of debt owed by the soes and the other vulnerabilities of china s financial system a real estate bubble a roller coaster stock market and an uncontrolled shadow banking system there is no doubt that china is already in the midst of a real estate bubble as in the united states during the subprime mortgage bubble that culminated in the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 the real estate market has attracted too many wealthy and middle class speculators leading to a frenzy that has seen real estate prices climb sharply chinese real estate prices soared in so called tier 1 cities like beijing and shanghai from 2015 to 2017 pushing worried authorities there to take measures to pop the bubble major cities including beijing imposed various measures they increased down payment requirements tightened mortgage restrictions banned the resale of property for several years and limited the number of homes that people could buy however chinese authorities face a dilemma on the one hand workers complain that the bubble has placed owning and renting apartments beyond their reach thus fueling social instability on the other hand a sharp drop in real estate prices could bring down the rest of the chinese economy and given china s increasingly central role as a source of international demand the rest of the global economy along with it china s real estate sector accounts for an estimated 15 percent of gdp and 20 percent of the national demand for loans thus as pointed out by banking experts andrew sheng and ng chow soon any slowdown would adversely affect construction related industries along the entire supply chain including steel cement and other building materials the problem is not just a real estate market slowdown having a domino effect on the rest of the economy owing to reduced demand it is also that so many other industrial sectors are heavily invested in real estate because of reduced profitability in the real economy owing to overcapacity more and more manufacturing companies have started to subsidize their losses by investing in real estate or financial speculation financial repression keeping the interest rates on deposits low to subsidize china s powerful alliance of export industries and governments in the coastal provinces has been central in pushing investors into real estate speculation however growing uncertainties in that sector have caused many middle class and rich investors to seek higher returns in the country s poorly regulated stock market the unfortunate result a good many chinese have lost their fortunes as stock prices fluctuate wildly as early as 2001 wu jinglian widely regarded as one of the country s leading reform economists characterized the corruption ridden shanghai and shenzhen stock exchanges as worse than a casino in which investors would inevitably lose money over the long run at the peak of the shanghai market in june 2015 a bloomberg analyst wrote that no other stock market has grown as much in dollar terms over a 12 month period noting that the previous year s gain was greater than the 5 trillion size of japan s entire stock market when the shanghai index plunged 40 percent later that summer chinese investors were hit with huge losses debt they still grapple with today many lost all their savings a significant personal tragedy and a looming national crisis in a country with such a poorly developed social security system another source of financial instability is the virtual monopoly on credit access held by export oriented industries state owned enterprises and the local governments of favored coastal regions with a significant part of the demand for credit from a multitude of private companies unmet by the official banking sector the void has been rapidly filled by so called shadow banks informal institutions of credit that are unregulated the shadow banking system in china is not yet as sophisticated as its counterparts on wall street and in london but it is getting there ballpark estimates of the trades carried out in china s shadow banking sector range from 10 trillion to more than 18 trillion in 2013 according to one of the more authoritative studies the scale of shadow banking risk assets i e assets marked by great volatility like stocks and real estate came to 53 percent of china s gdp that might appear small when compared with the global average of about 120 percent of gdp but the reality is that many of these shadow banking creditors have raised their capital by borrowing from the formal banking sector these loans are either registered on the books or hidden in special off balance sheet vehicles should a shadow banking crisis ensue it is estimated that up to half of the nonperforming loans of the shadow banking sector could be transferred to the formal banking sector thus undermining it as well in addition the shadow banking sector is heavily invested in real estate trusts thus a sharp drop in property valuations would immediately have a negative impact on the shadow banking sector creditors would be left running after bankrupt developers or holding massively depreciated real estate as collateral finance is the achilles heel of the chinese economy the negative synergy between an overheating real estate sector a volatile stock market and an uncontrolled shadow banking system could well be the cause of the next big crisis to hit the global economy rivaling the severity of the asian financial crisis of 1997 1998 and the global financial implosion of 2008 2009 environmental wasteland not surprisingly china s infrastructure intensive smoke stack industries dependent high speed growth has been accompanied by widespread and chronic environmental crises with perhaps the dangerous air pollution levels in beijing being the most widely discussed internationally water scarcity desertification deforestation soil erosion and degradation and soil and water contamination have all contributed to a greater concern about the environment especially among the middle class yet that same middle class is the source of much of the problem reliance on fossil fuels contributes significantly to air pollution and climate change prosperity has made china the world s biggest car market with the consequent rise in unhealthy levels of airborne pollution in the cities owing to its price competitiveness coal the dirtiest fossil fuel continues to be the fuel of choice for generating power accounting for 65 percent of electricity use apart from their massive negative impact on the environment and public health fossil fuel driven industrial processes have increasingly boomeranged on the economy economists have estimated that environmental degradation and pollution cost the chinese economy the equivalent of 3 to 10 percent of gdp owing to work days missed crops lost to pollution and contamination decline in tourism and other problems a recently published retrospective analysis by the chinese academy of sciences placed the figure higher at 13 5 percent of gdp in 2005 from relative equality to gross inequality china s breakneck capitalist growth relying on cheap labor has had two contradictory effects on the socioeconomic conditions of its people on the one hand people living in poverty declined from 88 percent in 1988 to 2 or 3 percent at present on the other hand it has converted china from one of the world s most egalitarian societies during the mao period to one of the world s most unequal societies research by branco milanovic one of the world s leading experts on inequality shows that in the period 1988 to 2008 income inequality in china rose far more rapidly than in any other region in the world estimates of china s gini index or gini coefficient the most commonly used measure of inequality range from 0 47 the government s estimate to 0 55 the government figure it has been pointed out would make china s income inequality substantially greater than is the case in all developed countries class related inequality has recently been joined by gender related inequality as a great source of concern ironically as china has become more prosperous the gap has increased between women s incomes and economic status and those of men with the headlong rush towards capitalism the earnings of women went down from 80 per cent those of men at the start of the reform era to 67 percent in the cities and 56 percent in the countryside the drivers of this regression from the status of women during the mao period are a greying population and the demographic imbalance produced by the controversial one child policy when male children were favored over females resulting in widespread abortion and infanticide gender is now one of the most important factors determining income inequality in china perhaps more so than even the longstanding divide between the cities and the countryside what is alarming is that discrimination against women is now accepted if not promoted by the country s leadership mao famously told women that they held up half the sky and despite turmoil and the persistence of patriarchal traditions they entered the wor force in record numbers and began to enjoy greater rights now in a break with the marxist ambition of liberating women president xi has openly called on women to embrace their unique role in the family and shoulder the responsibilities of taking care of the old and young as well as educating children no party leader would have been caught saying something like this in the past but the breaking of the taboo apparently stems from the male party leadership s push to raise the birth rate owing to its obsession with china s looming demographic crisis china s rapid growth has produced prosperity and reduced poverty it has also generated less wholesome economic social and ecological consequences which are now catching up with it making the much vaunted chinese model increasingly less attractive for developing economies this series is based on the recently published study by focus on the global south titled china an imperial power in the image of the west on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the people s republic of china this year

skepticism abounds over whether the nearly 3 trillion indian economy is growing fast enough to reach prime minister narendra modi s gdp target of 5 trillion by 2024 2025 but signs suggest that economic activity may have bottomed out and foreign institutional investors are placing big bets on india s infrastructure sector according to participants in a panel discussion at the recent wharton india economic forum held in mumbai foreign investors are attracted to butterflies or cash flow generating assets like existing airports to operate and use as a cushion to invest in greenfield projects the panelists said they are optimistic also because of improved transparency in governance of projects auction systems for allocation of licensing for public resources the existence of a top tier of well managed private companies and other market mechanisms such as the creation of funding platforms for infrastructure they noted in order to reach its gdp goal of 5 trillion india s economy will need to grow at a sustained rate of 9 over the next five years according to c rangarajan former governor of the reserve bank of india the country s central bank the international monetary fund imf on january 20 sharply revised downward india s growth forecast by 130 basis points to 4 8 for 2019 2020 in its world economic outlook update imf chief economist gita gopinath said growth in india slowed sharply owing to stress in the non bank financial sector and weak rural income growth three metrics that matter at some level the growth rate is an irrelevant number said alok kshirsagar senior partner at consulting firm mckinsey who leads its risk practice in asia he noted that we obsess about the growth rate and listed three metrics that matter the first is the pace of private and public investment particularly investment in terms of actual capital expenditure and capital formation the second is the pace of growth in new income and job opportunities such as the employment created by e commerce platforms in food delivery or taxi hailing he said the third is the growth in per capita income which is rising according to government data the major challenge india faces is concerns net new investment which has been depressed because liquidity challenges at banks have limited credit offtake according to kshirsagar has prevented a large part of the engines of the economy such as the small and medium enterprises sector and the supply chains from growing and caused them to freeze up over the last two or three years he said much of the pain caused by such liquidity challenges is self inflicted said kshirsagar i look at this as corporate india driving itself into a ditch about a year ago everyone persuaded themselves that the sky was about to fall according to him while a few non banking finance companies had some deep rooted issues because they engaged in corrupt practices and fraud the problem was blown out of proportion we have taken what could have been an isolated set of issues associated with five or six institutions a bank an nbfc a mutual fund and a couple of real estate development companies and made it an economy wide problem kshirsagar said we have to get our confidence back because we got ourselves into this ditch we have to jump out of it the indian government is trying to make financing available for infrastructure projects one is the creation of the national investment and infrastructure fund with investors such as the abu dhabi investment authority temasek of singapore and the hdfc group the government has also announced rs 100 trillion 1 4 trillion in infrastructure projects covering the power railways urban irrigation mobility education and health sectors efforts to sell stressed assets of india s public sector banks and divest government holdings in state owned corporations are other encouraging signs in the latest union budget that was presented three weeks after the wief conference the government set a disinvestment target of 2 1 trillion by 2021 we have to get our confidence back because we got ourselves into this ditch we have to jump out of it alok kshirsagar india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman recently claimed that the economy is returning to a sound footing with seven key green shoots that are clearly visible including foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment trends industrial production and the purchasing managers index a day later two indicators dampened that enthusiasm retail prices rose to 7 6 in january rising to its highest since 2014 and industrial output shrank by 0 3 in december 2019 growing optimism encouraging signs are visible are visible at toll plazas and tax collections that reflect activity in the informal and formal sectors respectively said shailesh pathak ceo of l t infrastructure development projects ltd l t idpl the chennai based infrastructure development subsidiary of engineering and construction services company larsen toubro he noted that gst goods and services tax collections in november 2019 were up 6 and crossed rs 103 000 crore 14 4 billion reversing two quarters of negative growth according to government data they have since crossed rs 110 000 crore 15 4 billion as of january 2020 according to government data the true number that matters for the formal economy is gst collections he said numbers don t have ideology toll plazas offer a sense of the informal economy noted pathak whose company operates 33 toll plazas across the country from the end of october onwards the traffic numbers reveal that the worst is behind us he said he noted that the formal corporate sector accounts for barely 14 of the indian economy and that most of india s economic activity happens in the informal sector across its toll plazas l t idpl collects about a million dollars each day pathak noted of that digital toll collections have grown from 2 in november 2016 to 64 as of early january 2020 he said this is not counted in gdp but it has removed queues from toll plazas in our projects there are 540 toll plazas in the country can you estimate the savings in those toll plaza queues in diesel congestion and the waste of time more and more of the informal sector is finding its way into gdp calculations thanks to simplified tax regimes and a push towards greater compliance for a long time the business model for many of these informal businesses was tax evasion said pathak that s not a sustainable business model all that will doubtless boost india s macroeconomic performance said pathak whatever the gdp growth rate is next year by 2024 2025 it will definitely be 300 basis points more than that he predicted he noted that india overtook the u k economy in terms of gdp size last year and said it would surpass germany and japan by 2029 speeding up growth after india won independence it took 60 years to get to the first trillion dollars said sujay bose ceo of the national infrastructure investment fund the next trillion took 10 years and then from 2 trillion to 2 9 trillion took roughly three years now in five years to do 2 trillion more is not out of whack it can be done bose pointed out that the decade between 2005 and 2015 saw almost a trillion dollars of investments in infrastructure projects in the country the second trillion faster if you do things the right way he said india is already moving up the leagues in some infrastructure segments bose noted for example over the next few years the four largest global metro footprints will include three in china and in india the fourth will be in tokyo edging out london and new york city if we can achieve that kind of directional investment in infrastructure it becomes a key leg of the gdp growth to 5 trillion pathak said he thinks better days are ahead for india s infrastructure sector also because the abuses of the public private partnership ppp model in past years have declined and the government is coming down heavily on errant actors in india ppps became ttts or taxpayer to tycoon transfers he said in such ppps an infrastructure project would be gold plated with inflated costs that banks would fund enabling private sector participants to take out their equity even before commercialization he explained obviously when you run a 1 000 infrastructure project at a capitalized value of 2 000 you are not going to make money he explained however if after completion the project does generate positive cash flows and makes profits the private sector partners would stick with it he noted if it doesn t walk away the banks carry the can many of those ppp excesses occurred between 2006 and 2012 saddling public sector banks with nonperforming assets that are hobbling them till date pathak said since the government is reluctant to let public sector banks go under it recapitalizes them with taxpayer money he noted that is not a sustainable business model bose expected the ppp concept to re emerge in a different way with all the lessons that we have learnt from the previous decade pathak offered an alternative and sustainable way to operate infrastructure projects build them using government money and once it s a cash flow yielding asset hand them over to the private sector to operate them mumbai and new delhi airports are prime examples of private sector companies taking over operations after they were built with public funds and they also make way for construction of additional terminals he noted butterflies and caterpillars under construction public funded infrastructure projects are caterpillars and those handed over to the private sector for operations are butterflies said pathak caterpillars are ugly to look at and full of risk butterflies are lovely cash flow yielding assets for the next 30 years the upshot of that according to him is that butterflies will attract international funding because they have secure cash flows in sight while caterpillars will find it hard to raise such capital a second terminal at mumbai s international airport is a butterfly since it is built by private sector partner gvk power and infrastructure but the same company s winning bid to build a greenfield airport in navi mumbai will find it challenging to attract international capital he added butterflies are clearly in demand as recent deals show last october niif and its partners abu dhabi investment authority and canada s psp investments signed a deal to acquire an equity stake of 26 3 each in the gvk group s holding company that owns mumbai international airport for a total value of 1 billion pathak revealed that the canada pension plan investment board canada s largest pension fund which last september bought a 51 controlling stake in l t infrastructure development projects is very clearly looking at butterflies for its india investments caterpillars are ugly to look at and full of risk butterflies are lovely cash flow yielding assets for the next 30 years shailesh pathak he said the government could open similar butterfly opportunities for investors in assets with existing cash flows such as railway stations if you have a footfall of 300 000 in a railway station of course there is money to be made the private sector would be happy to take it over on that note he pointed out that a competition is underway between many indian cities to build their own metros and that in the next 10 years at least 25 indian cities will have state of the art metro systems as it happens greenfield caterpillar projects are also attracting international investors the niif combine with abu dhabi investment authority and canada s psp investments a pension investments manager will also get the rights to build the navi mumbai airport niif s other partner zurich airport international ag of switzerland recently won the concession to build a second airport at jewar near new delhi the zurich airport group had in 2016 sold its stake in bengaluru s international airport to fairfax group of canada we are actually able to get really serious high quality capital into greenfield projects said bose this is a turning point in the infrastructure development picture in india investing in infrastructure kshirsagar pointed to a few aspects that make india s infrastructure projects more attractive to international investors than they were in the past first the presence of large professionally run companies such as l t infrastructure development projects and the emergence of niif as major funding platform is fundamentally changing the infrastructure market increasing transparency in governance and the use of auctions to allocate public resources have made it easier to attract international equity capital he said as a fundamental premise of resource allocation a huge change as occurred in the last five or six years as a way of allocating resources when you look back 20 years from now it will be a very important development to encourage more professional capital to avoid the gold plating and the tycoons corruption and political corruption the push towards asset monetization at public sector organizations such as the planned divestment at the state owned logistics company concor is driving a lot of excitement from all the major global sovereign funds and global infrastructure investment funds to participate in that he added there is an important virtuous cycle occurring where the government is under pressure to do asset monetization international capital is looking for butterflies and you now have platforms and vehicles such as the niif through which to do that i am optimistic about the combination of the market mechanism and asset monetization with a more transparent project pipeline to encourage equity capital role of state and city governments while most attention is focused on the central government india s state and city governments play an under appreciated but crucial role in ensuring the success of infrastructure projects the panelists noted kshirsagar pointed out that more than half of tax revenues in india are controlled by states historically when state run corporations were run well they had an enormous role to play he said for example the tamil nadu industrial development corporation or the maharashtra industrial development corporation played an important role in land allocation and creating the ecosystems in their respective states in the 1950s 1960s and the 1970s he said however decay has set in over the years at several state owned corporations unfortunately most of them have in in the last 10 or 15 years have become huge sources of corruption and sweetheart deals and there has been an atrophying of their capabilities kshirsagar said new structures such as special purpose vehicles spvs to implement infrastructure projects have helped and they are enabling many private sector companies to participate in smart city projects including smart metering water treatment and sewage treatment that would simply have not been possible earlier he added collectively we need to raise that bar on by using spvs and other structures to encourage more private sector participation read what the economists say but focus on what investors are doing sujoy bose according to pathak city governments represent an even bigger risk than state governments in infrastructure projects the way the state operates in india the city is a subservient body so there is no champion for the city called mumbai it is the chief minister of maharashtra who s running mumbai it is the chief minister of karnataka who is running bangalore this is not going to work another risk for investors in infrastructure projects relates to the enforcement of contracts pathak said if contracts cannot be enforced they will lead to time and cost overruns in projects he cautioned in singapore if i give a check and it bounces i go to jail in india if my check bounces it is the start of negotiations because nobody wants to go to court according to bose growing aspirations among indian citizens for development and the unrelenting pace of urbanization will drive a bottom up push for infrastructure projects looking beyond the numbers kshirsagar reiterated that gdp growth numbers are irrelevant in response to a member of the audience who pointed to a harvard research paper last year by india s former chief economic advisor arvind subramanian in that paper subramanian contended that between 2014 and 2018 india s gdp had been overstated by 2 5 percentage points against official estimates of 7 india s gdp growth was no more than 4 5 he had argued what is powerful about arvind s paper is it looks at the underlying drivers of consumption and investment and it did show that they were not growing kshirsagar said but since then corrective mechanisms have been put in place such as with auctions of public resources more transparent contract allocation and greater accountability he added reforms such as the introduction of the gst regime to unify the multiple taxes that prevailed earlier are important and positive structural changes even if they were poorly executed he added gdp growth numbers represent the overall picture but it is important to look for those that perform better than the average such as states such as chhattisgarh and parts of madhya pradesh that have done better than the industrial powerhouses of the past including maharashtra tamil nadu and karnataka he said the same is true for companies where a select few high performers that are better governed will be able to take advantage of opportunities that transparent market mechanisms make available forget the averages just look at where the growth is bose had advice for those about to start their careers or those who are in the early stages of their careers read what the economists say but focus on what investors are doing the largest and savviest investors in the world are allocating more and more of their capital to one infrastructure and two to india forty percent of the largest investors in the world are saying that their top allocation of exposure is going to be for the infrastructure sector and almost all the large institutional investors who operate outside the oecd countries have india as one of the top destinations of capital

moody s expresses concern over nigeria other west african countries debts obinna chima the international monetary fund imf has revised downward its 2020 gross domestic product gdp forecast for nigeria to two per cent from the 2 5 per cent it had predicted earlier this is as on ne of the leading global rating agencies moody s investors service yesterday noted that government debt burdens in nigeria and other economic community of west african states ecowas countries have risen significantly according to imf the cut reflects the impact of lower international oil prices while inflation in the country is expected to pick up in addition it predicted that deteriorating terms of trade and capital outflows will weaken the country s external position the washington based institution stated this in its article iv consultation on nigeria which saw some of its officials visiting lagos and abuja between january 29 february 12 2020 for discussions on nigeria s economy the imf team was led by the senior resident representative and mission chief for nigeria amine mati the statement signed by mati at the end of the visit was posted yesterday on the fund s website mati said external vulnerabilities in the country were increasing reflecting a higher current account deficit and declining reserves that remain highly vulnerable to capital flow reversals the exchange rate has remained stable helped by steady sales of foreign exchange in various windows high fiscal deficits are complicating monetary policy weak non oil revenue mobilisation led to further deterioration of the fiscal deficit which was mostly financed by cbn overdrafts the interest payments to revenue ratio remains high at about 60 per cent under current policies the outlook is challenging the mission s growth forecast for 2020 was revised down to two per cent to reflect the impact of lower international oil prices inflation is expected to pick up while deteriorating terms of trade and capital outflows will weaken the country s external position he said however mati noted that policymakers in the country have recognised the vulnerabilities which led to a number of initiatives that had been introduced the authorities have taken a number of welcome steps these include measures to boost revenue through the adoption of the finance bill and deep offshore basin act and improve budget execution by adopting the 2020 budget by end december 2019 the tightening of monetary policy in january 2020 through higher cash reserve requirements to respond to looming inflationary pressures is welcome progress on structural reforms particularly in doing business finalising power sector reforms and strengthening governance is commendable major policy adjustments remain necessary to contain short term vulnerabilities build resilience and unlock growth potential non oil revenue mobilisation including through tax policy and administration improvements remains urgent to ensure financing constraints are contained and the interest payments to revenue ratio sustainable recourse to central bank overdrafts should be limited and the mission supports the authorities plans to use the low domestic yield environment to front load their financing requirements it stated he stressed the need for further tightening of monetary policy by the central bank of nigeria cbn albeit through more conventional methods this the multilateral institution said was needed to contain domestic and external pressures arising from large amounts of maturing cbn bills as part of its restrictive monetary policy stance the cbn monetary policy committee mpc at the end of its last meeting had raised the cash reserve ratio crr from 22 5 per cent to 27 5 per cent mati however reiterated the advice on ending direct central bank interventions securitising overdrafts to introduce longer term government instruments to mop up excess liquidity and moving towards a more flexible exchange rate banking system vulnerabilities should continue to be addressed the mission welcomed recent efforts to reduce legacy non performing loans the introduction of risk based minimum capital requirements would also help strengthen bank resilience he stated the imf officials also noted that structural reforms particularly executing the much delayed power sector recovery plan implementing the anti corruption and financial inclusion strategy as well as addressing infrastructure and gender gaps are essential to boost inclusive growth in the country nigeria s border closure will continue to have significant economic consequences on the country s neighbours it is important that all involved parties quickly resolve the issues keeping the borders closed including to stop the smuggling of banned products the team held productive discussions with senior government and central bank officials it also met with representatives of the banking system the private sector civil society organisations and development partners the team wishes to thank the authorities and all those it met for the productive discussions excellent cooperation and warm hospitality the statement added mati stated that the pace of economic recovery in the country remains slow as declining real income and weak investment continued to weigh on economic activity he said inflation driven by higher food prices has risen marking the end of the disinflationary trend seen in 2019 moody s expresses concern over nigeria other west african countries debts meanwhile one of the leading global rating agencies moody s investors service has noted that government debt burdens in nigeria and other economic community of west african states ecowas countries have risen significantly the development according to the agency has offset much of the debt relief from the early 2000s and raising concerns over debt sustainability debt burdens in the ecowas are now almost double what they were in 2010 and are unlikely to fall raising concerns about debt sustainability with potentially significant economic and social costs a moody s vice president senior credit officer lucie villa stated in a report she co authored the report explained that risks to debt sustainability included adverse debt dynamics weak financeability and debt management capacity these factors are particularly present in togo b3 stable and to some extent ghana b3 positive and nigeria b2 negative for some sovereigns in the region improved institutional strength and shock absorption capacity bolster their ability to sustain higher debt burdens compared with 10 years ago for instance the positive outlook on ghana s rating reflects our view that institutional improvements will help the government manage potential shocks and avoid a sharp and self fulfilling increase in debt it added according to the report although nigeria s debt levels is still low debt dynamics in the country is becoming adverse and fiscal metrics are deteriorating while debt management capacity remains weak others including mali b3 stable and niger b3 stable have more sustainable debt burdens under moody s central scenarios but they remain vulnerable to shocks that could materially increase their debt burdens and undermine their debt sustainability more highly rated senegal ba3 stable and côte d ivoire ba3 stable have the highest external debt owed to private creditors as a share of gdp but have the best financial management capacity it added nigeria s total public debt comprising the federal government of nigeria fgn the 36 states and federal capital territory fct stood at n26 215 trillion as at september 2019 according to data from the debt management office dmo this indicated a two per cent growth when compared with the n25 701 trillion recorded as at june 30 2019 the dmo director general ms patience oniha had said the total debt stock implied that in the quarter july to september 2019 a two per cent growth was recorded adding that the debt included promissory notes of n821 651 billion which had been issued to settle the fgn s arrears to oil marketers and state governments under the promissory programme approved by the federal executive

there is no inflation pressure the globalised economy renders the uk s internal phillips curve irrelevant the deflationary forces of elastic world supply overwhelm all else there can be moments in history when even current spending on social cohesion is itself an investment if it serves to hold a polity together through dangerous times the great liberal democracies are fracturing all over the place and it may be that the right sort of anti austerity policies will deliver a better economic dividend over 10 years than the alternative right now i e the jacobin temptation or the contractionary rule based fetishism of the eu s fiscal compact what should never be repeated is the great slash and burn of the osbornian dark age when net public investment was cut to 1 4pc of gdp because it was the easiest to cut this was at a time when the economy had a frightening output gap and the return on infrastructure spending probably had a multiplier of 3 0 based on recent academic literature the treasury was complicit in this vandalism it persisted in pushing self defeating forms of austerity relying on multiplier models jettisoned even by the imf in doing so it caused the debt ratio to be higher than it would otherwise have been leaving aside the social and political wreckage it failed even on its own crude terms defenders of treasury orthodoxy have been warning over recent days that low interest rates are not guaranteed and might suddenly spike higher yes that is a tail risk but i have yet to hear a coherent case for why it is remotely likely given that deflationary demographics are getting worse across the world and the underlying pathologies of secular stagnation remain with us a rate shock would in any case cause an equity crash and a chain of debt defaults the process would short circuit instantly what is more likely is that the wicksellian natural rate of interest falls ever further in the next downturn until we end up trapped in depression that way lies existential political peril besides boris johnson s fiscal boost may flood into the economy by some fluke of timing just as the tired global expansion sputters out it may prove to be a lifesaver a time may come when it is appropriate to open the fiscal spigots again but now s not that time jeremy warner argues against boris johnson is said to be considering a tax raid on the upper middle classes to pay for his burgeoning spending promises but why not like japan whose overall tax burden is relatively low compared to britain simply let debt do the work instead to keep the economy going the japanese government has spent heavily in the process it has allowed the national debt to rise to 238pc of gdp can t we do the same in britain here s why not annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure nineteen nineteen and six result happiness annual income twenty pounds annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six result misery so says wilkins micawber in david copperfield by charles dickens i suppose it is my upbringing or something but i have lived my life by this creed i don t like taking on debt and unlike micawber who ends up in a debtors prison have mercifully managed to avoid it throughout much of my adult life i cannot say that this aversion has served me badly but nor has it served me particularly well contemporaries of mine who have routinely geared themselves to the hilt have on the whole done much better financially than me countless fortunes have been built on the bedrock of debt with today s near free money why would you not have a big mortgage for instance even if in a position to pay it off indeed so in my view cheap and plentiful money has been a much more powerful driver of runaway house price inflation in the uk and elsewhere than oppressive planning laws and inadequate supply we live in an age where the profligate and the spendthrift are rewarded but the prudent are punished governments and countries are not like individual households and businesses where living within your means is often a matter of externally imposed necessity when a government borrows money it is because of the collective nature of the bargain only in effect money that we owe to ourselves within an economy as a whole debt is a hall of mirrors creditors and debtors are just two sides of the same coin

washington dc would you believe the following story if you heard it imagine a small rural town with one general store that sells to and buys from the farmers living in the surrounding area owing to their large families the farmers have been running up a tab at the store and they now owe the store a great deal of money so they organise a protest to demand that the store raise its prices on seed fertiliser and the like while reducing the price it will pay for the farmers grains obviously the scenario is absurd paying even higher prices for agricultural supplies and receiving less for what they produce will not help the farmers pay off their tab indeed either change would probably result in higher profits for the store and greater losses for the farmers and their families in this nonsensical parable us president donald trump s administration represents the farmers by accusing china or any other country of currency manipulation the administration is effectively demanding that the chinese appreciate their currency that is make each renminbi cost more in dollars to be sure many politicians over the years have argued that china and other developing and emerging economies manipulate their currency to gain a competitive edge by reducing the purchasing power of their own currencies they can make their exports cost less to foreign buyers while rendering imports more expensive to domestic buyers to account for such concerns the united states has a law mandating that the department of the treasury prepare a biannual report for congress specifying whether any currencies are being manipulated if the treasury does so specify the administration is then expected to carry on talks with the accused country but even then the law mandates no penalties congress has established three criteria to determine whether manipulation has occurred the offending country must have a current account surplus above 3 per cent of gdp it must have intervened in the foreign exchange market to make its currency cheaper and it must have a bilateral surplus with the us in excess of 20 billion in august 2019 china s current account surplusfell below 3 per cent of gdp and the chinese government had previously been intervening not to devalue the renminbi but rather to prevent further depreciation following trump s threats of additional tariffs in the event the us declared china a currency manipulator anyway only to remove the designation as a part of the phase one trade deal agreed in january but in the meantime the trump administration has discovered a new tool with which to bludgeon foreign competitors the department of commerce this month issued a rule that allows for additional levies on imports from countries deemed to be currency manipulators with the percentage increase in the tariff in addition to the statutory tariff and the anti dumping or countervailing duty margin being equal to the estimated percentage by which the currency is deemed undervalued worse under the new rule there is no legal process that the department must follow when determining whether manipulation has occurred accordingly an american company that believes it is losing sales to a foreign company may now appeal to the commerce department and the international trade administration for special treatment even if a profitable german exporter charges the same prices for the goods it sells domestically as it does for the goods it sells in the us an american firm can demand additional levies by citing currency manipulation and if no us firm acts the commerce department can simply initiate such appeals on its own the us has long had one of the world s strongest economies owing in no small part to its respect for the rule of law and its efforts to maintain a level playing field for competition both foreign and domestic within the us market given this tradition it is puzzling that so many american politicians and businessmen are now terrified of other countries economic strengths true the us has also long championed extraordinarily loose criteria to justify anti dumping measures and countervailing duties and it has secured rules and procedures for determining such offenses within the world trade organisation but a finding of currency manipulation has never been among the relevant criteria most likely the trump administration s unilateral decision to add currency manipulation to the list will be contested in court and at the wto more broadly the trump administration s currency politics will be felt everywhere trump has complained that both argentina and brazil are manipulating their currencies even though those countries exchange rate depreciation is obviously a response to high inflation the international monetary fund and others have recommended that both pursue devaluation in order to restore macroeconomic balance meanwhile trump continues to call on the us federal reserve to lower interest rates and ease its monetary policy so that the dollar will depreciate apparently the us is free to manipulate its currency just so long as no one else does anne o krueger a former world bank chief economist and former first deputy

in angola she is known as the princess a smart and innovative businesswoman famous for her friendships with jetsetters from all over the world and above all for her fortune which makes her the richest woman on the continent however recently isabel dos santos has become the symbol of corruption among african elites as she is accused of systematically looting public assets it is once again to courageous whistle blowers and the rigorous analysis by members of the international consortium of investigative journalists icij that we owe these revelations after the panama papers the paradise papers and the mauritius leaks the luanda leaks showed this time how the eldest daughter of ex president jose eduardo dos santos who served from 1979 to 2017 has together with her husband allegedly received billions of dollars from her father s government in angola through a business empire spanning more than 400 companies in 41 countries including hong kong and mauritius as a result according to the luanda leaks she was able to avoid scrutiny and access many public works contracts state assets and loans at the expense of angolans it s no coincidence that the 2020 edition of the financial secrecy index fsi published by tax justice network a uk based financial advocacy group classifies angola as the most secretive place of all 17 african countries included in its index for five of the past 10 years angola was listed as having strategic deficiencies by the financial action task force fatf an international standard setter of anti money laundering policy angola is not alone six months ago another icij investigation the mauritius leaks showed how by creating an intricate network of bilateral investment tax and trade treaties with mostly developing countries mauritius proceeded to build one of the most aggressive offshore regimes in africa thus monopolising investment flows into the continent in reality no nation on the continent is in a position to congratulate itself on its good results south africa for example managed to slightly reduce its contribution to global financial secrecy taking its ranking down from 50th on the 2018 index to 58th in 2020 but the country s elite south african corporations and foreign multinational companies within its borders keep exploiting loopholes in legislation and use other secrecy jurisdictions to reduce their tax obligations in a nation that time magazine referred to as the world s most unequal country of course we must remember that the biggest contributors to global secrecy are not african countries members of the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd that brings together the richest countries in the world are responsible for 49 of all financial secrecy in the world as measured by fsi in 2020 this contribution is either direct or through their dependencies to which they outsource some of their financial secrecy such as the us virgin islands curaçao or the cayman islands showing the remarkable hypocrisy of the world s most fortunate countries by using the tax havens that are part of their networks they enable some of the worst forms of financial secrecy in the world while exercising stricter regulations within their own borders but it is in africa that the situation is most tragic capital flight out of africa by african elites and foreigners alike has been undermining the continent s development for decades in a recent report examining capital flight from 30 african countries between 1970 and 2015 james boyce and i demonstrated that they lost approximately 1 4 trillion over the period in question 1 8 trillion if earned interest income is taken into account this is much more than the total of the stock of debt owed by these countries as of 2015 496 9 billion and the cumulative amount of foreign aid received over this period 991 8 billion in short africa is a net creditor to the rest of the world and not a continent dependent on foreign aid and private investment as typically portrayed the consequences are brutal these capital outflows deprive governments of resources to invest in public services such as education healthcare childcare services clean drinking water and sanitation systems the financial haemorrhage exacerbates gender inequality because women are overrepresented among the poor and among the demographic groups with precarious or low paid jobs in addition they tend to take on a larger share of unpaid care work when social services are cut furthermore capital flight and tax evasion erode the tax base forcing a resort to regressive taxes on consumption such as value added tax vat thereby shifting the tax burden to the middle class and the poorest segments of the population the succession of scandals such as the luanda leaks has generated public outrage across the world it is hoped that this will eventually force governments to start tackling the financial secrecy industry that allows cross border corruption networks to prosper the 2020 fsi already shows that on average countries have reduced their contribution to global financial secrecy by 7 since the previous edition from 2018 which is excellent news we the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation icrict believe it is time for africa to start addressing the question of transparency south africa for example has yet to implement the public beneficial ownership register it has committed to most african countries have not even contemplated such as a vital tool to combat secrecy tax evasion and illicit financial flows allowing the identification of the beneficial owner of an asset regardless of whose name the title of the property is under is a powerful tool to tackle tax fraud and corruption it would also be an opportunity to engage effectively with citizens as well as earning their trust by being more demanding on themselves african governments will also be in a better position to stand up to jurisdictions that block progress on transparency at the global level the problem is not limited to the usual suspects the financial centres such as dubai singapore or hong kong which are attracting more and more capital from african oligarchs as the luanda leaks have shown it is also troubling to see that major advanced economies such as the united states and the united kingdom have seen their contribution to global financial opacity increase in the 2020 fsi financial transparency is also a political emergency by continuing to turn a blind eye to corruption and tax evasion and by persisting in responding to the lack of fiscal resources through austerity programmes governments jeopardise their legitimacy in the eyes of the population opening wide the door to extremist movements to advance their destructive interests dm léonce ndikumana is a distinguished professor of economics and director of the african development policy programme at the political economy research institute at the university of massachusetts he is a commissioner on the independent commission for the reform of international corporate taxation icrict

preface volatility is not fear volatility is not the vix index volatility is not a statistic or a standard deviation or any other number derived by abstract formula volatility is no different in

insights can be found in this interview with real vision as well as a video presentation titled volatility at world s end two decades of movement in markets i highly recommend watching them both since around 2008 a niche group of asset managers such as the above mentioned began to see volatility not only as a hedge but also as an investment in its own right while asset management companies with top

by an assemblage of factors including but not limited to the following disruption assessment of the impact coronavirus has had on global trade china s politique moral hazard and muddy waters mechanics

personal contacts the high degree of asymmetric information pertaining to covid 19 coronavirus is apparent it now affects 10 of the global population and most citizens directly affected by the virus are showing higher levels of dissatisfaction than the news portrays the realization of this asymmetrical information is making its way across the pacific and could be the canary in the coal mine for a spike in volatility disruption sputtering global trade the largest creditor nation and global supplier of goods with the largest gdp per ppp alongside a populace that is four times as numerous than that of the usa has shut down a vast amount of commerce due to a widespread virus without a cure given the continued outbreaks the world s factory will likely continue to close shop in the short term and in turn disrupt global supply chains the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific wrote on february 14 2020 in the face of a new virus covid 19 china is reportedly shutting down production lines domestic consumption is weakening and growth forecasts are being revised downwards as a result experts around the world are now rushing to understand the true impact of chinaâ s economic integration businesses aren t reportedly shutting down they are shutting down apple inc aapl announced on february 1 2020 the company would be shutting down all stores in the mainland until february 9 2020 this has now been extended to february 15 2020 to make matters worse hon hai precision industry better known as foxconn has closed shop as well this spells trouble for

employer there were earlier reports of the business resuming production by reuters but this was proven false the ripple effects are already seen in the japanese and south korean car markets nissan and hyundai have shut down assembly lines due to a shortage in china made parts cases like the aforementioned are important more important however are the efforts to quell the outbreak by resuming economic activity which has unfortunately come in vain contagion is putting a strain on the global shipping industry as shown through the baltic dry index according to trading economics the baltic dry index has been trading below 450 in february the lowest level since march 2016 with the capesize segment falling to all time lows amid weak demand for ships and muted activity in china whose demand accounts for almost 40 of total dry seaborne imports the dry bulk index which can be an early indicator of slowing global growth has plunged by over 83 since early september as an 18 month trade war between the us and china and the coronavirus outbreak weighed on exports and manufacturing while higher fuel costs under the new international maritime 2020 regulations led to a significant rise in the cost of operating cargo ships the last time it fell by 90 in just a few months was in 2008 during the great recession source trading economics moreover china s production of real goods is unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world it is an industrial powerhouse and the u s is highly dependent after all china is the united states largest supplier of goods in december 2019 u s imports from china accounted for 18 1 of total u s imports these goods aren t the commodity type either of the 452 2 billion in u s imports from china in 2019 they mainly comprised of cell phones computers televisions motor vehicle parts plastics and furniture and bedding finding substitutes for these manufactured goods will be difficult source us tradenumbers if china ceases to operate for a lengthy period it will have a profound impact on the united states consumer and the global economy itself let s remember u s productivity is measured to include consumption which comprises approximately 70 of total u s gdp this composition is a build up spawned from the past 40 years of sino u s relations which have had a close symbiotic relationship this relationship was one wherein china focused on production and saved while the u s balanced this with growing consumption and debt mass consumption of cheap goods from china has been prevalent since deng xiaoping pushed through his open market reforms and claimed if you open the windows some flies will come in but in doing so you re also going to get a lot of fresh air and sunshine on a global basis the integration of china s rise through

is disseminating the relevant data after all this is why entrepreneurs create private market research firms that span the globe to act as counterweights to official data if there does remain an inclination to trust government data absent such counterweights such is china it would be wise to take note of the shortage of test kits and medical equipment due to lack of transparency and supply

explained by an independent variable in a regression model not to be confused with correlation which explains the strength of the relationship between an independent and dependent variable r squared details the extent to which the variance of one variable explains the variance of the second variable as an example if the r2 of a model is 0 25 then approximately one quarter of the observed variation can be explained by the model s inputs source data is beautiful the data representing this quadratic model is detailed below parentheses represent predictions and bold type represents actual

highly improbable moreover a research paper titled quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic by axel brandenburg also confirms suspicions of dubious data it is publicly accessible via cornell university s open access archive arxiv below is the abstract the number of infections and the number of fatalities in the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemics follows a remarkably regular trend since the end of january the ratio of fatalities per infection is about 2 and remarkably stable the increase appears to be roughly exponential but with an e folding time that gradually increases from just two days at the end of january to about ten days by february 9 here we show that since january 20 the number of fatalities and infections increases quadratically and not exponentially as widely believed at present no departure from this behavior can be seen allowing tentative predictions to be made for the next 1 2 months cornell university arxiv solidifying the view that data relating to this virus is dubious in nature are reports from the horse s mouth chinese health officials have admittedly claimed there are not enough test kits to test those who think they have symptoms hospitals are turning away symptomatic individuals due to overcapacity and a lack of resources a continuation of uncoordinated efforts to distribute donated materials given to the red cross persists to reaffirm i believe it to be a fool s errand to consider the posted data reliable due to policy culture predictive modeling and official statements i had mentioned the potential severity of this outbreak as early as january 26 2020 when the total recorded death toll was said to be 80 individuals alongside the 2 800 official confirmed cases at that time more importantly i have frequented mainland chinese hospitals outside of tier 1 cities and seen the hygienic methods and health practices being employed first hand a vast amount of the hospitals and staff seemed very ill equipped and ill trained for basic treatment let alone a viral outbreak it s estimated that as much as 90 of chinese physicians have no degree beyond a bachelor s village practitioners are mostly underqualified and wages constitute 1 4 of the average physician s income the twitter post from my general sentiment of the virus earlier in january is below source holdenbweaver given the market s lack of attention

up about their frustration with efforts to contain the virus and the dissatisfaction of being confined to their homes unable to work and in some cases receive the care they need the importance and rarity of such actions cannot be fully explained in writing it is a unique time to say the least and one ripe for volatility as more truth is discovered china also remains vulnerable to more contagion and as an effect widespread disruption in our global supply chains seems to be more likely with the passing of time major companies such as technology behemoths and automobile manufacturers are already being directly affected both in china and in surrounding countries china s system is ill prepared for such a shock to its health infrastructure and its political system it isn t ready to deal with the contagion in an upfront manner being transparent in the process and allowing international organizations to be allowed into wuhan to do meaningful work this may cause the world to take notice and infer the situation is far worse than being discounted sending a shock to confidence and in turn financial markets trust is of utmost importance and as trust dwindles so does credibility and confidence in closing considering a long position with vxx to play volatility to the upside offers asymmetric risk reward in such times of uncertainty

first responders inside the u s strategy for fighting the 2007 2009 global financial crisis edited by ben s bernanke timothy f geithner and henry m paulson jr with j nellie liang yale university press 37 50 cloth more than a decade after the financial crises of 2008 the shortcomings of the government s response have become painfully clear this clarity has unfortunately not been aided by the extensive writings of the three people george w bush and barack obama charged with putting the fire out henry paulson bush s treasury secretary timothy geithner bush s new york fed ceo turned obama s treasury secretary and ben bernanke chairman of the federal reserve for both bush and obama in no other u s financial crisis did two successive administrations of opposing parties work together so harmoniously aiming toward the same goal with similar means from the moment of the lehman brothers bankruptcy on september 15 2008 to obama s inauguration on january 20 2009 the two major parties one of whose leaders won office on the slogan of hope and change sought essentially the same legislation backed the same actions by the executive branch and even relied on the same person geithner to restore wall street s primacy in shaping investment and wealth allocation the response to the 2008 financial crisis has threatened the survival of democracy not only in the united states but around the world after calm returned to the panic stricken financial markets the summer of 2009 in the united states later in europe each of these figures wrote separate memoirs of the experience they also jointly authored a book firefighters which i reviewed in these pages last year and have given mutually supportive interviews i do not think u s history includes any similar effort to explain and rationalize decisions of such magnitude more typically different actors provide uncoordinated and often clashing accounts of their conduct in crises the latest contribution in this direction is first responders a compilation of eighteen essays edited by the trio who in turn wrote one essay and recruited thirty two of their aides to write the others overall the editors claim qualified success the crisis paralyzed global credit ravaged global finance and plunged the american economy into the most painful recession since the 1930s they write but it did not result in a second depression the three admit that their response was very unpopular but conclude that is because the government entered the crisis with inadequate powers the government still lacks essential powers they contend but they say they assembled this book because they owed the crisis fighters of the future the manual that we were never given we are witnessing in these books a unique try in george orwell s phrase to control the future by controlling the past the central message from the trio is this in the next time of trouble do what we did the problem is that the first responders have not fully reckoned here or elsewhere with the implications of their actions their inadequate response undercut obama s major legislative reforms leaving policymakers with no commonly understood economic approach to decision making it represented a triumph of expedience and elitism over economic justice it gave a huge boost to china in the competitive contest among nations and it has threatened the survival of democracy not only in the united states but around the world not accepting their own history in these terms the editors are too confident in their prescriptions following the introductory essay are seventeen chapters describing the full gamut of government programs in the department of the treasury the federal reserve the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and within the executive branch that eventually restored calm and confidence to wall street restored liquidity to global finance and helped get investment and job hiring going again these accounts are dry but candid and in many ways more revealing than the polished joint narratives of the three editors all told they issue a total of eighty five tactical lessons but we can group them into four overarching lessons act before crisis diagnose the financial and real economies anticipate problems intervene with all possible government authority before the difficulties become critical act with overwhelming force during crisis spend public money invest public dollars provide government guarantees of debt in whatever amount ends the financial panic and puts the economy on a good track retain flexibility to keep spending etc as needed if the crisis flares or economy slips again explain inform public and congress about the situation the response the reasons for decisions be amoral try to recoup public investment do not pursue social goals while ending bank runs do not worry about unjust enrichment of some do try to get a return of capital for the treasury these lessons are based on the triumphalist claim about avoiding a second depression the specter they also conjured up at the time of their decision making soon after being named as obama s pick for treasury secretary after the 2008 election geithner informed the president elect that his accomplishment is going to be preventing a second great depression but there were three terrible aspects of the great depression that the first responders did not avoid at least not completely and two they should have aspired to replicate but did not we are witnessing in these books a unique try in george orwell s phrase to control the future by controlling the past first if they meant to stop unemployment from reaching double digits as it did for most of the 1930s and did again in the reagan recessions of the early 1980s then they did not avoid that calamity to be sure unemployment did not reach the peak of 25 percent it hit in 1933 but that prospect was not plausible after the crisis in 2008 government stabilizers the anodyne term for the safety net measures of unemployment insurance and social security as well as the vast expansion of the federal role in the economy since world war ii greatly mitigated the impact of recession on consumer demand and thus reduced job loss second if they meant to avoid panic driven bank runs their efforts in this respect lasted a long time stretching at least from early 2008 to mid summer 2009 in the united states and from 2007 to 2012 in europe by contrast franklin roosevelt stopped the bank runs of march 1933 within days of his inauguration third if one of their goals was to show the world the merits of their response to the crisis a reconstitution of the peculiar synthesis of democracy and capitalism in the united states then they were not totally successful neither roosevelt nor these first responders were able to stem the global surge of fascism and communism as dangerous alternative governing models moreover two aspects of roosevelt s response to the great depression were not replicated but should have been for one thing both the bush and obama administrations refused to punish what in the 1930s were labeled banksters instead they restored wall street elites quickly to their preeminent role in investing and allocating wealth by contrast in 1933 34 roosevelt passed moral and in some cases criminal judgment against financiers his administration also initiated an era of public investment that exercised a countervailing power of capital allocation to create public goods from the triborough bridge to the tennessee valley authority most important unlike roosevelt obama failed to create a grand political coalition that would give his party the capability to address massive problems requiring collective action including at minimum affordable health care for all and a rapid shift from carbon to clean power as the underpinning of the economy to a significant degree the lessons proffered by the lieutenants can be read as a subtle but telling critique of the actions of their generals the most salient example is that paulson followed neither the first nor the third lesson early in 2008 he diagnosed the financial crisis with reasonable accuracy but he intervened only in part then failed to summon all government authority and ultimately looked on as the very thing he knew would trigger untold disaster unfolded the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in no other u s financial crisis did two successive administrations of opposing parties work together so harmoniously aiming toward the same goal with similar means the story of that neglect bears repeating larry summers told me that when he was still in the private sector in march 2008 he informed paulson that fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises gses that bought and sold the bulk of home mortgages were bankrupt paulson did not appear to concede the point but according to adam tooze s magisterial history crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world 2019 paulson was concerned about a mass sell off of dollar denominated assets by china s reserve managers at more than 4 trillion gse securities circulating around the world exceeded the amount of united states treasuries in the hands of private investors as one commentator wrote the gses were too chinese to fail paulson therefore consulted with barney frank the democratic congressman chairing the house financial services committee they agreed to pass the housing and economic recovery act enacted in july this law authorized the treasury to take over the gses guarantee their debt and thereby dedicate unlimited federal money to assure that any creditor of the gses such as china would be paid 100 percent on their money due but that same march the wall street investment bank bear stearns failed the treasury and fed collaborated in providing 30 billion of public money to persuade jpmorgan chase to buy bear assume its obligations and thus quell panic from that date all three editors knew that another important financial firm outside the insurance regime maintained by the fdic would fail it was almost certainly going to be lehman in the summer paulson alerted frank to the near certain calamity of the coming crash of a major firm the solution for the impending bankruptcy of fannie and freddie was legislation giving paulson the ability to seize the firms and backstop their obligations with government guarantees however paulson wanted different authority for any and all wall street firms that could suffer uncontrolled runs although none of the editors disclose what paulson told frank specifically we know from paulson s proposal to congress after the lehman bankruptcy what he presumably wanted in the summer obama failed to create a grand political coalition that would give his party the capability to address massive problems requiring collective action paulson s preferred plan was to have the treasury buy the troubled assets of the big wall street banks those loans made that were not likely to be paid given the economic downturn and the securities that were likely to be worth much less than the banks had paid for them this is why his plan was called the troubled assets relief plan or tarp frank told him that if he wanted new legal authority he would have to explain why paulson states that he refused on the grounds that making the compelling case about the risk would have precipitated exactly what we wanted to avoid in other words if he said that lehman or a similar firm was about to go bankrupt the run could start immediately paulson would be blamed alternatively if he waited for the inevitable event he could arrive on the scene like a firefighter demanding the water from congress to put out the conflagration the water was 700 billion in spending authority what paulson has not conceded is that his plan could not have survived public scrutiny or passed congress with the cover of the smoke from the many specific fires that lehman caused paulson insisted on legislation that bailed out banks but did not change bank leadership sanction any firms oblige any to undertake any public duties or even limit their bonus payments another contributing factor to paulson s decision not to ask for expanded legislative authority in the summer may have been politics even president bush notably inattentive to the details of the economic situation would not have wanted to condone such a cassandra like warning of impending financial disaster a republican treasury secretary s public proclamation would have greatly boosted obama s chance of winning in november in any event although the lehman bankruptcy was not unexpected paulson had not prepared in advance any of the many stopgaps his able colleagues describe in this manual instead he focused on begging obama and the democratic congressional leadership to pass the bad bill he hurriedly sketched out however the republicans could not deliver the support of many of their house members and paulson s proposal failed the democrats cobbled together a modestly improved version and with a few more republican votes it passed in early october only three weeks after the lehman bankruptcy then paulson was persuaded to buy stock in banks a maneuver that he dreaded that proved vital to quelling the panic meanwhile the first responders could not stop the crisis from metastasizing to many other organs of the financial industry money market funds the insurance industry the automobile financing the housing market and so on despite the lack of preparation in one market after another the skilled administrators of the editors quickly figured out what to do and acted with dispatch the chapters of this book document their decisions with admirable candor the editors might have reached a different conclusion if they had tried to account for the tsunami of firing and foreclosure that swept the country in the wake of the banking industry s foolishness the contributors to this book repeatedly communicate their sense that their success was in doubt yet both before and after the lehman bankruptcy the managers of the u s government s moneymaking machinery commanded unstoppable financial force ultimately the fed extended more than 3 trillion of nearly free money to many dozens of firms worldwide never in doubt either was whether wall street eventually could be restored to primacy in the u s economy very much up for grabs however were two outcomes who would suffer and who would be enriched as a result of the editors decisions the middle class came to bear the brunt of the economic and social suffering leaving stockholding elites better off the editors do not discuss whether they foresaw these outcomes tragically the banks did not do the job the editors wanted done they failed to allocate capital in the volume needed to drive speedy substantial and sustained economic growth in the decade following the crisis private savings greatly exceeded private investment by somewhere between 5 and 7 trillion that investment had it occurred could have provided affordable clean power to every consumer and business rebuilt transportation infrastructure everywhere and financed low cost higher education for all students the war the editors were supposed to win was the struggle to get private money to deliver public goods the other great disappointment was that china took the lead as the driver of global investment displacing the united states from the position it had occupied since world war ii all the obama advisers and congressional decision makers acknowledged that the government needed to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to get people hired and the spending needed to start quickly the form and amount of the stimulus were agreed by the obama team in chicago on december 16 2008 and presented to congress soon thereafter it was enacted into law on february 17 2009 but the stimulus was on the order of 800 billion less than half the size that was needed as a result unemployment rose above 10 percent and was not much lower at the time of the november 2010 congressional election that contributed mightily to the republican seizure of the house jason furman states the administration s oft repeated excuse the fiscal response suffered significant shortcomings largely the result of the political difficulty of persuading congress to sufficiently stimulate the economy in early 2009 but this explanation is not persuasive we know the house would have voted for a bigger package and the obama team got almost exactly what it decided to ask for in chicago on december 16 2008 the stimulus decision in size and shape violated the first second and third lessons while paying respect to the fundamentally backward fourth lesson the authors did not correctly anticipate the true depth of the recession they did not apply overwhelming fiscal force to stop the downturn and start the recovery they did not explain openly what was really going on and they didn t have a moral stance that could be explained to the country it is the failures of neoliberal planning that paulson geithner and bernanke forgoing as they do any serious reflection on the right aims of government still have not reckoned with on january 10 2009 incoming obama administration economists published a prediction that the desired stimulus would keep unemployment from going much above 9 percent and would get it down to around 7 percent by the time of the midterm election at the same time they paul krugman and other savvy students of the situation knew from recently published hiring and firing numbers that unemployment was going to be much higher and that as a result the stimulus was unlikely to produce that predicted outcome the incoming administration decided to ignore the signals and stick with its plan knowing it was too small they thought it was more important to get the package authorized quickly than to have it be big enough time proved this to be wrong it would have been better to have sought funding for infrastructure projects even if they were not in the jargon of the time shovel ready the incoming administration should have increased welfare payments of diverse kinds offered the republicans the egregious tax cuts that had to be proffered in december 2010 anyhow and committed the government to loaning into public private projects in total the direct and indirect spending should have been about 700 billion a year for each of the years 2009 2010 and 2011 the obama decision makers including geithner did not want to take these steps they incorrectly feared that the size of the government deficit would kick off inflation which would be good for homeowners but bad for banks the new treasury secretary expressed concern that a larger stimulus could hurt his bid to get congress to allocate more investment in banks an inconceivable project that he wanted on the table until the markets deemed banks sufficiently recapitalized the editors might have reached a very different conclusion if they had not looked at their result as qualified success but instead tried to account for the tsunami of firing and foreclosure that swept the country in the wake of the banking industry s foolishness the failure of real estate prices to recover over a decade and the extreme underinvestment by the financial sector that followed the crisis from that perspective the problem to be explained is not how a second great depression was averted but why the government failed to use its full authority to get the real economy not just the financial sector on a solid path of high growth presumably the three editors thought that after being put back in working order wall street would once again tick to the designs of neoliberal clockwork allocating capital efficiently creating jobs and improving wages yet that is exactly what did not happen the government officials for whom this manual was written should think differently about the goals of policy and about the means to achieve them it is these failures of neoliberal planning that the editors forgoing as they do any serious reflection on the right aims of government still have not reckoned with they must have thought restoration of wall street was their principal goal not because they cared only about their business acquaintances but rather because they saw efficient financing as the means to avoid a deeper economic downturn in the years since the crisis was quelled however private finance alone has not addressed the major problems in the economy or society nor has it produced the widespread improvement in the standard of living that citizens expect in the next crisis those who occupy the positions held by the editors and their colleagues will be hard pressed to work harder be more ingenious or more altruistic than they were but the government officials for whom this manual was written should think differently about the goals of policy and more broadly about the means to achieve them the decisions taken now more than a decade ago have greatly undermined people s trust in government and if the next crisis does not produce a better outcome the republic itself is at risk

prices in border cities with those in neighboring u s communities along the border but that measure has been abandoned according to local business leaders a year later there has been no official written agreement with pemex mexico s struggling state oil company to lower prices in baja california and the state legislature recently increased gasoline taxes by 2 5 percent regional business leaders had successfully lobbied for the designation but a year later they say at best it has only spurred moderate economic growth advertisement we haven t gotten there yet said aram hodoyan the president of tijuana s economic development council hodoyan said he and other regional business leaders remain cautiously optimistic despite the slow progress in the first year we have been doing more things than we expected in one year he said specifically pointing to the border region s new lower sales tax and lower import duties or taxes placed on goods being imported into the country advertisement hodoyan said the initial impact of the reduction in the sales tax was very noticeable in the first months of 2019 with an initial sales increase in baja california of about 8 percent or 9 percent however that early spike stabilized throughout the year without greater reductions to the cost of importing goods the changes had little overall impact on smaller business owners in baja california he said jason m b wells the ceo of the san ysidro chamber of commerce agreed advertisement it s safe to say at a street level in baja california those changes have had zero impact either way said wells last march lópez obrador relaxed some of the strict regulations to the border economic plan allowing more businesses to participate and he extended the deadline for companies to apply for tax incentives prior to that less than 1 percent of the companies in baja california actually qualified according to business leaders before companies had to not be enrolled in any other tax relief programs offered by the federal government also real estate and rental companies were previously excluded advertisement the benefits didn t trickle all the way down to the average joe which for san ysidro is very important because the more money people have in tijuana the more they spend in san ysidro wells said historically the border region had benefited from special measures designed to make it more competitive with u s communities but some of those programs had been rolled back in the years before lópez obrador s election negatively impacting the local business community said influential businessman pedro romero torres torija the economy is growing just not as fast as we expected said romero torres torija who is serving as the economic czar to lópez obrador advertisement there are more investments coming we have several other companies that want to establish their business here in the border region he said adding that mexican national leaders expect growth to intensify because of the new trade agreement between the united states canada and mexico he said in the meantime mexican federal officials are exploring other measures to boost growth we re training in technology and innovation and exploring new measures to make it easier to go through the border and to make it easier to import and export merchandise he said advertisement hodoyan said it is difficult to tell whether the small growth in the border region can be attributed to the reduction in value added taxes or whether it s a domino effect of growth in the u s economy maybe 40 percent of what we re seeing now is because of the vat s and things being done better in mexico said hodoyan and probably 60 percent at least here at the border we can attribute to the growth of the u s economy
listening to the howls from democrats and the applause from republicans one would think president trump s proposed fiscal year 2021 budget is a radical assault on the welfare state the truth is the budget contains some minor spending cuts most of which are not even real cuts instead they are reductions in the projected rate of growth this is equivalent of saying you are sticking to your diet because you ate five chocolate chip cookies when you wanted to eat ten president trump s plan reduces the education department s budget by nearly eight percent leaving the department with only 66 6 billion dollars cuts to other departments are similarly small while reductions in entitlement spending consist mostly of reforms that will not affect most of those dependent on these programs president trump deserves credit for proposing an 11 6 billion dollars cut in funding for the department of state and the us agency for international development usaid foreign aid does little to help impoverished people overseas instead it benefits foreign government officials willing to do the us government s bidding the state department and usaid are extensively involved in us intervention abroad including efforts to overthrow governments swords into plowshares paul ron best price 4 00 buy new 15 99 as of 11 36 utc details president trump s budget proposes a number of increases in spending for example his budget spends around 900 million additional dollars on vocational education it also includes additional spending on items including infrastructure and childcare few in dc have expressed concern over the fact that president trump s 4 8 trillion dollars budget proposal is the largest budget in american history there is also little outcry from supposedly antiwar progressive democrats over trump s proposal to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on militarism this is not surprising as many progressives are happy to support increased warfare spending as long as conservatives go along with increased welfare spending similarly many conservatives are happy to support increased welfare spending as long as it means that progressives will vote for increased warfare spending so congress is unlikely to approve any of president trump s spending cuts but congress will gleefully agree to all of his spending increases even if congress agrees to all of president trump s cuts federal deficits will still be over one trillion dollars for the next several years however president trump claims the budget will balance in 15 years in order to show a balanced budget by 2035 the administration assumes three percent economic growth for most of the next decade this level of growth is unlikely to come to pass instead the current boom will likely end soon and the economy will experience another major recession signs that we are on the verge of a downturn include rising homelessness and the federal reserve s bailout of the repurchasing market the current economic boom is built on debt and the debt based economy is facilitated by the federal reserve s easy money policies the massive amount of debt held by consumers businesses and especially government is the main reason the fed feels compelled to maintain historically low interest rates if rates were to increase to market levels government interest payments would be unstable this would cause the government debt bubble to burst leading to a major crisis however continuing on the current path of low interest rates will inevitably lead to a dollar crisis and a collapse of the welfare warfare keynesian system continuing to waste billions on wars abroad and failed programs at home while pretending that we can avoid a crisis via phony cuts and fed fueled growth will only make the inevitable collapse more painful the only way to avoid economic disaster is to cut spending and audit then end the federal reserve the best of ron paul md

timely and decisive measures of china to lessen the economic impact will be beneficial both to china and the world economy he said adding that isolating china due to the coronavirus is not the solution and will only create more obstacles to world trade tan the malaysian envoy noted that china has remained malaysia s largest trading partner for 11 consecutive years and accounted for 17 2 percent of malaysia s trade in 2019 and that bilateral trade will recover with a higher peak within reach after the epidemic jorge valenzuela president of the chilean federation of fruit producers

hsbc earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 hsbc holdings plc hsbc 0 81 q4 2019 earnings call 3 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks mark e tucker group chairman good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us this morning before we get into the details of the presentation that noel and ewen will make i wanted to just set aside a few minutes just to give you some context during the course of the last year the board determined that it had two major priorities one was to ensure that a new group chief executive is selected and the other was the need to enhance performance accelerate pace and improve our sustainable returns collectively we concluded that both urgent challenges and that we needed to tackle them immediately and separately we have always seen that these have needed to be parallel processes with independent timescales and the board i can promise you has been fully engaged in both let me deal first with the group ceo selection process the board has embarked on a very thorough and rigorous process to search for and identify a new ceo that process is well under way and it s the board s intention to announce the outcome within the six to 12 month time scale that we outlined in august turning now to the business update we saw a pressing need to reallocate capital away from underperforming businesses to support the growth of higher return businesses particularly where we have competitive advantage the board and executive are also acutely aware of the need to improve efficiency reduce costs and inject pace and we have been working hard on this and it is to noel s credit that he has grasped the issues and tackled the task with energy and resolve he and the rest of the executive team have worked very closely with the board to formulate and determine the plans that they had announced today and as you ve seen they amount to a very significant shift in the allocation of the bank s capital and resources they build on a natural and inherent strengths of the organization and are designed to significantly improve sustainable returns for our shareholders i think finally and is i think just worth mentioning important to mention and to recognize the continuing exceptional work of our team of our staff across the world particularly those in mainland china and hong kong who are dealing with the impacts of covid 19 on both our customers and the bank the board and i want to make it clear that we owe them enormous gratitude and thanks for their continuing dedication their care and their immense professionalism having said all of that let me now pass over to noel and ewen to take you through the details noel quinn group chief executive thank you mark and good morning to everyone in london and good afternoon to everyone listening or watching in hong kong we have two objectives today the first is to take you through our q4 and full year results for 2019 and the second is to tell you how we re going to address the underperforming parts of the business and simplify the group to increase returns reduce our cost base and create capacity to invest in growth and technology we re going to do this in three parts first ewen will take you through the numbers for 2019 i ll then talk about our plan and then back to ewen to cover the financial implications of that plan and then we ll take questions so i ll now pass straight over to ewen for him to talk about our results ewen stevenson group chief financial officer thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all on the fourth quarter it was a decent set of results adjusted revenues were up 3 reflecting both a weaker quarter in 2018 but also the continuing strength of our stronger performing franchises while adjusted profits were up 29 due to the goodwill impairment of 7 3 billion we made a reported loss before tax of 3 9 billion as i go onto shortly hong kong continues to produce very resilient results in the fourth quarter with adjusted profits up 3 relative to a year before but given the continuing impact of coronavirus that we re seeing this year we do expect a weaker first half a few particular points to call out the headline results for the fourth quarter were impacted at a headline basis because of the large goodwill impairment this reflected the weakened interest rate outlook and our revenue outlook and those change long term growth rate assumptions as you know the goodwill impairment has no impact on core tier 1 the uk ring fenced bank was impacted the redress costs 224 million in the fourth quarter driven mainly by sharply higher expected litigation costs in relation to ppi we re making progress on reducing our cost run rate down from down by half from 5 6 to just under 3 in 2019 and second half costs were lower than first half costs our core tier 1 was up 40 basis points to 14 7 we ve reduced net risk weighted assets in the quarter by 22 billion including a 19 billion reduction in global banking and markets on slide four group continues to be underpinned by a strong set of franchises all showing continued attractive growth rates in retail banking and wealth management full year adjusted revenues were up 9 with good growth in deposits mortgage balances and customer numbers the turnaround of global banking global private banking continues with net new money of 23 billion in the year commercial banking revenues were up 6 underpinned by strong growth in both lending and deposits and for our global transaction banking franchise revenues were up 3 and that s despite the impact of a softer interest rate environment in asia revenues up 7 overall with good growth across most of the region and the uk ring fenced bank had revenue growth of 3 underpinned by deposit balance and mortgage growth turning to the next slide and to go into more detail on hong kong macro conditions progressively became more challenging in the second half and remain challenging given the sharp and unfolding impact of the coronavirus despite these macro conditions last year 2019 performance remained resilient adjusted revenue growth of 7 credit quality remaining robust and profits before tax of 12 1 billion on slide six as we said over recent quarters we ve also got businesses or parts of businesses that need to improve non ring fenced bank is impacted by a combination of high costs and challenging conditions for the sector overall revenues were down 3 in the full year and as part of those global banking and markets had a weak year in europe was sharply lower revenues driving an 80 reduction in pre tax profits our us turnaround has been impacted by the changed us outlook for interest rates full year revenues were down 3 and profits before tax down 39 our retail banking and wealth management and private banking businesses in the us were loss making in the year and profits in commercial banking and global banking and markets fell both fell by more than 20 turning to the detail of the full year results on slide seven across most segments in our global businesses we saw a strong revenue growth in 2019 total adjusted revenues up 6 in retail banking and wealth management revenues up 9 including 7 in retail banking due mainly to lending and deposit growth in hong kong latin america and the uk and up 13 in wealth management principally from higher life insurance revenue including positive market impacts in commercial banking revenues up 6 with global liquidity and cash management up 6 and credit and lending up 5 trade finance had slower revenue growth in 2018 impacted by the ongoing us china trade dispute within global banking and markets while revenues were down 1 overall transaction banking showed good revenue growth up 2 but global markets had a tough year with revenues declining by 8 and within global private banking revenues were up 5 underpinned by our best net new money performance since 2008 on slide eight fourth quarter revenues were 9 were up 9 overall or almost 1 2 billion and that s despite 300 million of lower corporate center revenues this quarter included a much stronger franchise by the wealth management franchise given the turnaround from weak markets in the fourth quarter of the previous year and our best fourth quarter revenue performance in global banking and markets for four years and commercial banking and retail banking we can begin to see the impact of lower policy rates with further headwinds expected in 2020 on the next slide adjusted net interest income was broadly stable from the third quarter and the net interest margin was unchanged at 156 basis points helped by lower provisions from uk redress programs and releases relating to argentinian hyper inflation our asian franchise experienced some asset margin compression with the net interest margin down 5 5 basis points and in the uk ring fenced bank while the headline net interest margin was up 2 basis points excluding lower uk redress provisions the underlying net interest margin was broadly stable at around 200 basis points turning to costs excluding the uk bank levy adjusted operating costs were up 2 7 in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 our cost run rate this year was down by half and slightly better in the second half than the first and that s despite higher investment spend up 10 from the previous year for your models in 2020 you should assume that our aim is to have adjusted operating cost broadly stable in on 2019 and adjusted revenues down very modestly with rwa disposal costs take into significant items turning to the next slide on credit credit costs were down 5 basis points to 28 basis points in the fourth quarter this reflected a number of items in the uk we reduced our allowances for economic uncertainty by 99 million to 311 million against this in hong kong we increased our overlay by 56 million to 138 million and we took incremental provisions in argentina of some 125 million second half credit costs were 31 basis points so we re now at the low end of our expected 30 basis points to 40 basis points of through the cycle range given the impact of the coronavirus we expect the continuing downturn in hong kong in the first half of this year and we anticipate that we ll need to take additional expected credit losses into our first quarter results i would caution however the impact of the virus could vary materially in part dependent on the time taken to contain the virus with additional expected credit losses only part of a broader potential set of financial impacts on the group including lower revenues and volumes and credit rating deterioration driving higher risk weighted assets on capital adequacy our core tier 1 ratio improved 40 basis points in the quarter to 14 7 this reflected a material reduction in rwas in the fourth quarter that i ll go into detail on the next slide we set out the detail of the risk weighted assets and return on tangible equity walks during 2019 for risk weighted assets we ve reduced these by almost 22 billion during the year with the bulk of this coming in the fourth quarter we took a very conscious decision to accelerate our risk weighted asset plans in global banking and markets resulting in a 19 billion reduction in that business in the final quarter looking forward we are sensitive to a number of potential headwinds and risks including a forecast first quarter 2020 rwa uplift of around 10 billion due to modeling and regulatory changes and a similar amount from revenue growth for our return on tangible equity it declined by 20 basis points during the year to 8 4 this reflected a stable overall performance but was impacted by a 50 basis point negative impact from intangible movements primarily due to present value in force movements in our insurance business so to summarize on the 2019 financial performance before handing back to noel for the full year adjusted revenues up 6 adjusted profits up 5 in part reflecting much better cost discipline with positive jaws of over 3 and a return on tangible equity of 8 4 our core tier 1 ratio was up 70 basis points in the year to 14 7 in part due to a significant rwa reduction in global banking and markets however despite this continuing progress last year we ve recognized the need to continue to drive our group returns to significantly improve areas of the group with low returns currently this requires a new cost and rwa reduction plan that noel will now step through noel quinn group chief executive thanks ewen i ll talk about our plans to increase returns in the second but first i want to say a few words about the coronavirus outbreak this is clearly something we re observing closely and i d like to pay tribute to the resilience that our people have shown during this very difficult time and so thank them for their amazing commitment our first priority is obviously the well being of our people and our customers and we will continue to do all that we can to provide support and ensure their safety there will inevitably be a short term economic impact that will doubtless affect our clients and we will do all that we can to support them however the long term strategic importance and attractiveness of mainland china hong kong and the broader asian region remains unchanged and the region as a whole remains a key part of our strategy turning to our plan we intend to deliver on three action programs between now and 2022 we will implement an rwa upgrade program stripping out low returning rwas from the underperforming parts of our business and redeploying them into higher returning areas we will execute a 4 5 billion cost reduction program to reduce total costs even as we invest in the business and we will simplify hsbc to increase revenue synergies and accelerate the pace of execution we will target the following in 2022 a gross rwa reduction of more than 100 billion a reduced cost base of 31 billion or lower and a cet1 ratio in the range of 14 to 15 taken together these should help us achieve our main target our return on tangible equity of 10 to 12 by 2022 with a full year benefit of cost reductions and redeployed rwas flowing into subsequent years to be clear i do not consider 12 to be a ceiling for the group i think we can go higher and we will aspire to do so this is a deep and fundamental restructuring of the bank that will enable us to deliver on our strategy and our potential crucially it s not dependent on market conditions it s focused on things that we can control our first task is to upgrade the return profile of rwas we plan to remove more than 100 billion of low returning rwas and reinvest them in high growth high returning activities in other parts of the business as you know we have a very strong heritage with the wholesale and personal client base centered around the faster growing higher returning markets of the world a differentiated proposition serving the banking needs of middle market entrepreneurial businesses globally a personal banking franchise grounded in three scale and attractive markets in hong kong the uk and mexico on a strong international wealth business with circa 1 4 trillion of client assets that core franchise deliver strong inherent rote and sustainable growth potential these are the parts of the business that we want to continue to grow however as i mentioned on our q3 results we have parts of the organization our us business and the non ring fenced bank in the uk and continental europe that are not producing acceptable returns particularly in global banking and markets these are the businesses we intend to reshape let s start with europe we want to focus our footprint in europe on our international wholesale and transaction banking franchises and connect our clients better to our international network particularly asia and the middle east by 2022 we intend to reduce the net rwas in the non ring fenced bank by around 35 and within that to reduce global banking and markets rwas by around 50 we also intend to reduce our non ring fenced bank costs by around 25 we plan to do this by focusing our client coverage on clients that value our international network and presence particularly in asia and the middle east rather than serve in pure domestic clients we will scale back the amount of capital we deploy to our rates business and exit capital and leverage intensive product lines such as g10 long term derivative market making in the uk we will focus our european investment banking activities on supporting uk mid market corporates and capital flows in transactions between europe and the faster growing markets of the world london will remain an investment banking hub to support our global clients we will reduce our equity sales and equity research activities in europe to much our client footprint and we will transition our structured product capabilities from the uk to asia where the opportunity for profitable growth is greater and we ll continue to invest in our transaction banking and financing capabilities we recognize the need to take action to address our retail banking operations in france and a strategic review is ongoing we will provide an update on that review when it is appropriate to do so but we have not assumed any change to our current business model in the forecast shared with you today turning to the us we are one of the leading wholesale and transaction banking franchises and the leading trade bank in the world so we need a meaningful presence in the us but we need a new approach that generates acceptable returns as in europe we re going to focus on our strengths we ll reposition hsbc usa as an international client focus corporate bank anchored in commercial banking and global banking with a focused retail offering for international and affluent clients this will be a fundamentally different business to today s we will consolidate select fixed income activity in london and reduce us global markets rwas by around 45 we will reinvest the majority of the rwas saved into commercial banking and retail banking in commercial banking we ll expand our coverage of mid market corporates who trade in the us and internationally and in retail banking we will expand our products offering and increase our investment in digital we ll refocus our retail banking presence to serve globally mobile clients reducing our branch network in the us by around 30 we considered a number of options with respect to us retail banking including exiting it completely but a retail deposit base in the us provides an important source of stable liquidity for our wholesale banking and global transaction banking activities and we believe we can connect our personal banking operations in the us to our personal banking operations in the rest of the world just as we have in wholesale banking finally and partly as a consequence of these changes we ll embark upon a major cost and consolidation program in the us that should reduce our total costs by between 10 and 15 the big difference between this and previous us turnaround plans is that all of these changes are within our control we are not reliant on favorable market conditions and we have a new management team that is totally focused on delivering these plans the outcome should be a leaner more focused business delivering higher sustainable returns moving on to global banking and markets it is worth taking a step back and considering the type of business that we want global banking and markets to be we want to continue to serve large long term capital providers public sector entities and global corporate and financial institutions who can use our international network particularly in the faster growing markets we want to do this as the top transaction bank and a leading global financing house and to reinforce our position as the foremost international bank in asia and the middle east to deliver this we will invest in asia and the middle east to cement our position as a top three corporate and investment bank across both global banking and commercial banking clients we will continue to invest in our global transaction banking franchise to defend our market leadership and deliver sustainable growth we will strengthen our investment banking capabilities in asia and in the middle east while maintaining a global investment banking hub in london and we will build leading emerging markets and financing capabilities in global markets and enhance our institutional clients business we will also improve collaboration with other businesses currently global banking and markets and commercial banking both own their own products and operations capabilities they cross sell fairly successfully today but we want to offer our clients a much more integrated service to drive revenue synergies we will reorganize our product teams to serve both front line businesses and to drive cost synergies we ll combine the operational support infrastructure for global banking and commercial banking we will also to continue to invest in the digital systems and solutions that will improve the service we offer our clients so here is where we intend to reinvest the rwas that we save even in the current environment we see significant opportunities for growth our transaction banking businesses are a major revenue driver for the group and will continue to do so we have an excellent opportunity to build our international wealth franchise particularly in asia and among the international asian community asia as a whole is a core engine of growth for the business over the next few years we will continue to invest in the expansion of our business in china generally the greater bay area in particular and across southeast asia given our heritage in the middle east and the many market reforms that are taken place we believe we are in a strong position to take advantage of the significant opportunities that will arise we also intend to continue capturing market share in the uk ring fenced bank as we have in recent quarters and we see strong growth momentum in our business in mexico we will also be investing more in technology improving our digital platforms to expand our reach and improve customer experience turning to cost reduction and simplification there are three paths to reduce cost base and a simpler business first we will take out costs associated with the activities we choose to exit second we ll keep investing in technology to reengineer manual or legacy processes removing costs and improving the customer experience third we will organize ourselves in a less matrixed and fragmented fashion leading to lower cost increased accountability and greater agility the net effect of these changes will be a simpler more streamlined business we expect savings of 4 5 billion from this cost program which will allow us to substantially reduce our cost run rate our intention is to target total adjusted costs of no more than 31 billion in 2022 many of the changes we re going to make will have a material impact on the cost and complexity involved in running the group first we will combine retail banking and wealth management and global private banking to create one new global business which we will call wealth and personal banking not only will this increase our ability to find revenue synergies within a much larger wealth business it means we can remove many layers and support structures associated with running two global businesses second and as already mentioned we will merge the back and middle offices for our wholesale banking businesses this will help us sell more products to more clients but it will also reduce duplication and increase collaboration third we are simplifying the way we manage our geographies where previously we had seven geographies we will now have four covering asia the uk the us and the rest of the world each of these will be represented on the group executive committee which will be smaller than before this will increase accountability reduce complexity and improve our ability to execute at pace fourth we will be able to reorganize our global functions to match the size and simplified structure of our front line teams and finally we as an executive committee will be increasingly incentivized via scorecards to deliver the right outcome for the bank as a whole not just for our individual business units or functions this represents one of the deep restructuring and simplification programs in our history it will help us not only to reduce our cost base but also to become a more collaborative empowered customer centric business while maintaining or enhancing our risk framework taken together these actions will significantly change the shape of the group the new wealth and personal banking business and commercial banking will occupy a greater share of rwas for the group while the share of global banking and markets will reduce from 31 to less than 25 on a geographical basis asia and the uk ring fenced bank will be the main beneficiaries from the reduction in rwas currently allocated to the non ring fenced bank and the us so in summary since q3 we have developed a detailed restructuring plan to address the low return portfolios of europe and the us and to reshape global banking and markets we have plans to reallocate freed up capital into higher growth higher return businesses and markets we have begun an ambitious simplification and cost reduction program while increasing it investment this is a robust plan built around things we can control predicated on reasonable revenue growth assumptions combined with significant cost reduction and capital efficiency programs we have reorganized our management structure to deliver up pace we have established a dedicated transformation team to focus on executing the restructuring with a separate team focused on building future growth strategies and since my appointment in august we have taken tough decisions to deliver quick results in the fourth quarter we reduced rwas by 22 billion we reversed the direction of travel on both cost and headcount and we refresh the executive management team to position us for execution now we need to evidence continued delivery and i am totally committed to doing that back to you ewen ewen stevenson group chief financial officer thanks noel to take you through the broad financial implications of what noel has just outlined we expect to have risk weighted assets in 2022 that are broadly in line with year end 2019 with reductions in the non ring fenced bank the us and parts of global banking and markets increasing our capacity to invest in both planned growth in priority markets and to deal with the expected impact of regulatory changes over the same three year period we re also planning a material reduction in the leverage exposure of global markets we re targeting an annual cost base of 31 billion or less in 2022 which translates into a return on tangible equity in that year of 10 to 12 and we want to do those while maintaining our core tier 1 ratio in the range of 14 to 15 for clarity these targets exclude the impact of any business disposals on the next slide on risk weighted assets we re planning to materially reduce rwas in the non ring fenced bank and to a lesser extent in the us and as part of this and given that almost 60 of the rwas across those two entities are global banking and markets related we re specifically targeting a material reduction in capital allocation to that business largely offsetting this is planned growth in other franchises the core underlying rwa growth across the group is currently at around 4 to 5 per annum so over a three year period will largely offset the rwa reduction we re planning on basel iii reform at this point we d become less concerned about the day one net impact we now see a relatively limited uplift post mitigating actions we are planning to take on the next slide we set out where we expect the gross rwa reduction to be achieved the bulk of the reduction and revenue impact we re targeting is expected to come from global banking and markets and to a lesser extent commercial banking the rundown program is likely to take three years to execute with a dedicated team now set up to execute this the disposal losses of the rwa rundown program and global banking and markets is expected to cost in the order of 1 2 billion and this will be taken into significant items spread mainly over 2020 and 2021 with the associated net revenue loss expected to be in the order of 2 5 billion we re also targeting a gross reduction in leverage exposure of 250 billion in the non ring fenced bank in the us partially offset by around 50 million of anticipated growth in the global markets franchise in asia on the next slide we expect rwas at the end of 2022 to be broadly in line with where they were at the end of 2019 2020 revenues will be impacted by the impact of lower interest rates and the assumed non repeat of certain positive revenue items in 2019 these items include positive market impacts and insurance and disposal gains which in total to around 0 5 billion we intend to reduce rwas by over 100 billion in areas generating low revenues to risk weighted assets with very high cost income ratios and we intend to redeploy these risk weighted assets in areas of higher revenue and lower cost income ratios particularly over the medium to longer term the reduction on redeployment of rwas and associated revenue impacts will be spread fairly evenly over the three years of our plan and we do expect further benefits from the redeployment of rwas to flow into 2023 and beyond on the next slide the targeted gross reduction in rwas helped us fund the cost of the restructuring the underlying growth in rwas from our stronger performing franchises and the anticipated net impact of basel iii reform however current group capital group returns are insufficient to fund both the natural growth in our business and to fully immunize the group dividend so in an order to bridge to 2022 we when we expect to have higher returns we re suspending the buyback for this year and next we re also shifting our guidance and our core tier 1 ratio we re still targeting to be above 14 but signaling today that over the next three years we expect to be at the higher end of 14 to 15 range from 2021 onwards over the medium term as we target reducing gross peak to trough stress in the group and seek to further optimize today s capital inefficiency that comes from our subsidiary structure we plan to reduce our core tier 1 ratio back to the lower end of the 14 to 15 range turning to costs we plan to substantially reduce our cost run rate to 31 billion or better by 2022 given underlying inflation over this period and the expected reduction in the bank levy this reflects a real reduction in the order of 10 with the shift to higher yielding rwas over the same period we expect the material operating profit improvement over the next three years the cost reductions broadly fall into three buckets direct cost savings relating to business reductions these amount to around 45 of the total the organization simplification that noel has just outlined including a substantial restructuring of group central costs this amounts to around 35 of total savings and for the remainder technology investment that leads to increased levels of automation and productivity accounting to around 20 of the total the cost program will require intense focus on delivery there are almost 200 separate cost initiatives underpinning this progress will be monitored through a tight central oversight team with some of those cost initiatives starting today on slide 33 we expect costs to achieve to have been substantially completed by 2022 with full run rate benefits achieved in subsequent years expected cost savings of 4 5 billion from this new cost program are phased across the three years 1 billion to be delivered in 2020 a further 2 billion in 2021 and the remainder in 2022 we expect that additional restructuring costs in the order of 6 billion will be required with more than 90 of these costs incurred this year and next so to conclude from me before handing back to noel we believe we re setting out an ambitious but realistic plan to achieve a number of objectives firstly to materially improve overall group returns by 2022 that allows us both to grow how we want to grow and to fund our current distribution policy secondly to take capital and cost away from underperforming franchises so we can continue to invest where we have stronger returns and growth prospects and lastly to simplify our currently overly complex structure reducing the overall group and central costs and improving the capital efficiency of the group noel noel quinn group chief executive thanks ewen so to quickly summarize strong revenue growth in our target areas and good cost discipline in 2019 our firm intention is to grow returns create the capacity to invest and to build a platform for sustainable growth a robust plan to restructure our us and european businesses reposition global banking and markets and reallocate capital to higher growth businesses all while simplifying the group a path to a return on tangible equity of 10 to 12 in 2022 through a gross risk weighted asset reduction program of more than 100 billion and a gross cost reduction of around 4 5 billion by the end of 2022 we also have a strong ambition to seek additional strategic opportunities for growth and higher returns and a commitment to deliver with that we re happy to take questions and i think richard will step up and questions and answers richard o connor head of investor relations thanks noel we ve got some questions from the web but before we take some of those we ll take it with the audience can i ask you to give your name institution wait for the mic please and if you can at least to start with limited to two per person and we ll try and go around a few times so we do a few from the floor to start and then go to the web from there raul raul sinha j p morgan analyst hi good morning it s raul sinha from j p morgan maybe two please one on the strategy i guess for the plan to work the capital redeployment will be the key element and i really appreciate the detail you ve given us on where you are taking capital away but i was wondering if you could give us more detail about where you re going to capital put where you re going to put that capital into and apart from the areas in terms of geographies and businesses could you also talk about whether the plan is organic or whether also you might consider inorganic options noel quinn group chief executive so i ll deal with the second one first the plans that are before you and the forecast that are before you were all based on organic activity there is no inorganic assumed in those plans second on capital redeployment we still believe and has have seen in 2019 strong growth in asia in the middle east in our uk business and we want to continue to fuel that growth and we see that growth continuing going forward we ve also seen extremely strong growth in mexico let me just recall mexico today or in 2019 achieved a return on tangible equity of 15 and that business has extremely strong growth momentum still in it so we want to provide that in terms of asia to be more specific we see still growth potential in our international commercial banking franchise that proposition is well positioned to continue to grow i think we have a unique and differentiated position in international mid market ewen stevenson group chief financial officer it goes both ways too or equally there is no disposals built into these numbers so to the extent that there is disposals you should factor that on top of what we re announcing today and in terms of organic growth i ll just point you to look some of the underlying growth rates that we ve had in places like asia over the last decade and yes there is a near term impact fro the coronavirus but we do think there is a secular growth opportunity in trade in wealth in asia over the next 10 years to 15 years and that we are relatively uniquely placed currently to take advantage of that noel quinn group chief executive just to give you one example of that in asia commercial banking i remember when i took over that business at the end of 2010 we had a balance sheet at that point of around about 80 billion today that balance sheet is closer to i think 135 billion and still has potential to grow so we want to continue to fuel that investment richard o connor head of investor relations martin martin leitgeb goldman sachs analyst thank you yes good morning martin leitgeb from goldman sachs could i just follow up on the capital comments earlier and i was just wondering and what timeframe should we consider hsbc to return to this kind of more normalized capital level of closer to the lower end of the 14 to 15 range rather than the 15 range you re kind of signaling over the next three years for the restructuring period and the second question more strategically and i was just wondering hsbc uk sort of ring fenced bank how strategic do you consider it within the group context just bearing in mind obviously the limitation imposed by ring fencing on the utilization of retail deposits thank you noel quinn group chief executive i ll do with the second one first we see it as a very strategically important part of the portfolio it generates inherently higher returns if you look at the underlying returns of the uk business in the uk market it s an attractive market we ve seen growth in market share and growth in our own business in both retail banking and commercial banking and we believe it will become increasingly connected to the rest of the world in a post brexit world so it s strategically important ewen do you want to go to the capital ewen stevenson group chief financial officer i m go into a bit more detail on the comments and guidance around capital look in the very near term we are obviously sensitive to the fact that we re doing a significant restructuring and the precise timing of restructuring guide is in rwa run down over that period can vary and hence why we want some capital flexibility secondly the final rules on basel reform haven t been settled so yeah what you see embedded in the numbers today is a net increase of less than 2 so if we got back i think if i was presenting views about a year ago when i was reluctant to do so it was because we could see that there was a path to significant mitigation in the medium term we ve got two big structural issues that we re working through as a bank firstly we have enormous complexity in the group because of the subsidiary restructure our largest single balance sheet has less than 30 of the group assets if you compare us to us peers typically 70 of one balance sheet is the dominant balance sheet in the group as a result we have an enormous amount of capital and efficiency across the group we re also subject to 64 markets where in some markets for example were held to standardized rules are not able to take advantage of advanced modeling so there is a progressive work plan on that over the next few years and the second issue that we re dealing with is we still got i think a significant level of peak to trough stress across the group some of that is getting addressed as part of this restructuring for example we re planning to substantially reduce the principal investment business that sits in the non ring fenced bank one of the core reasons for doing that is not the fact that it produces attractive returns under base but under stress it has enormous stress characteristics so i think if we can make progress and solve those and make progress on those two issues i think we can comfortably reduce down to the lower end of that range in terms of timing that s why i use language of medium term because it s difficult to be precise richard o connor head of investor relations claire just behind martin claire kane credit suisse analyst good morning it s claire kane from credit suisse couple of follow ups firstly on the capital in the event that you re unable to redeploy all the rwas and i do know your plan to redeploy them in quite low risk weighted asset businesses now rbwm and transaction banking and the capital ratio was to go well north of your 15 range over the next two years would you consider buying back shares or would you rather that was will built up to 2022 and what is the basis for your rote target so the tnav clearly if you build up a lot of surplus capital that would dilute returns so should we expect that you are in the mid area of your 14 to 15 range by 2022 and all surplus cash will be distributed at that point ewen stevenson group chief financial officer well look on the latter point first i think we said that we expect to be at the higher end of the range in 2022 so embedded in that 10 to 12 rating target is the higher end of 14 to 15 core tier 1 being held in that year the other thing i would say on returns is we don t think 2022 is a clean year either for revenues because we ve reinvested revenues into new customer relationships where the revenue buildup takes time and secondly we haven t got full run rate costs in 22 so we do think that there is further upside on the return as you go out on capital i mean firstly i mean we have a high degree of confidence i guess in our ability to redeploy 100 billion of rwas over the next three years if we were to end up in a scenario where that wasn t the case we re not going to just sit and allow our capital ratios to accrete well in excess of what we need them to do but its our current expectation that we re not doing buybacks for two years if that was to change because the rwa profile on the capital position of the bank was very very different we would relook at it at that point noel quinn group chief executive just on the reasonableness of our growth assumptions even today with all of the challenges that exist around coronavirus we are seeing a strong pipeline of activity in our business globally and so i think we re very confident that we can deliver that growth plan we ve had delivered that or more in the past so we believe we have made reasonable assumptions on the growth and that it can be delivered richard o connor head of investor relations before we go to the floor there is just a couple of from the web on the coronavirus firstly do your book your q4 ecl assumptions do they take into account the coronavirus or as at the december 31st and secondly one from jason napier of ubs dbs made some revenue guidance recently on the impact the of coronavirus can you talk a little bit more about them expected impacts from that please ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yeah so for accounting purposes coronavirus is a post balance sheet event so it s not in our 2019 forward economic guidance at that point it will be obviously reflected in the forward economic guidance as part of q1 reporting to give you some numbers embedded into our disclosures in the annual report and accounts today is various adverse scenarios for hong kong economic performance yeah what s the downside the most extreme downside scenario in there i would say makes an assumption that the coronaviruses are still continuing in the second half of this year if you look at that and that was to become the central scenario there would be about 600 million of additional loan losses provisions required we don t think we re going to be any way to like that q1 but it s not the only p l impact and capital impact as i said earlier there will be revenue impact which will become progressively more acute if the coronavirus was to continue beyond the next month to six weeks there would also be the risk of credit rating migration among the wholesale book in hong kong which would lead to rwa inflation we think that the q1 an impact as we sit here today is probably range bound in the order of about 200 million to 500 million relative to our previous planning assumptions i think if the virus is still prevailing beyond that we ll come back as part of q1 reporting to give you a much fuller update on what we think the impact is at that point but it really is a yeah when we look at the modeling it s really a call on predominantly a call at this point on how long does it take to contain the virus when you look across the various scenarios that we re trying to model at the moment underlying that i think when you look at the underlying credit performance of the book as noel said q4 was good and january was certainly robust we are getting some positive offsets against this because hibor in particular continues to remain elevated relative to previous planning assumptions as well richard o connor head of investor relations that s a few questions from the web from the likes of tom rayner jason napier and manus costello can you talk a little bit more about the revenue loss from the rwa reductions the timing thereof the timing of reinvestment should you should you expect revenue losses earlier in the plan and a hockey stick toward the end can we just have a little bit more detail on the 100 billion reductions on 100 billion reinvestment please ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yeah so we thought we were providing a decent amount of guidance but it appears that there is still a few gaps the you ll see in one of the charts that we ve got in the presentation some sort of bar charts and please don t get your rulers out to try and measure across but for global banking and markets we signaled about a 2 5 billion reduction as a result of the rwa run down that excludes the costs associated with the run down which we will treat as a significant item we do think offsetting that will be some degree of revenue improvement over the next three years therefore we think order of magnitude global banking and markets revenues will probably be down on the order of about 1 billion relative to last year s run rate by the time we get to 22 for the material impact as you can see on the bar charts that are in the slides is in global banking and markets for 2020 overall we ve talked about a very modest reduction in revenue impact we have got interest rate headwinds we ve set that out about 1 1 billion of lower interest income as a result of reduction in rates that have been going on in 2019 and some assume reduction in 2020 the bulk of that will hit 2020 we ve got about 0 5 billion of one offs that were in 2019 that we re not expecting a repeat of in terms of our forecasting offsetting that is a decent amount of growth that we re continuing to see in our underlying business and i think the last part of that was the timing across the period broadly we think the revenue reduction from the rwa run off and the revenue growth from rwas we re putting on is evenly sort of spread in terms of the build up and run down over the three year period noel quinn group chief executive but i d add one other point and that is one of the reasons we re doing the organizational simplification and the cost reduction program is to make sure we have some mitigation so that we don t end up with stranded costs should the revenue go down on the reduction program for rwas but there will be a time lag for the revenue coming up elsewhere so i think you ve got to take the two in the round it s the revenue reduction built on the rwa redeployment program and the cost reduction program that gives us more assurance on managing the situation richard o connor head of investor relations more from the floor guy stebbings exane bnp paribas analyst morning it s guy stebbings from exane bnp paribas can i come back firstly to capital being created from the plan if we think about the 100 billion of gross takeout that you re guiding to but in the plan no buybacks before 2022 so you ve only got the ordinary dividend which most people would have had in their numbers i mean should we be inferring that the plan itself doesn t release any capital if you do redeploy but incremental to that it s really about any business disposals which creates that additional capacity is that the right way to be thinking about it ewen stevenson group chief financial officer i m just going to think about that for a second so the 100 billion of rwa reduction would release 14 billion to 15 billion of capital for us offset by the after tax cost of the restructuring cost and the rwa rundown cost so that still creates capital in that program but it s all embedded in the statements around the suspension of the buyback for two years yeah the second part of the question is guy stebbings exane bnp paribas analyst well it s just if we re looking at a capital ratio in 2022 broadly aligned to where we are today we re saying no buybacks before 2022 implicitly that assumes that there s no net capital release versus our previous guidance but you re obviously not including within that any disposals which seems like it could be the big delta ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yeah if those disposals create value i mean obviously it depends on the realization proceeds of those disposals and the so possibly but i don t i mean if you think about some of the stuff that s been speculated about in the press just remember that we have a lot of network markets that are relatively small if we were to dispose of any of them i don t think it s going to have a material impact on our capital base overall so yeah the big driver is things like interest rates the speed of the rwa rundown the speed of the redeployment all of that is going to have a far greater impact on the capital position of the bank guy stebbings exane bnp paribas analyst thanks and can i just come back to the capital target quickly and the peak to trough stresses that you referenced if we look at the bank of england stress test and we look the other component parts of the capital stack consider some trapped capital it still feels like quite a conservative target so is this very much an internal stress that you re applying that just ewen stevenson group chief financial officer it s not it s certainly not driven by what the regulators think we will always drive our capital targets by the higher of regulatory constraints and what we think we have a more conservative view than the pra on where our capital position should be i think look an offset to that is we are the best rated of the u k banks as you know with our credit ratings we get wholesale funding costs therefore that are substantially cheaper than our competitors we ve always wanted to position ourselves as a very strongly rated strong balance sheet bank we get the benefit of that through funding costs but it s certainly not driven by any conversation we ve been having with the pra guy stebbings exane bnp paribas analyst so we can t lean on new bank of england disclosure on stress test in this year as a guide it s more about ewen stevenson group chief financial officer no no no the stress testing issue is our own internal issue it s something that we ve recently strengthened our stress testing team under new leadership and we do think that we can make material progress over the next few years on reducing the peak to trough delta that we re seeing in our stress test results richard o connor head of investor relations magdalena magdalena stoklosa morgan stanley analyst thanks very much could you give us a little bit more sense of the of your cost trajectory that s particularly slide 32 that i m referring to what assumptions are embedded in your severance costs over the next over the time of the restructuring but also if you could give us a direction of where the investments go and also the sense of the flex in that cost base so we ve got the 31 billion at the end of 2022 should the revenue surprise on the upside or the downside how will that number flex to noel quinn group chief executive you can tell me how the revenues will flex i ll tell you how the costs flex i mean clearly we position the cost base to be in the context of the revenue growth opportunity at the moment based on the current assumptions we believe 31 billion or less is an appropriate position should the economy and the growth be better we ll invest in the business should it be different we ll take a different course of action ewen stevenson group chief financial officer as you can see on slide 32 there is a light gray bar there that has a significant component of investment and growth but broadly we expect cost to be flat down in the next three years and getting down to 31 billion by the time you take the underlying inflation rate in the bank at the moment it s about 2 5 per annum we are expecting a 700 million that order of magnitude reduction in the bank levy from 2022 onwards if you back those two out i mean what s embedded in the plan is about a 10 reduction in real terms but importantly there s a significant component in there for growth investment if we don t see the growth coming we ll just scale back their growth investment magdalena stoklosa morgan stanley analyst and the severance ewen stevenson group chief financial officer pardon noel quinn group chief executive severance ewen stevenson group chief financial officer well the detailed assumptions based on where people are leaving and what the cost of them leaving which vary substantially across the world so severance costs in continental europe as you know are substantially higher than they are in other parts of the world but all of that is reflected into the numbers and we ve provided breakdown on one of the slides of what the breakdown of the cost to achieve that with about 40 of that i think is severance related noel quinn group chief executive and we go with the timing of that cta as well so you have that timing in the slide ewen stevenson group chief financial officer but i think the other important thing to remember on some of the job cut numbers that have been stated today we currently have attrition of 25 000 people a year so in the context of the 35 000 job number over three years we anticipate about 75 000 people leaving the bank naturally over the next three years and if we can be smart on recruitment against that we can materially reduce headcount over a three year period without having to pay any severance costs against that aman rakkar barclays analyst good morning guys it s aman rakkar from barclays i m just going to come back to capital and run the risk of asking too detailed a question it s just to interrogate the kind of cautiousness that the message that s coming across regarding capital i mean basically when i do some pretty crude back of the envelope math it does look like you re going to accrete pretty significant capital over the plan period even if you do redeploy the 100 billion of rwas i mean basically if profits are broadly maintained at that current level you re going to pay away basically half of that in the dividend post the script and if i times that by three obviously we ve got to take out the restructuring charge it does basically look like you re going to build about 150 basis points to 160 basis points of capital from where you are now so well above 16 i mean first of all is there anything there that you disagree with and secondly does that mean that there s some kind of intangible asset build or some cet1 deduction that we should be mindful of over the plan period ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes it s hard to have the debate in the absence of numbers but the it feels a little bit high i mean maybe if you can sort of step through your model with ir afterwards we can figure out why but i would sort of go back to claire s question earlier if we see our capital ratios accreting comfortably above 15 we re not going to allow that to happen and we will manage our capital base appropriately for how much capital we need the same way in 2019 we undertook a 1 billion buyback as we felt we had the capacity to do that so we did it so if we are being cautious that s a good thing and if we do accrete more capital than we think because of our caution then we ll take action against that richard o connor head of investor relations a couple on hong kong from the web one from ronit ghose on the q4 asian nim down five basis points is that the effective run rate for asian nim going forward can you talk a little bit about that and then from vincent guao asking about the stage 2 growth in hong kong balances in the second half and provide a bit more color on what drove that please ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yeah on asian nim we did see some asset margin compression the other thing is a significant portion of the hong kong deposit base is u s dollar based so u s dollar interest rates are down so you will see ongoing impact of that i ve given up since i ve arrived at the bank trying to predict the trajectory of hibor but we re obviously very sensitive to the trajectory of hibor and in some ways as i said earlier it s sort of linked to the coronavirus where it s remaining high at the moment so but we would expect hibor this year and we ve got that in our economic forecast to decline at some point during the year in terms of a stage 2 i mean look hong kong pre the coronavirus has been facing some difficult economic circumstances and all you re seeing is the natural migration i think of their credit book but richard will have the numbers but the underlying if you looked without the quality of the hong kong credit book is yeah you have to imagine some extremely difficult scenarios as i said earlier shifting to assuming coronavirus continues for most of this year only gets you to incremental provisioning of 600 million in hong kong so we don t expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year richard o connor head of investor relations okay ian over in the corner ian gordon investec analyst hi ian gordon from investec can i just have one question on the u s please correct me if i m wrong but i don t think there s any suggestion that the u s will ever be anything other than the drag to group returns so obviously i welcome what you ve announced retaking capital out of gbm and slashing costs within the retail business but in terms of the reallocation within that geography is it based on genuine enthusiasm for the opportunities you see or is it based on some other structural restriction e g scale requirements time it takes to extract capital under ccar or something else noel quinn group chief executive we do see the plan delivering acceptable returns in the u s business over the medium term so we see a significant increase in returns that s a combination of the reduction in the balance sheet in the global markets business a refocusing of the retail business we do believe there is an opportunity to serve international clients in the u s but we also believe it s important to have a stable balance sheet in the u s to support our global market leading capabilities in transaction banking and trade and that the package together is the right package we did look hard at what we do in the u s and did we look to dispose of the retail business we looked hard at that we don t think that s the right answer to be honest if i wanted an easy headline and i wanted an easier day to day i d have just made the decision to sell the u s retail business but i genuinely don t believe that s the right answer for us as a bank i don t think it s the right answer for our business in the u s or for our business globally you ve got to remember we are the market leading global transaction banking business and circa 70 of that transaction banking business is denominated in u s dollars we cannot put that business at risk by having a subscale inappropriate or high risk business in the u s that is not able to fund itself so that is an important part of buying in hsbc is that global transaction banking business now many people said we wouldn t be able to turn around the mexico retail business five six years ago and were advising us to sell that at that point in time well nuno is here in the room today him and his management team in mexico have done an excellent job that business today is growing significantly double digit year on year and high double digit and it s generating return on tangible equity today of 15 with strong momentum for future growth we have to achieve that same outcome in the u s not just because of the u s business because of what it means to be in the u s for our broader hsbc strategy so the easier decision for me would have been to make the sale decision the harder decision and gets me less headlines today and possibly less support is to do what we believe is right for the bank and that s the decision we ve taken and we ll give our team the support to do it please remember as well we ve chosen a strategy for retail banking now that is different to the past in the past on the east coast we were largely a mass market full service subregional bank in retail banking on the west coast we were more of an affluent internationally orientated bank i don t think it s appropriate to run both strategies together alongside each other it s inconsistent if we were to choose a strategy for retail banking in the u s it s to support the international and more affluent sector of the marketplace in the u s and our belief is that s a big market segment it s in excess of 40 million people our brand plays into that market segment well it s our job to make sure we can do it profitably and that s what we ll be focused on but it s a big enough market segment to be meaningful in fact it s bigger than most countries we re in frankly and i know i don t believe you have to be a full service national bank in the u s in order to make money but we have to prove that to you over time ewen stevenson group chief financial officer there s also just a couple of other things that you won t see on the capital side in the headline numbers that yes while i talked about a sort of less than 2 uplift on day one because of basel reform in the u s there s about a 15 uplift in the numbers so while we re showing you a sort of stable rwa picture actually that reflects a significant reduction in rwa offset by anticipated inflation so the basel reform across the globe is not uniform in how it impacts different legal entities the second thing is today if you look at the u s filings you will see that u s rwas are about 40 higher than pra rwas so a significant part of this plan is optimizing that gap and there is significant equity release that s embedded in this plan out of the u s business back to the group over the next three to four years part of that goes to some of the structural issues that i was talking about earlier in terms of the double leverage and subsidiary complexity that we re dealing with richard o connor head of investor relations joe joseph dickerson jefferies analyst it s joe dickerson from jefferies i guess this is the first restructuring plan post crisis that really seeks to address the midland back office how many can you give us a sense of how much headcount is going to actually come out of what we used to call the corporate centre or corporate hq secondly i see that you made a small release of the u k uncertainty overlay and there s i think 311 million left in that provision which is a little bit higher than the low end of what you re calling out for coronavirus what do you need to see to release the remainder of that is it certainty of a trade bill what are the things we need to look for because there s pretty much an offset there noel quinn group chief executive i ll let ewen answer the second one and i ll give you an answer on the first if i can we re not giving individual headcount targets or detail at this stage on either any subregion or business line or the center what i will say is i firmly believe that it s absolutely important to not only reduce the cost of the superstructure of hsbc in order to provide some mitigation to the rwa redeployment program so that i don t end up with stranded costs but i also think it s an important thing to do to empower the organization with greater agility and greater pace to delayer and de matrix and i think we ve had a structure in place that served us well post the financial crisis and through the dpa we had to build up a more substantial complex support structure for the businesses during that period but i think in a phase that we re going into we need more agility and simplicity and therefore that requires our central cost base to go down and i want to recreate a much more clinical divide between what is the holding company or the group of hsbc and that we should be there separate from that we should be in the countries to allow the countries to make growth happen and so i m not going to give you any specific headcount targets on that we can help you try to model that later but nothing i think at this point in time on the second point ewen ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes just on we ve broken out in one of the slides about 60 of the cost savings are coming from the back and the middle office and sort of just personalize it to the bit i run i mean if you look at the finance department today very manual with sort of poor customer control and cost outcomes as a result of that we ve got a three to four year plan to create a single data warehouse and heavily use the cloud which should lead to a dramatic improvement in the productivity of the department as a result of that and we can see similar efficiency programs across much of the back office and middle office and we ve just got a new coo john hinshaw who s got a deep background in technology and has led similar restructurings at other organizations he s led so again both on the technology side and the operations side again we see significant opportunity for efficiency benefits all of which are reflected in today s cost announcement on the u k overlay i think part of what you re seeing is the fact that the u k stressing the u k portfolio under extreme stress results in higher levels of provisioning than you would see in hong kong because it goes back to the fundamental credit quality of the hong kong business rather than any reflection on the u k post the big triggering event in q4 for the write back of part of the overlay was the election which reduced some of the probabilities associated with some of the downside scenarios i think in terms of releasing a significant amount of further overlay in the u k we re just going to have to see what how the forward economic guidance shifts during the year with yes there s still quite a broad spectrum of views around the u k economy particularly as we continue to negotiate the exit from europe this year noel quinn group chief executive i will say on the u k economy it surprised me on the upside how resilient the u k corporate base has been through the three years leading up to the point we re at now richard o connor head of investor relations one more from the web then we ll take two off from floor raul and john still lots of questions on rwas and capital and buybacks as you can expect so one with a slightly different flavor from manus costello is your plan assumes 4 to 5 growth in organic rwas to fund that you need to get a return above right at the top of your 10 to 12 rote target what happens if you don t reach that top end of the range how will you fund growth in the future or is the dividend at risk that s from manus costello noel quinn group chief executive well firstly let me just and ewen will cover it but let me first of all make a comment the rwas we ve taken out are probably yielding at the moment between 2 to 3 the rwas we re putting back in we re assuming will yield much closer to 5 to 6 so just taking out one the rwas and redeploying them you get in a revenue and a margin uplift as a consequence of that because actually the market segment is going back into higher yielding returns than the market segments it s coming out of so you re going to get the margin enhancement as a consequence of that transformation program ewen ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes i don t think the math is right actually in terms of needing to get to the top end of the 10 to 12 rote range for the reinvestment that s not what s embedded in the numbers it s a significant amount of growth embedded in the plan that s not particularly rwa intensive particularly around some of the wealth management franchise so look ultimately in order for the group to be sustainable with this distribution policy we need to be targeting returns of about 11 to 12 return on tangible equity we think this plan delivers that by 2022 we don t think 2022 is optimized for returns as i talked about earlier we re right at the top end of that 14 to 15 range on capital we think we can further optimize that and we think there s more revenue upside as we get the benefit of the reinvestment of the rwas and we think we ve got the full run rate benefit of cost that would to come through into 2023 but the previous plan that was set out in june just over 18 months ago was very much premised on getting to that 11 rote that we think we need to be the interest rate environment fundamentally changed on us 2020 interest rates are probably about 150 basis points lower than what we thought they were going to be when the plan was set up so hence why we ve had to adjust the plan we think this plan gets us back to that place by 2022 and we think it has inherent logic to it which allows us to sustain the distribution policy and grow the bank at about that 4 to 5 growth rate richard o connor head of investor relations raul and then john raul sinha jp morgan analyst a couple of follow ups for me the capital ratio looks like it s going to go backwards in q1 so just wondering if i can follow up on what you said in your opening remarks ewen there s 10 billion of model changes and there s 10 billion of inflation from is that from business growth ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes so we think over this year there s probably about well firstly on the capital ratios i think it wouldn t be surprising if it fell back about 20 basis points in the quarter i d heavily caveat there because it depends on coronavirus but we think there s about 15 billion of headwinds this year on regulatory related modeling related issues that were of which about 10 billion or just under 10 billion should come through this quarter the other 10 billion that we see is relating to business growth part of that there s always a significant reduction in balance sheet in q4 particularly around balance sheet management and part of gbm when it comes back on early in the new year but also we re continuing to see decent growth in retail banking and commercial banking so our current guidance is rwas we ll be up about 20 billion or so in q1 raul sinha jp morgan analyst thank you and the second one is on gbm specifically i think in the past we ve looked at divisional returns across hsbc and i m struggling to kind of go back to that maybe it s not relevant anymore but can you talk about where the stand alone gbm returns would look like under your plan relative to the 10 to 12 post the merging of the middle and the back office ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes a minor hesitation because we ve also got the corporate centre reallocation process that we re intending to roll out in the second half of this year which has some impact on the returns but this materially improves the return profile of gb m through the period of the plan raul sinha jp morgan analyst is that in 10 to 12 or is it still below ewen stevenson group chief financial officer yes sorry i m just struggling to get the numbers straight in my head post the reallocation but relative to the current returns the returns are materially higher raul sinha jp morgan analyst thank you richard o connor head of investor relations last question from john at the back john cronin goodbody analyst thank you it s john cronin from goodbody just a few specifically on the uk actually in relation to flow share development in mortgages in the year to date anything you can say on that additionally the recent modest improvement in deposit funding conditions in the market how do you anticipate that will pass through in terms of pricing or should there should we expect potentially some nim accretion there and finally anything you can say on the rotes you re currently printing on new mortgage flow i think you gave us some numbers on that before thank you ewen stevenson group chief financial officer so in terms of flow share in q4 from mortgages it was just over 7 so we re continuing quarter on quarter to put on flow share in excess of stock share in mortgages in the uk we think we can continue to do that as we ve talked about previously we have about a 13 to 14 share of current accounts by value with about 10 share of consumer credit and we re sitting at just under 7 share of stock mortgages so we do think that there s a long term opportunity for us to continue to accrete share in mortgages on nim i would be a bit cautious because there continues to be we don t have it but the term funding scheme needs to be refinanced by the sector it s not obvious to me how that get refinanced without some pressure on deposit funding at some point the new the return on tangible equity for the new business on mortgages is comfortably ahead of cost of capital it s very rote equivalent because of relatively low risk weightings attached to that business the other thing i would say on the return overall in the uk the return on tangible equity in the uk it is impacted because we have a very large pension surplus that pension surplus helps in terms of a stress test because we don t need to hold capital against the pension plan for the stress test because we ve got the surplus but if you were to adjust all that out i think returns for the uk business would be a couple of hundred basis points higher than we showed noel quinn group chief executive i d just like to add a couple of comments as well about our plans to create a combined wealth and personal banking business there are two principal drivers behind that one is and probably the most important one is revenue synergy we believe that bringing the wealth management capability of our private bank and to be able to extend that product capability and those services to a broader client base gives us significant growth opportunities in revenue across the whole personal customer base equally we believe there are benefits in sharing the architecture and the skills that are being developed in and the capabilities that are being developed in our retail banking business particularly in the area of digitization now we can transfer those benefits into for the benefit of our private bank clients so we believe there are opportunities for growth and revenue from bringing those two businesses together there are also some cost synergies but that is not the primary purpose for doing it the primary purpose for doing it is to facilitate future growth and some of the benefits will be the scale operations that are being built up in retail banking can be leveraged to continue to grow our private banking proposition for our private banking clients at a much faster pace without having to correspondingly grow the cost base alongside it so we believe that combination is a powerful one does and we also believe the opportunity for continued growth in our business in the area of wealth management is one that we should focus on and we re looking at further activities and strategies that can take that business on to even grow higher growth rates so i just wanted to add that sort of comment on the u k retail business richard o connor head of investor relations that s no more formal questions there s tea and coffee at the back obviously do speak to the team as the whole of the executive committee is here so do net them and ask them questions as well and thanks very much for your time

other gains and losses equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates mark to market adjustments on non qualified retirement plan investments and surplus or deficits generated by marketing and reservation system activities we consider adjusted ebitda to be an indicator of operating performance because it measures our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use adjusted ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets or amortizing franchise agreement acquisition costs these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative asset costs and estimated lives and therefore the depreciation and amortization expense among companies mark to market adjustments on non qualified retirement plan investments recorded in sg a are excluded from ebitda as the company accounts for these investments in accordance with accounting for deferred compensation arrangements when investments are held in a rabbi trust and invested changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as both compensation expense in sg a and other gains and losses as a result the changes in the fair value of the investments do not have a material impact on the company s net income surpluses and deficits generated from marketing and reservation activities are excluded as the company s

future events or otherwise non gaap financial measurements the company evaluates its operations utilizing the performance metrics of adjusted ebitda revenues excluding marketing and reservation system activities adjusted sg a adjusted net income and adjusted eps which are all non gaap financial measurements these measures which are reconciled to the comparable gaap measures in exhibit 6 should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or liquidity as promulgated under or authorized by gaap such as net income eps and total revenues the company s calculation of these measurements may be different from the calculations used by other companies and comparability may therefore be limited we discuss management s reasons for reporting these non gaap measures and how each non gaap measure is calculated below in addition to the specific adjustments noted below with respect to each measure the non gaap measures presented herein also exclude acquisition related transition and transaction costs restructuring of the company s international operations including employee severance benefit and legal costs estimated one time transition taxes on tax legislation

adjusted ebitda reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense interest income provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization franchise agreement acquisition cost amortization other gains and losses equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates mark to market adjustments on non qualified retirement plan investments and surplus or deficits generated by marketing and reservation system activities we consider adjusted ebitda to be an indicator of operating performance because it measures our ability to service debt fund capital expenditures and expand our business we also use adjusted ebitda as do analysts lenders investors and others to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be dependent on a company s capital structure debt levels and credit ratings accordingly the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets or amortizing franchise agreement acquisition costs these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative asset costs and estimated lives and therefore the depreciation and amortization expense among companies mark to market adjustments on non qualified retirement plan investments recorded in sg a are excluded from ebitda as the company accounts for these investments in accordance with accounting for deferred compensation arrangements when investments are held in a rabbi trust and invested changes in the fair value of the investments are recognized as both compensation expense in sg a and other gains and losses as a result the changes in the fair value of the investments do not have a material impact on the company s net income surpluses and deficits generated from marketing and reservation activities are excluded as the company s franchise agreements require the marketing and reservation system revenues to be used exclusively for expenses associated with providing franchise services such as central reservation and property management systems reservation delivery and national marketing and media advertising franchisees are required to reimburse the company for any deficits generated from these marketing and reservation system activities and the company is required to spend any surpluses generated in future periods since these activities will be managed to break even over time quarterly or annual surpluses and deficits have been excluded from the measurements utilized to assess the company s operating performance adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share adjusted net income and eps exclude the

your speaker today karina padilla thank you please go ahead karina padilla senior vice president of corporate planning and analysis and investor relations thank you good morning everyone we issued our earnings press release this morning and posted a slide presentation to the investor relations portion of our website which we will be referencing during this call i m joined today by gary michel our ceo and john linker our cfo before we begin i would like to remind everyone that during this call we will make certain statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including those set forth in our earnings release and provided in our forms 10 k and 10 q filed with the sec jeld wen does not undertake any duty to update forward looking statements including the guidance we are providing with respect to certain expectations for future results or statements regarding the expected outcome of pending litigation additionally during today s call we will discuss non gaap measures which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated under gaap can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix to this presentation i would now like to turn the call over to gary gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks karina good morning everyone and thank you for joining us i want to begin by acknowledging a roughly 3 000 associates in australia who for the past eight months have courageously dealt with the devastating effects of bushfires and more recently adverse weather and flooding i m thankful all of our associates are safe and that our operations are largely unaffected we re committed to supporting our employees and their effective communities turning to our business performance 2019 was a pivotal year for jeld wen that set the foundation for continued momentum in 2020 we made significant progress on key strategic initiatives through the adoption and expansion of our business operating system the jeld wen excellence model or jem across the enterprise we delivered favorable productivity realized price and deployed our rationalization and modernization program to simplify our business and contribute revenue and margin expansion over the coming periods we introduced several new and innovative products to the market that will accelerate volume growth over the coming years i ll highlight a few of these products showcased at the recent international builder show in just a few minutes we improved service and quality levels and remain disciplined with pricing to offset inflation we announced significant price changes in the north america door business across all channels which take effect this month globally our associates delivered net productivity savings during the year through the rigorous deployment of jem as part of our facility rationalization and modernization program we started production in our atlanta facility which will deliver efficiency and cost improvements with significant reductions in labor and material scrap compared with legacy operations overall we made excellent progress on the rationalization and modernization program initiating projects that address approximately one third of our footprint reduction target we made significant progress advancing key priorities in 2019 we also faced headwinds that impacted our growth and profitability from market headwinds due to reduced residential new construction demand in australia and north america and plant inefficiencies in a few of our north america windows facilities i m optimistic about the market outlook for 2020 that will help drive core revenue growth and margin expansion this includes improving residential new home construction demand in north america and expected stabilization of residential new home construction demand in the australia housing market additionally the benefits from our rationalization and modernization program and our growing pipeline of productivity projects will contribute to margin expansion please turn to page 4 for a brief summary of our fourth quarter results we delivered revenue and cash flow in line with expectations and were disappointed by our ebitda results we delivered year over year core revenue growth of approximately 1 in north america including core revenue growth across all major product lines we view this as an inflection point in the return to core growth we delivered the fifth consecutive quarter of positive price cost as a result of disciplined pricing and along with net productivity gains europe delivered core margin expansion for the second consecutive quarter north america windows delivered sequential improvement during the fourth quarter although slower than we hoped for as the inefficiencies that impacted the third quarter remained a headwind compared to prior year operational progress continues for north america windows eliminating the inefficiencies from last year and we expect continued sequential improvement in australia markets continued to soften sequentially at a greater rate than expected resulting in less volume i ll provide more detail on our 2020 outlook for australia in a few minutes but we continue to take a conservative approach to activity levels and continue to adjust our cross structure in line with current market conditions the use of our jem business operating system and tools is expanding across all areas of the enterprise one particular area of focus in 2019 was operating cash flow improved discipline in working capital and reduced cash taxes helped drive a 65 improvement in free cash flow despite a 17 5 million increase in capital expenditures as you know in lean deployments working capital efficiency is typically a lead indicator to improved operations and quality of earnings on page 5 i ll provide a summary of our market outlook and catalyst for 2020 earnings growth by segment for north america favorable fundamentals including generally robust economic growth and employment increasing wages strong consumer confidence and attractive borrowing costs continue to support us housing growth late in 2019 housing activity including starts and homebuilder orders improved and we expect this to continue in 2020 we believe these same factors further aided by modest home price appreciation are beneficial for r r activity as well while residential new construction market trends improved in both the us and canada i m most excited about jeld wen specific performance drivers in 2020 we ve announced and deployed significant product pricing actions within our doors and windows businesses in both retail and traditional distribution channels we introduced several innovative products in 2019 and we are delivering additional innovation to the market in 2020 including our finishield vinyl laminated windows enhanced fiber glass door offering and auraline composite windows which deliver unique solutions for our customers and will contribute to core revenue and margin expansion finally and perhaps most exciting are the benefits we will deliver from our jem and footprint modernization projects completed in 2019 and the deep pipeline of projects being executed in 2020 to further improve our operations and service capabilities and positively impact our margins please turn to page 6 construction activity in europe was mixed during the fourth quarter across channels and geographies with strength in central europe france and the uk largely offsetting relative weakness in northern europe we anticipate european residential new construction r r and non residential construction activity to remain approximately flat in 2020 we are well positioned for modest core revenue growth and margin expansion in 2020 despite generally stagnant markets in europe pricing actions implemented across regions in 2019 remain a tailwind to core revenue growth and margins and we will take additional pricing actions in 2020 jem deployment in europe is strong and will continue to deliver service level improvements and margin expansion on the back of one of the strongest productivity pipeline conversions in the enterprise please turn to page 7 in australasia we continue to face considerable headwinds in the residential new construction market related to prior government credit tightening residential new home construction during the fourth quarter declined sequentially and was below the already conservative assumptions in our previous outlook however our strong brands leading market positions and our dedicated associates allowed us to outperform the market r r activity remained stable providing an offset albeit modest given our lower index of r r relative to residential new construction we expect australia new home construction activity to remain challenged through the first half of 2020 while general sentiment is starting to improve access to funding remains our hurdle for homebuyers and conversations with our largest customers indicate that stabilization is not expected until at least the second half of 2020 regardless of market conditions we continue to drive productivity improvements remain disciplined with price and compete on product quality assortment and customer service we expect to generate productivity savings in 2020 from the restructuring and footprint initiatives executed in 2019 and from efficiencies related to the start up of our new manufacturing facility in indonesia this and our pipeline of jem projects will help to offset the impact of volume deleverage on margins please turn to page 8 innovation in design material composition and manufacturing processes is a major cornerstone of our strategy to drive future revenue growth and margin expansion i d like to highlight several new product introductions that we re excited about these include new esthetic enhancements to existing jeld wen products and product extensions that provide customers with improved performance and selection and allows us to capture share and expand margin the top picture shows our moda rustic interior door which combines a beautiful wood veneer with modern flat panel styles and translucent glass offered in 21 innovative configurations providing customers with complete design flexibility and control next the jeld wen exterior fiber glass door system leverages industry leading technology and component to deliver superior performance and aesthetics introduction of the complete system utilizes jeld wen s industry leading door slabs with best in class components that offer builders and contractors proven tested

market proprietary finishing process that offers the look and feel of real iron with the performance and customization of our aurora fiber glass exterior doors these new products join our 2019 class of innovation products like finishield laminated vinyl windows and auraline composite windows in north america continued to expand in market acceptance and growth contribution stay tuned as we launch more jeld wen innovation across our segments expanding our customer solutions and fueling our growth with that i ll pass it over to john linker to provide a detailed review of our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019 john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary and good morning everyone i ll start on page 10 for the fourth quarter net revenues decreased 2 1 to 1 1 billion the decrease was driven primarily by a 2 reduction in core revenues and a 2 headwind from foreign currency partially offset by a 2 contribution from the vpi acquisition the decrease in core revenues was driven primarily by sequentially weaker demand conditions in australasia partially offset by slightly positive core revenue growth in north america notably this was the first quarter of core revenue growth in north america since mid 2018 i ll speak more about the segment drivers in a moment adjusted ebitda decreased 15 9 to 89 2 million adjusted ebitda margins declined by 130 basis points in the quarter to 8 4 compared to prior year adjusted ebitda margins were impacted by inefficiencies in our north america segment primarily in our windows business and the deleverage impact of significantly lower volumes in australasia these factors were partially offset by improved performance in our europe segment which delivered a second consecutive quarter of core margin improvement from positive productivity and pricing fourth quarter net income was impacted by the lower operating results as well as a significantly higher tax rate our book tax rate in the quarter was 60 7 due to the compounding effect of the gilti provisions of u s tax reform as well as the impact of our annual review of valuation allowances driving discrete higher tax expense in the quarter excluding these items our normalized fourth quarter tax rate was 27 4 page 11 provides detail of our revenue drivers for the fourth quarter and full year our consolidated core revenue declined 2 in the fourth quarter comprised of a 4 headwind from volume mix partially offset by a price benefit of 2 favorable pricing in north america and europe enabled us to deliver our fifth consecutive quarter of positive price cost realization the 4 volume mix headwind was primarily driven by our australasia segment due to the sharply lower new construction demand in australia the impact of foreign exchange remained a headwind to revenue in the quarter although slightly less so than the third quarter as we look at the full year core revenue decline of 2 pricing performed largely as expected while volume mix headwinds were a surprise throughout 2019 given the weaker than expected demand conditions for new construction in north america and australasia as we move into 2020 we see the potential for improved demand conditions in both of these markets accelerating demand combined with a tailwind from pricing in north america should set us up well to return to core revenue growth in 2020 please move to page 12 where i ll take you through the segment detail beginning with north america net revenues in north america for the fourth quarter increased 3 1 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 2 contribution from the acquisition of vpi and a slight increase in core revenues north america pricing was sequentially stable from the third quarter we implemented price increase in selected products and channels in december 2019 and given the timing we didn t see any material benefit of that price increase in the quarter a second round of north america price increases goes into effect this month including both retail and traditional distribution channels meaning that we have now deployed our 2020 price increase across all products and channels in north america given these actions we should see meaningful improvement in price realization starting from the second quarter and through the rest of 2020 north america volume mix declined by 1 comprised of lower volumes in our traditional distribution channel partially offset by increased demand in our retail channel as well as higher volumes in canada north america volume mix sequentially improved from the third quarter and we expect to see this trend continue into 2020 we re starting to see our north america order backlog build reflecting improving residential new construction market conditions adjusted ebitda in north america decreased by 12 to 60 4 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 160 basis points to 9 4 the year over year reduction in margins was primarily due to operating inefficiencies in our north america window business as well as the channel mix shift toward more retail volume and less traditional distribution let me spend a moment on the windows performance as a reminder unusual ordering patterns earlier in 2019 unfavorably impacted our demand planning process and resulted in insufficient inventory levels and labor staffing to support customer demand leading to third quarter operational inefficiencies in our last call we said that we d expect to see sequential improvement in our north america windows business during the fourth quarter we did realize both financial and operational improvements in the fourth quarter but not to the magnitude we originally expected fourth quarter ebitda margins in our north america windows business improved sequentially from the third quarter but we re still down significantly year over year driving the majority of the margin compression in the north america segment as the fourth quarter progressed our on time delivery performance and backlog improved however we faced cost inefficiencies in the quarter in material usage labor and freight to stabilize our operations and expedite order backlog to meet customer expectations we do expect to see continued sequential operational and financial improvements in windows as 2020 progresses moving on to page 13 net revenues in europe for the fourth quarter decreased 3 8 the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency of 3 and volume mix of 2 that were slightly offset by positive price volumes were mixed by region as weakness in northern europe was offset by relative strength in central europe france and the uk we are very pleased with the operating performance in europe as adjusted ebitda increased 15 4 to 29 4 million adjusted ebitda margins expanded by 170 basis points to 10 1 primarily a result of improved productivity and pricing we continue to build the productivity pipeline with new projects and have good visibility to sustained margin improvement in 2020 on page 14 net revenues in australasia for the fourth quarter decreased 18 7 the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a 15 contraction in core revenue from ongoing market challenges and a 4 adverse impact from foreign currency volumes worsened as the year progressed from low single digit decline at the beginning of the year which was anticipated to double digit declines in demand at the end of the second quarter and growing into the teens by the end of the third quarter fourth quarter volume sequentially weakened further to a 14 decline we are very pleased with the pre emptive cost reduction actions by our australasia team over the last year as they tried to stay ahead of weakening end market demand with a number of facility closures and significant cuts to sg a which combined to deliver cost savings in 2019 however the impact of market volume decline in the fourth quarter was too great to overcome with cost actions alone as adjusted ebitda decreased 31 to 16 5 million adjusted ebitda margins contracted by 210 basis points to 12 2 due to the deleverage impact of lower volumes we remain focused on productivity and cost controls and expect this segment to return to margin improvement as soon as the demand environment stabilizes moving to page 15 i m pleased to report strong free cash flow performance finishing the year at 166 5 million up 65 5 million or 65 versus prior year primarily due to improvements in operating cash flow from a disciplined focus on working capital management and lower cash taxes with these improvements our free cash flow conversion was significantly over our target of 100 of adjusted net income on page 16 on the balance sheet we ended 2019 with total net debt of 1 29 billion a decrease of 69 5 million compared with year end 2018 at year end our net leverage ratio was 3 1 times at the upper end of our target range up from 3 0 times at year end 2018 our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong to fund our strategic initiatives now i ll turn it back over to gary to go through our 2020 outlook and provide closing comments gary s michel president and chief executive officer thank you john please turn to page 18 for our 2020 segment revenue expectations in north america we expect favorable pricing and improving new construction demand to drive full year revenue growth of 3 to 6 in europe we expect mix demand across our end markets netting to flat volume and delivering revenue growth of 0 to 2 in australasia we expect residential new construction weakness to continue through the first half of the year with stabilization in the second half resulting in total revenue contraction of down 4 to down 6 total revenue for 2020 on a consolidated basis is expected to grow between 1 and 4 our pricing actions improving volumes and productivity project pipeline are expected to deliver growth in adjusted ebitda from 415 million in 2019 to a range of 450 million to 495 million in 2020 at the midpoint this represents a 14 increase in adjusted ebitda compared to last year please turn to page 19 as i described our expected cadence for earnings improvement through the year we expect a number of headwinds in the first quarter resulting in adjusted ebitda margin contraction although as you can see we have visibility to sequential margin expansion as the year progresses due to specific drivers in the first quarter we anticipate continued market headwinds in australasia resulting in revenue being down in the range of mid to high teens percent compared to last year which will have a corresponding deleverage impact on earnings in north america the windows business continues to recover from operational inefficiencies and while sequentially improving we expect first quarter margins will still be below prior year we also face a foreign exchange headwind in the first quarter in the second quarter we expect to realize the full benefit of the north america price increases along with improving productivity and into the second half we expect tailwind to kick in from improving market demand pricing productivity and saving from our footprint modernization and rationalization projects together these factors should lead to significant margin expansion in the second half of the year before opening the line for q a i d like to note that we cannot comment substantively on our ongoing dispute with steves sons some of you may have seen that steves filed a new lawsuit against us last week what i can tell you is that the newest lawsuit they filed is related to a contract dispute and is different than the existing litigation that we have appealed it misconstrues the facts in an attempt to damage our reputation and obtain an unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace against both us and other competitors i assure you that our contract addresses the issues at hand and that we are abiding by all the terms we also continue to believe that we will prevail in our appeal and look forward to stating our case in upcoming oral arguments with that let s open the line for q a questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies your line is open phil ng jefferies analyst hey guys quick question on your 1q guidance considering some of these ongoing operational issues in windows are is expected to moderate and the trend in australia you called out in 1q not too different coupled with the fact you re going to see some pricing i m a little surprised that your margin performance is actually going to decelerate from q4 can you give us a little more color gary s michel president and chief executive officer sure so if you think about the components you just listed i mean starting with australia i mean the comp we re up against in australia is pretty unfavorable i mean we did see margin saw revenue and volume contraction in q1 of last year but the downturn really didn t accelerate until q2 q3 and q4 so we re looking at another mid teens type of percentage decline in volumes in australia the highest contribution margin in the business so that s certainly a significant revenue headwind windows will be a will certainly be a headwind versus prior year although sequentially improving we do see a little bit of weakness in the northern european markets while we didn t call that out in the prepared remarks there is some demand headwinds there and then you got about 3 million or so fx headwind that we re contemplating so on the pricing side in north america we i guess in terms of what we re comping in q1 of last year just the timing of when increases went in the carryover we had in q1 of last year yes we re positive price cost in q1 of this year but it s not significant relative to year over year improvement the big step change in price goes into effect here in february and given ordering patterns and things like that we really don t see that the full benefit of that until march i m sorry april and into the second quarter phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s helpful appreciating that there is a timing component when these pricing does come through can you give us a sense how it s been received in the channel implicit in your guidance obviously the big piece is tied to your doors business how much of the price increase have you kind of baked into your guidance gary s michel president and chief executive officer so as far as the receptivity pretty good at this point we ve issued our price increases and had conversations with our channel partners and our customers really across all our channels so retail and our traditional channels as well as builders this is for north american doors so we ve seen some significant price increases there we re starting to as john pointed out we re starting to see some business come in but it for delivery later in the quarter early into next quarter is when some of the new pricing will really hit we went out in two stages so the first stage will start to hit sooner the second stage hitting a little bit later but no real push back for that and then traditionally in our other channels windows europe australia even in terms of r r the r r market we go out with our traditional price increases which are a little more moderate john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer and so i m going to hit the guidance portion i m sure we ll get into this in the rest of the q a but i mean if you think about the 1 to 4 total revenue guide for the full year i mean that s mostly priced and we got fx and m a sort of offset each other and then you ve got from a volume standpoint but the first half headwinds from volume and australia sort of really sort of mitigate any volume pickup that we re getting in north america so most of the revenue guide is price related i will say the opportunity set for pricing is certainly more than we have baked into our guidance but we re moving into sort of a step change pricing environment and wanted at this point in the year want to take a moderate view of how much of that flows into our results in 2020 phil ng jefferies analyst got it that s really helpful good luck in the quarter gary s michel president and chief executive officer okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst yeah hey guys good morning gary s michel president and chief executive officer hey tim tim wojs baird analyst maybe just on the productivity and the rationalization efforts could you just talk to us how much you guys are baking into the year over year improvement in ebitda from those two items and then maybe what was that in 2019 in terms of a net realization number john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so in terms of 19 the actual realization from the footprint program ended up being around in the 5 million range we ve talked in the past about making sure that we do this program in a way where we don t disrupt customer deliveries and our delivery performance and so we did hold on to some of the legacy capacity that is required for us to achieve the full savings a little bit longer than we originally anticipated so for example we didn t shutdown a few plants that were originally anticipated to be shut down earlier in the year just to make sure we could meet customer order demand patterns as you think about 2020 certainly the improvement steps up from that by 5 million in 2020 i guess the best way to think about it is there will continue to be some of the offsets of ramping up and ramping down some of the legacy facilities but as we exit 2020 gary mentioned earlier we ve acted on about a third of the square footage for our overall target and so sort of our exit run rate exiting 2020 would about a third of that 100 million target is kind of how to think about it so we re not going to see all that in 2020 in terms of the calendar year realization but certainly we ll be well on our way by third and fourth quarter to showing our run rate of that amount tim wojs baird analyst okay okay that s helpful and then i guess as you think about kind of full year 2020 free cash flow is there any way to kind of to kind of segment how we should think about that for the year john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean certainly we saw a nice step up of improvement in 2019 that we were pleased about i think as we start to pivot toward 2020 cash flow i would kind of think about it being similar to 2019 from a magnitude standpoint capex is going to be a bit higher than 2019 as we continue to fund the footprint rationalization programs we saw a pretty nice pickup in working capital in 19 some of that was more one time in nature as we sort of worked with our vendor base to optimize terms and that won t be necessarily a recurring tailwind every year but it s now included in the base so i guess a rough order of magnitude i would think about free cash flow is being in 2020 is being similar to 2019 tim wojs baird analyst okay thanks a lot i appreciate it gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open truman patterson wells fargo analyst hi good morning guys just wanted to touch on your 2020 ebitda guidance it looks like it implies a 55 million 60 million year over year can you just walk us through the drivers of the improvement either quantify or possibly just rank order from volumes pricing versus input costs the jem savings the footprint rationalization and then also in that are you all baking in any sort of inefficiencies in there as well john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so as you think about the walk that you just mentioned i d start off just from an ebitda standpoint the small contribution from the vpi acquisition which is a carryover in q1 that s largely offset by fx in q1 so really the full year guidance midpoint increase that you described is really all in the core business so from an order of magnitude standpoint certainly price cost realization would be the largest driver we will see we expect to see sequential improvement in price cost realization from 2019 into 2020 most of that coming from price so i think inflation we expect to be largely similar to 19 on the material and freight standpoint and then the next largest contributor would be sort of the productivity bucket and then i would include both our organic jem productivity initiatives as well as the contribution from the footprint rationalization and modernization program and then there are some offsets from an sg a and investment standpoint there is some sg a inflation some growth investments we re making in the business that do offset some of those tailwinds to ebitda and then i would just think about as i mentioned earlier sort of the volume mix contribution is being largely neutral to ebitda in the year there s certainly some opportunity there depending on how the markets pan out but we have not baked in a significant amount of ebitda from a volume mix standpoint truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay john and then just for clarity on that sg a investment that was up could you just walk us through i believe your corporate expense was up quite a bit in the quarter that actually led to a portion of the ebitda miss could you just walk us through what that was john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so on let s talk about actuals first i mean in the fourth quarter sg a was actually down year over year down by 5 million so what you re seeing in our segment reporting is more geographic in nature in terms of where some of the costs are realized we had some true ups on workers comp and health benefits at the corporate line and there were some offsets in the north america segment also embedded in that line though is real year over year compression of our fx hedging program q4 of 18 we had some pretty nice fx hedge gains that we didn t see recur in 2019 so i would think about the year over year increase that you see in the corporate line is not real increase in dollar spend i do want to reiterate that sg a was actually down over prior year and that s inclusive of the fact that we had vpi in sg a which we didn t have in q4 of 18 but i guess moving into the 2020 portion of your question i mean i d kind of categorize the increases in four areas there will be some incentive accruals that we re planning to accrue at a higher level in 2020 that were not there given 2019 s ebitda performance there is some true sg a inflation both on wage as well as insurance and things like that and then i mentioned some growth investments that we re making in the business around really trying to drive core growth in future years so innovation r d some digital programs that we re working on and sort of reinvesting i guess after a year where we had 5 volume headwind and we really had to cut pretty hard on sg a to mitigate the impact of that we re looking to be prudent and pay as we go but make some selective growth investments in the business to ensure we can drive core organic growth in the future truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thank you all operator our next question comes from the line of reuben garner from the benchmark company your line is open reuben garner the benchmark company analyst thanks good morning everybody let s see maybe can we dive into the north american windows operation issues a little bit more can you quantify what the headwind was in q3 from a dollar remind us what it was from a dollar perspective and then what it ended up being in q4 and what you re kind of baking into the early part of 2020 and then just going a step further maybe could you just tell us what s kind of changed that s extended the pressures into early 2020 why do you expect it to carry on i didn t think that was what you had talked about a quarter ago thanks guys john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me hit the financial piece and i ll hand it to gary to talk about the improvements that we re seeing q3 i believe is the first part of your question i mean at that point windows was about a 10 million or so headwind to prior year from an operational inefficiencies standpoint q4 was slightly less than that we did see over 100 basis points of margin improvement sequentially from q3 to q4 in north america windows but we were still down close to 500 basis points year over year in windows in q4 and so relative to what we had guided to we certainly anticipated a headwind in q4 but we did not anticipate that the full amount that we end up realizing so i guess relative to sort of the midpoint of the guidance we gave back in october and what we ended up delivering i would attribute about 3 million to 4 million sorry 4 million of kind of the miss to the midpoint of our guidance being attributed to not getting back in windows to where we wanted to be but i ll let gary comment more on the operational side gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes so as john mentioned we sequentially improved in the windows business from third quarter to fourth quarter largely in part to the redeployment of our jem tools as we look at exiting q3 into q4 we had significant backlog to work down we worked on the efficiency of our plants and productivity of our plants getting our on time delivery out of those plants reset to a level that was acceptable in the channels and to our customers we ve also had significant conversations and working on planning with our north america windows customers so we understand what the demand curve looks like or what their requirements will be and we ve been able to match our supply to that demand equation so a little slower maybe flying out of it but we are seeing sequential improvement we re seeing good performance out of our the effective plants and with no resets set for 2020 and the very very close tie out with our customers on demand we feel pretty good about continuing the sequential improvement of the business and that we should see a pretty steady on time performance out of north america windows reuben garner the benchmark company analyst okay great that s very helpful and a quick follow up so you talked about some of the sg a puts and takes are mostly takes going into 2020 is it fair to say that the vast majority of your targeted margin expansion is going to come on the gross line this year john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yes yes i think that s fair reuben garner the benchmark company analyst okay great thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions so john you mentioned that you re taking a more conservative approach to layering in the pricing improvement in north america within your guide and please clarify that statement if i m wrong there but can you provide a little color on what s actually embedded in the 3 to 6 growth in north america on the pricing side and i guess kind of what the assumption is around the realization of pricing thank you john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so you re right i mean we ve given the timing of when this call is and when the pricing is going in effect i mean we have implemented and deployed the pricing at this point in north america across all of our channels it is effective in february this month but in terms of what we ll actually start realizing and ensuring that we re seeing that flow through to the bottom line a lot of that is not going to come until the second quarter so we ve taken at this point in the year taken what we believe is a bit of a conservative approach to embedding in our outlook what may actually transpire from a pricing standpoint i mentioned before the opportunity set for what we could realize in pricing is certainly greater than what we have embedded in the guide but given uncertainty around how the market dynamics are going to pan out over the next 10 months we wanted to be conservative but to answer your specific question on the 3 to 6 guide for north america that s primarily rough order of magnitude that would be about 1 point of volume mix and then the rest of that would be sort of pricing related matthew bouley barclays analyst okay that s perfect thank you for that detail and then i guess sticking with north america and you kind of highlight some of the drivers of north america margins in 2020 i noticed you didn t really discuss the channel mix i guess just what does this improvement on the new residential side mean for channel mix between distribution and retail and how should we think about that mix impact on margins assuming that distribution might see a stronger uptick in 2020 thank you gary s michel president and chief executive officer so yes we like we obviously like the movement in residential new construction and we think that that will what we saw late last year and certainly coming into this year will play well for our forward orders we re starting to see some activity there and that will play out over really the next several quarters of the year and we believe that that will certainly favor our traditional channel likewise r r remains pretty stable so the retail channels continue to plug along there as we said earlier we are getting price in all those channels for north american doors we re well positioned with our recoveries in our factories for north america windows so we feel that we can take on the new business in both of those areas when it comes and we have the opportunity as well with the work that we talked about last year on our customer segmentation where to make sure that we re focusing potentially particularly in the traditional channels with customers channel partners to take our entire product lines and that we feel that we can grow with that we ll grow along with the residential new construction piece of the business but also we ll position all of our products so we look at whole home packages and complete solutions so we re pretty excited with the market dynamics in north america that we expect to play out over the next several quarters matthew bouley barclays analyst okay appreciate the color thank you operator our next question comes from the line of mike dahl from rbc capital markets your line is open mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i just wanted to follow up on the comments around north america and specifically the volume environment if we look at housing starts we start to see a real inflection almost six months ago now and obviously to your point the last couple of months have been even stronger but the demand recovery has been in place for give or take 0 5 years and on the margin these are homes that are getting built more like a four month five month build cycle probably just given its greater proportion entry level so i guess the question is why isn t this hitting your results sooner is it some of the windows headwinds that are perhaps detracting from it or how else would you characterize why it s such a lag between that and your comments suggesting it s a second half 20 recovery gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes matt so we typically think about on our products on the new construction side at more of a six month to nine month lag between a start and our sales our lead times are pretty short so sort of two weeks on the door side three to four weeks on windows depending on the product type so we don t have a ton of visibility in terms of long term visibility in north america but i d just say that our early in the year it has started a little soft from order activity in a few of our markets in the january time frame but our backlogs now moving into february are building quickly we re starting to see we re starting to see some nice backlog improvement across all of our product lines in north america so we do we are starting to see that signs of recovery i d just say coming off of a year of a 5 volume headwind to revenue in north america you re just hearing us be a little bit conservative in terms of what we re actually embedding in our outlook for volume but we certainly agree with you that the demand environment is improving and believe that there is some nice opportunity there for us mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay that s helpful the second question is related i guess maybe if you think about that the soft patches in january would you attribute that to kind of geographic market related issues or is there was there kind of pre buy ahead of your first round of price increases and how would you characterize kind of the pre buy environment and the inventory in the channel in indoor specifically in the us gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah i d say the softness that i mentioned was really more on the retail side i mean the way our retail partners work is they typically will come to us with sort of a significant host order to start the building season and the timing of those host orders has been a little bit delayed which would i mean that could be inventory in the channel that they are trying to work down i m not totally sure what s driving that i mean i ll tell you that all of our partners both retail and our traditional wholesale distribution across the country are giving us a view that they re expecting to see growth and demand and unit demand this year so i would just attribute timing more than anything i don t think there is anything else going on there just in terms of when the ramp actually starts mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it okay thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of susan maklari from goldman sachs your line is open susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning my first question is can you just give us a little more color around inflation how you are thinking about that for 2020 i know you mentioned that you expect it to be similar to 2019 but just a little more color on where you are in terms of catching up with that especially maybe as it relates to tariffs and how we should be thinking about it going forward gary s michel president and chief executive officer sure so 2019 material freight inflation ended up being and inclusive of tariffs included up being around 1 of sales was the headwind as we look to 2020 we see a similar 1 of sales sort of view that s coming out of primarily out of glass and vinyl in north america and then in europe logs and lumber are inflationary i also embedded in that 1 for 2020 would be about a 10 million headwind from tariffs related to china so i would just say right now the inflation environment is predictable we do have some categories that are deflationary it s not all bad guys there s definitely some areas where we re making some nice progress but i think the best way to characterize it is it s stable versus prior year we can plan for it we can embed it into our pricing strategy for the full year susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay that s helpful and gary in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you ve got a growing pipeline of some productivity initiatives around jem and some of the cost improvements that you re making can you just give us a little more color on that how is it evolving and how should we think about that coming through this year gary s michel president and chief executive officer sure when we talk typically when we talk about our productivity when we get on these calls we ve talked a lot about kind of the bigger refresh or modernization or actualization programs so as we start working through those obviously those are contributing but in other we ve got a lot of other plans where we re just focused on good old fashioned lean deployment working on cycle time reduction and deploying jem tools in those plants so as we work through those plants we do improvement events in those plants we re starting to identify places where we can take waste out and we can improve the processes and take cost out so in each one of our segments we ve been driving toward improved pipelines for productivity programs like those and we have been transforming those plants and those operations to do that so as we built through last year the pipeline certainly increased we started to execute and realize benefits from those productivity projects coming into 2020 the pipeline is much stronger it s kind of right in front of us we get a little bit of benefit obviously from programs that were deployed in 2019 and then we ll continue to deploy those throughout the year and get the benefits from them as well so cycle time reduction obviously material cost improvements but really deploying jem more broadly across the organization susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay and so then just as a quick follow up to that with the improvement in working capital that you saw in 2019 and i know you mentioned that you are working with your suppliers and got some benefits from that should we expect a similar level coming through in 2020 or kind of further improvements as some of these cycle times and material improvements come through gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes i think as john mentioned working with suppliers on rationalizing our terms was one of the benefactors last year as we continue to improve our cycle time and deploy jem across more operations we ll start to see inventory turns improve as well even more so i think that s a place where you ll see that happen and we ll obviously continue to work on receivables as well which as cycle time improves you should see cash working capital utilization improve as well susan maklari goldman sachs analyst okay great thank you good luck gary s michel president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open john lovallo bank of america analyst hey guys thank you for fitting me in here john i think you had initially framed the december price increases in north america has been kind of mid single digits on unblended basis how should we kind of think about or dimension the magnitude of the second round of increases john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and just to clarify i mean that was selective in the december round of price increases in north america that was selected product lines just within our traditional distribution channel no impact on our retail channel and so i mean as you think about what s going through in the february time frame it s a view it as sort of a second round of increases and so kind of cumulatively between the two different rounds that we ve now got between the december phase and the february phase in north america you ve got interior doors increases anywhere from 15 to 25 you ve got exterior door increases more in the mid single digit range you ve got windows increases probably more in the low to mid single digit range kind of across the board and there is a piece of our north america revenue through our aps and mmi businesses that as more non residential products in nature the non residential doors and that piece of the business doesn t have quite the same magnitude of pricing improvement john lovallo bank of america analyst okay that s helpful and then gary i think in australasia you had mentioned that there were some early signs that things could potentially kind of stabilize a bit i mean what are some of those early signs that you guys are seeing gary s michel president and chief executive officer well i would say that what we re seeing is first of all remember what caused this was a sighting in credit in australia around residential new construction so we re seeing a little bit of loosening there that being said homebuilders are still they re still seeing a decline as we mentioned in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue for the first half of this year with expected stabilization toward the second half of the year builders are clearly putting out some incentives at this point the banks have loosened their credit a little bit but it s still the availability of getting those loans and getting the values that people want as expected in order to buy those homes so there is plenty of availability to build homes the credit tightening seems to be loosening if that makes sense and people do want to buy houses so we re hoping that what we re seeing in the first half of this year will start to diminish decline and then kind of level out toward the second half of the year at least stabilize the residential or the repair and remodel business continues to do ok we continue to increase our penetration into that area as well which is and will continue to offset the decline from residential new construction john lovallo bank of america analyst okay thanks guys operator our final question today will come from the line of michael rehaut from jpmorgan your line is open elad hillman jpmorgan analyst hi this is elad hillman on for mike thanks for taking my question on 4q would you be able to quantify what the price cost benefit in the quarter was in segment gary s michel president and chief executive officer i m sorry at the end you said price cost benefit by segment is that what you asked elad hillman jpmorgan analyst yes so the whole company and by segment please yes gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes in the fourth quarter price cost benefit was in the 7 million to 8 million range versus fourth quarter of 18 most of that was in north america a little bit in europe and a little we were actually slightly price cost negative in australia in the fourth quarter just given the pressures on that market but it wasn t material elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and then the footprint rationalization and modernization benefits following the 5 million benefit in 2019 and with some of the actions already taken there i was curious why on slide 19 the benefits are kind of expected to start in 2q from these actions versus already in 1q gary s michel president and chief executive officer we certainly see a little bit of it in 1q i think we re just trying to dimensionalize the opportunity i mean we ve got some as i mentioned some plants that we ve held on to a little bit longer than we had originally anticipated that are now being cleaned out close we re getting rid of all that overhead and so i just as you think about sort of dimensionalizing an opportunity the ramp really begins more in sort of q2 and beyond timeframe it s not that there is not savings happening in 1q but just trying to sort of pictorially show it elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay thank you operator i ll now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks gary s michel president and chief executive officer so thank you all for joining us today and your interest in jeld wen we re excited about the progress that we ve made over the past year and our prospects for 2020 we look forward to

accordance with gaap the company has included in this release adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps performance measures that the securities and exchange commission defines as non gaap financial measures management believes that such non gaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company s reported or forecasted results in each case calculated in accordance with gaap can provide useful supplemental information for investors because they facilitate a period to period comparative assessment of the company s operating performance relative to its performance based on reported or forecasted results under gaap while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the company s operations and underlying operational performance the company s definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner as the company does and should not be viewed in isolation from nor as alternatives to net income or diluted eps calculated in accordance with gaap the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in venezuela and the price increases the company implements as a result of the highly inflationary economy in that market can each when considered in isolation have a disproportionately large impact to the company s consolidated results despite the offsetting nature of these drivers and that net sales in venezuela which represent less than 1 of the company s consolidated net sales are not material to our consolidated results therefore in certain instances the company believes it is helpful to provide additional information with respect to these factors as reported and excluding the impact of venezuela to illustrate the disproportionate nature of venezuela s individual pricing and foreign exchange impact to the company s consolidated results however excluding the impact of venezuela from these measures is not in accordance with u s gaap and should not be

despite the budget s long run focus and conservativism it did include many measures to reverse the slowdown but these were not clearly articulated since the budget stayed within the spending limits mandated by the fiscal responsibility and budget management frbm act enacted to set fiscal deficit targets for the government the markets took this to imply the absence of widely expected countercyclical measures but the markets may have slumped even if there was a departure from the frbm act due to fears of uncontrollable deficits this left the budget performing a difficult balancing act stimulus measures taken to boost economic growth included first the government invoked the frbm act escape clause to allow a 0 5 per cent rise in the fiscal deficit for the next two years the magic of a us 3 trillion economy is that even 0 5 per cent of gdp amounts to a large increase in absolute dollars available for spending second there are attempts to maintain expenditure and improve its quality by restructuring towards expenditure with higher multipliers such as tax cuts rural transfers and infrastructure spending on rural roads and low income housing for example the growth in tax revenue was only 1 4 per cent against a budget estimate of 11 4 per cent as nominal income growth was far below the forecasted 11 per cent the rise in expenditure of 9 8 per cent was also lower than the budget estimate of 13 4 per cent but the shortfall was less than that in tax revenue capital expenditure growth of 10 2 per cent was higher than the budget estimate of 6 9 per cent it was financed by a rise in capital receipts and borrowings and a fall in interest payments capital expenditure growth of 18 per cent is slated for next year while total expenditure is expected to increase 12 per cent third borrowings from small savings were used to finance part of the finance corporation of india s fci food subsidies so they were not included in the fiscal deficit since small savings are not available to the private sector using them need not crowd out private borrowing allowing stimulus to exceed the fiscal deficit moreover extreme risk aversion is limiting lending to industry only credit to government and quasi government agencies showed respectable growth last year and was essential in keeping the economy afloat the current frbm act is too rigid inadequate countercyclical spending makes it more difficult to achieve fiscal consolidation as growth and revenues fall fourth income tax cuts for lower slabs puts more money in the hands of people who are likely to spend it faster as does large planned rural spending the pm kisan scheme that provides small farmers income support is expected to be more effective in its second year sitharaman s budget speech emphasised the continuation of reform and initiatives for systemic improvements for example promoting prepaid smart metering over the next three years will give consumers the freedom to choose suppliers and help resolve the issue of energy distribution company viability the focus on creating opportunities for youth will create jobs and raise productivity major reforms in government recruitment will reduce duplication and improve the set of skills available the thrust towards corruption free governance based on trust is also commendable the announced taxpayer charter incentives to close tax litigation removal of criminal liabilities for business activities and the use of technology for faceless assessment and appeal are all systemic changes that move towards this goal there is a push to continue the initiatives from the last budget to strengthen the financial sector but the absence of big moves for stressed sectors has disappointed markets there is a tension however between doing more in the budget and retaining the flexibility to respond to evolving situations through sustained stakeholder engagement for example schemes to improve non banking financial companies nbfcs liquidity access have been extended to smaller nbfcs in response to complaints that they were previously excluded it is important to listen to markets and rather than accommodating narrow interests make operational improvements and take action where systemic spillovers would otherwise occur it is also important to remember that further opening of government and corporate bond markets to foreign investors can cause volatility deep domestic markets are a precondition for and not a consequence of such flows foreign debt must also be repaid in hard currency so using it to build export capability is essential since there are signs of a turnaround in growth the forecasted nominal income growth of 10 per cent is likely to be realised this year and inflation is likely to anchor around 4 per cent it will be important to continue front loading government expenditure while the direct benefit transfer dbt scheme reduces leakages government payments must be made in time to keep money circulating in the economy the government must aggressively pursue privatisation to keep the fiscal deficit in check and direct funds toward productive expenditure corporatisation of public sector enterprises transforms them into profitable independent entities that are free to raise resources in the market as required the shift to accrual budgeting is a long overdue reform that would enhance the credibility of the budgeting process as would incorporating more realistic countercyclical measures in the frbm rationalising unproductive subsidies and falling interest payments as the central bank acts to reduce spreads will lower revenue deficits the transparency about off balance sheet financing and plans to continue fiscal consolidation already improves credibility ashima goyal is professor of economics at

from such forecast prices and costs could be material the estimated future net revenue from the production of the disclosed oil and natural gas reserves in this news release does not represent the fair market value of these reserves the estimates of reserves for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as estimates of reserves for all properties due to the effects of aggregation there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil reserves and the future cash flows attributed to such reserves the reserve and associated cash flow information set forth above are estimates only in general estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon a number of variable factors and assumptions such as historical production from the properties production rates ultimate reserve recovery timing and amount of capital expenditures marketability of oil and natural gas royalty rates the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs all of which may vary materially for those reasons estimates of the economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves attributable to any particular group of properties classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary the company s actual production revenues taxes and development and operating expenditures with respect to its reserves will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be material all evaluations and reviews of future net revenue are stated prior to any provisions for interest costs or general

introductory remarks by fabio panetta member of the executive board of the ecb at the european parliamentary week it is an honour for me to speak here today economic and monetary union emu calls for european and national policies to work in sync which in turn requires close cooperation between european institutions and you european and national parliamentarians from the start the emu project has been accompanied by two central debates the first relates to the order of integration with some arguing that political convergence should come before monetary union and others reasoning that economic integration would spur political integration and the second relates to the question of whether to already incorporate new members into the euro area or first deepen its institutional underpinnings these debates highlight choices that go beyond economic considerations they reflect europe s common will to grow closer together over time that political commitment has proven to be stronger than many believed but if this commitment is to endure it will need to be supported by effective policies i see two priorities here first as the euro area widens the need to make the architecture of emu fit for purpose becomes increasingly urgent second in the interests of both new and existing euro area members we need to collectively ensure that accession is fully prepared this will avoid emu being deepened too slowly or widened too fast harnessing the benefits of economic integration the case for european economic integration remains as strong as ever if not stronger on their own european economies are too small to withstand spillovers from large economic regions to leverage power in international trade negotiations or to enjoy a sizeable international role for their currency cooperating at the european level and sharing a currency increases their influence in the world take the euro itself it represents a political bond but also acts as a source of economic strength as the world s second most used currency the euro allows countries to invoice trade in their own currency reducing the pass through of exchange rate volatility to import prices and thus to inflation membership of the euro area gives countries a genuine voice in setting a shared monetary policy rather than de facto accepting a policy set elsewhere but economic integration needs to be managed effectively if we are to reap its full benefits as more countries join the euro area its economic structure becomes more diverse and the potential for spillovers between countries and financial structures grows larger if insufficiently managed this interconnectedness can exacerbate business cycle misalignments between countries thus reducing the traction of the single monetary policy during the crisis this theoretical observation became viscerally real the incomplete nature of emu led to a debt crisis related recession in 2012 13 which was unique to the euro area economy it complicated the monetary policy process and contributed to the need for specific non standard monetary policy instruments to address fragmentation the ecb rose to this challenge and fulfilled its mandate stabilising inflation in the euro area in the process it supported economic growth and job creation since the start of its recovery in 2013 the euro area economy has created over 11 million jobs and according to some estimates about one third of the 5 percentage point increase in the employment rate observed in the euro area as a whole since mid 2014 is due to the ecb s measures significant steps were also taken to make the emu architecture more resilient by creating joint banking supervision a common system to deal with failing banks and the european stability mechanism to help countries in need but as we can see from recent developments more needs to be done inflation is still below the governing council s aim and while growth is showing signs of stabilisation it remains modest against this background the euro area economy will continue to require support from our monetary policy for as long as necessary to ensure the robust convergence of inflation to our aim the incomplete nature of emu is a part of this story monetary policy has been insufficiently flanked by support from fiscal and other policies this in turn has conceivably led to lower growth and inflation than would otherwise have been the case accelerating the deepening of economic and monetary union critically risk sharing between countries remains lower in the euro area than in other economic regions it is estimated that since the start of emu around 80 of a country specific shock to gdp growth has remained unsmoothed in the euro area thus amplifying fluctuations in citizens consumption which ultimately worsens their welfare by contrast in the united states less than 40 of a shock to state specific gdp was not smoothed over the same period in the united states smoothing is mainly undertaken by private investors and companies who by diversifying their holdings across states can mitigate recessionary pressures in their own state through financial income from other jurisdictions not hit by negative shocks the crisis has once again reminded us of a fundamental lesson as the euro area is set to widen it must strengthen its institutional structure the most urgent task we face is to complete both banking union and capital markets union thereby increasing cross border ownership of assets and bringing about a more balanced financial structure the diversity of the euro area would then become a source of strength rather than weakness as financial holdings would be diversified across a wider set of countries and assets moreover the market would then cushion economic shocks reducing the need for public money but more integrated financial markets on their own are not enough a monetary union as diverse as the euro area also needs a common fiscal instrument to maintain convergence when firms and households collectively retreat across the union as the euro area widens and the preferences of its members become more varied it may become more challenging to find agreement on such projects this is due less to insurmountable differences indeed cultural diversity across the eu is estimated to be of a similar magnitude to that in the united states despite of the unifying role of language unity in the latter country than to divisions in decision making this reinforces the case for building strong institutions with a clear mandate and full democratic backing particularly as the euro area widens an agenda for widening the euro area should thus be accompanied by an agenda for deepening and the two should be treated together in policy discussions ensuring that euro area accession is beneficial to all a deeper emu however does not absolve countries from their responsibilities experience shows that adopting the single currency can give rise to significant opportunities but opportunities are there to be used or to be wasted history provides examples of both ensuring that new euro area countries meet the economic and legal conditions for successful membership therefore remains indispensable and critically is in everyone s interest and while it is important of course that countries adopt the eu s body of law before joining the eu and fulfil the numerical convergence criteria before adopting the euro these steps are not in themselves sufficient to benefit from membership of the eu and the euro area on a lasting basis relentless efforts must be made over time to implement countercyclical fiscal and macroprudential measures proper debt management sound banking supervision and growth enhancing structural policies there will be neither resilience nor convergence unless national and eu authorities give the utmost priority to enhancing their institutions and governance in the words of the eu treaties we need sustained convergence it is in the interest of all member states to avoid time inconsistency that is frontloading the economic benefits of joining the euro area whilst incurring the cost of insufficient convergence at a later stage the launch of monetary union was accompanied by a pronounced convergence of long term interest rates but many countries failed to use the resulting boost to public and private finances to address existing imbalances or increase productive investment many of the countries that joined later have performed more positively this was true of the baltic states for example and also of slovakia which since adopting the euro has seen its gdp grow each year by around 0 9 percentage points more than its immediate neighbour the czech republic this shows that it is possible to capitalise on the higher trade and investment that come with joining the euro area and the process of adopting the euro has itself evolved in particular any country that wishes to join the euro area must now be sufficiently ready not only for the single currency but also for the banking union a prospective member has to request close cooperation between its national banking supervisor and the ecb meaning that its banking sector undergoes a comprehensive assessment potential weaknesses are addressed and the banking sector is supervised by the ecb this aims to mitigate the risk to the extent possible of banks failing in the future thereby weakening the economy and the public finances of one country with negative spillovers across the entire euro area the question of whether to expand the euro area is and should remain a political decision to be taken by citizens and their elected representatives at the same time the economic and legal conditions for successful participation require careful scrutiny in the interest of all parties conclusion let me conclude rather than arguing about whether it is more important to widen or to deepen the union i have made the case today that any expansion of the euro area must be accompanied by measures to deepen it both politically and economically deepening emu also hinges on the ambition of national governments in the council we have the concepts for how to deepen the union but we also need the political will to implement them parliaments have a critical role to play the european parliament and national parliaments can drive forward legislative integration they can look out for spillovers from national policies to the rest of the euro area and they can hold european actors and national governments accountable for their action or inaction on emu thank you for your attention
perhaps tullow oil plc the company at the heart of kenya s much hyped oil fortune is a fraud perhaps the british oil explorer is just unlucky business in the world of oil and gas exploration has not been impressive in fact the sharp drop in the global prices of crude oil has cast a dark shadow on tullow s financial prospects the result has been a violent shake up of its c suite which has in turn led to a bloodbath at its counter at the london stock exchange in just three months shareholders have lost sh180 6 billion in paper wealth the shockwaves have crossed the atlantic hitting kenyan shores hard with tullow s local subsidiary tullow kenya announcing staff cuts globally the firm is expected to put 300 employees on the chopping block tullow kenya managing director martin mbogo said the restructuring is group wide and informed by tullow s announcement in december that its global oil production and associated revenues in 2020 and beyond would be lower than forecast in kenya the team will be reduced and will only be focused on the critical path activities that will allow us to continue to target fid final investment decision at the end of 2020 said mr mbogo slipping away tullow may just rise from financial ruin and guide kenya into the long awaited economic bliss that comes with being an oil exporter few kenyans believe this though people are disgruntled and have taken to social media to rail at the tullow project calling it a scandal perhaps there was no commercially viable oil after all they claim indeed nearly nine years after kenya s 2012 announcement that it had struck oil the dream seems to be slipping away for three decades tullow has been more than just an oil explorer it has been an alchemist of sorts a biblical david that has outwitted many goliaths by turning impossibilities into possibilities where oil and gas behemoths such as shell bp exxon total and chevron only found traces of oil in turkana the british explorer found relatively high deposits of the mineral the oil find said tullow could be monetised catapulting kenya into the league of oil exporting countries but now some experts have cast doubt on the size of the country s oil reserves and poor global prices of the commodity have added to the gloom further the government and tullow are yet to decide on how commercial oil production will proceed there is also no infrastructure for extracting oil on a large scale basis and the project is not backed by a vision on how this new oil wealth can be realised even worse tullow s finances are now in a shambles but the firm which traces its origins to ireland is bullish we would not be investing what we have if we thought the resources were not commercially viable said mbogo but a financial risk expert with experience in oil and gas exploration in central africa and north america believes the situation kenya finds itself in is one of hype gone wrong it is he says a mix of two situations one being a miscalculation which is typical from mid sized oil producers like tullow the other is that of a resource owner such as kenya that does not understand the reality of earning rent on the natural resource said the expert who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media once oil is struck he said it is pegged as being a p50 resource this means it has a 50 per cent chance of being produced tullow had spent money to get to this stage and indeed done an honest job he explained unfortunately political announcements about the find became pegged on dollar earnings from the projected number of barrels that would be produced years after the oil find however the only known income realised so far is sh1 2 billion from the early oil pilot scheme which was highlighted in government data showing a jump in oil export revenue unfortunately despite the modest gain the government appears unprepared and tight lipped on the way forward after spending close to sh7 billion of taxpayers cash to axle up tullow s exploration efforts the government has not issued clear timelines on how the country s oil will be monetised when tullow announced that it had struck oil in turkana kiraitu murungi the then energy minister was quoted saying the oil that was discovered in uganda is much lower than what has been discovered in kenya best case scenario these fighting words from the current meru governor according to our source was to make the government s income appear very large and the announcement was followed by tullow saying it could pump out 750 million barrels of oil from the lokichar basin to add on to the hopes of the people of turkana and kenyans in general the firm said further exploration could add to the barrels recoverable from the region tullow has however since revised the recoverable oil from the lokichar oil blocks downwards to 560 million barrels it however explained that the 750 million barrels were a best case scenario and that 560 million barrels present a more realistic case an even more realistic scenario however is 250 million barrels with recovery at more than 90 per cent but what is an oil reserve and is it any different from an oil resource by the time mr murungi was being quoted in 2012 and made claims that were neither approved nor denied by tullow kenya had an oil resource with a 50 per cent chance of being produced however p50 resources do not always become p90 reserves that is an amount you can safely budget costs and revenue of extraction against said our source moreover even these reserves fluctuate in value when prevailing factors such as the global price of a barrel of oil are taken into account which is what is technically known as net present value npv npv is calculated by subtracting the cost of extraction over the lifetime of an oil field from the price per barrel that npv of course also influences what the government earns and what the value of pipeline infrastructure would be many mid sized firms such as tullow badly underestimate these costs said the expert thus stretching their finances by the time kenya struck oil brent crude oil a type of sweet light crude oil averaged 111 67 sh11 200 per barrel approximately 159 litres of crude oil make a barrel today that price per barrel has plunged to under 60 sh6 000 the kenyan economy had staked its hopes on mining and oil resources which would enhance economic growth once their full scale exploitation commenced according to a 2014 treasury document it is expected therefore that economic growth by 2018 will be relatively higher than the current estimates due to the impact from this sector oil as well as the standard gauge railway said the exchequer in its 2014 budget policy statement one study by the world bank even estimated that the government would rake in close to sh900 billion from oil revenues enough to pay for the standard gauge railway sgr project and with a flurry of oil exploration and development in the region kenya saw an opportunity to become the preferred regional petroleum transporter of choice a planned crude pipeline from lokichar to lamu is part of the multi billion shilling lamu port south sudan ethiopia transport lapsset corridor with the ongoing exploration for petroleum and gas regional petroleum and oil potentials and strategic location of the port of mombasa and lamu it is imperative that kenya starts to invest in an oil pipeline to position itself as a preferred regional petroleum transporter of choice said the treasury in 2014 but then uganda changed tune opting for the tanzanian route for its pipeline moreover oil and gas though in its infancy stage has been weaved into president uhuru kenyatta s big four agenda as a job creator the treasury has also created a fund for the country s newfound wealth as the oil frenzy built up to a crescendo some analysts have linked this new optimism to the government s fiscal priorities which has seen it go on a borrowing spree spiking the country s debt levels to sh6 trillion pre resource curse the international monetary fund has labelled this phenomenon the pre resource curse where countries embark on risky borrowing on the back of overly rosy projections studies do not include kenya but ghana tanzania lebanon mongolia and sierra leone are just some of the countries that have suffered the pre resource course although tullow kenya boss mbogo denies that there are plans for tullow to exit the kenyan oil blocks and that it has always wanted to reduce its equity by half to 25 per cent international media reports say tullow plc is ready to throw in the towel the 35 year old firm has had enough of the wildcatting where it has been venturing into countries like kenya uganda and ethiopia painstakingly digging for black gold as part of its cost saving initiative the new management has significantly slashed its exploration budget saddled in debt the company is open to offers at a proper value as a result as things stand kenyans might as well continue nursing their dream of becoming oil exporters on their own will the sale of kenyan holdings earn the trinity of tullow canada s africa oil and france s total enough money to recover their investment what will be left for kenyans according to the petroleum act the sharing of profit oil is based solely on production volumes with the maximum state share achieved when production exceeds 100 000 barrels a day tullow s estimates on how much kenya can pump out once commercial production begins will be clearer after the fid is done this should go on for 25 years in corporate finance lingo fid is the equivalent of eating the pudding to determine its taste the fid was to be completed in late 2019 black gold with this the country would know if it has enough of the black gold to warrant a seat at the high table of major oil exporting countries like nigeria most likely kenya will square out with small time oil producers such as uzbekistan which is so far the only country with comparable oil wealth to kenya s the two countries have around 600 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves each compared to uganda s 6 5 billion and ghana s seven billion petroleum principal secretary andrew kamau had not responded to our requests for comment by the time of going to press the matrix of the whole oil saga is complicated by the fact that by the time the country begins commercial production it needs to have in place a specially made crude oil pipeline of about 825 kilometres from lokichar to the coastal town of lamu the pipeline s entire length will have to be constantly heated to keep the waxy oil in a molten state for easy evacuation construction of the pipeline is costly and time consuming and should have been ideally a joint venture with uganda in one of its documents the state department for petroleum expects to spend around sh10 billion on preparatory activities for the lokichar lamu crude oil pipeline the cost of the pipeline has however been estimated at around sh4 billion by the end of june last year the state had spent close to sh1 billion just surveying the land land acquisition one of the hurdles that proved a turn off to uganda is yet to start still mr kamau told the standard in an earlier interview that it would take the country only 18 months to build the pipeline but an environmental impact assessment report that tullow lodged with the national environment management authority nema for the crude oil pipeline in november last year talked of between 33 and 35 months commercial production the country had been trucking 2 000 barrels of oil daily from the oil fields of lokichar to the defunct refinery in mombasa for export in what is meant to be a precursor to commercial production set for 2022 tullow has been fuzzy about its total investment so far in appraisal and exploration with the figure oscillating between sh150 billion and sh200 billion this figure is likely to go up as the firm gears up for commercial production capital costs are subject to recovery at a rate of 20 per cent per annum due to the lack of clarity the government was recently forced to enlist the services of an audit company to help it ascertain tullow s true investment

operating income assists investors in understanding and evaluating the financial performance of the company s long term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity a limitation of utilizing this non gaap financial measure is that the effect of accounting for non core events or transactions in accordance with gaap does in fact reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results for example the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements such as u s treasury note futures or options on u s treasury note futures do not affect the computation of non gaap core operating income in addition the company s calculation of non gaap core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies therefore the company believes that net income determined in accordance with gaap should be considered in conjunction with non gaap core operating income furthermore there may be differences between non gaap core operating income and taxable income determined in accordance with the internal revenue code as a reit the company will be required to distribute at least 90 of its reit taxable income subject to certain adjustments to qualify as a reit and all of its taxable income in order to not be subject to any u s federal or state corporate income taxes accordingly non gaap core operating income may not equal the company s distribution requirements as a reit the

rick kahler financial advisor almost every politician running for president or congress refers to the alarming growth of the national debt it is now 23 2 trillion or 188 000 for each individual taxpayer democrats blame the recent run up of the debt on the republicans who have controlled the congress and white house not many years ago it was the gop blaming the democrats who controlled congress and the presidency for the exploding debt for my entire adult life i ve heard politicians on both sides of the aisle warning of an economic armageddon from the growing federal debt whether they are warning about or defending the debt depends on whether their party is in power such inauthenticity can understandably leave much of the public apathetic and untrusting of what politicians say most americans understand that no individual corporation or government entity can sustainably continue spending more revenue than they receive it s also not hard to understand that the only way to spend more than you receive is to borrow as debt grows eventually lenders credit card companies banks investors etc stop providing the new money that keeps the entity afloat loans come due and bankruptcy ensues this is true for every individual corporation and government entity in the country except one the federal government the reason is simple only the federal government owns a printing press this means it can never run out of us dollars usd the us treasury can borrow all the usd needed from the federal reserve which creates usd to pay for entitlement programs interest on the debt maturing debt and anything else denominated in usd for the federal government the risk from excessive debt is not running out of usd and going bankrupt the risk is inflation and the devaluing of the usd if you can grasp this one basic point you can start to understand something that many politicians don t grasp it is one of the major reasons our federal debt hasn t resulted and won t result in the bankruptcy of the country this does not mean excessive debt is nothing to be concerned about politicians persist in calling for spending cuts or tax increases to tackle the debt problem rarely does either one actually happen given the size of the current debt tax increases may be in our future a january 30 article by rick newman at yahoo finance looked at some recent proposals 1 a new inheritance tax proposals would reduce the current amount exempt from federal estate taxes from the first 11 58 million of a deceased person s wealth down as far as 1 million this could mean 92 billion in additional taxes collected 2 a wealth tax democratic presidential primary candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders support this idea four wealth tax variations proposed by the hamilton project would tax those with net worth in the range of 8 25 million to 25 million each option could raise approximately 300 billion annually 3 a value added tax this taxes goods and services at various stages of production and is popular in many developed countries despite raising prices for consumers a 10 vat could raise around 1 trillion a year 4 a financial transaction tax this would raise costs for investors with a levy on all trades of stocks bonds and derivatives a 0 1 transaction tax might raise 60 billion a year the bottom line is that some form of additional taxation is probably coming after the election regardless of which party is in control just don t expect federal spending to be reduced or any tax increases to be applied to the federal debt either one rarely happens regardless of politicians alarming rhetoric rick kahler is president of kahler financial group of rapid city

perhaps tullow oil plc the company at the heart of kenya s much hyped oil fortune is a fraud perhaps the british oil explorer is just unlucky business in the world of oil and gas exploration has not been impressive in fact the sharp drop in the global prices of crude oil has cast a dark shadow on tullow s financial prospects the result has been a violent shake up of its c suite which has in turn led to a bloodbath at its counter at the london stock exchange in just three months shareholders have lost sh180 6 billion in paper wealth the shockwaves have crossed the atlantic hitting kenyan shores hard with tullow s local subsidiary tullow kenya announcing staff cuts globally the firm is expected to put 300 employees on the chopping block tullow kenya managing director martin mbogo said the restructuring is group wide and informed by tullow s announcement in december that its global oil production and associated revenues in 2020 and beyond would be lower than forecast in kenya the team will be reduced and will only be focused on the critical path activities that will allow us to continue to target fid final investment decision at the end of 2020 said mr mbogo slipping away tullow may just rise from financial ruin and guide kenya into the long awaited economic bliss that comes with being an oil exporter few kenyans believe this though people are disgruntled and have taken to social media to rail at the tullow project calling it a scandal perhaps there was no commercially viable oil after all they claim indeed nearly nine years after kenya s 2012 announcement that it had struck oil the dream seems to be slipping away for three decades tullow has been more than just an oil explorer it has been an alchemist of sorts a biblical david that has outwitted many goliaths by turning impossibilities into possibilities where oil and gas behemoths such as shell bp exxon total and chevron only found traces of oil in turkana the british explorer found relatively high deposits of the mineral the oil find said tullow could be monetised catapulting kenya into the league of oil exporting countries but now some experts have cast doubt on the size of the country s oil reserves and poor global prices of the commodity have added to the gloom further the government and tullow are yet to decide on how commercial oil production will proceed there is also no infrastructure for extracting oil on a large scale basis and the project is not backed by a vision on how this new oil wealth can be realised even worse tullow s finances are now in a shambles but the firm which traces its origins to ireland is bullish we would not be investing what we have if we thought the resources were not commercially viable said mbogo but a financial risk expert with experience in oil and gas exploration in central africa and north america believes the situation kenya finds itself in is one of hype gone wrong it is he says a mix of two situations one being a miscalculation which is typical from mid sized oil producers like tullow the other is that of a resource owner such as kenya that does not understand the reality of earning rent on the natural resource said the expert who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media once oil is struck he said it is pegged as being a p50 resource this means it has a 50 per cent chance of being produced tullow had spent money to get to this stage and indeed done an honest job he explained unfortunately political announcements about the find became pegged on dollar earnings from the projected number of barrels that would be produced years after the oil find however the only known income realised so far is sh1 2 billion from the early oil pilot scheme which was highlighted in government data showing a jump in oil export revenue unfortunately despite the modest gain the government appears unprepared and tight lipped on the way forward after spending close to sh7 billion of taxpayers cash to axle up tullow s exploration efforts the government has not issued clear timelines on how the country s oil will be monetised when tullow announced that it had struck oil in turkana kiraitu murungi the then energy minister was quoted saying the oil that was discovered in uganda is much lower than what has been discovered in kenya best case scenario these fighting words from the current meru governor according to our source was to make the government s income appear very large and the announcement was followed by tullow saying it could pump out 750 million barrels of oil from the lokichar basin to add on to the hopes of the people of turkana and kenyans in general the firm said further exploration could add to the barrels recoverable from the region tullow has however since revised the recoverable oil from the lokichar oil blocks downwards to 560 million barrels it however explained that the 750 million barrels were a best case scenario and that 560 million barrels present a more realistic case an even more realistic scenario however is 250 million barrels with recovery at more than 90 per cent but what is an oil reserve and is it any different from an oil resource by the time mr murungi was being quoted in 2012 and made claims that were neither approved nor denied by tullow kenya had an oil resource with a 50 per cent chance of being produced however p50 resources do not always become p90 reserves that is an amount you can safely budget costs and revenue of extraction against said our source moreover even these reserves fluctuate in value when prevailing factors such as the global price of a barrel of oil are taken into account which is what is technically known as net present value npv npv is calculated by subtracting the cost of extraction over the lifetime of an oil field from the price per barrel that npv of course also influences what the government earns and what the value of pipeline infrastructure would be many mid sized firms such as tullow badly underestimate these costs said the expert thus stretching their finances by the time kenya struck oil brent crude oil a type of sweet light crude oil averaged 111 67 sh11 200 per barrel approximately 159 litres of crude oil make a barrel today that price per barrel has plunged to under 60 sh6 000 the kenyan economy had staked its hopes on mining and oil resources which would enhance economic growth once their full scale exploitation commenced according to a 2014 treasury document it is expected therefore that economic growth by 2018 will be relatively higher than the current estimates due to the impact from this sector oil as well as the standard gauge railway said the exchequer in its 2014 budget policy statement one study by the world bank even estimated that the government would rake in close to sh900 billion from oil revenues enough to pay for the standard gauge railway sgr project and with a flurry of oil exploration and development in the region kenya saw an opportunity to become the preferred regional petroleum transporter of choice a planned crude pipeline from lokichar to lamu is part of the multi billion shilling lamu port south sudan ethiopia transport lapsset corridor with the ongoing exploration for petroleum and gas regional petroleum and oil potentials and strategic location of the port of mombasa and lamu it is imperative that kenya starts to invest in an oil pipeline to position itself as a preferred regional petroleum transporter of choice said the treasury in 2014 but then uganda changed tune opting for the tanzanian route for its pipeline moreover oil and gas though in its infancy stage has been weaved into president uhuru kenyatta s big four agenda as a job creator the treasury has also created a fund for the country s newfound wealth as the oil frenzy built up to a crescendo some analysts have linked this new optimism to the government s fiscal priorities which has seen it go on a borrowing spree spiking the country s debt levels to sh6 trillion pre resource curse the international monetary fund has labelled this phenomenon the pre resource curse where countries embark on risky borrowing on the back of overly rosy projections studies do not include kenya but ghana tanzania lebanon mongolia and sierra leone are just some of the countries that have suffered the pre resource course although tullow kenya boss mbogo denies that there are plans for tullow to exit the kenyan oil blocks and that it has always wanted to reduce its equity by half to 25 per cent international media reports say tullow plc is ready to throw in the towel the 35 year old firm has had enough of the wildcatting where it has been venturing into countries like kenya uganda and ethiopia painstakingly digging for black gold as part of its cost saving initiative the new management has significantly slashed its exploration budget saddled in debt the company is open to offers at a proper value as a result as things stand kenyans might as well continue nursing their dream of becoming oil exporters on their own will the sale of kenyan holdings earn the trinity of tullow canada s africa oil and france s total enough money to recover their investment what will be left for kenyans according to the petroleum act the sharing of profit oil is based solely on production volumes with the maximum state share achieved when production exceeds 100 000 barrels a day tullow s estimates on how much kenya can pump out once commercial production begins will be clearer after the fid is done this should go on for 25 years in corporate finance lingo fid is the equivalent of eating the pudding to determine its taste the fid was to be completed in late 2019 black gold with this the country would know if it has enough of the black gold to warrant a seat at the high table of major oil exporting countries like nigeria most likely kenya will square out with small time oil producers such as uzbekistan which is so far the only country with comparable oil wealth to kenya s the two countries have around 600 million barrels of proven crude oil reserves each compared to uganda s 6 5 billion and ghana s seven billion petroleum principal secretary andrew kamau had not responded to our requests for comment by the time of going to press the matrix of the whole oil saga is complicated by the fact that by the time the country begins commercial production it needs to have in place a specially made crude oil pipeline of about 825 kilometres from lokichar to the coastal town of lamu the pipeline s entire length will have to be constantly heated to keep the waxy oil in a molten state for easy evacuation construction of the pipeline is costly and time consuming and should have been ideally a joint venture with uganda in one of its documents the state department for petroleum expects to spend around sh10 billion on preparatory activities for the lokichar lamu crude oil pipeline the cost of the pipeline has however been estimated at around sh4 billion by the end of june last year the state had spent close to sh1 billion just surveying the land land acquisition one of the hurdles that proved a turn off to uganda is yet to start still mr kamau told the standard in an earlier interview that it would take the country only 18 months to build the pipeline but an environmental impact assessment report that tullow lodged with the national environment management authority nema for the crude oil pipeline in november last year talked of between 33 and 35 months commercial production the country had been trucking 2 000 barrels of oil daily from the oil fields of lokichar to the defunct refinery in mombasa for export in what is meant to be a precursor to commercial production set for 2022 tullow has been fuzzy about its total investment so far in appraisal and exploration with the figure oscillating between sh150 billion and sh200 billion this figure is likely to go up as the firm gears up for commercial production capital costs are subject to recovery at a rate of 20 per cent per annum due to the lack of clarity the government was recently forced to enlist the services of an audit company to help it ascertain tullow s true investment

measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap including adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps such measures are not recognized terms under gaap should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap and are not indicative of net income as determined under gaap adjusted ebitda adjusted diluted eps and other non gaap financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate the pfg s financial performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because of varying methods of calculation management uses adjusted ebitda defined as net income before interest expense interest income income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude certain items we do not consider part of our core operating results such adjustments include certain unusual non cash non recurring cost reduction and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the pfg s credit agreement and indentures other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our credit agreement and indentures relating to the adjusted ebitda contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date under pfg s credit agreement and indentures pfg s ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness making certain investments and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda as defined in the credit agreement and indentures management also uses adjusted diluted eps which is calculated by adjusting the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by excluding the same items excluded in pfg s calculation of adjusted ebitda as well as amortization of intangible assets to the extent that each such item was included in the applicable gaap financial measure in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and in anticipation of the reinhart acquisition we revised our definition of adjusted diluted eps to exclude the effect of intangible asset amortization expense for business combinations pfg generally allocates a portion of the purchase price to intangible assets and such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation the amount of the allocation is based on estimates and assumptions made by management and is subject to amortization over the useful lives of the intangible assets the amount of the purchase price from an acquisition allocated to intangible assets and the term of its related amortization can vary significantly and are unique to each acquisition and thus pfg does not believe it is reflective of ongoing operations intangible asset amortization excluded from adjusted diluted eps represents the entire amount recorded within pfg s gaap financial statements and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from adjusted diluted eps intangible asset amortization is excluded from adjusted diluted eps because the amortization unlike the related revenue is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised pfg believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps is useful to investors because these metrics provide insight into underlying business trends and year over year results and are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in pfg s industry the following tables include a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the applicable most

thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you mark and thanks to everyone for joining the call today we appreciate your interest in vulcan materials company 2019 represented another year of strong earnings growth and demonstrated the strength of our aggregate centric business model but before we talk about our accomplishments for the year i want to spend a few minutes telling you about the good progress we made again in the fourth quarter aggregates gross profit was 274 million dollars a 7 improvement versus the prior year fourth quarter aggregate shipments increased by 4 with markets in the southeast and southwest reporting a strong growth for the quarter freight adjusted average sales prices increased by 5 5 all key markets reported year over year price growth and the 70 basis point benefit from mix was due in part to above average growth in gulf coast markets that are served by our unparalleled logistics network this growth is noteworthy the fourth quarter of 2018 made for a tough comparison with a 24 increase in aggregates gross profit 8 growth in volume and 5 mix adjusted price growth over 2017 gross profit per ton in the quarter improved to 5 32 and was negatively impacted by three things most of which are timing and mix related first repair and maintenance costs were higher in the quarter as we said before certain types of repairs and maintenance are routined and scheduled therefore the associated costs are more predictable other repair and maintenance activities are planned annually but the exact timing is more difficult to predict with precision we monitor the situation throughout the year to determine the optimal time to do the work and as a result the cost can be lumpier this quarter included several of these types of repairs in addition the rigorous inspection and maintenance protocol that we rolled out as part of our operational excellence initiative in early 2019 drove some of our costs higher in the second half of the year we expect to continue to see additional repair and maintenance costs in 2020 and have incorporated them in our guidance setting high standards is the right thing to do for the long term health of our business our employees are highly engaged and they are focused intuitively on the mobile equipment and fixed plant inspection and maintenance aspects of this initiative in doing so we can pre empt or avoid equipment failures which could result in much more expensive repair cost the second factor that impacted our gross profit in aggregates was actual geographic mix versus our expectations our fourth quarter shipments were robust in markets alone along the gulf coast which are served by rail and water remote served markets carry higher selling prices but also carry higher cost particularly if the tons are shipped by rail versus blue water in the fourth quarter higher volumes from rail distribution negatively affected margins the third factor was lower revenue and earnings from certain aggregates locations which also generate tipping fees on clean fill this result was mainly a matter of timing of projects expected to contribute to the fourth quarter instead projects were delayed but will benefit 2020 finally i ll also highlight our fourth quarter asphalt results where gross profit increased by 4 million compared to the fourth quarter last year this was driven by 10 improvement in shipments and a 3 improvement in average selling prices in addition we expect we experienced volume growth in california in spite of wet weather in the fourth quarter these volume and price improvements in addition to a 12 reduction in the average unit cost for liquid asphalt drove a 52 improvement in unit profitability in asphalt suzanne will share with you the detailed numbers in a moment but first i like to summarize our full year 2019 accomplishments and talk about how we are excited about 2020 let s start with the most important aspect of our business safety in 2019 our people led us to another year of world class safety performance despite being busier than ever we also completed the rollout of all of our strategic initiatives commercial excellence operational excellence logistics innovation and strategic sourcing we believe these initiatives will help us accelerate growth toward our long term goals on the financial side aggregate shipments grew by 7 and average freight adjusted sales price was 5 6 better than 2018 average gross profit increased by 16 and unit profitability grew by 8 cash gross profit per ton was 6 74 another step forward on the path to our longer term goal of 9 per ton and while our non aggregates segment gross profit was flat year over year the second half showed signs of improving trends in the asphalt business our adjusted ebitda for the year grew by 12 and importantly our return on invested capital increased to 13 9 as a whole we were pleased with our annual results but we aren t satisfied with just setting records our focus is on getting better every day and reaching our potential as we enter 2020 we are well positioned to take advantage of supportive markets and deliver another year of double digit earnings growth our markets will continue to benefit from both public construction demand led by highways and a resurgence in demand on the private side particularly residentials the public highway demand is there as for the revenues to support the investment as we ve seen excuse me as we said before it s not a matter of if but rather when the projects are finally started and shipments begin to be fair we ve seen we ve been a little bit disappointed over the last couple of months with the speed with which the states are letting work however we remain confident that these projects are a go in the near to medium term with respect to residential demand which we ve been a bit cautious but now we re seeing a very positive turn and leading indicators with vulcan markets outpacing the rest of the country underlying demand fundamentals including population and employment growth remain firmly in place and underpin our expectations of growth in private residential and non residential construction these demand characteristics are catalysts for a positive pricing environment in 2020 and demand visibility is also an important contributor with our geographic footprint focus on the higher growth markets we are in the best position to capitalize on public and private demand so what does all of this mean for 2020 we anticipate a 2 to 4 growth rate in aggregate shipments aggregate freight adjusted sales prices are expected to increase between 4 and 6 additionally we maintain our longer term view of approximately 6 same store flow through rate to gross profit on a trailing 12 month basis overall we are looking at double digit growth in aggregate segment earnings moving to our construction products segment we expect 10 to 15 growth in gross profit collectively this contemplates relatively stable liquid cost in asphalt i ll now turn it over to suzanne for further comments on our 2019 full year performance and 2020 guidance suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks tom and good morning to everyone in 2019 our aggregates volume growth reflected the solid underlying demand fundamentals in our market including growth in population household and jobs that is 2 times to 3 times that of other markets over the next 10 years shipments in certain markets in the southeast mid atlantic and texas were particularly strong average sales prices in aggregates increased and higher prices were widespread with all major markets reporting improvement for the full year our costs were up 4 contributing to a 48 same store aggregates flow through rate as tom mentioned there were several factors that affected this rate particularly in the fourth quarter our segment gross profit increased by 16 this continued progression underpins our ability to deliver attractive earnings growth sag expenses while higher in absolute dollar terms decreased as a percentage of total revenues moving on now to the balance sheet cash flows and return on investment we made progress in each of these areas our balance sheet structure remains strong with a weighted average debt maturity of 14 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4 4 leverage was reduced from 2 6 times to 2 2 times well within our target range we generated 820 million of discretionary cash flow and we followed our capital allocation priorities to determine the most shareholder returns enhancing use of that cash in 2019 this included investments and attractive growth opportunities as well as return of cash through dividends and share repurchases and as a result our return on invested capital improved by 130 basis points on an adjusted ebitda basis i ll move on now from 2019 to 2020 tom has already covered the operational aspects of our segment guidance so i ll comment on a few other points sag expenses are forecast to be approximately 365 million in 2020 this represents a reduction in absolute dollars as well as a reduction in the ratio of expense to revenue we already have taken steps to ensure we are efficiently leveraging our overhead we anticipate that interest expense will approximate 125 million and that depreciation depletion accretion and amortization will approximate 385 million in 2020 and our effective tax rate will be approximately 20 the combination of these assumptions lead us to an adjusted ebitda range of 1 385 billion to 1 485 billion for 2020 the midpoint of this range represents a 13 increase as compared to 2019 moving on to our cash flow expectations remember that our business is an inherently cash generative one and 2020 will be no exception we anticipate discretionary cash flow of approximately 800 million as you model our cash flows i ll share some thoughts to help you fill in the blanks as guide posts we will continue to adhere to our unchanged capital allocation priorities in directing our uses of cash and we will stay within our target leverage range we expect cash interest expense of 120 million operating and maintenance capex of 275 million and finally cash taxes of 180 million the discretionary uses of our cash involve returns to shareholders internal growth capital and acquisitions let me cover each one of those first we expect to maintain a progressive dividend generally growing it in line with earnings to a level that is fully sustainable through the cycle second we expect to spend approximately 200 million on growth capex for projects that are already largely under way as we do not spend the full amount of growth capital we projected in 2019 these projects include the opening of a new quarry in california capacity expansion at other quarries as well as improvements to our logistics and distribution network and sales yards and third we will continue our disciplined evaluation of acquisition opportunities as they arise only investing in those which fit our strategy and offer superior returns and synergies and last we will continuously evaluate the use of opportunistic share repurchases as a means to return excess cash to shareholders and now i ll turn the call back over to tom for closing remarks j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thanks suzanne now before we go to q a i want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of vulcan materials for their hard work and dedication they have taken good care of our customers and have improved our business processes and disciplines importantly they have promoted our strong safety culture and are responsible for delivering our industry leading safety metrics as we move forward we will continue to capitalize on our strengths our aggregates focus business our outstanding geographic footprint and our local execution capabilities we will also remain focused on compounding our unit margins through the cycle and improving our return on invested capital now we ll be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from stanley elliott of stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel analyst good morning everybody thank you for taking the question tom could you talk a little bit about the cost structure kind of puts and takes as we re heading into 2020 you mentioned some of that being planned in the current guide does any of this roll off i m just curious to see how you guys are thinking about the cost piece j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer sure if you look at the fourth quarter the average cost per unit profitability was as i said was impacted by three unique items and pretty much equally all three of those items are somewhat of a combination of mix and timing the first one is a large clean fill project which we will take dirt into quarry for a tipping fee the job was temporarily stopped but it will start back up in 2020 so we ll see that again we ll get that back the second item was really geographic mix it was increased volumes to remote distribution rail yards on the gulf coast which is a good thing it just comes at a higher cost for the simple reason that experience not only to the quarry costs but also the yard costs and you couple that with we had a little bit lower volumes in the mid atlantic states really due to timing of work and then the third item was increased equipment maintenance cost that is really driven by our equipment inspection efforts as part of our operations excellence efforts which we kicked off in february last year and this is really to prevent catastrophic equipment failure it improves operating efficiencies and actually improved customer service while the costs were higher in q3 and q4 because of these efforts a long term focus on maintenance is just the right decision for the company now those efforts will benefit us later this year as over time it improves cost by helping to eliminate expensive failure costs and really the expense of downtime and i would expect some of these costs to continue for a bit into 2020 but all of that s built into our full year 2020 guidance and i got to tell you i m very pleased this takes a lot of work a lot of effort and i m pleased with our operators performance here stanley elliott stifel analyst and then sticking on the cost side can you guys speak to the leverage you re seeing on the sag line i wanted to call it sg a but i feel like that tracking below 7 of sales maybe one of the best in the company s history you talk a little bit about how you re driving that down when your revenues are going to be up double digits suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure i m happy to do that and good morning to you yes the sag area which is predominantly corporate and administrative tight cost is an area where we are continually focusing our attention if you look at the fourth quarter and you look at the full year of 2019 while the absolute dollar amount is higher we did reduce it as a those costs as a percentage of revenue and that s something that we have been really focused on as part of our budgeting process and as we move into 2020 i mean look that we want to make sure that we are delivering the appropriate services to our operational folks and we have looked across the footprint particularly in those corporate and admin functions for ways to be more efficient and effective in delivering those important services to people and sometimes that is just finding more efficient ways to do things sometimes it s using technology you just use a number of things at your disposal to try to affect some change so you ll see those efforts which have already begun some are completed as we speak you ll see that reflected in the 2020 guidance and we are absolutely driving toward not just a reduction of those cost as a percentage of revenue but also a reduction in the absolute dollar amount and we have plans in place to do that stanley elliott stifel analyst perfect thank you very much for the time and best of luck j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from trey grooms of stephens inc please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning trey suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning trey grooms stephens inc analyst good morning so i guess i m going to talk more or my first question is more around the volume so 4q the 4q volume you did see a little bit of a deceleration there relative to what we saw in some of the other quarters and then seeing the volume going from 7 or so i guess that you put up in 19 in aggregates to the guidance this year of 2 to 4 you know as my first question can you talk more specifically about how we get there what your end market expectations are or your assumptions for your end markets public private non res and then residential that you have baked into that suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer hi good morning that s a good question i ll just start off with a gentle reminder about the tough comp that we had year over year in fourth quarter and then tom can address some more specific comments if we look at the fourth quarter of 2018 from the revenue perspective it was just a really strong quarter we had an 8 growth in volume which led to a 24 in aggregates gross profit so i think with the volume increase of about 4 in the quarter this year i mean frankly that s i think that s pretty pretty decent growth it s well within our guidance range that we set forward at the beginning of the year and coming off a very good fourth quarter we had last year i m not completely surprised by that j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i would add to that the 2 to 4 growth in 2020 i think is our trying to be thoughtful about taking everything into account demand timing of shipments weather comparing it to 2019 so remember that we saw a little bit slower starts and leading indicators on the private side and the third quarter kind of july to october that has now picked up it picked up dramatically and it could flow through part of 2020 as a short low or it could just what we re seeing right now to flow through we just don t know quite know yet on the highway side funding is up demand is up and public works for the first time non highway public works is picking up still there is quite a bit of unknowns about again about how fast the dots can get jobs let and to work the funding is there but it will be about timing i think we re also not going to have as suzanne said we re not going to have a first quarter 2019 last year we had a windfall we re up 13 as we had pull forward from the prior year and then 2019 we didn t have any hurricanes or tropical storms that impacted us in any material way i think the 2 to 4 volume growth in our guidance is a thoughtful approach as we put all those factors together i would point out in all of this that we will see growth in all four end markets and the one that s that s coming on and we re pleased to see is that the non highway infrastructure pieces is now rolling trey grooms stephens inc analyst got it okay and tom you mentioned the 1q of 19 having a pretty good showing there with some windfalls how should we be thinking and maybe this is for suzanne but how should we be thinking about the cadence there of the volume as we look into 20 in light of things like tough comps and other things of that nature j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think as always it s going to be timing related it will be the we ll have ebbs and flows with that but the it will be timing of weather and timing of large projects trey grooms stephens inc analyst okay fair enough thank you i ll pass it on j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from kathryn thomas of beg your pardon kathryn thompson of thompson research group please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning kathryn suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst good morning thank you for taking my questions today first focusing on illinois we are seeing a pick up in lettings in illinois you talked about lettings in prepared commentary but focusing on that how do you expect forward you re seeing work what type of projects and how big of an impact could we build only have a state that has relatively underperform every past several years j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think it was hard for me to hear you was your question first of all how is it in illinois and what should we expect from how we are working with hyperbole kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst yes really what we ve seen lettings are you starting to see work come from rebuild illinois and what are your expectations for future volumes at the state from this past fast act j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i think that illinois i wouldn t we re not expecting a lot of that funding to flow through in 2020 i think it s pretty more 21 we still have some of the pull work and airport work which will benefit us in illinois in 2020 on the private side and illinois is probably not one of our strengths it is probably one of the few places where pricing some weakness on that so while the team in illinois did the job improving unit margins they are not getting the benefit of big volumes and i don t think we re going to see the highway in illinois much of it until 21 am i answering your question kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst yes perfect yes no that s helpful that s helpful and then also just following up on the rail network assume that most of the volumes are out of your south georgia ops could you just confirm give more color in terms of the type of projects that you re seeing that are driving demand in the gulf thank you j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so it was in the fourth quarter the rail work was really widespread and it was really more timing we are pleased with it is good work just comes at a higher cost but it was across the board i mean it was texas it was the mississippi louisiana panhandle south alabama even into florida we really just had a good solid fourth quarter even weather helped it kathryn thompson thompson research group analyst all right thanks very much operator our next question comes from jerry revich of goldman sachs please go ahead jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning everyone j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning jerry revich goldman sachs analyst i m wondering can you talk about the pricing cadence as we think about 2020 versus 19 any differences and timing of price increases that we should keep in mind then can you comment on how broad the price increases is in terms of breadth of markets as we think about 20 versus what you put through in 19 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i would describe it is very similar 2020 will be very similar to 2019 we re continuing to see solid price improvements at this point in 2020 we re very confident guide that 4 to 6 price improvement for the year our bid work our backlogs would support this and our discussions with our fixed plant customers would support this kind of pricing momentum again we always point this out but we do it again it s really underpinned by that visibility of the rapidly growing highway work and a solid we think a solid performance will be seen in growth in the private side and then again now we re starting to see growth in the non highway infrastructure well it s the smallest piece of it it s healthy and i would tell you that we re going to see price increases across it s really widespread across every one of our markets suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer as it was in 19 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes jerry revich goldman sachs analyst and we will have if you hit the pricing items will have two straight years of 5 or so pricing gains is that sustainable in the medium term and obviously you re looking for lower volume growth in 20 than in 19 i m wondering as we think about the medium term outlook how would you counsel us to think about sustainable level of long term pricing gains j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer obviously we re not going to give guidance past 2020 but you saw it in 19 you ll see it in 20 i think the again we ve got a long term substantial highway funding coming and that visibility we will continue to grow so that just supports the kind of pricing we re seeing jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay and lastly in the past when you had pricing momentum in aggregates in your asphalt markets you re able to achieve gross margin expansion i think at a faster rate than we ve seen so far in the cycle can you just comment on what s holding you back from achieving historical levels of gross margins in asphalt in this cycle compared to the past j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes well i think in as far as asphalt is concerned we are guiding to non air product lines being up 10 to 15 asphalt prices and unit margins are going to drive the big improvement in that asphalt we would expect gross profit in asphalt to be up double digit that would be probably a slight improvement flat to a slight improvement in liquid cost i think the good news is the good highway work where we experience that the big funds and the timing of that line up with our asphalt business so the story in asphalt i think is this is we said all of last year we would catch and bypass liquid liquid prices or liquid cost to improve unit margins you saw this happen in the fourth quarter more to come jerry revich goldman sachs analyst okay thank you j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from anthony pettinari of citi please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning anthony pettinari citigroup global markets analyst good morning tom i think you mentioned being disappointed over the last couple of months with regards to the speed with which some states are wedding work i was wondering if you could just give a little more color on which states you re seeing this and maybe the magnitude of the delays relative to what you were initially expecting j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i would describe it this way i think at this point where we are in the year right now we would expect highway demand at this point be up predict low single digit now that could move to mid single digit depending on the timing of large projects and really states ability to get work less and get work started as i said earlier for asphalt the good news is states where we have asphalt probably have the strongest demand going into 2020 texas california virginia florida tennessee but the flip side of that is places like georgia and south carolina they struggled in the last year to get work they get funding left and work started if you look at georgia we re still shipping three mega projects in georgia so that s helping but i would tell you that highway awards data starts have been a little slower but then again lettings they do ebb and flow they come and go all that said i think that single digit that low single digit could turn quickly to push us to mid single digit you ve got georgia in the second half of 2019 where lettings were slow now georgia in the first half of 20 is going to let 1 billion worth of work texas is looking to double their lettings going into 2021 that s already healthy is at 7 billion going to 14 billion california we d expect fund spending to go up some 13 embedded in that is a 25 increase in maintenance funding and that maintenance funding could go very fast all in all we will experience growth in highways in 2020 and for years to come and then i will give you a reminder that highway starts right now while they have been maybe a little bit slower or up 20 versus where they were two years ago so it s growing it s just how fast can the states get it to work anthony pettinari citigroup global markets analyst got it got it that s very helpful and then in the release i think you made some reference to concrete project delays can you talk about where you saw these project delays and the magnitude and whether you expect this to kind of continue into 2020 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes we got delayed two places it was timing of big projects in virginia and then it was both weather and fires in northern california where we ve got hit with on the volume piece of this i would expect volumes in concrete in 2020 up mid single digit and recovering in both those markets i would expect prices up probably mid single digit and i would expect unit margins in concrete up double digit anthony pettinari citigroup global markets analyst okay that s helpful i ll turn it over j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from mike dahl of rbc capital markets please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst hi thanks for suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i m just to follow up on one of the prior questions around the state lettings what s your sense of just the underlying fundamental cause for the slower pace of lettings is a worker shortage is it something in terms of the just getting things through the regulatory body just a little more color on the underlying root cause there j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s external factors outside of the dots it s really them being able to they got huge slug of funding they got to mature into that and they got to have you ve got to get it estimated permitted let we ve got engineering that goes into it so there is a lot of work those dots to put projects out while everybody has the pressures of workers and employment this is not what s holding up the lettings is just its holding up the states it s just their ability to get that work planned and out and let and put to work suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer particularly as some of the projects are larger perhaps than they had been in the past the larger the project that just adds a degree of complexity to the process michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks second question just thinking about the incremental margins if i look at 2019 on the whole the difference if my math is right in terms of the incremental margin and what you would target on a 60 would be about 60 million and in ebitda and so understand some of the one time issues or transitory issues that you ve been talking about but it s a pretty big number and this is in a year where you had everything kind of working for you in terms of volume price and your internal initiatives so as we go into 20 i guess what i m getting at is really just what s giving you the level of confidence that you can get back to the 60 is it actually volume was too high in 2019 and so as you go into 20 the stripping costs aren t as high just trying to understand that bridge a little suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i will comment first and then i m sure tom will have a follow up comment i m i can t say i m quite sure about your math on the 60 million but with respect to the 60 that is we say this often that is a long term average you re going to have some quarters and some years when you hit it some quarters you re below it we have had a couple of years where we were just above that in fact if you just look at 2019 for the trailing 12 month period ended in september we were right at 60 so i think when you look at the flow through for this year it really does revolve around those three items that tom called out had it not been for those we would have been much closer to that number and some of those were timing and mix related and to the extend its timing and mix related you won t have that pressure into 2020 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i think fundamentally this is not an inflationary issue it s more about timing we talked about the remote distribution that s a good that s really good because it s more volume for us the fill work will come in 2020 as far as what we did in q3 and q4 was stripping and preventive maintenance i think those are just operating disciplines first of all the stripping is an investment and while it s cost it s a one time thing for a while as you develop kits and get ready for future volumes which we think we re going to grow on the maintenance side it s really about we want to control our equipment don t have the equivalent control you and make sure you do in a timely manner let me just give you like a real life example of that if you were to take a seven foot cone crusher down it all samples it cost you 50 000 if you wait till it failed it would cost you 150 000 and that s just the tip of the iceberg costs because now you re taking the plant down which is very expensive and if you look at underneath that where we are from really important metrics like tons per hour to a plant downtime returns per man hour you re seeing improvement it s an investment we started february with the investment in our people operations through this operation s excellence program it allows us to maximize the long term efficiencies operations and i d tell you that i m confident that these efforts will improve our profitability of the company and i think our folks who ve taken those into account is they created their plan and the guidance for 2020 michael dahl rbc capital markets analyst okay thanks for the call operator our next question comes from rohit seth of suntrust please go ahead rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks for taking my question just curious on if residential construction grew faster than you expected in 2020 would there be any asp or mix benefits or maybe on the cost side j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no i think i think it will residential has a good mix of both base and clean stone i think it would flow through like everything else although and that is something we d love to see so we got our fingers crossed but i wouldn t expect any big price mix change or unit margins mix change rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst okay and then on your incremental margins just kind of building on some of the things you ve already said but i mean the last few years it s come under the 60 i m curious how much of equipment failure has been part of that issue j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i think as we do that we talk about same store and same store in 2018 finished 65 2019 was so we have years that were up we have years below i think as you look at it and i would point out to you that same store and you re going to have times when it s parties and have times with a slower we will guide you back to the 60 rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst all right i m suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer i think the other thing i m sorry i was just going to add i think the other thing for us is the real question as we look through some of these fourth quarter cost is there something there that is indicative of a significant shift in the cost performance of the company is something going on there that has materially changed the cost structure of the company and that to me would be the real important sort of carry forward question into 2020 and again as we go back through those items our view internally as we ve talked a lot about them is no that there isn t something that is a significant change in the cost structure of the company and for that reason even though there can be some volatility in it between quarters or years we on the long term basis guide back to a trailing 12 or 6 days rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst understood and then on the m a pipeline can you provide any thoughts on what you re seeing out there and maybe your appetite j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes as always we ve got some projects both large and small that we re working again as we always tell you its discipline everything does not fit us it s got to be unique to have synergies for us have the discipline that if it s too expensive won t be able to walk away from it and really importantly is once you get it make sure you integrate it very fast and very accurately so we ve got a number of them working we ll just again all of them don t fit us so we ll be picky about what we buy rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst any deals of size out there j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer it s both it s both some large ones and some small ones i don t think there s any mega ones out there but i would this full gamut rohit seth suntrust robinson humphrey analyst understood all right thank you j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from michael wood of nomura instinet please go ahead michael wood nomura instinet analyst hi good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer hi michael michael wood nomura instinet analyst i was hoping you could quantify the repair and maintenance a little bit more curious if you could tell us how much it is as a percentage of cogs and should we think about this is a purely variable next year in terms of increasing alongside volume or could it maybe decline after being elevated this year j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think what we would guide you to that this is that i think you may see a little bit more of this in the first few months of the year and then i would expect it to level off to meet the guidance that we ve given you and i would call that out is both some stripping and some repair and maintenance but i think we re confident as we look at our hand for the full year guide guidance of how that flows through our cost flows through for the year michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay in 2019 i know you were talking about throughout the year earlier in the year some lower mixed ongoing on to the larger highway projects i m curious if you can give us an update on that is that continued or you seeing kind of mix up as those projects mature j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think what we saw in the mix that we saw in the quarter was a little bit of geographic and a little bit of product mix as we called out i think was that for the year our performance was right in line with guidance the full year was 5 5 mix adjusted 4 8 and it was in the impact of asphalt size is it really driven by highway work geographic mix a little bit higher volumes on the gulf coast and the southeast michael wood nomura instinet analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from phil ng from jefferies phil ng jefferies analyst hi guys j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer hi good morning phil ng jefferies analyst good morning appreciating that there are some delayed lettings and potentially some downdraft from private couple of tougher comps would be helpful tom if you give us some color how to think about the shape of the year from a growth standpoint j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes good question i would expect first of all you ve got a really tough comp in q1 because volumes last year were up 13 and it was really that you had the pull forward from 18 into 19 and other than that i would call it one of timing of large projects and timing of weather and we also had a very the weather in the first quarter of last year was with exception of california was quite good so and you guys can look outside and see what s happening right now with the weather in first quarter this year so all in all i think it s timing of weather in large projects phil ng jefferies analyst and tom you re not calling for any delay of larger project at this juncture which would you can t predict at this juncture if i m interpreting your kind of j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so we re shipping a lot of big projects right now we called out three in georgia we ve got a number of different places i believe it s going to be how fast the highways can get the jobs let into work and we talked about that a little bit where there was fast and we were slow what we call it out with georgia and south carolina which slot so the second half of last year s lettings which flow into 2020 and slow but the first half of this year they ve got huge letting so we ll see how fast the work get started phil ng jefferies analyst got it and then based on your guidance for your downstream business for 2020 it s a touch below what you thought actually coming into 2019 initially just given some of the project delays you saw last year and frankly a more manageable liquid actual price environment i m little surprised you re not expecting more strength can you give us some of the puts and takes j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i think what we see is real strength in unit margin improvement in asphalt and up double digit we re calling for liquid being flat to slightly down and our volumes are just up slightly and the that again will be determined by the timing of this dot work and how fast it gets started you got to remember we had two we had big projects in asphalt in tennessee and we had the big 202 project in arizona which neither one of those were repeating going into 2020 so they were windfalls in 19 they re not going to repeat even with that we re seeing slight improvements in volume and so that get much bigger they ll have to accelerate work is in some of the lettings that i talked about phil ng jefferies analyst got it j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer the thing i m encouraged about i said in asphalt is you saw those margins turn in the fourth quarter we have been predicting that kind of chasing that through the year 19 now we see we carry that momentum into 2020 phil ng jefferies analyst and just one cleanup question tom when you said flat to down liquid costs are you calling sequentially or is that more on a year over year on a full year basis j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer as a comparison year over year but you know i think importantly with that we re going to manage what a number of what happens the last fall we re going to manage that unit margin in asphalt appropriately so the liquid prices fall we ll see that accretive to unit margins and like i said the good news is we call it and keep growing it and i think we ll see that as we continue to perform in 2020 phil ng jefferies analyst okay thanks a lot j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from seldon clarke of deutsche bank please go ahead seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst hey thanks for the question could you just give us a sense of how the margin differs on your shipments by rail and is this a dynamic that s coming solely from higher demand in these particular areas or has the cost of service provided by the rails change with some of the ongoing initiatives that they ve been putting into place j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer okay i would point out this way in general the rail tons is just going to be a little lower margins and that s and higher price higher costs a little bit lower margins but very good margins so it s good work i mean the volume being up is a good thing i would point out that in contrast the blue water tonnages and much higher margins it would be higher price higher cost and higher margins than the whole so what we saw in the quarter was just a timing of good work along the rail that happened to ship at a higher rate seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst okay so nothing to do with then putting process reality in place okay j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no a simple thing with quarry cost versus rail distribution you have rail distribution plus the quarry costs which just comes at a higher price and a higher cost seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst got it okay and then just a question on the 2020 guidance there is about 700 basis points of differential in the high and low end as it relates to the year in your growth could you just give us a sense of maybe what s embedded in the low end of guidance and what would you really need to see to hit the higher end of that range j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think i would tell you is probably going to be mostly volume i go back to timing of shipments i go back to do we get do you get hit with the tropical storm or two or three those would be the big variables i think between the high end of the low end and how it lines up would be the delta suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer that s right and that s that s a very similar approach to what we took at the beginning of 2019 when we gave the volume guidance then a range of 3 to 5 and you know luckily and happily we wound up being ahead of that for the year but tom s right it really comes down to what happens with the timing it s shipments and weather as to whether you re at the lower end or the higher end and as tom said we ll continue to watch with interest how residential how those starts you continue to improve throughout the year seldon clarke deutsche bank analyst all right thanks for the time j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from garik shmois of loop capital please go ahead garik shmois loop capital analyst hi thanks just one more j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning garik shmois loop capital analyst hey good morning so just wanted to follow up just on the highway outlook just being in intellectual year with the fast act expiring in the fall do you think that could lead to additional letting delays in 2020 just curious how these are factored in the plan to the highly outlook and some of the sluggishness that you can see j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes we talked about the cadence and now we re lettings and some that they have been slow and now coming on strong and the timing of it i wouldn t think the election year would have any impact on state dot lettings and the least i don t think it s going to have it won t for sure will have any an impact on the fast act or funding from the feds i think people in washington are working hard toward the highway bill a lot of progress made on that both on the build side and the funding i don t expect to get a highway bill in 2020 at the same time when the fast act expires i don t expect any of that funding to go down we ll just an extension so i don t see a big impact on it i don t see any impact on state dot lettings due to this being election year garik shmois loop capital analyst okay thanks and then just given some of the repair and maintenance costs here and some of the other items that you called out is this all just to be clear within your plan as you think about your 2 billion ebitda target you laid out your investor day and thinking about how that could be potentially achievable once you reach 230 million to 240 million tons of volume j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yeah if anything i think the four strategic initiatives including the operations excellence initiative or give me more and more confidence in our ability to get to the 9 that we planned i think that our operator if you look if you were to look beneath the surface in our operations while the headline is higher stripping and repair and maintenance costs behind that i think you re doing the right things in the investing in the business for the long term really importantly though is you re starting to see the key operating parameters which we measure things like tons per hour throughput through individual plants downtime individual plants tons per man hour individual plants we re starting to see improvement i think we are teaching our young people the right things to do we are leveraging the collective knowledge and experience of vulcan across 350 plants so while we see some headline things the ultimate work that goes into this from those initiatives is starting to gel the commercial excellence initiatives is mature it is working and we re very pleased with our progress there garik shmois loop capital analyst great thank you operator our next question comes from david macgregor of longbow research please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes good morning david macgregor longbow research analyst good morning just getting back to the 2 to 4 volume guide and just a question i guess on construction capacity and if we get a large increase in awards and lettings what are the downstream bottlenecks that most concern use or constraint to your volume growth and how you accounted for that as potentially concerned development with the new guidance j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well first of all for vulcan internally i don t think we see any bottlenecks we can handle it we love to see it grow as much as it could and we will be there both from an aggregate to prospective and asphalt prospective or concrete perspective on as far as if lettings were to increase dramatically i think what you see is the work would happen the big bottleneck as always with the people ask about is labor in all the labor shortages to answer that question is yes i don t think it s going to hold up work but i think it will hold up is ability to catch up once work is delayed so if you had a month in the winter time which was all rainy and little cold trying to catch that up or we a big tropical storm come through it s going to take a little longer to catch it up just because they don t have the fire power to do it fast that s how i would describe it david macgregor longbow research analyst okay have you factored that in your guidance is that there is an element potentially the discrepancy between 2 to 4 which seems fairly conservative versus the story which seems pretty bullish j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think that i think when it comes to volume as i ve said we tried to pull all of those factors and as comparing to last year the pull through the weather aspect of it you know a little bit of a air pocket leading indicators in the rail side and the timings of how we lettings in states ability to get that work and we would put all that together and the upside potential the risk piece of it that s what we got will try to be thoughtful about the 2 to 4 david macgregor longbow research analyst yes that makes sense and then second question on mix and if you could talk about the pace of growth in your backlog and as your backlog building faster and your higher margin products and geographies j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i think i i would describe this i think when we looked at the 4 to 6 is best we can if you take the mix of products of will not say mix both geographic and product mix together i think we have seen good improvement in base in our backlogs we ve seen good improvement in clean stone in our backlogs and our booking pace right now as we look at it both in price and in volume will support our guidance david macgregor longbow research analyst thank you very much j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from adam thalhimer of thompson davis please go ahead adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst hey good morning guys would you chalk if ebitda was flat to down in q1 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well we don t we can t yield q1 guidance i think as we said we are comping over a year in the first quarter of 2019 with which was very good weather and we had the windfall of pull forward of 13 volume from the year before i don t think you ll see that pull through you guys can look outside know what the weather is doing in the fourth in the first quarter so again we re halfway through it we ll just have to wait and see adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst and then tom can you walk us through the demand you re seeing right now in california and texas j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer sure i would describe california this way i think that the well let me start with texas the public side is very strong the txdot has done an excellent job of lettings and getting work out there is big work there is shipping right now there s big work on the horizon and as we said next year they re going to go from a while back of 7 billion to 14 billion on the private side i would describe north texas is being driven by non res i d say res is fairly flat with some exceptions some big development north fort worth south texas housing strong non res a little bit soft coastal texas everything strong and you could see some lng work start on coastal texas in the second half of 2020 a little bit going now california northern cal public is very strong both for aggregates and asphalt private side looks good maybe a bit flat in the bay non res is a bit soft but leading indicators were improving publics on southern california again public very strong highway strong non highway is strong on single private loan in southern california a little bit of a watch for us with leading indicators a bit we were a bit softer in the last three months of indicators were up over 20 so all in all i think pretty healthy growth in both states and i would tell you that i would expect good margin improvements unit margin improvements in both locations both in aggregates and in asphalt adam thalhimer thompson davis analyst good color okay thanks tom j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you our next question comes from adrian huerta of jp morgan please go ahead adrian huerta jp morgan analyst hi good morning everyone and thank you for taking my call tom and suzanne suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning adrian huerta jp morgan analyst good morning quick question on cash taxes can you tell us how the end of last year i believe they probably ended way below what you were expecting early last year and now you re back into expecting 200 million if there is any chances that there could be lower than your guidance suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer sure and the main reason for the reduction in cash taxes through the year was that as we started the year we have not made a determination as to whether we were going to take advantage of the bonus depreciation or not that s a calculation that we have to go through each year because there is some interplay between it and depletion allowance that we get when we file our tax returns as well as some other things so there is an actual while it might seem obvious you would want to take advantage of the bonus depreciation there is actually a calculation that you need to go to ensure you are selecting the calculation methodology that gives you the most tax benefit so we started out the year under one assumption we determined in the second quarter and called this out at the time that we were indeed going to take the bonus depreciation that resulted in for 2019 us paying quite a bit less tax than we had initially intended and the estimated the cash tax rate was between 7 and 8 as we start off in 2020 we are guiding to you don t want effective tax rate of 20 will go through the same process again and make a determination as to what our depreciation methodology we re going to use so there is some chance the cash tax may be lower but we will we ll work through that process in a similar fashion that we use this year even under the even under the assumption of having higher cash taxes in 2020 as compared to 2019 i just point out we still would throw off about 800 million of discretionary cash flow so very very healthy very substantial and that 800 million could be put on a discretionary basis toward your growth projects potentially m a if something comes along that meets all the criteria that tom outlined your dividends and share repurchases adrian huerta jp morgan analyst that was very clear suzanne and if i may ask another question can you share with us any details on the quarry that is expected to open in california in terms of a win and the size and potential volumes on an annual basis that that quarry could take j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so it s it s in frisco we re not is it will probably won t open until beginning of next year versus second quarter of next year size we re not going to actually disclose that at this point we have a closer to it will talk about those things it s been a very good market it was taken us some 10 plus years to get this done the team has worked very hard and now they re working hard to build it out into a market that is there is it is very healthy and quite profitable adrian huerta jp morgan analyst excellent tom so it s a totally new market for you j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer no it s a market we ve been in before adrian huerta jp morgan analyst okay excellent thank you so much tom and suzanne i appreciate it j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from paul chabran of on field investment research please go ahead paul chabran on field investment research analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions first of all concerning the rail deliveries i think you talked about that extensively already so and i applogies which you already answered but how should we think about it for 2020 the evolution of rate increase is there any chance that it could impact your margins as it did in q4 2019 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer i m sorry the beginning of your question i m sorry beginning of your question i couldn t hear paul chabran on field investment research analyst i m sorry the question was related to the evolution of rate deliveries in 2020 how should we think about that does change they could impact your margin as it did in q4 2019 suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer the repairs and maintenance is that what you re asking about the connection was a little poor i just couldn t hear i m sorry paul chabran on field investment research analyst yes applogies it s concerning the rail deliveries they don t defense rail deliveries that had an impact on your margin in q4 j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer well i wouldn t expect the rail happen to be a timing issue of big shipments in the fourth quarter and i would not expect i think we ve got those the volumes that we do out of those that rail distribution network embedded in our 2020 guidance and i would see very little impact paul chabran on field investment research analyst okay all right thank you very much j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from brent thielman of d a davidson please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey good morning just wanted to for i think for you suzanne just on the sag expense can you help us understand the sensitivity to growth this year in other words if things are going to lineup well through the year you start seeing 5 6 7 volume growth can we sustain sag below 2019 level suzanne h wood senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we can as i said this is a matter of what s driving that cost reduction year over year or the changes we talked about some of that is being more efficient in the way we do things so it s not like it s a variable kind of expense it s more what i would call on the fixed side that we are making some changes and so i think that that would be sustainable yes brent thielman d a davidson analyst thank you that s all i had operator our next question comes from michael dudas of vertical research please go ahead j thomas hill chairman of the board president and chief executive officer good morning michael dudas vertical research analyst good i think afternoon i think you may have gone into 12 o clock so in

u s president donald trump delivers his state of the union address to a joint session of congress on capitol hill in washington d c on february 4 ï¼ xinhua u s president donald trump s supremely confident state of the union address on february 4 his third was more campaign rhetoric as he seeks reelection trump officially announced his candidacy in pennsylvania on march 10 2019 with the campaign slogan keep america great a modification of his first election slogan in the same way his 2020 election manifesto doesn t have any major surprises continuing and re emphasizing his 2016 program as the last address before the presidential campaign the main theme of the state of the union was trumpeting what he deems the achievements of his term and reiterating his political beliefs tooting his own horn trump bragged about the u s economy being the best it s ever been and the u s being stronger than at any other time in history with more job opportunities bigger incomes and a booming stock market poverty and the crime rate have been reduced while people s confidence has surged he attributed this progress to his tax reduction strategy financial deregulation the policy to make the u s energy independent and judicial reform he also boasted about his perceived achievements in reshaping foreign relations and advancing social reforms for example the trilateral north american free trade agreement was replaced by the entirely new u s canada mexico agreement then there were tariff wars with major trading partners the phase one trade deal signed with china which eased the hostility to some extent was also trotted out as an achievement along with enhanced investment in the military and making nato allies increase their defense budget one relatively innocuous achievement was reforming the public education system by establishing the opportunity scholarship covering chosen college students tuition fees and campus expenses trump praised his administration s progress in medical care illegal immigration and the building of a wall on the u s mexico border defeating the islamic state radical group and the raid on its leader abu bakr al baghdadi that led to his death the assassination of iranian general qassem soleimani and controlling opioid drug abuse were other achievements some of them were promises trump had made during the 2016 presidential campaign and have been high on his agenda over the past three years lack of rivals trump admittedly has several advantages over other candidates such as solid fundamentals a basically good economy and the absence of a good candidate from the democratic party still he is not taking the election lightly his address made two priorities clear winning more votes and creating a historical legacy his address also outlined the key tasks his administration will carry out if he wins a second term it will reconstruct domestic infrastructure upgrade internet services and deport illegal immigrants with criminal records politically his middle east peace plan will be implemented the country will be protected from the threat of terrorism and troops will be withdrawn from the middle east and afghanistan some of these plans were made in 2016 but were delayed or scrapped after the democrats blocked some or money was not approved unsurprisingly in the nearly 80 minute speech trump made no mention of his impeachment trial perhaps a pointed demonstration that his opponents can t distract him while many applauded the address nancy pelosi the democratic speaker of the house of representatives tore her copy of it right after the speech such acts by the opposition have become normal in the u s and the polarization will impact trump s political agenda in varying degrees however instead of attacks and an impeachment process that couldn t unseat him but just made him the first impeached president seeking reelection in u s history democrats should concentrate on choosing an appropriate candidate and coming up with an attractive campaign platform otherwise they will not have an effective strategy to return to the white house even after 2024 whether trump wins the election will largely hinge on the economic trends in the u s in 2021 the reason his address highlighted the economic performance under his administration although the economic statistics sound good there is still the grim reality of mounting debt serious stock market bubbles and lackluster performance in the manufacturing sector economists and international economic organizations continue to warn the u s and the global economy of the risk of recession people participate in a demonstration in san francisco on july 19 2019 for the protection of immigrants rights ï¼ xinhua confused diplomacy foreign affairs were not a focus of the address nor will they be unless the external environment changes drastically trump bypassed the korean peninsula nuclear issue and the negotiations with the democratic people s republic of korea dprk though it was a priority in his asia pacific agenda after he took office he was immensely proud to be the first u s president to ever meet with a dprk leader the omission could indicate that bilateral negotiations have reached an impasse there seems to be an irreconcilable contradiction between the dprk s position that it has the right to take effective self defense measures and that sanctions should be removed and the u s line that the dprk should abandon its missile and nuclear weapons program this makes it unlikely that trump will boast about u s dprk negotiations before the election instead he focused on the iranian issue with the general idea of tightening economic sanctions and maintaining maximum pressure through such measures the u s intends to trigger internal changes in iran rather than resort to military force against the iranian government after trump was elected the u s foreign strategy refocused on major country competition positioning china and russia as its main competitors it also began withdrawing from international treaties to shirk its responsibilities and used maximum pressure to resolve regional hotspot issues however maximum pressure often proved to be ineffective in the face of the complicated international situation with major changes in power structures u s relations with russia have been deteriorating while a trade truce has been reached with china after intermittent friction besides the phase one trade deal with china trump mentioned bilateral cooperation with the chinese government to combat the novel coronavirus because of these two developments the trump administration seems to have lost its reasons to restart the trade conflict and pressure china to enter a second stage of trade negotiations it remains to be seen what implications this adjustment in the u s policy on china in trump s remaining first term will be sino u s relations have entered a period of strategic competition and bilateral communication and accommodation have continued despite multiple problems the two countries have been testing each other s limit the u s strategic contraction will be a long term process and international chaos and fragmentation will continue to intensify against this backdrop trump while lacking strategic planning has continued attacking specific issues but in a disorganized way this seemingly active but actually passive diplomatic style is likely to continue the author is an op ed contributor to beijing review and a researcher with the pangoal institution copyedited by sudeshna sarkar
franklin electric co inc nasdaq fele q4 2019 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the franklin electric reports fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales and earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today john haines chief financial officer please go ahead sir john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you jewel and welcome everyone to franklin electric s fourth quarter 2019earnings conference call with me today is gregg sengstack our chairman and chief executive officer on today s call gregg will review our fourth quarter business results and i will review our fourth quarter financial results when i m through we ll have some time for questions and answers before we begin let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties many of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements a discussion of these factors may be found in the company s annual report on form 10 k and in today s earnings release all forward looking statements made during this call are based on information currently available and except as required by law the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements with that i will now turn the call over to our chairman and ceo gregg sengstack gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you john as we expected our revenue and operating income were essentially flat to the fourth quarter of last year organic growth in both fueling systems and distribution offset negative organic growth in water systems fueling systems led the way with another record quarter on strong volume in the u s and mix distribution sales were also a record however the segment s fourth quarter operating loss was similar to last year our water systems business saw modest top line growth globally but not enough to offset lower large dewatering pumps sales in the u s recall that environmental regulations the requirement to move to tier 4 diesel engines in 2019 drove large pioneer pump sales in q4 of 2018 making for a very tough comp for the year consolidated sales were up 1 operating income was down 3 and earnings per share was down 9 while 2019 earnings were below plan in last year i am pleased to report that our focus on working capital resulted in free cash flow conversion of 163 of net income or about 3 35 per share a record for any year in our history returning to the fourth quarter i will start with distribution the business continue to improve in q4 with organic growth of about 6 however this came at a cost as our team moved out some more commodity type materials at lower margins resulting in an operating loss in the quarter similar to the loss in the fourth quarter of last year in our water systems segment revenue from our u s surface pump product line declined modestly in the quarter while u s groundwater product line revenue grew modestly our u s large dewatering pump revenue trailed last year s record results as continued push out of orders and slowing demand in rental and oil and gas end markets compounded the challenging comparisons to the strong fourth quarter last year at the same time our operations team continues to improve their ability to flex the operating cost base to maintain margins in this most cyclical business outside the u s sales in latin america accelerated compared to last year the team achieved 20 organic growth in the quarter all latin american markets grew organically with particularly strong results in brazil and the southern cone in europe the middle east and africa our water business improved modestly the continued recovery in our business in the middle east particularly turkey offset modest declines in europe and africa and consistent with prior quarters our water business in asia pacific grew modestly as well our u s fueling business continued to deliver strong growth driving another record quarter however in china fourth quarter results were essentially flat sequentially but down significantly from last year business in china was below our expectations as the conversion of underground piping systems appears to be winding down faster than anticipated strength across the rest of our international fueling markets essentially offset the sales decline in china so overall our fueling business achieved about 4 organic growth in the quarter turning to 2020 with more normal weather patterns we believe our distribution business will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range the business is well positioned working capital is trending lower the restructuring of our footprint in california is essentially complete as is the integration of milan supply which was acquired in early 2019 again with more normal weather in our strengthening latin american business we believe our global water systems segment will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range as well we expect the u s fueling business to continue to post strong results outside of china we expect our international fueling business to grow modestly while we expected 2020 fueling sales in china to continue to decline on lower sales in underground pipe we have planned that the regulatory initiatives around the installation of in station diagnostics for isd would partially offset this decline this view has changed over the last month the uncertainty of a negative impact on economic growth from the current coronavirus outbreak will likely delay the start of installations of isds beyond the impact of the current coronavirus outbreak on the china economy our supply chain leadership continues to monitor the post chinese new year start up of our supply base to best anticipate the potential disruptions both direct and indirect to our supply chain while we are encouraged with the information that our own factory and many of our tier 1 suppliers factories have reopened it s still unclear as to the degree delivery commitments will be impacted our global supply organization continues to monitor the situation daily and has contingency plans in place for many but not all sourced items so with that as a backdrop we are initiating our 2020 guidance for earnings per share before restructuring expenses at 2 25 to 2 35 however where our fueling and large dewatering business has started 2019 strong and weakened later in the year we are anticipating the opposite pattern in 2020 we believe the challenges in china and their impact on our fueling systems business combined with a slow start for the sale of our large dewatering equipment sales into rental and oil and gas applications will result in our overall sales and earnings pattern for 2020 to start off weak and accelerate throughout the course of the year we anticipate that due to our continued focus on our working capital 2020 will be another strong year for cash generation i will now turn the call over to john to discuss the numbers in more detail john john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you gregg our fully diluted earnings per share were 0 42 for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 0 51 for the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter eps before the impact of restructuring expenses was 0 43 compared to 2018 fourth quarter eps before restructuring of 0 52 restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 0 8 million in the water segment were related to various manufacturing realignment activities and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 0 7 million primarily related to branch consolidations and other asset rationalizations in the distribution segment as well as various manufacturing realignment activities in the water and fueling segments and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter 2019 sales were 320 1 million compared to 2018 fourth quarter sales of 316 7 million an increase of 1 sales revenue decreased by 5 8 million or 2 in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to foreign currency translation and we estimate this revenue decline lowered our earnings per share in the fourth quarter by about 0 02 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales were 188 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 sales of 196 9 million water systems organic sales decreased by about 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales in the u s and canada decreased by 10 overall compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower sales volumes of dewatering equipment sales of dewatering equipment decreased by nearly 50 due to lower sales in rental channels and a surge of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by regulatory demand sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased by 4 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in groundwater pumping systems was primarily due to increased sales of residential water systems sales of surface pumping equipment decreased by 5 on lower sales of both wastewater and water transfer systems water systems operating income was 24 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily driven by lower revenues fueling system sales were 77 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018 sales of 75 million and were a record for any fourth quarter fueling systems organic sales increased about 4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling system sales in the u s and canada increased by 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was principally in the pumping and fuel management systems product lines outside the united states and canada fueling systems revenues were flat as increased sales in europe india and latin america were offset by lower sales in china which declined by about 40 in the fourth quarter and about 14 for the full year 2019 versus 2018 fueling systems operating income was a record for any fourth quarter at 20 2 million compared to 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling systems operating income was higher in the quarter due to favorable product sales mix distribution sales were 64 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus fourth quarter 2018 sales of 56 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales from businesses acquired since the fourth quarter of 2018 were 4 8 million the distribution segment sales grew about 6 organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the distribution segment recorded an operating loss of 2 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a loss of 2 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 higher product costs higher sales mix of commodity type products little price achievement and higher operating expenses contributed to the distribution segment s earnings loss the company s consolidated gross profit was 101 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 a decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross profit of 104 3 million the gross profit decrease was primarily driven was primarily due to lower water systems sales which were only partially offset by higher gross profit from increased fueling systems and distribution sales the gross profit as a percent of net sales was 31 6 in the fourth quarter versus 33 in the fourth quarter of 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were 71 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 sg a expenses from acquired businesses was 1 8 million and excluding the acquired entities the company s sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 70 1 million a decrease of 7 from the fourth quarter of 2018 partially due to lower variable performance based compensation expenses and due to the offsetting effect of foreign currency translation versus the prior year during the first quarter of 2019 the company changed the management reporting for certain transfers and manufactured products between the water and fueling segments this change was made to better align the production of certain products by reportable segment and sales to third party customers to consistently compare 2019 results to the prior year certain 2018 net sales and operating income reclassifications were made these reclassifications resulted in lowering fourth quarter 2018 results of fueling systems and increasing fourth quarter 2018 results of water systems net sales by about 0 9 million and operating income was unchanged versus what was reported in this period last year there is no impact on the company s previously reported consolidated financial statements as you can see on our income statement the company recorded 3 8 million of transactional fx losses below the operating income line in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 4 million of fx gains in the fourth quarter of 2018 which is a negative 0 11 swing in our earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2018 transactional fx losses for the full year 2019 were 1 6 million historically going back five years the below the line transactional fx gains or losses have generally been less than 2 million each year for all of 2018 they were a 0 7 million loss and in 2017 they were a 1 million gain the company s primary method of mitigating these transactional fx losses is by minimizing cross currency balances to the extent possible in settling those cross currency accounts receivable and accounts payable balances in a timely manner as a reminder these losses are non cash and do not reflect the operational performance of the company since the fourth quarter of 2018 however the transactional fx losses below the operating income line has become much more volatile and this is mostly the result of our acquisition last year of industrias rotor pump in argentina which has been characterized as a hyperinflation economy and is subject to special accounting rules the rotor pump business primarily distributes pump products imported into argentina from all over the world beginning primarily in the third quarter the business in argentina began to build inventory and accounts payable rapidly in preparation for their primary selling season this acceleration at exactly the same time the argentinian peso was weakening significantly drove meaningful period to period unmatched balance sheet positions and subsequent volatility in the third and fourth quarters in the second half of 2019 despite the unsettled economic and political environment that exists there our business in argentina grew in constant currency by 3 although the full year 2019 fx loss of 1 6 million is within our historical range we have seen more volatility in the quarter to quarter fluctuations primarily due to the business unit in argentina at the end of the third quarter when we were discussing fourth quarter and full year 2019 results we did not anticipate this magnitude of transactional fx loss recorded in the quarter so as gregg said with the exception of some variances between individual business units our fourth quarter operational results were consistent with the fourth quarter of last year and our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 our effective tax rate net of discrete events was about 13 5 slightly lower than the 2018 effective tax rate of about 14 the 2019 full year effective tax rate is about 18 compared to the 2018 full year tax rate of about 12 5 for the full year of 2020 the company expects the effective tax rate net of discrete events to be between 18 and 20 the company ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with a cash balance of 64 4 million which was 5 2 million higher than at the end of 2018 the company had 19 million in borrowings on its revolving debt facilities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 77 million in borrowing at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 as of january 1 2019 the company adopted the new lease standard and has recognized additional operating liabilities of about 28 million for its outstanding operating leases with corresponding right of use assets of the same amount the impact of this new accounting standard is non cash in nature and does not affect the company s cash position the company does not consider the impact of this standard to be material to the consolidated results of operation or to the cash flows cash from operations for 2019 was about 178 million compared to 128 million in 2018 an increase of 50 million or almost 40 our free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment is about 157 million and is 163 of net income compared to about 100 for the full year 2018 this improvement in cash flow is primarily due to reductions in working capital which remains a key strategic focus for the company the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2019 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 the total remaining authorized shares that may be repurchased is about 1 3 million on january 27 the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 0 155 a 7 increase from the 2019 dividend the dividend will be paid february 20 to shareholders of record on february 6 this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to turn the call over for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from edward marshall with sidoti company your line is now open edward marshall sidoti company analyst gregg and john good morning gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning ed john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning ed edward marshall sidoti company analyst so i wanted to ask about the isd impact as it relates to china and i m curious what your what the guidance is baking into from the negative effects of that of that situation gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure ed so as we look at we had our isd system approved late in 2019 we had a handful of installations in late 2019 we expected several million dollars less than 10 million in 2020 of isd installations and that s effectively kind of what we ve pushed out or taken out this is a the opportunity of long term price these though is going to be as we see it more significant than the double wall piping initiative our revenue per station we expect would be about double and we think that it will be a longer term than the couple of three years we saw for the double wall pipes so we think it s going to be a more systemic growth in the business in china over time edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and previously you ve talked about buy local is that a theme that isd will affect isd or is that just on the underground piping systems gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think my view is that if you go back to the time when that specification for double wall pipe was reopened it was when there was a pretty contentious trade environment with the u s and it seems the trade tensions are at least directionally trending down and given that the electronic sophistication or the sophistication of the product rise i suspect that there is going to be a and this is also again a government mandate and the whole idea is for government connection and oversight of fueling station operations we would expect that that s going to be a pretty good situation for western technology in general edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and as i look into 2020 and we talk about you ve given us some good margin rather top line guidance i m curious if you talk about the margin in fueling john i think you ve said in the past that you anticipate that the high 20s which is where it s been trending is likely too high just any clarity you could provide on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our guidance assumes mid 20s fueling margin for 2020 edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay and then john do you have the you said latin america was up 20 in water do you have the constant currency impact in latin america have you done that math john j haines vice president chief financial officer well the 20 is the organic what we would call the organic growth which would take the opex out edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay so that is so that is constant currency okay john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah that s the that takes out both the acquisition impact and which is zero because we ve lapped the irp acquisition and it takes out the opex so the opex impact if you look at that table on page three of the release was about 3 7 million or 12 in the quarter for latin america so if we take the total when we take the reported growth and add that back that s how we get to the 20 edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it perfect and then last one from me when you look at your guidance for 2020 you talked about the cadence being first half weaker second half stronger i m just curious about the q1 you had a pretty soft q1 in 2019 do you anticipate that to be down year over if you could frame that out john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah we are intentionally not giving guidance in the first quarter ed for these reasons it s difficult for us to predict what we can say to you is that we do expect a weak first quarter but as you rightfully pointed out we had a weak first quarter in 2019 so i think about that we could say is that as greg said in his comments fueling is going to move to the right throughout the year so we have some tough comps there and we don t expect fueling to be up we don t we expect for sure that our dewatering equipment sales are going to be down fairly significantly they are also facing some very difficult comparables the balance of the water businesses and our distribution business should have a decent quarter so we re not optimistic about the first quarter ed but we re also not prepared to give specific quarter guidance either edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it thanks very much for your comments john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you ed operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global securities analyst hi thanks good morning guys gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning walter john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning walter walter liptak seaport global securities analyst i ve got one on china i think you mentioned that china was down 30 in the fourth quarter and so i wonder if you can give us an idea of directionally is that out more in the quarter are you starting to see any turn in china this quarter gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so our our thinking for china is no we don t see any turn maybe the second part of that question first of all we re concerned about we think the opportunity is great the pipe and containment opportunity is basically one that is great so the iot opportunities are a great opportunity for our company but given the economic uncertainty and the virus uncertainty kind of the the situation on the ground as we understand it there right now we just see this opportunity pushing right in 2020 so we think it s there we think we ll win our fair share but we think it s going to be the latter half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year now what we can say is that our estimate for revenue in china is dropping to about 30 million in total from 45 million in 2019 and about 53 million in 2018 so a meaningful decline there and again just reemphasis on back half loaded walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great i also wanted to ask about just generally the comments about the first half being weaker because of fueling and some of the water retail i m sorry rental those are a couple of your more that s better mix products so as we re modeling this out are you i guess the profit mix should be back half weighted too is that right john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah and walter that s why we wanted to point that out in our prepared remarks is that we just see that as you pointed out correctly the fueling business and the dewatering business which are higher margin businesses where they re going and particularly where the dewater business is going those are the businesses we expect are going to start the year slow we do expect the water business to do certainly better than the last year s first half but that s a lower margin business so water distribution so that s why we see the mix and the expectations for earnings to accelerate through the year but to start the year slow walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay got it and then a last one on argentina thanks for pointing out the volatility around that currency is there anything that you re doing differently in 2020 to mitigate the currency or how should we think about the kind of impact that argentina currency could have on 2020 gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah we a couple of things we do have our hedge positions in place walt that are really protecting us for the downside of the peso strengthening against the u s dollar that s a catastrophic kind of situation for us not to be over over excited about it or dramatic about it but so we do have positions like that in place i think the key learning is less working capital settle accounts payable as i pointed out one of our issues here is that we ve got product coming in from all over the world both franklin facilities non franklin products and selling those at those aps quicker is really important and that should be made easier by the fact that we re trying to lower the level of working capital everywhere so if we have less inventory that should contribute to that as well so those are some of the things we re doing but it is highly volatile the peso to the dollar the argentinean peso to the dollar loss about 30 just in the third quarter and then it went beyond that lost additional value in the fourth quarter so we ll do what we can to live in that kind of volatile world walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson analyst thanks can you maybe put a little bit of a finer point on the earnings cadence as you expected throughout the year clearly the first quarter sounds like it s going to be the low point i guess i m wondering if the underlying trends in fueling and dewatering shift out that normal q2 q3 high earnings watermark for the company so maybe put down a little bit of context because i guess i m just having a hard time given the north america groundwater has such an easy comparison in the first half of the year and given that that is at least in my opinion a pretty good margin business for the company especially in the ag motor only stuff that you guys sell i guess i m just having a little bit of a hard time with the earnings came so maybe can you put a finer point on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah matt i guess i would say that we certainly expect the first quarter to be the low point as you know the distribution business had a poor first quarter in 2019 but the first quarter is still the off quarter for distribution so even if we recover in the first quarter the first quarter is never a great a great quarter and then as gregg pointed out the comp is easier in north america for the balance of water and we would expect that to improve for sure but those products margins are not the same as what we see when we talk about fueling and dewatering large de watering so that is really the caution that we have i think that the peak being in the second and third quarters from an earnings perspective will remain the same i do think the fourth quarter will be significantly better than the first quarter and that s kind of the way we re thinking about it right now matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to pioneer i believe in the past you ve publicly stated in 18 that business did around 120 million in revenue can you maybe talk about how it performed in 19 and what your underlying assumption is for that excuse me for that piece in 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yes matt we can in 2000 let me just get to the right page here yeah in 2019 we did about 109 million full year in pioneer that includes all of the international operations and the rental business that same number for 2018 was about 119 million and in 2020 we see that going down just marginally or being pretty close to flat so we re not expecting growth in that business in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to the profit outlook for distribution i think when you originally made the forward moves into the channel you talked about that business getting into an operating profit range of 4 to 6 obviously you were below that in 18 below that again in 19 what s the sort of expectation you have for that business in 20 and do you need to make incremental structural changes to the business to generate that level of profitability gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer so matt we are planning for the distribution business to be within that range in 2020 many of the structural steps to get there were taken in 2019 and that s why we wanted to convey in my comments that things have settled down the focus is on the west i think we have to step back and say that in 2019 and what were really tough market conditions the distribution business actually was flat organically and that had to do with the focus by the leader de davis and his team on cross pollination getting into businesses that are less impacted by the cyclicality of the weather impact for example the ag as you pointed out earlier so they re getting more into turf and treatment and wastewater to grow that business and then on that report get an opportunity to have a more normal weather year to grow the business in the area of submersible pumping systems and lines you have turbine pumping systems which are more focused on the west and the margin profile in the west is generally more positive when there is strength there so we think that the structure is in place the team is in place obviously it s not laid on hand it s been a pretty competitive pricing environment with the weak business and the weak general climate business climate in 2019 we got a little bit upside down we acquired some commodity products in the middle of summer when pricing was a little stronger and as i pointed out we sold some of that off it will continue to add some margin pressure i think in q1 until we come into the season but expecting a more normal year our plan is for the business to be within the range that we originally talked about three years ago matt summerville d a davidson analyst and then maybe lastly just in terms of pricing overall for the company what the average realization was in 19 and what you re expecting for 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our realization in 2019 was just over 200 basis points matt and we re assuming something consistent with that in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst thank you guys operator thank you i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to gregg sengstack for any closing remarks gregg c sengstack chairman

politicians love to tell voters they ll change the tax rules so ordinary hard working families will get more in the hand every week to pay their bills they also love to promise voters that if in government they would waste less money on undeserving recipients or even worse on bureaucrats and for good measure they ll cut red tape but promising tax cuts less wasteful spending and less red tape are the easy bits it s much harder to say exactly how you ll do it what you ll spend less on to offset the lower tax receipts and which regulations you ll cut national leader simon bridges did the easy bits in his widely self promoted speech on monday titled national s economic plan for 2020 to the usual suspects at a closed door event on the rooftop of the rydges hotel in central auckland he set out the five key planks of national s election offer tax relief regulation reduction infrastructure small business and families but he didn t specify the detail of those policies he will have to answer the tougher questions before the election on september 19 here s the six things to know from the speech 1 tax cuts dangled the headline designed to stick in people s heads from the few seconds of television coverage and the snippets in the median voters facebook news feeds was the prospect of tax cuts and not just the block of cheese ones to offset the fiscal creep of the usual wage inflation pushing people into higher tax brackets we have already announced our plans to index tax brackets to the cost of living repeal the auckland fuel tax and introduce no new taxes bridges said but we recognise we need to do more we will announce our full tax plan that will see people on the average wage better off and keeping more of what they earn he said people on the average wage shouldn t be paying almost 33 per cent in the dollar 2 you said what this was where a bunch of fact checkers smelt something was a little off does someone earning the average wage actually pay almost 33 percent of their income to the government stats nz reports the average ordinary time hourly wage rate in the december quarter was 32 76 per hour and the average full time worker worked for 38 hours a week given 52 weeks in the year that s an annual gross pay of 64 733 a quick check of the ird s tax calculator shows this average earner would pay 12 439 in tax or a tax rate of 19 2 percent if they had no children not 33 percent the top tax rate of 33 percent does not kick in until the earner hits a threshold of 70 000 bridges told me forecast growth in wages would see that earner get to 70 000 within a few years and then they would start paying at 33 cents in the dollar for earnings over 70 000 he said that marginal rate was what he was referring to 3 yes but the trouble is that most taxpayers don t have simple situations like the single earner referred to above often they have children and receive working for families and the ones referred to by bridges may also receive an accommodation supplement the measure regularly referred to as the tax wedge is that share of income actually going to the government after tax credits and other payments back from the government the oecd measured new zealand s tax wedge vs the rest of the oecd last year and found new zealand had the lowest for a family with two children new zealand had the 36th lowest tax wedge in the oecd for an average married worker with two children at 1 9 percent in 2018 which compares with the oecd average of 26 6 percent the country occupied the same position in 2017 the oecd said in this paper this chart shows the picture for the average tax wedge in new zealand vs the rest of the oecd we have the red arrow at the extreme right a slightly different measure showing the average tax rate also shows new zealand has a very lowly taxed population here s the oecd again with the chart below taking into account child related benefits and tax provisions the employee net average tax rate for an average married worker with two children in new zealand was reduced to 1 9 percent in 2018 which is the 33rd lowest in the oecd and compares with 14 2 percent for the oecd average this means that an average married worker with two children in new zealand had a take home pay after tax and family benefits of 98 1 percent of their gross wage compared to 85 8 percent for the oecd average it said 4 cut the red tape bridges then talked about extra regulation and how he said it was suffocating the economy new zealanders are doing it tougher facing more tax cost and red tape our economy is slowing and as a result new zealanders are worse off he said jacinda ardern s government has failed to deliver on its promises has piled on the tax cost and red tape made things more uncertain domestically at a time of global uncertainty and as a result new zealand has become a country of lost opportunities on regulation you can t pile more regulation red tape and more tax and cost onto business like jacinda ardern s government has and expect new zealand to succeed we have already promised to cut red tape and regulation we will light a regulations bonfire in our first six months of government and cut two regulations for every new one we create he didn t say which ones he would cut but indicated in previous comments he would roll back some of the tougher regulation for landlords and has pledged to reform the resource management act 5 but does new zealand actually have a lot of red tape that makes it hard to do business not according to the world bank which ranked new zealand as the best in the world for doing business in 2020 in its doing business report for starting a business for example georgia and new zealand have the lowest number of procedures required 1 new zealand also holds the shortest time to start a business 0 5 days whereas rwanda and slovenia have the lowest cost 0 0 it wrote its rankings are in this chart which shows the easiest at the left hand side 6 more infrastructure and less tax bridges then went on to talk about what he said was national s superior record on delivering infrastructure and how it would do more than labour while also keeping public debt and taxes low on infrastructure we not only need to build the roads to get you and your family home on time but invest in the social infrastructure our country needs in world class hospitals and schools bridges said we won t be afraid to use the private sector to partner with government to deliver projects that matter to us all that means we can deliver more roads more rail more transport and more social infrastructure faster and better he said we will have new thinking on infrastructure and you will see a clear vision and plan from us of how we see new zealand bridges said he wanted to use public private partnerships such as the one currently building transmission gully between wellington and the kapiti coast it announced on friday that costs had blown out by 191 million to almost 1 billion the government was forced to pay because it was judged the cost blowout was outside the control of the consortium building the motorway the issue with ppps is they cost much more than public borrowing given the government can currently borrow at a rate of 1 2 percent

fele earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 franklin electric co inc fele 0 24 q4 2019 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the franklin electric reports fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales and earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today john haines chief financial officer please go ahead sir john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you jewel and welcome everyone to franklin electric s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call with me today is gregg sengstack our chairman and chief executive officer on today s call gregg will review our fourth quarter business results and i will review our fourth quarter financial results when i m through we ll have some time for questions and answers before we begin let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties many of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements a discussion of these factors may be found in the company s annual report on form 10 k and in today s earnings release all forward looking statements made during this call are based on information currently available and except as required by law the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements with that i will now turn the call over to our chairman and ceo gregg sengstack gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you john as we expected our revenue and operating income were essentially flat to the fourth quarter of last year organic growth in both fueling systems and distribution offset negative organic growth in water systems fueling systems led the way with another record quarter on strong volume in the u s and mix distribution sales were also a record however the segment s fourth quarter operating loss was similar to last year our water systems business saw modest top line growth globally but not enough to offset lower large dewatering pumps sales in the u s recall that environmental regulations the requirement to move to tier 4 diesel engines in 2019 drove large pioneer pump sales in q4 of 2018 making for a very tough comp for the year consolidated sales were up 1 operating income was down 3 and earnings per share was down 9 while 2019 earnings were below plan in last year i am pleased to report that our focus on working capital resulted in free cash flow conversion of 163 of net income or about 3 35 per share a record for any year in our history returning to the fourth quarter i will start with distribution the business continue to improve in q4 with organic growth of about 6 however this came at a cost as our team moved out some more commodity type materials at lower margins resulting in an operating loss in the quarter similar to the loss in the fourth quarter of last year in our water systems segment revenue from our u s surface pump product line declined modestly in the quarter while u s groundwater product line revenue grew modestly our u s large dewatering pump revenue trailed last year s record results as continued push out of orders and slowing demand in rental and oil and gas end markets compounded the challenging comparisons to the strong fourth quarter last year at the same time our operations team continues to improve their ability to flex the operating cost base to maintain margins in this most cyclical business outside the u s sales in latin america accelerated compared to last year the team achieved 20 organic growth in the quarter all latin american markets grew organically with particularly strong results in brazil and the southern cone in europe the middle east and africa our water business improved modestly the continued recovery in our business in the middle east particularly turkey offset modest declines in europe and africa and consistent with prior quarters our water business in asia pacific grew modestly as well our u s fueling business continued to deliver strong growth driving another record quarter however in china fourth quarter results were essentially flat sequentially but down significantly from last year business in china was below our expectations as the conversion of underground piping systems appears to be winding down faster than anticipated strength across the rest of our international fueling markets essentially offset the sales decline in china so overall our fueling business achieved about 4 organic growth in the quarter turning to 2020 with more normal weather patterns we believe our distribution business will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range the business is well positioned working capital is trending lower the restructuring of our footprint in california is essentially complete as is the integration of milan supply which was acquired in early 2019 again with more normal weather in our strengthening latin american business we believe our global water systems segment will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range as well we expect the u s fueling business to continue to post strong results outside of china we expect our international fueling business to grow modestly while we expected 2020 fueling sales in china to continue to decline on lower sales in underground pipe we have planned that the regulatory initiatives around the installation of in station diagnostics for isd would partially offset this decline this view has changed over the last month the uncertainty of a negative impact on economic growth from the current coronavirus outbreak will likely delay the start of installations of isds beyond the impact of the current coronavirus outbreak on the china economy our supply chain leadership continues to monitor the post chinese new year start up of our supply base to best anticipate the potential disruptions both direct and indirect to our supply chain while we are encouraged with the information that our own factory and many of our tier 1 suppliers factories have reopened it s still unclear as to the degree delivery commitments will be impacted our global supply organization continues to monitor the situation daily and has contingency plans in place for many but not all sourced items so with that as a backdrop we are initiating our 2020 guidance for earnings per share before restructuring expenses at 2 25 to 2 35 however where our fueling and large dewatering business has started 2019 strong and weakened later in the year we are anticipating the opposite pattern in 2020 we believe the challenges in china and their impact on our fueling systems business combined with a slow start for the sale of our large dewatering equipment sales into rental and oil and gas applications will result in our overall sales and earnings pattern for 2020 to start off weak and accelerate throughout the course of the year we anticipate that due to our continued focus on our working capital 2020 will be another strong year for cash generation i will now turn the call over to john to discuss the numbers in more detail john john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you gregg our fully diluted earnings per share were 0 42 for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 0 51 for the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter eps before the impact of restructuring expenses was 0 43 compared to 2018 fourth quarter eps before restructuring of 0 52 restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 0 8 million in the water segment were related to various manufacturing realignment activities and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 0 7 million primarily related to branch consolidations and other asset rationalizations in the distribution segment as well as various manufacturing realignment activities in the water and fueling segments and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter 2019 sales were 320 1 million compared to 2018 fourth quarter sales of 316 7 million an increase of 1 sales revenue decreased by 5 8 million or 2 in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to foreign currency translation and we estimate this revenue decline lowered our earnings per share in the fourth quarter by about 0 02 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales were 188 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 sales of 196 9 million water systems organic sales decreased by about 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales in the u s and canada decreased by 10 overall compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower sales volumes of dewatering equipment sales of dewatering equipment decreased by nearly 50 due to lower sales in rental channels and a surge of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by regulatory demand sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased by 4 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in groundwater pumping systems was primarily due to increased sales of residential water systems sales of surface pumping equipment decreased by 5 on lower sales of both wastewater and water transfer systems water systems operating income was 24 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily driven by lower revenues fueling system sales were 77 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018 sales of 75 million and were a record for any fourth quarter fueling systems organic sales increased about 4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling system sales in the u s and canada increased by 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was principally in the pumping and fuel management systems product lines outside the united states and canada fueling systems revenues were flat as increased sales in europe india and latin america were offset by lower sales in china which declined by about 40 in the fourth quarter and about 14 for the full year 2019 versus 2018 fueling systems operating income was a record for any fourth quarter at 20 2 million compared to 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling systems operating income was higher in the quarter due to favorable product sales mix distribution sales were 64 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus fourth quarter 2018 sales of 56 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales from businesses acquired since the fourth quarter of 2018 were 4 8 million the distribution segment sales grew about 6 organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the distribution segment recorded an operating loss of 2 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a loss of 2 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 higher product costs higher sales mix of commodity type products little price achievement and higher operating expenses contributed to the distribution segment s earnings loss the company s consolidated gross profit was 101 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 a decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross profit of 104 3 million the gross profit decrease was primarily driven was primarily due to lower water systems sales which were only partially offset by higher gross profit from increased fueling systems and distribution sales the gross profit as a percent of net sales was 31 6 in the fourth quarter versus 33 in the fourth quarter of 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were 71 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 sg a expenses from acquired businesses was 1 8 million and excluding the acquired entities the company s sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 70 1 million a decrease of 7 from the fourth quarter of 2018 partially due to lower variable performance based compensation expenses and due to the offsetting effect of foreign currency translation versus the prior year during the first quarter of 2019 the company changed the management reporting for certain transfers and manufactured products between the water and fueling segments this change was made to better align the production of certain products by reportable segment and sales to third party customers to consistently compare 2019 results to the prior year certain 2018 net sales and operating income reclassifications were made these reclassifications resulted in lowering fourth quarter 2018 results of fueling systems and increasing fourth quarter 2018 results of water systems net sales by about 0 9 million and operating income was unchanged versus what was reported in this period last year there is no impact on the company s previously reported consolidated financial statements as you can see on our income statement the company recorded 3 8 million of transactional fx losses below the operating income line in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 4 million of fx gains in the fourth quarter of 2018 which is a negative 0 11 swing in our earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2018 transactional fx losses for the full year 2019 were 1 6 million historically going back five years the below the line transactional fx gains or losses have generally been less than 2 million each year for all of 2018 they were a 0 7 million loss and in 2017 they were a 1 million gain the company s primary method of mitigating these transactional fx losses is by minimizing cross currency balances to the extent possible in settling those cross currency accounts receivable and accounts payable balances in a timely manner as a reminder these losses are non cash and do not reflect the operational performance of the company since the fourth quarter of 2018 however the transactional fx losses below the operating income line has become much more volatile and this is mostly the result of our acquisition last year of industrias rotor pump in argentina which has been characterized as a hyperinflation economy and is subject to special accounting rules the rotor pump business primarily distributes pump products imported into argentina from all over the world beginning primarily in the third quarter the business in argentina began to build inventory and accounts payable rapidly in preparation for their primary selling season this acceleration at exactly the same time the argentinian peso was weakening significantly drove meaningful period to period unmatched balance sheet positions and subsequent volatility in the third and fourth quarters in the second half of 2019 despite the unsettled economic and political environment that exists there our business in argentina grew in constant currency by 3 although the full year 2019 fx loss of 1 6 million is within our historical range we have seen more volatility in the quarter to quarter fluctuations primarily due to the business unit in argentina at the end of the third quarter when we were discussing fourth quarter and full year 2019 results we did not anticipate this magnitude of transactional fx loss recorded in the quarter so as gregg said with the exception of some variances between individual business units our fourth quarter operational results were consistent with the fourth quarter of last year and our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 our effective tax rate net of discrete events was about 13 5 slightly lower than the 2018 effective tax rate of about 14 the 2019 full year effective tax rate is about 18 compared to the 2018 full year tax rate of about 12 5 for the full year of 2020 the company expects the effective tax rate net of discrete events to be between 18 and 20 the company ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with a cash balance of 64 4 million which was 5 2 million higher than at the end of 2018 the company had 19 million in borrowings on its revolving debt facilities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 77 million in borrowing at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 as of january 1 2019 the company adopted the new lease standard and has recognized additional operating liabilities of about 28 million for its outstanding operating leases with corresponding right of use assets of the same amount the impact of this new accounting standard is non cash in nature and does not affect the company s cash position the company does not consider the impact of this standard to be material to the consolidated results of operation or to the cash flows cash from operations for 2019 was about 178 million compared to 128 million in 2018 an increase of 50 million or almost 40 our free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment is about 157 million and is 163 of net income compared to about 100 for the full year 2018 this improvement in cash flow is primarily due to reductions in working capital which remains a key strategic focus for the company the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2019 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 the total remaining authorized shares that may be repurchased is about 1 3 million on january 27 the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 0 155 a 7 increase from the 2019 dividend the dividend will be paid february 20 to shareholders of record on february 6 this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to turn the call over for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from edward marshall with sidoti company your line is now open edward marshall sidoti company analyst gregg and john good morning gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning ed john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning ed edward marshall sidoti company analyst so i wanted to ask about the isd impact as it relates to china and i m curious what your what the guidance is baking into from the negative effects of that of that situation gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure ed so as we look at we had our isd system approved late in 2019 we had a handful of installations in late 2019 we expected several million dollars less than 10 million in 2020 of isd installations and that s effectively kind of what we ve pushed out or taken out this is a the opportunity of long term price these though is going to be as we see it more significant than the double wall piping initiative our revenue per station we expect would be about double and we think that it will be a longer term than the couple of three years we saw for the double wall pipes so we think it s going to be a more systemic growth in the business in china over time edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and previously you ve talked about buy local is that a theme that isd will affect isd or is that just on the underground piping systems gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think my view is that if you go back to the time when that specification for double wall pipe was reopened it was when there was a pretty contentious trade environment with the u s and it seems the trade tensions are at least directionally trending down and given that the electronic sophistication or the sophistication of the product rise i suspect that there is going to be a and this is also again a government mandate and the whole idea is for government connection and oversight of fueling station operations we would expect that that s going to be a pretty good situation for western technology in general edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and as i look into 2020 and we talk about you ve given us some good margin rather top line guidance i m curious if you talk about the margin in fueling john i think you ve said in the past that you anticipate that the high 20s which is where it s been trending is likely too high just any clarity you could provide on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our guidance assumes mid 20s fueling margin for 2020 edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay and then john do you have the you said latin america was up 20 in water do you have the constant currency impact in latin america have you done that math john j haines vice president chief financial officer well the 20 is the organic what we would call the organic growth which would take the opex out edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay so that is so that is constant currency okay john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah that s the that takes out both the acquisition impact and which is zero because we ve lapped the irp acquisition and it takes out the opex so the opex impact if you look at that table on page three of the release was about 3 7 million or 12 in the quarter for latin america so if we take the total when we take the reported growth and add that back that s how we get to the 20 edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it perfect and then last one from me when you look at your guidance for 2020 you talked about the cadence being first half weaker second half stronger i m just curious about the q1 you had a pretty soft q1 in 2019 do you anticipate that to be down year over if you could frame that out john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah we are intentionally not giving guidance in the first quarter ed for these reasons it s difficult for us to predict what we can say to you is that we do expect a weak first quarter but as you rightfully pointed out we had a weak first quarter in 2019 so i think about that we could say is that as greg said in his comments fueling is going to move to the right throughout the year so we have some tough comps there and we don t expect fueling to be up we don t we expect for sure that our dewatering equipment sales are going to be down fairly significantly they are also facing some very difficult comparables the balance of the water businesses and our distribution business should have a decent quarter so we re not optimistic about the first quarter ed but we re also not prepared to give specific quarter guidance either edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it thanks very much for your comments john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you ed operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global securities analyst hi thanks good morning guys gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning walter john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning walter walter liptak seaport global securities analyst i ve got one on china i think you mentioned that china was down 30 in the fourth quarter and so i wonder if you can give us an idea of directionally is that out more in the quarter are you starting to see any turn in china this quarter gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so our our thinking for china is no we don t see any turn maybe the second part of that question first of all we re concerned about we think the opportunity is great the pipe and containment opportunity is basically one that is great so the iot opportunities are a great opportunity for our company but given the economic uncertainty and the virus uncertainty kind of the the situation on the ground as we understand it there right now we just see this opportunity pushing right in 2020 so we think it s there we think we ll win our fair share but we think it s going to be the latter half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year now what we can say is that our estimate for revenue in china is dropping to about 30 million in total from 45 million in 2019 and about 53 million in 2018 so a meaningful decline there and again just reemphasis on back half loaded walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great i also wanted to ask about just generally the comments about the first half being weaker because of fueling and some of the water retail i m sorry rental those are a couple of your more that s better mix products so as we re modeling this out are you i guess the profit mix should be back half weighted too is that right john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah and walter that s why we wanted to point that out in our prepared remarks is that we just see that as you pointed out correctly the fueling business and the dewatering business which are higher margin businesses where they re going and particularly where the dewater business is going those are the businesses we expect are going to start the year slow we do expect the water business to do certainly better than the last year s first half but that s a lower margin business so water distribution so that s why we see the mix and the expectations for earnings to accelerate through the year but to start the year slow walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay got it and then a last one on argentina thanks for pointing out the volatility around that currency is there anything that you re doing differently in 2020 to mitigate the currency or how should we think about the kind of impact that argentina currency could have on 2020 gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah we a couple of things we do have our hedge positions in place walt that are really protecting us for the downside of the peso strengthening against the u s dollar that s a catastrophic kind of situation for us not to be over over excited about it or dramatic about it but so we do have positions like that in place i think the key learning is less working capital settle accounts payable as i pointed out one of our issues here is that we ve got product coming in from all over the world both franklin facilities non franklin products and selling those at those aps quicker is really important and that should be made easier by the fact that we re trying to lower the level of working capital everywhere so if we have less inventory that should contribute to that as well so those are some of the things we re doing but it is highly volatile the peso to the dollar the argentinean peso to the dollar loss about 30 just in the third quarter and then it went beyond that lost additional value in the fourth quarter so we ll do what we can to live in that kind of volatile world walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson analyst thanks can you maybe put a little bit of a finer point on the earnings cadence as you expected throughout the year clearly the first quarter sounds like it s going to be the low point i guess i m wondering if the underlying trends in fueling and dewatering shift out that normal q2 q3 high earnings watermark for the company so maybe put down a little bit of context because i guess i m just having a hard time given the north america groundwater has such an easy comparison in the first half of the year and given that that is at least in my opinion a pretty good margin business for the company especially in the ag motor only stuff that you guys sell i guess i m just having a little bit of a hard time with the earnings came so maybe can you put a finer point on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah matt i guess i would say that we certainly expect the first quarter to be the low point as you know the distribution business had a poor first quarter in 2019 but the first quarter is still the off quarter for distribution so even if we recover in the first quarter the first quarter is never a great a great quarter and then as gregg pointed out the comp is easier in north america for the balance of water and we would expect that to improve for sure but those products margins are not the same as what we see when we talk about fueling and dewatering large de watering so that is really the caution that we have i think that the peak being in the second and third quarters from an earnings perspective will remain the same i do think the fourth quarter will be significantly better than the first quarter and that s kind of the way we re thinking about it right now matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to pioneer i believe in the past you ve publicly stated in 18 that business did around 120 million in revenue can you maybe talk about how it performed in 19 and what your underlying assumption is for that excuse me for that piece in 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yes matt we can in 2000 let me just get to the right page here yeah in 2019 we did about 109 million full year in pioneer that includes all of the international operations and the rental business that same number for 2018 was about 119 million and in 2020 we see that going down just marginally or being pretty close to flat so we re not expecting growth in that business in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to the profit outlook for distribution i think when you originally made the forward moves into the channel you talked about that business getting into an operating profit range of 4 to 6 obviously you were below that in 18 below that again in 19 what s the sort of expectation you have for that business in 20 and do you need to make incremental structural changes to the business to generate that level of profitability gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer so matt we are planning for the distribution business to be within that range in 2020 many of the structural steps to get there were taken in 2019 and that s why we wanted to convey in my comments that things have settled down the focus is on the west i think we have to step back and say that in 2019 and what were really tough market conditions the distribution business actually was flat organically and that had to do with the focus by the leader de davis and his team on cross pollination getting into businesses that are less impacted by the cyclicality of the weather impact for example the ag as you pointed out earlier so they re getting more into turf and treatment and wastewater to grow that business and then on that report get an opportunity to have a more normal weather year to grow the business in the area of submersible pumping systems and lines you have turbine pumping systems which are more focused on the west and the margin profile in the west is generally more positive when there is strength there so we think that the structure is in place the team is in place obviously it s not laid on hand it s been a pretty competitive pricing environment with the weak business and the weak general climate business climate in 2019 we got a little bit upside down we acquired some commodity products in the middle of summer when pricing was a little stronger and as i pointed out we sold some of that off it will continue to add some margin pressure i think in q1 until we come into the season but expecting a more normal year our plan is for the business to be within the range that we originally talked about three years ago matt summerville d a davidson analyst and then maybe lastly just in terms of pricing overall for the company what the average realization was in 19 and what you re expecting for 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our realization in 2019 was just over 200 basis points matt and we re assuming something consistent with that in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst thank you guys operator thank you i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to gregg sengstack for any closing remarks gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you for joining us today on our conference call we look forward to speaking to you in april after the first quarter results are published have a good

quarter of 2019 decreased 11 percent compared with 240 9 million in the prior year revenues declined 5 percent in technical products and 15 percent in fine paper packaging the decrease resulted from lower volumes including the divestiture of the brattleboro mill and unfavorable currency effects these were partially offset by increased selling prices and a higher value technical products sales mix selling general and administrative sg a expense of 23 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 3 0 million compared with 2018 primarily as a result of timing of certain items operating income

operating income included favorable items totaling 4 1 million excluding these items adjusted operating income of 20 9 million in 2019 increased 53 percent compared with 13 7 million in 2018 the increase in operating income in 2019 resulted primarily from lower manufacturing and input costs and higher net pricing which were only partly offset by lower volumes and higher sg a expense net interest expense of 2 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased from 3 2 million in the prior period due to lower debt and interest rates in 2019 the company made net debt repayments of 35 8

netherlands cash flow and balance sheet cash provided from operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 2 million compared with 29 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decreased cash

million as of december 31 2018 fourth quarter segment results technical products net sales of 123 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased 7 percent compared with prior year sales of 133 5 million revenues decreased due to volume declines primarily due to lower backings sales in asia and negative foreign currency impacts these items were partially offset by increased selling prices and a higher value mix operating income of 11 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased from prior year income of 6 7 million operating income in 2019 included a net benefit of 1 6 million related primarily to the curtailment gain for a dutch pension plan and a net benefit of 0 6 million in 2018 mostly for acquisition related adjustments excluding these items adjusted operating income of 9 7 million in 2019 increased 3 6 million from prior year income of 6 1 million as a result of lower input and manufacturing costs and a more profitable mix that more than offset lower sales volumes fine paper packaging net sales of 90 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 15 percent lower compared with prior year sales of 105 9 million approximately one third of the decline was due to the divestiture of brattleboro the remainder of the decrease was due to lower commercial print volume including impacts from a change in relationship with a major distributor these items were partly offset by higher selling prices and growth in premium packaging operating income of 15 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased from 14 1 million in 2018 income in 2019 included adjusting items of 0 4 million for idled paper machine costs and compared to a 3 1 million benefit from adjusting items in 2018 primarily related to the brattleboro impairment loss excluding these items adjusted operating income of 15 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 4 6 million from 11 0 million in 2018 due to lower input costs and higher selling prices that more than offset lower sales volumes unallocated corporate costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 4 4 million compared with 3 4 million in 2018 unallocated corporate costs included an unfavorable adjustment of 0 3 million in 2018 there were no adjustments in 2019 excluding this 2018 item unallocated corporate costs increased by 1 3 million primarily due to timing of certain expenses following the sale of the brattleboro mill in december 2018 the other segment was discontinued in 2018 operating results in this segment reflected income of 0 4 million and included a favorable adjustment of 0 7 million related to the brattleboro impairment loss full year 2019 consolidated results consolidated net sales of 938 5 million in 2019 were 9 percent lower than the prior year the decrease resulted from lower volumes including the divestiture of the brattleboro mill and unfavorable currency effects these were partially offset by increased selling prices and a higher value technical products sales mix technical products revenues declined 7 percent while fine paper packaging revenues fell 11 percent approximately half of which was due to the sale of the brattleboro mill consolidated operating income of 78 3 million in 2019 increased from 54 1 million in the prior year the increase was mainly due to the absence of a 31 1 million impairment loss in 2018 related to the divestiture of the brattleboro mill excluding 4 8 million of net unfavorable adjustments in 2019 primarily due to idling of a fine paper machine and 30 7 million of net unfavorable adjustments in 2018 adjusted operating income decreased 1 7 million 2 primarily due to lower sales and production volumes and associated manufacturing fixed cost inefficiencies that were only partially offset by higher net selling prices and

reconciliation table adjusted income from continuing operations decreased 0 9 million in 2019 due to lower adjusted operating income and a higher effective tax rate the effective income tax rate in 2019 was 17 percent and 9 percent in 2018 income tax expense in 2018 was significantly reduced by the effects of the 31 1 million impairment loss of the brattleboro mill and associated research and

1 percent compared to 3 50 in 2018 cash provided by operating activities of 97 6 million for 2019 was 4 9 million higher than 92 7 million in the prior year the increase in cash flows resulted primarily from lower pension plan contributions partly offset by lower cash earnings capital spending of 21 4 million in 2019 compared with 38 1 million in 2018 spending was lower in 2019 as a result of a large environmental project completed in 2018 at the company s filtration plant in germany and lower required spending in 2019 for most businesses 2020 outlook the following items are expected to

fele earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 franklin electric co inc fele 0 24 q4 2019 earnings call 9 00 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the franklin electric reports fourth quarter and full year 2019 sales and earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakers presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now like to hand the conference to your speaker today john haines chief financial officer please go ahead sir john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you jewel and welcome everyone to franklin electric s fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call with me today is gregg sengstack our chairman and chief executive officer on today s call gregg will review our fourth quarter business results and i will review our fourth quarter financial results when i m through we ll have some time for questions and answers before we begin let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 these statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties many of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements a discussion of these factors may be found in the company s annual report on form 10 k and in today s earnings release all forward looking statements made during this call are based on information currently available and except as required by law the company assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statements with that i will now turn the call over to our chairman and ceo gregg sengstack gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you john as we expected our revenue and operating income were essentially flat to the fourth quarter of last year organic growth in both fueling systems and distribution offset negative organic growth in water systems fueling systems led the way with another record quarter on strong volume in the u s and mix distribution sales were also a record however the segment s fourth quarter operating loss was similar to last year our water systems business saw modest top line growth globally but not enough to offset lower large dewatering pumps sales in the u s recall that environmental regulations the requirement to move to tier 4 diesel engines in 2019 drove large pioneer pump sales in q4 of 2018 making for a very tough comp for the year consolidated sales were up 1 operating income was down 3 and earnings per share was down 9 while 2019 earnings were below plan in last year i am pleased to report that our focus on working capital resulted in free cash flow conversion of 163 of net income or about 3 35 per share a record for any year in our history returning to the fourth quarter i will start with distribution the business continue to improve in q4 with organic growth of about 6 however this came at a cost as our team moved out some more commodity type materials at lower margins resulting in an operating loss in the quarter similar to the loss in the fourth quarter of last year in our water systems segment revenue from our u s surface pump product line declined modestly in the quarter while u s groundwater product line revenue grew modestly our u s large dewatering pump revenue trailed last year s record results as continued push out of orders and slowing demand in rental and oil and gas end markets compounded the challenging comparisons to the strong fourth quarter last year at the same time our operations team continues to improve their ability to flex the operating cost base to maintain margins in this most cyclical business outside the u s sales in latin america accelerated compared to last year the team achieved 20 organic growth in the quarter all latin american markets grew organically with particularly strong results in brazil and the southern cone in europe the middle east and africa our water business improved modestly the continued recovery in our business in the middle east particularly turkey offset modest declines in europe and africa and consistent with prior quarters our water business in asia pacific grew modestly as well our u s fueling business continued to deliver strong growth driving another record quarter however in china fourth quarter results were essentially flat sequentially but down significantly from last year business in china was below our expectations as the conversion of underground piping systems appears to be winding down faster than anticipated strength across the rest of our international fueling markets essentially offset the sales decline in china so overall our fueling business achieved about 4 organic growth in the quarter turning to 2020 with more normal weather patterns we believe our distribution business will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range the business is well positioned working capital is trending lower the restructuring of our footprint in california is essentially complete as is the integration of milan supply which was acquired in early 2019 again with more normal weather in our strengthening latin american business we believe our global water systems segment will experience growth in the 5 to 7 range as well we expect the u s fueling business to continue to post strong results outside of china we expect our international fueling business to grow modestly while we expected 2020 fueling sales in china to continue to decline on lower sales in underground pipe we have planned that the regulatory initiatives around the installation of in station diagnostics for isd would partially offset this decline this view has changed over the last month the uncertainty of a negative impact on economic growth from the current coronavirus outbreak will likely delay the start of installations of isds beyond the impact of the current coronavirus outbreak on the china economy our supply chain leadership continues to monitor the post chinese new year start up of our supply base to best anticipate the potential disruptions both direct and indirect to our supply chain while we are encouraged with the information that our own factory and many of our tier 1 suppliers factories have reopened it s still unclear as to the degree delivery commitments will be impacted our global supply organization continues to monitor the situation daily and has contingency plans in place for many but not all sourced items so with that as a backdrop we are initiating our 2020 guidance for earnings per share before restructuring expenses at 2 25 to 2 35 however where our fueling and large dewatering business has started 2019 strong and weakened later in the year we are anticipating the opposite pattern in 2020 we believe the challenges in china and their impact on our fueling systems business combined with a slow start for the sale of our large dewatering equipment sales into rental and oil and gas applications will result in our overall sales and earnings pattern for 2020 to start off weak and accelerate throughout the course of the year we anticipate that due to our continued focus on our working capital 2020 will be another strong year for cash generation i will now turn the call over to john to discuss the numbers in more detail john john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you gregg our fully diluted earnings per share were 0 42 for the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 0 51 for the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter eps before the impact of restructuring expenses was 0 43 compared to 2018 fourth quarter eps before restructuring of 0 52 restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 0 8 million in the water segment were related to various manufacturing realignment activities and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 0 7 million primarily related to branch consolidations and other asset rationalizations in the distribution segment as well as various manufacturing realignment activities in the water and fueling segments and resulted in a 0 01 impact on earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 fourth quarter 2019 sales were 320 1 million compared to 2018 fourth quarter sales of 316 7 million an increase of 1 sales revenue decreased by 5 8 million or 2 in the fourth quarter of 2019 due to foreign currency translation and we estimate this revenue decline lowered our earnings per share in the fourth quarter by about 0 02 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales were 188 2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter 2018 sales of 196 9 million water systems organic sales decreased by about 3 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 water systems sales in the u s and canada decreased by 10 overall compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower sales volumes of dewatering equipment sales of dewatering equipment decreased by nearly 50 due to lower sales in rental channels and a surge of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by regulatory demand sales of groundwater pumping equipment increased by 4 versus the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in groundwater pumping systems was primarily due to increased sales of residential water systems sales of surface pumping equipment decreased by 5 on lower sales of both wastewater and water transfer systems water systems operating income was 24 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily driven by lower revenues fueling system sales were 77 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to fourth quarter of 2018 sales of 75 million and were a record for any fourth quarter fueling systems organic sales increased about 4 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling system sales in the u s and canada increased by 7 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase was principally in the pumping and fuel management systems product lines outside the united states and canada fueling systems revenues were flat as increased sales in europe india and latin america were offset by lower sales in china which declined by about 40 in the fourth quarter and about 14 for the full year 2019 versus 2018 fueling systems operating income was a record for any fourth quarter at 20 2 million compared to 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 fueling systems operating income was higher in the quarter due to favorable product sales mix distribution sales were 64 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus fourth quarter 2018 sales of 56 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 sales from businesses acquired since the fourth quarter of 2018 were 4 8 million the distribution segment sales grew about 6 organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 the distribution segment recorded an operating loss of 2 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a loss of 2 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 higher product costs higher sales mix of commodity type products little price achievement and higher operating expenses contributed to the distribution segment s earnings loss the company s consolidated gross profit was 101 3 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 a decrease from the fourth quarter of 2018 gross profit of 104 3 million the gross profit decrease was primarily driven was primarily due to lower water systems sales which were only partially offset by higher gross profit from increased fueling systems and distribution sales the gross profit as a percent of net sales was 31 6 in the fourth quarter versus 33 in the fourth quarter of 2018 selling general and administrative expenses were 71 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 75 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 sg a expenses from acquired businesses was 1 8 million and excluding the acquired entities the company s sg a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were 70 1 million a decrease of 7 from the fourth quarter of 2018 partially due to lower variable performance based compensation expenses and due to the offsetting effect of foreign currency translation versus the prior year during the first quarter of 2019 the company changed the management reporting for certain transfers and manufactured products between the water and fueling segments this change was made to better align the production of certain products by reportable segment and sales to third party customers to consistently compare 2019 results to the prior year certain 2018 net sales and operating income reclassifications were made these reclassifications resulted in lowering fourth quarter 2018 results of fueling systems and increasing fourth quarter 2018 results of water systems net sales by about 0 9 million and operating income was unchanged versus what was reported in this period last year there is no impact on the company s previously reported consolidated financial statements as you can see on our income statement the company recorded 3 8 million of transactional fx losses below the operating income line in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2 4 million of fx gains in the fourth quarter of 2018 which is a negative 0 11 swing in our earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2018 transactional fx losses for the full year 2019 were 1 6 million historically going back five years the below the line transactional fx gains or losses have generally been less than 2 million each year for all of 2018 they were a 0 7 million loss and in 2017 they were a 1 million gain the company s primary method of mitigating these transactional fx losses is by minimizing cross currency balances to the extent possible in settling those cross currency accounts receivable and accounts payable balances in a timely manner as a reminder these losses are non cash and do not reflect the operational performance of the company since the fourth quarter of 2018 however the transactional fx losses below the operating income line has become much more volatile and this is mostly the result of our acquisition last year of industrias rotor pump in argentina which has been characterized as a hyperinflation economy and is subject to special accounting rules the rotor pump business primarily distributes pump products imported into argentina from all over the world beginning primarily in the third quarter the business in argentina began to build inventory and accounts payable rapidly in preparation for their primary selling season this acceleration at exactly the same time the argentinian peso was weakening significantly drove meaningful period to period unmatched balance sheet positions and subsequent volatility in the third and fourth quarters in the second half of 2019 despite the unsettled economic and political environment that exists there our business in argentina grew in constant currency by 3 although the full year 2019 fx loss of 1 6 million is within our historical range we have seen more volatility in the quarter to quarter fluctuations primarily due to the business unit in argentina at the end of the third quarter when we were discussing fourth quarter and full year 2019 results we did not anticipate this magnitude of transactional fx loss recorded in the quarter so as gregg said with the exception of some variances between individual business units our fourth quarter operational results were consistent with the fourth quarter of last year and our expectations in the fourth quarter of 2019 our effective tax rate net of discrete events was about 13 5 slightly lower than the 2018 effective tax rate of about 14 the 2019 full year effective tax rate is about 18 compared to the 2018 full year tax rate of about 12 5 for the full year of 2020 the company expects the effective tax rate net of discrete events to be between 18 and 20 the company ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with a cash balance of 64 4 million which was 5 2 million higher than at the end of 2018 the company had 19 million in borrowings on its revolving debt facilities at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 and 77 million in borrowing at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 as of january 1 2019 the company adopted the new lease standard and has recognized additional operating liabilities of about 28 million for its outstanding operating leases with corresponding right of use assets of the same amount the impact of this new accounting standard is non cash in nature and does not affect the company s cash position the company does not consider the impact of this standard to be material to the consolidated results of operation or to the cash flows cash from operations for 2019 was about 178 million compared to 128 million in 2018 an increase of 50 million or almost 40 our free cash flow cash from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment is about 157 million and is 163 of net income compared to about 100 for the full year 2018 this improvement in cash flow is primarily due to reductions in working capital which remains a key strategic focus for the company the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2019 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 the total remaining authorized shares that may be repurchased is about 1 3 million on january 27 the company announced a quarterly cash dividend of 0 155 a 7 increase from the 2019 dividend the dividend will be paid february 20 to shareholders of record on february 6 this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to turn the call over for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from edward marshall with sidoti company your line is now open edward marshall sidoti company analyst gregg and john good morning gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning ed john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning ed edward marshall sidoti company analyst so i wanted to ask about the isd impact as it relates to china and i m curious what your what the guidance is baking into from the negative effects of that of that situation gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer sure ed so as we look at we had our isd system approved late in 2019 we had a handful of installations in late 2019 we expected several million dollars less than 10 million in 2020 of isd installations and that s effectively kind of what we ve pushed out or taken out this is a the opportunity of long term price these though is going to be as we see it more significant than the double wall piping initiative our revenue per station we expect would be about double and we think that it will be a longer term than the couple of three years we saw for the double wall pipes so we think it s going to be a more systemic growth in the business in china over time edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and previously you ve talked about buy local is that a theme that isd will affect isd or is that just on the underground piping systems gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer i think my view is that if you go back to the time when that specification for double wall pipe was reopened it was when there was a pretty contentious trade environment with the u s and it seems the trade tensions are at least directionally trending down and given that the electronic sophistication or the sophistication of the product rise i suspect that there is going to be a and this is also again a government mandate and the whole idea is for government connection and oversight of fueling station operations we would expect that that s going to be a pretty good situation for western technology in general edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it and as i look into 2020 and we talk about you ve given us some good margin rather top line guidance i m curious if you talk about the margin in fueling john i think you ve said in the past that you anticipate that the high 20s which is where it s been trending is likely too high just any clarity you could provide on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our guidance assumes mid 20s fueling margin for 2020 edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay and then john do you have the you said latin america was up 20 in water do you have the constant currency impact in latin america have you done that math john j haines vice president chief financial officer well the 20 is the organic what we would call the organic growth which would take the opex out edward marshall sidoti company analyst okay so that is so that is constant currency okay john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah that s the that takes out both the acquisition impact and which is zero because we ve lapped the irp acquisition and it takes out the opex so the opex impact if you look at that table on page three of the release was about 3 7 million or 12 in the quarter for latin america so if we take the total when we take the reported growth and add that back that s how we get to the 20 edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it perfect and then last one from me when you look at your guidance for 2020 you talked about the cadence being first half weaker second half stronger i m just curious about the q1 you had a pretty soft q1 in 2019 do you anticipate that to be down year over if you could frame that out john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah we are intentionally not giving guidance in the first quarter ed for these reasons it s difficult for us to predict what we can say to you is that we do expect a weak first quarter but as you rightfully pointed out we had a weak first quarter in 2019 so i think about that we could say is that as greg said in his comments fueling is going to move to the right throughout the year so we have some tough comps there and we don t expect fueling to be up we don t we expect for sure that our dewatering equipment sales are going to be down fairly significantly they are also facing some very difficult comparables the balance of the water businesses and our distribution business should have a decent quarter so we re not optimistic about the first quarter ed but we re also not prepared to give specific quarter guidance either edward marshall sidoti company analyst got it thanks very much for your comments john j haines vice president chief financial officer thank you ed operator thank you our next question comes from walter liptak with seaport global your line is now open walter liptak seaport global securities analyst hi thanks good morning guys gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning walter john j haines vice president chief financial officer good morning walter walter liptak seaport global securities analyst i ve got one on china i think you mentioned that china was down 30 in the fourth quarter and so i wonder if you can give us an idea of directionally is that out more in the quarter are you starting to see any turn in china this quarter gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah so our our thinking for china is no we don t see any turn maybe the second part of that question first of all we re concerned about we think the opportunity is great the pipe and containment opportunity is basically one that is great so the iot opportunities are a great opportunity for our company but given the economic uncertainty and the virus uncertainty kind of the the situation on the ground as we understand it there right now we just see this opportunity pushing right in 2020 so we think it s there we think we ll win our fair share but we think it s going to be the latter half of the year as opposed to the first half of the year now what we can say is that our estimate for revenue in china is dropping to about 30 million in total from 45 million in 2019 and about 53 million in 2018 so a meaningful decline there and again just reemphasis on back half loaded walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great i also wanted to ask about just generally the comments about the first half being weaker because of fueling and some of the water retail i m sorry rental those are a couple of your more that s better mix products so as we re modeling this out are you i guess the profit mix should be back half weighted too is that right john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah and walter that s why we wanted to point that out in our prepared remarks is that we just see that as you pointed out correctly the fueling business and the dewatering business which are higher margin businesses where they re going and particularly where the dewater business is going those are the businesses we expect are going to start the year slow we do expect the water business to do certainly better than the last year s first half but that s a lower margin business so water distribution so that s why we see the mix and the expectations for earnings to accelerate through the year but to start the year slow walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay got it and then a last one on argentina thanks for pointing out the volatility around that currency is there anything that you re doing differently in 2020 to mitigate the currency or how should we think about the kind of impact that argentina currency could have on 2020 gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer yeah we a couple of things we do have our hedge positions in place walt that are really protecting us for the downside of the peso strengthening against the u s dollar that s a catastrophic kind of situation for us not to be over over excited about it or dramatic about it but so we do have positions like that in place i think the key learning is less working capital settle accounts payable as i pointed out one of our issues here is that we ve got product coming in from all over the world both franklin facilities non franklin products and selling those at those aps quicker is really important and that should be made easier by the fact that we re trying to lower the level of working capital everywhere so if we have less inventory that should contribute to that as well so those are some of the things we re doing but it is highly volatile the peso to the dollar the argentinean peso to the dollar loss about 30 just in the third quarter and then it went beyond that lost additional value in the fourth quarter so we ll do what we can to live in that kind of volatile world walter liptak seaport global securities analyst okay great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt summerville with d a davidson your line is now open matt summerville d a davidson analyst thanks can you maybe put a little bit of a finer point on the earnings cadence as you expected throughout the year clearly the first quarter sounds like it s going to be the low point i guess i m wondering if the underlying trends in fueling and dewatering shift out that normal q2 q3 high earnings watermark for the company so maybe put down a little bit of context because i guess i m just having a hard time given the north america groundwater has such an easy comparison in the first half of the year and given that that is at least in my opinion a pretty good margin business for the company especially in the ag motor only stuff that you guys sell i guess i m just having a little bit of a hard time with the earnings came so maybe can you put a finer point on that john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah matt i guess i would say that we certainly expect the first quarter to be the low point as you know the distribution business had a poor first quarter in 2019 but the first quarter is still the off quarter for distribution so even if we recover in the first quarter the first quarter is never a great a great quarter and then as gregg pointed out the comp is easier in north america for the balance of water and we would expect that to improve for sure but those products margins are not the same as what we see when we talk about fueling and dewatering large de watering so that is really the caution that we have i think that the peak being in the second and third quarters from an earnings perspective will remain the same i do think the fourth quarter will be significantly better than the first quarter and that s kind of the way we re thinking about it right now matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to pioneer i believe in the past you ve publicly stated in 18 that business did around 120 million in revenue can you maybe talk about how it performed in 19 and what your underlying assumption is for that excuse me for that piece in 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yes matt we can in 2000 let me just get to the right page here yeah in 2019 we did about 109 million full year in pioneer that includes all of the international operations and the rental business that same number for 2018 was about 119 million and in 2020 we see that going down just marginally or being pretty close to flat so we re not expecting growth in that business in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst got it and then with respect to the profit outlook for distribution i think when you originally made the forward moves into the channel you talked about that business getting into an operating profit range of 4 to 6 obviously you were below that in 18 below that again in 19 what s the sort of expectation you have for that business in 20 and do you need to make incremental structural changes to the business to generate that level of profitability gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer so matt we are planning for the distribution business to be within that range in 2020 many of the structural steps to get there were taken in 2019 and that s why we wanted to convey in my comments that things have settled down the focus is on the west i think we have to step back and say that in 2019 and what were really tough market conditions the distribution business actually was flat organically and that had to do with the focus by the leader de davis and his team on cross pollination getting into businesses that are less impacted by the cyclicality of the weather impact for example the ag as you pointed out earlier so they re getting more into turf and treatment and wastewater to grow that business and then on that report get an opportunity to have a more normal weather year to grow the business in the area of submersible pumping systems and lines you have turbine pumping systems which are more focused on the west and the margin profile in the west is generally more positive when there is strength there so we think that the structure is in place the team is in place obviously it s not laid on hand it s been a pretty competitive pricing environment with the weak business and the weak general climate business climate in 2019 we got a little bit upside down we acquired some commodity products in the middle of summer when pricing was a little stronger and as i pointed out we sold some of that off it will continue to add some margin pressure i think in q1 until we come into the season but expecting a more normal year our plan is for the business to be within the range that we originally talked about three years ago matt summerville d a davidson analyst and then maybe lastly just in terms of pricing overall for the company what the average realization was in 19 and what you re expecting for 2020 john j haines vice president chief financial officer yeah our realization in 2019 was just over 200 basis points matt and we re assuming something consistent with that in 2020 matt summerville d a davidson analyst thank you guys operator thank you i m not showing any further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to gregg sengstack for any closing remarks gregg c sengstack chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you for joining us today on our conference call we look forward to speaking to you in april after the first quarter results are published have a good
