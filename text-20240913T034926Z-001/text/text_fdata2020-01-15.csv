the united states is currently in the longest economic expansion in recorded history which has led economists to predict an inevitable recession ref the economic future is unknowable but there are still concrete policies that lawmakers should consider given what is known about the current state of the economy and given lessons from past responses to economic downturns a pro growth agenda will strengthen the american economic expansion and if necessary can help to minimize the impact of any future recession the traditional tools for fighting economic downturns are almost always reactive managing the symptoms of a recession rather than promoting a proactive economic program for renewed growth increased government spending new regulations and other temporary ad hoc measures are always ill timed poorly targeted and never enough to satisfy their proponents even a decade after the last recession advocates for greater government intervention continue to call for additional stimulus spending ref the traditional approach of reactionary government directed fiscal stimulus has largely been unsuccessful even more tailored automatic stabilizers that are triggered when the economy begins to slow down and unemployment increases have costs that often outweigh the benefits even proponents of automatic stabilizers acknowledge that they are in need of reform ref furthermore automatic stabilizers perpetuate a cycle where the federal government s increased size and importance in the economy is used as justification for not ever returning federal programs and agencies to their appropriate size and scope ref focusing on subsidies to ameliorate the costs of lost jobs does nothing to address the causes of economic downturns and often exacerbates underlying obstacles faced by private markets a pro growth economic agenda to sustain continued economic opportunity should identify and remove government barriers to business investment and disincentives to work the economic situation america is in the midst of the longest economic expansion in recorded history which is benefiting everyone most of all lower income and less skilled americans there are more than 7 million job openings and wage growth has averaged above 3 percent over the past year ref meanwhile the lowest 10th percentile wage earner people making about 12 an hour experienced wage growth of 7 percent over the past year ref following the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tcja and a dramatic re orientation of the u s administrative state away from increasing regulatory burdens there were measurable increases in investment job openings and economic confidence ref the tax cuts for individual americans included lower marginal tax rates allowing people to work and save more even more fundamentally the reform cut taxes on new investments made in america by lowering the corporate income tax rate permanently and allowing immediate expensing for five years ref if made permanent the tax cuts and the administration s work to slow down the rate of new regulations and roll back the most punitive rules from past administrations will represent structural reforms to the american economy that will increase business investment and labor supply however there are also important factors that are restraining the economy s growth potential specifically there is a high level of policy uncertainty associated with domestic politics that is depressing the expected gains from tax and regulatory reforms the administration s approach to trade has upended global supply chains which has negative effects that ripple through the world economy threatened or imposed tariffs on america s biggest trading partners including canada the european union japan and mexico is precipitating the balkanization of once increasingly free global markets unprecedented levels of government debt and medium term uncertainty about the direction of domestic fiscal policy after the 2020 presidential and congressional elections pose significant additional economic risks this uncertainty depresses economic conditions by pushing investors into safer assets leading firms to postpone or forgo investments and hiring slowing productivity growth and depressing consumption expenditures ref global uncertainties compound domestic risks as the u k negotiates separation with the european union japan raises its consumption tax italy stares down an impending debt crisis and china struggles with demographic changes and economic mismanagement among many others during the longest expansion in american history policymakers should double down on what has been working and fix what is not congress needs to reassert its authority in setting tariffs advance new free trade agreements and advance the freedom for americans to trade in order to quiet long term uncertainty associated with trade the 2017 tax cuts must be made permanent and deficits need to shrink to ensure taxes stay low the administration can continue to roll back past expansions of existing laws but until congress targets the costliest financial environmental and labor regulations new investments will always be threatened by future executive reinterpretation of existing laws consumer spending and confidence remain bright spots in the economic data when demand is strong and there are plenty of jobs the economic agenda could not be any clearer additional growth must by definition come from a greater supply of workers and more investment removing impediments to supply requires the tedious work of ensuring policy certainty for long term planning and culling unproductive laws and regulations that have built up over time trade certainty the costs for americans buying and selling goods abroad has steadily increased in the past few years due to this administration s trade policy ref compounding the direct cost increases from tariffs uncertainty about future trade policy has the effect of delaying planned business activity or canceling planned investments altogether ref in 2018 the average applied tariff rate in the u s increased from 1 5 percent to 2 6 percent ref by the end of 2019 the u s government had increased tariffs on roughly 15 percent of total imports and nearly all imports from china ref this dramatic spike in tariffs has resulted in an uncertain environment for sectors ranging from automotive manufacturing to retail sales other countries are also signing trade agreements without the u s leaving u s exporters at a competitive disadvantage threatened tariffs on countries other than china as well as global uncertainty over eu u k trade have created tremendous uncertainty which presents an economic challenge for the united states in the years to come new trade agreements congress and the administration can begin to undo the ongoing economic turmoil by resolving the trade dispute with china and advancing new trade agreements as soon as possible there are several economies that stand out as potential free trade partners for the united states taiwan for example has long been a strong economic partner u s exporters could gain access to the eurasia market through the country of georgia switzerland has shown that it is a competitive and dynamic economy geographically in the middle of the european union though it is not an eu member building a stronger trading relationship with tunisia could help the citizens of both countries increase economic opportunity ref finally advancing free trade agreements with the u k and japan could benefit consumers in each country lower tariffs more than 60 percent of all u s imports are intermediate goods business inputs such as steel or aluminum or capital goods such as machinery ref low or zero tariffs on intermediate goods allow american manufacturers to access inputs at competitive prices and thereby allow them to more efficiently produce finished goods the administration can unilaterally eliminate all tariffs that it has imposed since 2018 including those on washers solar products steel aluminum and specific imports from china congress should eliminate tariffs on all intermediate goods to help institutionalize a more certain business climate and make prices more competitive in the global market congress should also renew and make permanent the generalized system of preferences gsp and miscellaneous tariff bill mtb before these programs expire in december 2020 the gsp is a preferential tariff program for developing countries which allows products from certain countries to be imported without tariffs ref the mtb eliminates specific tariffs for some products that are not available in the u s ref doing so would provide additional certainty for those u s companies that import under these programs and allow them to better plan for future purchases streamlining costly financial environment and labor regulations regulations accumulate over time incrementally adding new costs that depress output restrict innovation reduce the supply of jobs and labor and limit financial markets the work of removing the many impediments to the supply side is a tedious task that requires a marie kondoing of our public life not a grand new initiative as put by economist john cochrane ref by focusing on financial environment and labor regulations congress can address some of the biggest federal impediments to the private sector no list is comprehensive the work of sifting through the accumulated federal laws and their regulatory progeny will require institutional dedication over several years many constraints also come from state and municipal governments through zoning that restricts housing supply and licensure that restricts the supply of credentialed professions financial regulations many types of financial firms not just banks have long dealt with increasingly complex capital rules liquidity rules disclosure rules leverage rules and the constant threat that regulators can create new rules or enforce old rules differently over regulating financial intermediaries makes it difficult to create and maintain the jobs and businesses that are the backbone of the american economy for at least a century the u s regulatory framework has protected incumbent financial firms from new competition suppressing the very market forces that drive innovation reduce prices and prevent excessive risk taking the result is that entrepreneurs have suffered from fewer opportunities and consumers have suffered from fewer choices higher prices and less knowledge of financial risks in order to spur innovation opportunity and growth federal officials should start with the following reforms create a new financial firm charter u s banking law remains stuck in the 1930s with regard to which functions financial companies should perform it was never a good idea to restrict banks to only take deposits and make commercial loans and it was never a good idea to prevent investment banks from taking deposits doing so makes markets less stable all financial intermediaries function by pooling the financial resources of those who want to save and funneling them to others who are willing and able to pay for additional funds this fact should be the underlying principle that guides u s financial laws policymakers should create new charters for financial firms that eliminate activity restrictions and reduce regulations in return for straightforward higher equity or risk retention standards ref these charters will ultimately replace government regulation with competition

between 5 billion and 8 billion annually there is little to no evidence that the bsa aml laws are a cost effective law enforcement tool any international information sharing regime must include serious safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals and businesses major reforms are necessary ref environmental regulations americans want a clean healthy and safe environment and the major environmental statutes are costly outdated and fail to achieve their objectives efficiently or effectively rather they are often used by activists to block and delay significant new investments in public and private infrastructure investors must spend their resources on lobbying fighting lawsuits and filing paperwork congress should reform outdated and unnecessary regulations and shift more responsibility for environmental protection to the states which are better equipped to customize policies for local conditions than washington below are some of the most important barriers to economic development that achieve little to no environmental benefit congress and the administration could dramatically improve the landscape for new investments across every sector of the economy while protecting the environment by first addressing these reforms congress and the administration should repeal the national environmental policy act nepa rather than improving environmental outcomes nepa has evolved to become a tool to delay and obstruct projects that are unpopular with special interest groups or politicians who ignore scientific and technical expertise in one instance a mining company waited 17 years for a permit ref for highway projects the average time to complete an environmental impact statement increased from 2 2 years in the 1970s to 8 1 years in 2011 ref far from

retirement saving subsidies continue to become more widely available nevertheless federal rules drive up the cost of employment and complicate the employer employee relationship decreasing the flexibility of the labor market and increasing the hurdle that potential workers must cross to join the productive economy america is simultaneously experiencing historically low unemployment while not yet reaching full employment while the prime age labor force participation rate is trending up it has not fully rebounded from the crises of the 2000s in 2017 the executive director of the joint economic committee of congress scott winship argued that the rise in labor force inactivity is primarily a supply side issue meaning more people are choosing not to work and this continues to be the case today ref as alternatives to work become cheaper more enjoyable and financially possible through government and other subsidies impediments to labor force participation and the supply of labor in general will have an outsized impact on economic growth and productivity to sustain a healthy labor market federal policymakers should start with the following reforms harmonize the government s multiple definitions of employee different tests and rules to determine who is and is not an employee of a company make it difficult for employers and workers to differentiate between employees and contractors this increases costs and decreases employee flexibility for the rapidly growing number of independent contractors if businesses can be held liable for the actions of contractors over whom they exercise little or no control there will be fewer jobs available for workers and fewer opportunities for entrepreneurs congress should clarify the test for independent contractor status under the fair labor standards act the national labor relations act and the tax code based on the common law test that bases determinations on how much control an employer exerts over a worker similarly

increasing productivity and immigration helps to increase the labor supply to generate higher economic output in the economics literature it is widely accepted that the overall economic impact of immigration is economic growth businesses tend to respond to increased immigration by investing in new capital for example by building additional factories which suggests that immigration does not crowd out existing work ref sound immigration policies can help to supply workers for the more than 7 million open jobs through a merit based system immigration enforcement and pro growth economic policies that will allow american workers and the american economy to continue to prosper creating tax certainty and removing disincentives for business investment the 2017 tcja was a structural reform to the u s tax code to remove disincentives to work and invest the tax cuts for individual americans included lower marginal tax rates so that people are able to save more of their earnings the reform also cut taxes on new investments made in america by lowering the corporate income tax rate and allowing immediate expensing for some assets investment in capital is what makes workers more productive and leads to higher wages and more jobs ref undermining some of the predicted benefits the law created uncertainty for businesses and individuals some sources of uncertainty include a highly complex new international tax system many provisions that change over time and the individual tax cuts expire after 2025 congress s first order of business should be to clarify remaining ambiguities in the law and make the temporary provisions permanent this will allow businesses and individuals to plan more comfortably for the future congress should also consider continuing to lower tax disincentives to investment and work congress should expand expensing by not allowing companies to account for the full cost of their investments when they are incurred the u s tax code reduces investment which translates to lower productivity and smaller income gains the 2017 tax cuts temporarily addressed this problem by allowing companies to immediately expense some short lived investments but other investments such as buildings still have to use the costly and complicated pre tcja system permanent tax cuts and expanded expensing to all investments could significantly boost

lowering the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to the originally proposed 15 percent would continue to support the gains from tax reform and paired with full expensing could be a powerful and fast acting antidote to slumping business investment similarly cutting the tax rate on capital gains and dividends and indexing gains to inflation would unlock privately held investments so that they can be better deployed throughout the economy lastly reducing the individual income tax rates beyond the modest 2017 tax cuts could further decrease disincentives to work and allow the millions of small businesses that are taxed as individuals to grow privatizing government owned assets the federal government owns and operates far too many assets which could be better managed by the private sector or decommissioned to create room for innovative new industries services and products to meet the changing needs of americans in some cases federal assets are underutilized or unused in other cases federal activities are quite clearly private sector endeavors that do not belong under the purview of the federal government markets will make better use of underutilized federal properties to the benefit of customers and local communities privatizing assets will also increase the tax base and therefore federal state and local tax revenues the benefits of privatization far outweigh the upfront costs of privatization such as those caused by budget scoring rules that make privatization unnecessarily difficult politically there are many individual examples of successful divestment of federal assets among them the old post office pavilion in washington dc which was transformed from a languishing food court to a five star hotel under the provisions of a 60 year lease to the trump organization in 2013 the south nevada public land management act of 1998 which made 68 000 acres of federal lands near las vegas available for purchase and generated proceeds for nevada s general education fund the southern nevada water authority and federal conservation and maintenance projects and the alaska power administration asset sales and termination act of 1995 which sold federally managed electricity generation transmission and administrative assets between 1995 and 1998 and generated over 87 million in revenues ref there are a variety of ways to accomplish the downsizing of federal assets undertaking a process similar to military base re alignment and closure brac to dispose of a large number of surplus property is one approach in some cases it may be most appropriate to transfer managerial authority to states for example in the case of some federal lands which can then determine courses of action according to their unique circumstances congress and the trump administration should privatize the following assets federal buildings the federal government holds a vast array of real property leasing or owning approximately 295 000 buildings in the united states

inherent government function yet the nuclear waste policy act established a system where the department of energy is legally responsible for collecting and storing waste from commercial nuclear reactors decades of dysfunction demonstrate the federal government s inability to manage nuclear waste rationally economically or at all taxpayers and electricity ratepayers have spent more than 15 billion to evaluate a repository site at yucca mountain in nevada and no technical or scientific evidence has yet disqualified it as a viable option congress should appropriate funds to complete the review of the yucca mountain permit application and transition to a more market based approach that allows for an innovative multi dimensional market with an array of management opportunities for the future nuclear industry the private sector should ultimately take responsibility for managing its own nuclear waste with the government limited to providing regulatory oversight and taking final ownership of any waste upon final disposal similar to the approach in finland ref restraining and reforming federal spending economists often forecast that the effects associated with government spending deployed correctly and quickly will have a multiplier effect returning more economic growth than the simple dollar outlay ref such predictions often come up well short of the estimates necessary to make the outlays worth the cost ref the most common calls are for new spending directed at infrastructure projects like all demand side stimulus the results of new infrastructure spending are typically disappointing temporary spending increases tend to shift resources within the industry rather than resulting in a permanent expansion in the number of firms or jobs ref existing supply side constraints around permitting labor union prevailing wage requirements and procurement restrictions also remain obstacles that must be overcome regardless of the funding source ref unshackling infrastructure investment rather than increasing the federal role in infrastructure policymakers should meet calls for increased spending by first removing the existing constraints on already appropriated funding and private activity by scaling back regulations expediting permitting and reforming energy sector regulations can unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in economic value over the next decade ref the administration s one federal decision policy to streamline environmental reviews is a positive example of such reforms and should be codified by congress ref removing barriers to private ownership and operation of airports ref reforming airport funding ref and privatizing air traffic control ref would revitalize the aviation industry reforming federal rules regarding private activity bonds and public private partnerships can facilitate significant new private funding for infrastructure projects ref the per dollar value of existing federally funded infrastructure projects could be increased by repealing the davis bacon act for setting wages repealing project labor agreements for work rules and repealing buy america restrictions on materials ref prioritizing spending from the highway trust fund by eliminating non highway spending diversions and devolving existing federal transportation spending and taxes to state and local governments would further increase the economic value and speed of taxpayer funded infrastructure projects ref de risking the debt large debts and uncontrolled deficits are a poorly understood source of economic uncertainty even given the substantial literature on government debt this is at least partly due to the fact that sustained high levels of sovereign debt during peace time are a relatively new phenomenon any economic crisis will only expand the gulf between revenues and outlays as people rely on existing benefit programs more heavily and tax revenue declines existing u s debt and deficits create uncertainties that are likely a source of current debt market instability and depressed investment as governments around the world continue to rely on unprecedented levels of debt central banks themselves are also purchasing more government debt than ever before ref historically this has been an important tool that has allowed the u s government to run deficits during recessions without worrying too much about associated short run concerns with deficits already close to historic highs traditional fiscal policy could face new constraints similar uncertainty exists around how the federal reserve will unwind its balance sheet if the economy remains strong and what remaining tools it has to use in the case of a downturn as interest rates remain historically low large deficits can also mute the impact of tax policy as investors are forward looking and know that if spending is not reasonably constrained and reformed taxes are likely to increase ref tax cuts are often associated with future tax increases absent spending reductions ref this causes businesses to hold back investments while becoming more risk averse at the same time new taxes are often associated with new spending rather than deficit reduction ref however the policy uncertainty alone associated with increased deficits is enough to depress economic growth ref the main drivers of spending growth and the national debt are social security health care entitlement programs and interest payments on the national debt by 2029 these categories of spending will consume 86 percent of all federal revenues ref medicare is projected to run out of reserve funding by 2026 and the social security trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2035 the funding shortfalls mean benefits will be cut or taxes will increase substantially ref reforming entitlements is the key to putting the federal budget on a long term path to sustainability and reducing the risks associated with the national debt ref reforms the best way to respond to an economic slowdown is by removing disincentives that stand in the way of economic activity through ensuring policy predictability and pursuing an environment that does not discourage working saving and investing there are a number of ways that policymakers can achieve such an environment including many of the proposals offered in this backgrounder it might be the case that recessions can never be avoided but it is possible to reform current policies so that they stop depressing economic activity while also providing policymakers with additional needed flexibility during recessions when they do happen to remove barriers to innovation economic opportunity and growth federal officials should pursue trade agreements and lower tariffs in order to increase choice

overview news that us tariffs on china will remain until through at least the november us election and continued us attempts to stymie china e g more curbs on huawei under consideration and stepped up efforts to force it to cut subsidies to business have taken some momentum from the push into risk assets the msci asia pacific index snapped a four day advance today with only australian equities among the large regional markets able to sustain upticks europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is hoving near record highs and is little changed through the morning session us shares are also little changed benchmark 10 year yields are mostly 2 3 basis points lower though the rate adjustment in the uk continues the dollar is mixed with sterling the antipodean and scandis heavier and leaving the swiss franc japanese yen and the euro slightly firmer emerging market currencies are mostly heavier with the chinese yuan slipping for the first time in five sessions march light sweet crude oil continues to staddle the 58 a barrel level while gold is recovering from the pullback that saw 1536 yesterday it is back above 1550 today asia pacific the signing ceremony for phase 1 of the us china trade deal is at hand the actual text of the agreement has been closely guarded as an executive agreement which does not require congressional consent e g nafta 2 0 the secrecy is allowed the us has indicated that even after the deal is published an annex that details the amounts of goods that china has agreed to purchase will remain confidential while us officials have denied the existence of other secret deals the market suspects otherwise consider the report that acknowledged that there was nothing in the formal agreement about the tariffs it turns out that there is an understanding that the existing tariffs will not be addressed for ten months after the signing which incidentally is also after the us national elections the us wants to monitor implementation before making any concessions on commitments for which there is a quantitative target an assessment may be straightforward however qualitative issues are different consider currency manipulation and the fact that the us resorted to a 1988 definition rather than the quantitative one that congress provided in 2015 china has denied claims of systematically stealing foreign technology and it has stiffened penalties for intellectual property violations again judgment calls will be required which is different than china s target is to boost the us goods by 200 bln over two years it seems little has been secured that could not have been achieved two years ago when president trump rejected the trade agreement that treasury secretary mnuchin had struck leaving aside the rhetoric and domestic messaging to get to the deeper structural issues it is clear that a multilateral approach is necessary such as the initiative that was taken this week at the wto by the us europe and japan to broaden and deepen prohibitions of state subsidies this is important because almost 2 3 of traded goods compete with businesses that receive subsidies the us dollar reached jpy110 20 yesterday and is consolidating in about a 10 tick range on either side of jpy109 90 today a break of the jpy109 75 area could see a push toward the jpy109 30 jpy109 40 area where there are also 1 2 bln in options expiring today unable to extend gains much above 0 6900 the australian dollar is seeing some profit taking today that has pushed it back to about 0 6880 an option for about a 885 mln at 0 6875 expires today and a break below there weakens the technical tone the chinese yuan rose for the first time in five sessions today but the us dollar did not sustain the upticks above cny6 89 some demand for the yuan is still being linked to the upcoming lunar new year as dollars proceeds are converted to yuan to cover costs during the extended holiday many remain skeptical about the yuan s strength outside of the very near term europe germany france italy and spain seemed to have reported stronger than expected november industrial output figures recently but the aggregate report disappointed not only did the november increase of 0

retail sales at the end of the week and a strong recovery from the 0 6 fall in november may spur some paring back of expectations the euro is trading with a firmer tone rising to a little through 1

after being aggressively pushed below chf1 08 yesterday the euro was sold through chf1 0750 today lastly softer than expected underlying swedish inflation reduces the chance that the riksbank follows

america the signing of phase 1 of the us and china trade agreement and the publication of the details are center stage today the ceremony is set for a little before noon in washington the fact there are no plans to reduce us tariffs on china for at least the next ten months dampens some enthusiasm at the same time us efforts at the wto and to block more sales to huawei underscores the idea that the phase 1 deal does not really impact the larger scale rivalry between the two which is not just about economics and trade separately us banks reported positive results yesterday and more are expected today bank of america goldman sachs morgan stanley and blackrock the us also reports december ppi today a 0 2 increase in the headline and core rate would bring the former to 1 3 to match the

business news of wednesday 15 january 2020 source laudbusiness com this year a cautious resumption of monetary easing is on the cards ahead of general elections in december with the aim of giving slowing economic growth a boost by increasing liquidity in the economy and reducing the cost of borrowing although there are political considerations involved in this the manner in which the current top tier executive management of the bank of ghana replaced their predecessors following the assumption of office of the president nana akufo addo assumption in 2017 has put paid to any illusions that the central bank is fully independent of the executive arm of government as established by law the economics of ghana s current circumstances support monetary easing too inflation by the end of 2019 was 7 9 percent which is lower than both government s end of year target and the median of the bog s target band of eight percent plus or minus two percent the cedi has been relatively stable since recovering from its world beating rate of depreciation during the first ten weeks of last year and indeed actually appreciated marginally against the united states dollar during the end of year festivities in stark contrast to its traditional tendency to depreciate significantly because of demand for foreign exchange to fund the customary year end rise in imports to meet the seasonal spike in consumerism furthermore economic growth has slowed for two consecutive years after jumping sharply in 2017 year on year growth by the third quarter of last year had fallen to 5 4 percent well below both the 8 5 percent achieved in 2017 and the 7 0 percent targeted for 2019 although the bog claims to be an inflation targeting central bank in actual fact economic growth considerations are given the same quantitative weight as inflation targeting in the setting of its benchmark monetary policy rate every two months importantly the decision by the america s federal reserve bank not to raise its key federal funds rate currently 1 6 percent means monetary easing in ghana should not lead to an exit stampede by foreign portfolio investors from government s medium and long term cedi denominated domestic debt securities this is a crucial consideration since the most recent cut in the mpr by 100 basis points down to 16 0 percent a year ago led to such heavy disinvestment by foreign portfolio investors resulting in sharp cedi depreciation and ultimately a financing crisis for government this was because the mpr cut was made at a time the us fed was tightening its own monetary policy stance thus increasing interest rates in america just as the bog was lowering rates in ghana the economist intelligence unit has predicted a cut in the bog s mpr by the last week in january further heightening expectations by heavily credit dependent corporate ghana that interest rates are about to be guided downwards for the first time since this time last year indeed expectations have shifted from whether or not the mpr will be cut to the extent of the impending cut with predictions ranging from 50 basis points to 100 basis points which would leave the benchmark rate at either 15 5 percent or 15 0 percent as the case may be but corporate ghana may be getting ahead of itself the bog has been very cautious about monetary easing over the past one year and indeed the international monetary fund is recommending readiness to actually go the other way towards monetary tightening in order to ameliorate the effects of any fiscal deficit overrun by government during the run up to the 2020 general elections as has usually been the case in election years the imf will not get that particular wish though bog governor dr ernest addison has publicly declared his confidence that government will keep within its self imposed 5 0 percent of gross domestic product fiscal deficit ceiling this year and thus does not expect the need to tighten monetary policy in response to fiscal pressures nevertheless the central bank will be very cautious in its monetary easing possibly implementing two consecutive 50 basis point reductions in the mpr rather than one 100 basis points cut besides this the bog will prudently try to get short term interest rates to fall faster than medium and long term interest rates indeed the latter may be kept where they are now thus steepening ghana s yield curve actually this is a strategy introduced by the bog last year it aims at lowering borrowing costs for local private enterprise which mainly borrows short term because of the dearth of long term deposits to prudently finance long term loans while keeping medium and long term rates high enough to retain the patronage of foreign portfolio investors who subscribe to more than 80 percent of the government debt securities issued over such tenors this is prudent strategy and importantly local enterprises in ghana that issue medium term corporate bonds on the stock market to finance their activities such as letshego bayport and ishwe all of them being savings and loans companies have already adjusted to the higher medium term interest rates they have had to offer on their corporate bond issues over the past year and a half thus a steepening of ghana s yield curve through lower short term rates but stable medium long term rates will enable local private enterprise to borrow more cheaply but at the same time retain yields on medium and long term government and corporate debt issuances that are high enough to keep foreign portfolio investors happy however deposit rates will not fall commensurately because financial intermediation firms are already having to cope with slower industry wide deposit growth than at any other time over the past decade banking industry deposits only grew by some 17 1 percent year on year up to october 2019 according to the latest data from the bog compared with 20 7 percent during the previous year with the recent melt downs in both the savings and loans and the microfinance industries making investors more conservative as to where they keep their monies safety has become as important as offered yields but the smaller banks and non bank financial intermediaries in particular are having to fight harder than ever before to attract sufficient deposits with which to generate profits that justify the significant increases in capital put up by their shareholders under recent recapitalization programmes insisted on by the bog competition for deposits will be intensified this year because of the commencement of deposit insurance because only retail deposits will be guaranteed under the scheme with relatively low caps many astute depositors will opt to spread their monies across several different institutions in order to stay within the cap in each institution so that effectively all their deposits will be insured this creates the potential for a more level playing field than ever before among deposit taking financial institutions but this will be underpinned by fiercer competition for deposits as well with offered yields being the major competitive tool employed competition will also intensify in the financial services industry along the lines of service quality and product innovation as well here digitization will be the biggest driving force already all the banks in ghana have deployed digital apps that offer lots of unprecedented convenience for customers with regards to providing payment platforms as a way of attracting relatively cheap deposits other genres of financial intermediaries are now enthusiastically following suit this being made possible by partnering the growing number of financial technology firms that design and distribute digital products and services on their behalf this trend will intensify further this year government s plans to issue yet another us 3 billion eurobond relatively early in the year aims to relieve pressure on the domestic money market from its own financing needs thus making more loanable funds available to needy private enterprises and households but the banks themselves are proving more comfortable investing in what cedi denominated government debt securities are available than in lending to the private sector despite the considerably wider interest margins derived from the latter how monetary easing and consequent lower yields on government securities and lending rates on private sector lending will play out is yet to be seen stock market based on trend analysis it is expected that the ghana stock exchange should rebound this year an election year after ending 2019 with a woeful performance returning about 12 25 with a market capitalization of ghc 56 791 28 million investopedia defines trend analysis as a technique used in technical analysis that attempts to predict the future stock price movements based on observed data trend this is based on the idea that events in the past gives traders an idea of what will happen in the future given that the gse has followed a particular pattern in election years of which 2020 may not be different the markets biggest return was in 2004 when it returned 91 33 percent followed by 2008 and then 2012 returning 58 06 percent and 23 81 percent respectively all of these being election years however1992 and 2016 were odd as the market returned 3 63 percent and 15 33 percent respectively which means expectations of a bull market this year based on similar trends in the past are not cast in iron fundamental reasons could be attributed to these returns aside the fact that they were election years the stock exchange thrives on good financial performance of the listed companies which emanates mainly from stable macro economic factors the 2016 woeful performance was attributed to high inflation high interest rate unstable exchange rate power crises among others mainly emanating from preceding years it is anticipated that the stock market can only rebound when the banking crises is entirely resolved and when locked up funds are adequately released to beneficiaries a major policy for 2020 will be the development of a harmonised primary dealer manual to guide the markets government also intends to promote bond specialists to support the development of the domestic market ghana fixed income market in 2020 the fixed income market should expect more investible products this was indicated in 2020 budget that the ghana fixed income market gfim is positioning itself for this course gfim has tasked itself to promote the corporate bond market in order for corporate institutions to use the market to raise funds to expand their operations which may lead to increased production and create more jobs for the labour market in addition government would continue to use the market to raise funds to finance the national budgets and to develop infrastructure again gfim will introduce securities lending and borrowing develop other fixed income securities such as commercial papers and municipal bonds and create indices for the market gfim is collaborating with other stakeholders such as securities and exchange commission bank of ghana and the ministry of finance to establish a domestic credit rating agency to bring onto the market independent credit worthy assessment of issuers who come to the market to raise money it is the view of gfim that introducing credit ratings will deepen the market especially the corporate bond sector of the market gfim will also engage in investor and public education about the safeness of this platform for investment and the need for investing public to avoid risky investment schemes that promise unrealistic returns forex market for 2020 the bank of ghana is planning to auction a total of us 715 million in foreign exchange on the forward market as this would aid in curbing the effect of speculative activities on the foreign exchange fx market this will be in accordance with the foreign exchange forward auction guidelines issued in september 2019 based on the auction guidelines all authorized foreign exchange dealer banks shall also comply with the provisions of the code of conduct for the interbank foreign exchange market in ghana the central bank expects that the maximum bids to be submitted shall not exceed three bids per authorized dealer banks successful banks will be expected to provide the required cedis on trade date in the case where they are buying a forward contract allowable spread between bid and offer for banks clients shall be 25 pips 0 0025 cedis further to this all bids are expected to be backed by customer demand and documentation which shall be submitted to the director of financial markets department of bog in 24 hours after release of the auction results the central bank will continue to sell the usd to the banks at the mid rate on the condition that these banks would also sell at the same rate at which it has been received in effect the banks are receiving us dollars to finance operations but cannot add on to the price in any way that would cause the rates spiral due to the foreign exchange risks associated with exposure to offshore investors government in close coordination with the bank of ghana will undertake periodic bond buyback operations to ensure orderly redemption of domestic debt held by foreign investors this will help mitigate the unintended consequences of occasional outflow surges of foreign capital and its impact on the domestic currency the implementation of the floor price and premium price for ghana s cocoa on the global market as well as inflow from the cocoa syndicated loan is expected to further bolster inflows of foreign exchange this year these should improve the net foreign assets nfa of the central bank and the foreign reserves position to support the forex market thus steadying the exchange rate in the 2020 budget the expected growth in the central bank s nfa would have to be supported by monetization of the foreign currency inflows this is projected together with increased deposit mobilization to instigate growth in reserve money rm and other monetary aggregates m1 m2 and m2 and exert upward pressure on inflation beyond the medium term horizon but importantly not this year which is strictly a short term horizon international capital market issuance in line with our medium term debt strategy and consistent with the 2020 macro fiscal framework government will do yet another major eurobond issuance of up to us 3 0 billion for its international capital market programme for 2020 the choice of instruments for this programme will be based on market conditions possibility and feasibility of the issuance in 2020 these are regular sovereign bond green bond sdg bonds syndicated loans financing and sukuk bonds the use of proceeds would be to finance growth and growth oriented expenditures in the budget interventions to reduce expenditures in the budget and liability management
a great deal hinges on this relationship image credit 2017 getty images there is no better place in the uk to interview a global strategist particularly one of a contrarian bent than edinburgh s library of mistakes lom two small rooms in the georgian new town jammed with books and papers on the many many financial disasters of the past russell napier is also the keeper of the lom making it even more perfect we start with china and the us the link between their currencies is the cornerstone of the global monetary system give me any asset price in the world for the last 25 years and i can relate it to the link between china and america says napier change the nature of that link and you change the way the world works so how exactly does it work now china has effectively been managing its currency the renminbi rmb against the us dollar since 1994 that s worked out well in some ways but now that growth has slowed the rmb may be overvalued stymying all government efforts to stimulate the economy since last april if an eventual trade deal with the us involves keeping the rmb at current levels as rumours suggest the chinese economy will get worse not better yet only a couple of years ago i say everyone was worrying about the rmb being massively undervalued which made china s exports too cheap what changed look at the current account and you can see says russell china used to have a huge surplus it exported more than it imported it still has a fairly significant one with the us but elsewhere in aggregate it is really very small that suggests the rmb is fairly valued or overvalued but also that if china tries to hold it up artificially and also to buy more from the us as president donald trump is demanding it will end up in current account deficit that could leave china in a bit of a pickle why would china agree to this perhaps it won t but some sort of deal is probably being cooked up and it will almost inevitably be one that suggests lower growth for china

debt require high levels of growth if they are to be repaid and a return to the world that all central bankers fear most one tipping back over to deflation this becomes a genuine risk if when the china us monetary link breaks at that point china won t be able simply to devalue to another fixed rate as in 1994 then its economy made up just 5 of global gdp today at 19 it would be completely politically unacceptable it would be banned from every goods market in the world instead china would have to adopt a fully flexible exchange rate the rmb would fall precipitously which would be deflationary for the rest of us then what every deflationary threat for the last few decades has been met with low interest rates and or quantitative easing but what if central bankers can t solve the deflation that results from a huge chinese devaluation and what if the china us spat is more than a spat take us vice president mike pence he is on record as lambasting china on everything from human rights to religious persecution interference in american politics and trade this could end up as a cold war this all implies a lot of losers in a deflationary environment debt becomes very hard to service in a cold war environment emerging markets that rely on both the us and china for investment and markets have unpleasant choices to make in a low growth environment corporate earnings growth suffers and in all these scenarios stockmarkets surely suffer equities outside the us may not be overly expensive but they can still fall there s a big gap between fair value and cheap as for the us equities could fall significantly because they are grotesquely overvalued by any measure high levels of global debt and falling asset prices would make for a very nasty mix given that we have the most highly geared world economy in our entire history usually says napier investors can ignore geopolitics but the resetting of global monetary policy and of the relationship between china and the us this is a big one this is important why the dollar is still top dog given that i say if you could hold just one fiat currency ie not gold for a 20 year period which would it be the dollar says napier trump or no trump the us constitution is strong as is the rule of law the latter is the number one ingredient that attracts capital i can see it crumbling elsewhere i couldn t put a single emerging market up and say to you i believe this emerging market will always back the rule of law the same goes for china as for japan it might back the rule of law but one day the bank of japan s efforts to inflate away its debt will work and you certainly don t want to be holding the yen when it works what s left not the euro the only way for the single currency to survive is for the superstate that the uk has been trying to avoid being part of to exist only a single fiscal and much closer political union can make it possible but a look at the polls in advance of the european parliament elections in may shows that most european union citizens don t want this level of integration and the rule of law in europe is not the same as in other countries spain just had 12 democratically elected politicians from catalonia incarcerated for organising a vote whatever happens in the uk or the us i don t think we would ever do that let s also not forget the one thing that is most unattractive to the global flow of capital capital controls the eu has twice used them to defend its monetary system making a complete mockery of the idea of the inviolate four freedoms the idea that capital controls are legitimate is something that every investor should worry about i wonder how he reckons brexit is going disappointingly for him it isn t about an economic land of milk and honey outside the eu it is about making some really concerted moves to re establish a representative democracy the loss of democratic accountability is not all the eu s fault power has been passed all over the place in the last few decades to multinationals that don t pay tax for example but we vote for people to go to westminster and we must make sure they have the power and authority to act as we would like them to when they get there erode that for too long and you get yourself into a deep deep hole leaving the eu is one major step towards changing things back people like power to be as local as possible those who voted remain might want to think about the fact that on almost every occasion when we ask people if they want to devolve power rather than concentrate it they say yes so why would they want to be part of an organisation that is absolutely committed to the centralisation of power that had to happen as soon as they put in a single currency when we leave says napier we will have the most decentralised democratic system that we have ever had our democracy at least will flourish people think they want certainty out of the future but certainty isn t ever possible better surely then to have a flexible democratic system such as the uk s one that can cope with change than an authoritarian and rigid one such as china s if he was allowed to hold a second currency for his 20 years would it be sterling it would and the uk stockmarket i am very tempted any other cheap markets this brings us back to the rule of law and to corporate governance china and russia are cheap but i want to be able to vote for the board i want to be able to change the board you might say that these things are hypothetical for the small investor but they are the very core of what investing in equities is all about so i have never invested in russia i have never invested in china either for similar reasons i don t believe that the management of chinese corporations with very few exceptions is actually there with the power ability and willingness to get me good returns that is also true of quite a few western managers but at least there are other ones out there who are looking after and stewarding my capital with that aim and those assets are legally protected what to buy when governments get intrusive what about gold napier isn t a gold bug someone for whom the answer to every question is gold but he would hold it now why first we are facing a period of more active government governments want to redistribute wealth usually via inflation in which case you want gold but it is not just inflation itself that makes gold attractive it s the fact that the government is looking at your assets and suggesting where they should be invested which could also be sparked by the deflationary adjustment mentioned above everything in a wrapper of any kind a sipp or an isa say can be pushed around by governments in the name of say macro prudential regulation regulators could demand that we all hold government bonds in our sipps for example gold is less easy to manipulate so more government is thus good for gold so there you have it there is likely to be both deflation and inflation ahead the uk hosts just about the only attractive stockmarket in the world and if you want to protect your wealth from government this is one of those times when you should probably hold gold and not in your isa hear the

des moines register this is a transcript of the debate from fdch this copy may be updated wolf blitzer live from drake university in iowa this is the cnn democratic presidential debate in partnership with the des moines register we want to welcome our viewers in the united states and around the world i m wolf blitzer along with cnn s abby phillip and the des moines register s chief politics reporter brianne pfannenstiel abby phillip the top six democratic presidential candidates are in place this is their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 presidential campaign the iowa

for clarifications please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time blitzer all right so let s begin right now just this month the united states and iran were on the brink of war which has reignited the debate over america s role in the world and which of you is best prepared to be commander in chief so let s have the debate right now sen sanders why are you best prepared the best prepared person on this stage to be commander in chief more what were the tense words exchanged between elizabeth warren and bernie sanders after tuesday s debate now we know sen bernie sanders yes i think my record speaks to that wolf in 2002 when the congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in iraq invade iraq i got up on the floor of the house and i said that would be a disaster it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region and i not only voted against the war i helped lead the effort against that war just last year i helped for the first time in the modern history of this country pass a war powers act resolution working with a conservative republican mike lee of utah which said that the war in yemen led by saudi arabia was unconstitutional because congress had not authorized it we got a majority vote in the senate we got a majority vote in the house unfortunately bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues i am able to work with republicans i am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table not through military efforts blitzer vice president biden you talk a lot about your experience but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the iraq war why are you the best prepared person on this stage to be commander in chief joe biden i said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if in fact he couldn t get inspectors into iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon it was a mistake and i acknowledged that but right the man who also argued against that war barack obama picked me to be his vice president and once we once we were elected president he turned and vice president he turned to me and asked me to end that war i know what it s like to send a son or daughter like our colleague has gone to war in afghanistan my son for a year in iraq and that s why i do it very very reluctantly that s why i led the effort as you know wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into afghanistan we should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the united states are at stake they were not at stake there they were not at stake in iraq and it was a mistaken vote but i think my record overall on everything we ve done has been i m i m prepared to compare it to anybody on this stage debate guide blitzer sen sanders you have been attacking vice president biden s vote on the iraq war but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in afghanistan was also a mistake so you both acknowledged mistakes why should the american people trust your judgment more sanders well it s a little bit of a difference on that particular vote every single member of the house including myself voted for it only barbara lee voted against it but what i understood right away in terms of the war in iraq the difference here is that the war in iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country as joe well knows we lost 4 500 brave troops hundreds of thousands of iraqis died we have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war money which should go into health care and education and infrastructure in this country joe and i listened to what dick cheney and george bush and rumsfeld had to say i thought they were lying i didn t believe them for a moment i took to the floor i did everything i could to prevent that war joe saw it differently blitzer vice president biden biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort it was a mistake to trust that they weren t going to go to war they said they were not going to go to war they said they were just going to get inspectors in the world in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war from that point on i was in the position of making the case that it was a big big mistake and from that point on i ve voted to i moved to bring those troops home blitzer sen klobuchar you ve publicly questioned mayor buttigieg s experience when it comes to being commander in chief why is your time as a u s senator more valuable than his time as a u s naval intelligence officer in afghanistan and as mayor sen amy klobuchar thank you wolf and i have been very clear that i respect the mayor s experience very much in the military i just have different experience i ve been in the u s senate for over 12 years and i think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions i will look at my position on the iraq war first i wasn t in the senate for that vote but i opposed that war from the very beginning in my first campaign for senate i ran against a republican who ran ads against me on it but i stood my ground when i got to the senate i pushed to bring our troops home then i have dealt with every issue from afghanistan to keeping our troops with good health care after what we saw with walter reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with our education and with their jobs and also with their health care i think right now what we should be talking about though wolf is what is happening right now with donald trump donald trump is taking us pell mell toward another war we have a very important resolution we just found out today that four republicans are joining democrats to go to him and say you must have an authorization of military force if you re going to go to war with iran that is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the iranian nuclear agreement something i worked on for a significant period of time as president i will get us back into that agreement i will take an oath blitzer thank you klobuchar to protect and defend our constitution blitzer thank you klobuchar and i will mean it blitzer thank you sen klobuchar we re going to continue talking about who s best prepared to be commander in chief mayor buttigieg pete buttigieg well i bring a different perspective there are enlisted people that i served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9 11 on the war in iraq and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates the next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything we ve seen before not just conventional military challenges not just stateless terrorism but cybersecurity challenges climate security challenges foreign interference in our elections it s going to take a view to the future as well as the readiness to learn from the lessons of the past and for me those lessons of the past are personal blitzer sen warren in our new cnn des moines register poll almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours why are you best prepared to be commander in chief more from january s iowa poll sen elizabeth warren i believe the principal job of the commander in chief is to keep america safe and i think that s about judgment i think it starts with knowing our military i sit on the senate armed services committee i work with our generals with our military leaders with our intelligence but i also visit our troops i visit our troops around the world i ve been to afghanistan to iraq to jordan to south korea i ve been to lots of places to talk with our troops and i fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay that they get the housing and medical benefits that they ve been promised that they don t get cheated by giant financial institutions you know i have three brothers who were in the military and i know how much our military families sacrifice but i also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways we have to think about cyber we have to think about climate we also have to think about how we spend money we have a problem with a revolving door in washington between the defense industry and the department of defense and the pentagon that is corruption pure and simple we need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget we need to depend on all of our tools diplomatic economic working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots blitzer mr steyer you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander in chief tom steyer i worked internationally around the world for decades i traveled i met with governments i met with businesses and i understand how america interacts with other countries and you asked what is the reason that the the experience really counts and to me i believe that sen warren made a great point it isn t so much about experience it s about judgment if you ve been listening to this what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the american government in the middle east of failure of mistakes so the real question is judgment and if you look who had the judgment it was a state senator from illinois with no experience named barack obama who opposed the war it is a congresswoman barbara lee from oakland california who stood up against the original vote who was the only person in congress so i would say to you this an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we re looking for now i agree with sen warren we are spending dramatically too much money on defense the money that we re spending there we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it s time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we re trying to do and how to do it as tom steyer s iowa bus tour ends some like his outsider resume others want more experience blitzer sen sanders in the wake of the iran crisis iran s ayatollah khamenei has again called for all u s troops to be pulled out of the middle east something you ve called for as well yet when american troops last left iraq isis emerged and spread terror across the middle east and indeed around the world how would you prevent that from happening again sanders o k i m going to tell you but before i tell you that let me tell you something else laughter and that is and i don t know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not maybe they will but what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes were the war in vietnam and the war in iraq both of those wars were based on lies and right now what i fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in iraq to answer your question what we need to do is have an international coalition we cannot keep acting unilaterally as you know the nuclear deal with iran was worked on with a number of our allies we have got to undo what trump did bring that coalition together and make sure that iran never gets a nuclear weapon blitzer vice president biden biden i was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with iran bringing together the rest of the world including some of the folks who aren t friendly to us and it was working it was working it was being held tightly there was no movement on the part of the iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon and look what s happened he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement trump what exactly would happen we re now isolated we re in a situation where our allies in europe are making a comparison between the united states and iran saying both ought to stand down making a moral equivalence we have lost our standing in the region we have lost the support of our allies the next president has to be able to pull those folks back together re establish our alliances and insist that iran go back into the agreement which i believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done blitzer so just to be clear vice president biden would you leave troops in the middle east or would you pull them out biden i would leave troops in the middle east in terms of patrolling the gulf where we have where we are now small numbers of troops and i think it s a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with isis what s happened is now that he s gone ahead the president and started this whole process moving what s happening isis is going to reconstitute itself we re in a position where we have to pull our forces out americans have to leave the entire region and quite frankly i think he s flat out lied about saying the reason he went after the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed blitzer sen klobuchar what s your response klobuchar i would leave some troops there but not in the level that donald trump is taking us right now afghanistan i have long wanted to bring our troops home i would do that some would remain for counterterrorism and training in syria i would not have removed the 150 troops from the border with turkey i think that was a mistake i think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to isis and then when it comes to iraq right now i would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by donald trump at the briefing we had last week i was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state and i asked them about imminent threat but i also asked them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague vague answers i asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if i was president and i asked them where they were going to leave the iraqi people time and time again you see that this president puts his own interests his private interests in front of our country s i would put our country s interests first as commander in chief blitzer sen warren leave combat troops at least some combat troops in the middle east or bring them home warren no i think we need to get our combat troops out you know we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily our keeping combat troops there is not helping we need to work with our allies we need to use our economic tools we need to use our diplomatic tools now look i understand there are people on this stage when it comes to afghanistan for example who talk about 5 more years 10 more years shoot lindsey graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years no one has a solution and an endpoint we need to get our combat troops out they are not helping create more safety for the united states or the region blitzer vice president biden is sen warren right biden well i tell you what there s a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position i was part of the coalition to put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states not us alone 68 other countries that s how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for isis they ll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us with small numbers of special forces we have to organize the effort to take them down blitzer mayor buttigieg you served in afghanistan who s right buttigieg we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops but what s going on right now is the president s actually sending more the very president who said he was going to end endless war who pretended to have been against the war in iraq all along although we know that s not true now has more troops going to the middle east in iowa pete buttigieg criticizes joe biden s 2002 iraq war vote calling it the worst foreign policy decision of his lifetime and whenever i see that happen i think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members i remember walking with a friend of mine another lieutenant i trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasn t turning back to scoop him up and it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time that is happening by the thousands right now as we see so many more troops sent into harm s way and my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander in chief blitzer sen sanders sanders wolf in america today our infrastructure is crumbling half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck eighty seven million people have no health care or are uninsured or underinsured we got 500 000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight the american people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars our job is to rebuild the united nations rebuild the state department make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced blitzer we re going to get to everyone but vice president biden you criticized president trump s decision to kill the iranian general soleimani without first going to congress are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the united states where you would take military action without congressional approval biden i ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in vietnam on the grounds that the only way to take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the american people the informed consent of the american people and with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere including special forces we there s no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists you have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them if you don t we end up being the world s policeman again they re going to come to us they ve come to us before they ll come to us again so it s a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries it s fundamentally the requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions blitzer mr vice president just to be clear the obama biden administration did not ask congress for permission multiple times when it took military action so would the biden doctrine be different biden no there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the united states congress house and senate and signed by the president that was the authority it does not give authority to go into iran it gave authority to deal with these other issues blitzer mayor buttigieg buttigieg that authorization needs to be replaced biden exactly and we tried to buttigieg when we lost troops in niger there were members of congress who admitted they didn t even know we had troops there and it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with al qaida and 9 11 and often congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role now thanks to democrats in congress that s changing but the reality is year after year congress didn t want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult fundamental truth is if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm s way often on deployment after deployment then we ve got to make sure that congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there and when i am president anytime which i hope will never happen but anytime i am compelled to use force and seek that authorization we will have a three year sunset so that the american people are included blitzer thank you buttigieg not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue blitzer thank you sen warren we re going to get to everyone but sen warren what about you are there any circumstances other than a direct attack on the united states where you would take military action without congressional approval warren well imminent threat but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat that is what the constitution provides and that is what as commander in chief i will do but i just want to be clear everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it you know on the senate armed services committee we have one general after another in afghanistan who comes in and says you know we ve just turned the corner and now it s all going to be different and then what happens it s all the same for another year someone new comes in and we ve just turned the corner we ve turned the corner so many times we re going in circles in these regions this has got to stop it s not enough to say some day we re going to get out no one on the ground none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out it s time to get our combat troops home blitzer mr steyer would a president steyer use military force as a deterrent and if not under what circumstances would you take military action steyer i would take military action to protect the lives and safety of american citizens but what we can see in the middle east and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that we re trying to accomplish in what we re doing in the middle east obviously mr trump has no strategy he is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation but if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in afghanistan we know from the washington post that in fact there was no strategy there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense so we really have to ask ourselves in the middle east what are we trying to accomplish i agree with vice president biden to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries and i want to point out that as we do that we re confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about but at the same time there s a gigantic climate issue in australia which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building that we actually should be using in the middle east we need to ask ourselves how are we going to provide a world that is safer for americans where we can prosper more and every single thing we should do should follow into that strategy and it s just not happening in washington d c phillip mayor buttigieg another critical issue you d face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons last week president trump said quote as long as i am president of the united states iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon would a president buttigieg make that same promise buttigieg ensuring that iran does not develop nuclear weapons will of course be a priority because it s such an important part of keeping america safe but unfortunately president trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal by gutting the iran nuclear deal one that by the way the trump administration itself admitted was working certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear iran by gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war now yes phillip continue buttigieg in order to get that done we ve got to work with our partners the iran nuclear deal the technical term for it was the jcpoa that first letter j stood for joint we can t do this alone even less so now after everything that has happened which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what i believe is not just an american goal but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that iran does not become a nuclear armed country phillip mayor buttigieg to be clear would you allow iran to become a nuclear power yes or no buttigieg no our security depends on ensuring that iran does not become nuclear and by the way we ve got a lot of other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world despite this president s coziness with vladimir putin we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with russia on things like the renewal of start we ve got to move toward less not more nuclear danger whether it is from states from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world phillip thank you mayor buttigieg thank you mayor buttigieg sen klobuchar if you become president it s very possible there won t be an iran nuclear deal for the united states to rejoin given that how would you prevent iran from gaining a nuclear weapon klobuchar i would start negotiations again and i won t take that as a given given that our european partners are still trying to hold the agreement together my issue is that because of the actions of donald trump we are in a situation where they are now starting iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement so what i would do is negotiate i would bring people together just as president obama did years ago and i think that we can get this done but you have to have a president that sees this as a number one goal and in answer to the original question you asked the mayor i would not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon and then you have to get an agreement in place i think there are changes you can make to the agreement that are sunset some changes to the inspections but overall that is what we should do and i am the one person on this debate stage on the first night of the very first debate when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world i said china on the economy but i said iran because of donald trump because i feared that exactly what happened would happen enrichment of uranium escalation of tensions leaving frayed relations with our allies we can bring them back understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon phillip vice president biden i want to ask you about north korea president trump has met with kim jong un three times president obama once said he would meet with north korea without any preconditions would you meet with north korea without any preconditions biden no not now i wouldn t meet with them without any preconditions look what we gave him everything he s looking for legitimacy the president showed up met with him gave him legitimacy weakened the sanctions we have against him need to know ahead of the caucuses i would be putting what i did as vice president i met with xi jinping more than anyone else i would be putting pressure on china to put pressure on korea to cease and desist from their nuclear power make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons i would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively wolf about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons that we would and when china said to me when xi jinping said to me that s a threat to us i said we re going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it i would reignite the relationship between japan and south korea and i would put enormous pressure enormous pressure on china because that s also in their interests for them to put pressure on north korea to cease and desist but i would not i would not meet with absent preconditions i would not meet with the quote supreme leader who said joe biden is a rabid dog he should be beaten to death with a stick i count that sanders other than that you like him biden other than that i like him and he he laughter and he got a love letter from trump right after that phillip mr steyer would you meet with north korea without any preconditions steyer no it s very clear that if we re going to do something with north korea we re going to have to do it in concert with our allies that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get but this is a classic situation where the united states idea of going it alone makes no sense and when you are talking about iran let s face it iran is under great pressure economically so every single discussion we ve had about iran has had to do with military power and america versus iran whereas in fact what worked with president obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic that to me is called strategy having a goal to make america safer by looking more broadly pfannenstiel thank you steyer than just us as the policeman of the world spending money pfannenstiel thank you mr steyer let s stay with the theme of america s role in the world and talk about trade tomorrow president trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with china and the senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with mexico and canada iowa s largest trading partners iowans applaud deal that clears a path for u s mexico canada trade agreement caught in prolonged trade war iowa farmers could finally see a big win with u s china deal sen sanders you have said that new deal the usmca quote makes some modest improvements yet you are going to vote against it aren t modest improvements better than no improvements sanders no we can do much pfannenstiel for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in iowa sanders the answer is we could do much better than a trump led trade deal this deal and i think the proponents of it acknowledge will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs as a result of outsourcing the heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements and i m the guy who voted against nafta and against permanent normal trade relations with china is that we have forced american workers to compete against people in mexico in china elsewhere who earn starvation wages 1 or 2 an hour second of all every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it and given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet i will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world pfannenstiel but sen sanders to be clear the afl cio supports this deal are you unwilling to compromise sanders the afl cio does the machinists union does not and every environmental organization in this country including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy opposes it so i happen to believe and i hope we will talk about climate change in a moment if we do not get our act together in terms of climate change the planet that we re going to be leaving our kids and our children and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable 2020 candidates on agriculture in iowa six democratic presidential candidates vow to help farmers battered by low prices trade disputes pfannenstiel we re going to get to climate change but i d like to stay on trade sen warren sanders well they are the same in this issue pfannenstiel sen warren you support the usmca why is sen sanders wrong warren i do i wasn t here i haven t been in congress long enough to have voted against nafta but i led the fight against the trade deal with asia and the trade deal with europe because i didn t think it was in the interests of the american people the american workers or environmental interests but we have farmers here in iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of donald trump s initiated trade wars we have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really don t have enforcement on workers rights this new trade deal is a modest improvement sen sanders himself has said so it will give some relief to our farmers it will give some relief to our workers i believe we accept that relief we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal we need a coherent trade policy we need a policy that actually helps our workers our farmers we need them at the table not just to trade policy written for big international companies i m ready to have that fight but let s help the people who need help right now pfannenstiel thank you sen sanders can you please respond to sen warren sanders well i think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation if this is passed i think it will set us back a number of years sen warren is right in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table that it is the family farmers here in iowa and in vermont and around the country that is the environmental community that is the workers bottom line here is i am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the ceos of large corporations behind doors pfannenstiel sen klobuchar i d like to bring you in here klobuchar brianne i want to hit reality here i serve on the agriculture committee and i will never forget going to crawfordsville here in iowa and thank you for bringing up iowa brianne since that is where we are and i went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant that plant had been shut down because of donald trump s trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard that worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said these are my friends they don t work anymore and their names were embroidered on those uniforms derek mark salvador and that guy started to cry these are real people hurt by donald trump s trade war so what we should do and i support the usmca i am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like richard trumka and sherrod brown on labor and environment and on pharma the sweetheart deal pfannenstiel thank you klobuchar because i think we need a big trading block pfannenstiel thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar with north america to take on china and the way you are stronger pfannenstiel sen klobuchar your time is up klobuchar china is with our allies pfannenstiel mayor buttigieg do you support the usmca yes or no buttigieg yes it has been improved it is not perfect but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit american consumers and workers and farmers by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability as democrats ensured we got in this usmca but let s acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration you know my part of the country in the industrial midwest i remember when they came around in the 90s selling trade deals telling us don t worry about your slice of the pie the pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off and that promise was broken the part about the pie getting bigger happened it s just that the part about it getting to most people where i live did not that is why there is such frustration the sense that these decisions in boardrooms pfannenstiel thank you buttigieg and in committee rooms in washington are being made not based on what s best for us pfannenstiel thank you mayor buttigieg buttigieg but based on their own gain pfannenstiel vice president biden sen sanders has said that donald trump will quote eat your lunch for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements when it comes to trade why are you the best candidate to take on president trump biden there will be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalists and labor at the table and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in american workers we should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing american workers to compete in the 21st century on the high tech side dealing with all artificial intelligence we should be focusing on equipping american workers to do that and by the way the idea i don t know that there s any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense but the problem is that 95 percent of the customers are out there so we better figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road not china pfannenstiel sen sanders sanders joe and i have a fundamental disagreement here in case you haven t noticed and that is nafta pntr with china other trade agreements were written for one reason alone and that is to increase the profits of large multi national corporations and the end result of those two just pntr with china joe and nafta cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom i am sick and tired and will not tolerate and we will use the power of the federal contracting system if a corporation in america wants to shut down in iowa or vermont or any place else and then they think they re going to get on line for our generous federal contract they ve got another thing going we need some corporate responsibility here and we need to protect good paying jobs in america not see them go to china mexico vietnam and all these other countries pfannenstiel mr vice president what s your response biden we need corporate responsibility and i agree with that completely but we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we make enforceable agreements that s one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with mexico and that s what we should be doing in any agreement we have but let s get back to the basics here if we don t set the rules of the road by going out to our partners instead of poking our eye excuse me poking our finger in the eye of all of our friends and allies we make up 25 percent of the world s economy we ve got to bring the other 25 percent of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so china cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage pfannenstiel sen warren warren you know our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility it has been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated the united states has had this strategy for decades and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators a small number and then surround them with giant multi national corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multi national corporations not good for america not good for american workers not good for the environment we need a different approach to trade and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals everybody wants to get to the american market and we need to put some standards in place you want to be able to sell your goods here then you ve got to meet some environmental standards you ve got to meet labor standards pfannenstiel thank you sen warren warren we need a crosstalk warren approach pfannenstiel i would like to bring in mr steyer here mr steyer even though farmers and manufacturers here in iowa and around the country could see some relief from the china deal they ve been crushed by the current administration s trade war what will you do as president to help them get back on their feet steyer look on the first day i would undo mr trump s tariffs on the first day i would get rid of his waivers that sen klobuchar was referring to to oil refiners so that not having to use corn based ethanol in fact these trade deals have been exactly what sen sanders and warren have been saying which is that they ve been designed to grow the american gdp for the corporations of america not for the working people of america and not to protect the climate so let me say this i m the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority i would not sign this deal because if climate is your number one priority you can t sign a deal even if it s marginally better for working people until climate is also taken into consideration what a difference one degree makes iowa is getting hotter bringing more frequent and intense storms look i ve got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31 i cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction everybody in their generation knows it frankly mayor buttigieg you re their generation i think you would be standing up more look that s why i m standing up for it we cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say we re going to sign this one more deal we re going to do one more thing without putting climate first that s why it s my number one priority we can do it in a way that makes us richer but we have to do it pfannenstiel mayor buttigieg your response buttigieg well that s right this issue is personal for me it s why we re going to tackle climate from day one it s why we ve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today now what i ve noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century starting with actions that we take right now the question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades the other day in winterset there was a kid at one of my events raised his hand and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his 90s in the year 2100 he will sit in judgment over what we do not just what we on this stage do anyone old enough to vote right now whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals to act aggressively not just re joining the paris climate accord that s table stakes but to actually move on from the fossil dependent economy we live in today crosstalk phillip let s now turn to let s now turn to an issue that s come up in the last 48 hours sen sanders cnn reported yesterday that and sen sanders sen warren confirmed in a statement that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election why did you say that sanders well as a matter of fact i didn t say it and i don t want to waste a whole lot of time on this because this is what donald trump and maybe some of the media want anybody knows me knows that it s incomprehensible that i would think that a woman cannot be president of the united states go to youtube today there s a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the united states in 2015 i deferred in fact to sen warren there was a movement to draft sen warren to run for president and you know what i said stayed back sen warren decided not to run and i then i did run afterwards hillary clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes how could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the united states and let me be very clear if any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination i hope that s not the case i hope it s me laughter but if they do i will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country applause phillip so sen sanders sen sanders i do want to be clear here you re saying that you never told sen warren that a woman could not win the election sanders that is correct phillip sen warren what did you think when sen sanders told you a woman could not win the election laughter warren i disagreed bernie is my friend and i am not here to try to fight with bernie but look this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it s time for us to attack it head on and i think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people s winning record so can a woman beat donald trump look at the men on this stage collectively they have lost 10 elections laughter the only people on this stage who have won every single election that they ve been in are the women applause amy and me klobuchar so true applause so true applause warren and the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me and here s what i know the real danger that we face as democrats is picking a candidate who can t pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the democratic constituency we need a candidate who will excite all parts of the democratic party bring everyone in and give everyone a democrat to believe in that s my plan and that is why i m going to win phillip sen klobuchar applause klobuchar thank you phillip sen klobuchar what do you say to people who don t klobuchar thank you elizabeth phillip sen klobuchar what do you say klobuchar i would like to point out phillip sen klobuchar let me finish my question klobuchar oh ok laughter phillip what do you say to people who klobuchar i thought it was such an open end i wasn t at the meeting so i can t comment but i was going to say laughter phillip what do you say to people who say that a woman can t win this election klobuchar i hear that people have said it that s why i ve addressed it from this stage i point out that you don t have to be the tallest person in the room james madison was 5 4 you don t have to be the skinniest person in the room you don t have to be the loudest person you have to be competent and when you look at the facts michigan has a woman governor right now and she beat a republican gretchen whitmer kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat kris kobach and her name is i m very proud to know her and her name is governor kelly thank you third i would add to this you have to be competent to win and you have to know what you re doing and when you look at what i have done i have won every race every place every time i have won in the reddest of districts i have won in the suburban areas in the rural areas i have brought people with me that is why i have the most endorsements of current iowa legislators and former iowa legislators in this race phillip thank you klobuchar because they know i bring people with me and finally every single person phillip thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar that i have beaten my republican opponents have gotten out of politics for good laughter and i think i think that sounds pretty good i think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the white house right now laughter phillip sen sanders you can respond sanders well just to set the record straight i defeated an incumbent republican running for congress warren when sanders nineteen ninety that s how i won beat a republican congressman laughter number two warren thirty years ago sanders of course i don t think there s any debate up here warren wasn t it 30 years ago sanders i beat an incumbent republican congressman warren and i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years laughter sanders well 30 years ago is 1990 as a matter of fact laughter but i don t know that that s the major issue of the day i think what the major issue of the day is let s does anybody in their right mind think that a woman cannot be elected president that s nobody believes that of hillary clinton got 3 million votes more votes than trump so who believes that a woman can t win of course a woman can win but the real question is how do we beat trump bernie sanders says donald trump is smart fraud who will be tough to beat but sanders claims he can do it and the only way we beat trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has by far the largest voter turnout in the history of this country and i believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement phillip thank you sanders we have been endorsed by many grassroots organizations phillip sen warren sanders that s why crosstalk phillip sen warren i want to give you the final word warren so i do think it s the right question how do we beat trump and here s the thing since donald trump was elected women candidates have out performed men candidates in competitive races and in 2018 we took back the house we took back statehouses because of women candidates and women voters look don t deny that the question is there back in the 1960s people asked could a catholic win back in 2008 people asked if an african american could win in both times the democratic party stepped up and said yes got behind their candidate and we changed america that s who we are applause phillip vice president biden vice president biden go ahead biden i agree women can win and i have went in and campaigned for 27 of them this last in 2018 the best group i ve ever campaigned for in terms of competence but the real issue is who can bring the whole party together represents all elements of the party african american brown black women men gay straight the fact of the matter is that i would argue that in terms of endorsements around the country endorsements wherever we go i am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race phillip all right we re going to take a short break now the cnn democratic presidential debate live from drake university will be back right after this applause commercial break applause blitzer welcome back to the cnn democratic presidential debate live from drake university in des moines iowa applause phillip let s turn to health care the top issue for iowa democrats donald trump is trying to repeal obamacare including the protections for pre existing conditions we all know that each of you vigorously opposes that still there are some questions about what each of you would do sen sanders you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your medicare for all plan is going to cost don t voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars sanders well what i will tell you is medicare for all which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man woman and child will cost substantially less than the status quo medicare for all will end the absurdity of the united states paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general while we have 87 million uninsured uninsured and underinsured and while 30 000 people die each year in iowa bernie sanders calls pete buttigieg s health care plan a failed idea under medicare for all one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4 percent tax on income exempting the first 29 000 so the average family in america that today makes 60 000 would pay 1 200 a year compared to that family paying 12 000 a year we save money comprehensive health care because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exists in our dysfunctional system phillip vice president biden does sen sanders owe voters a price tag on his health care plan biden i think we need to be candid with voters i think we have to tell them what we re going to do and what it s going to cost and a 4 percent tax on income over 24 000 doesn t even come close to paying for between 30 trillion and some estimates as high as 40 trillion over 10 years that s doubling the entire federal budget per year there s a way to do that the way to do that is to take obamacare reinstate rebuild it provide a public option allow medicare for those folks who want it and in fact make sure that we in the process reduce the cost of of drug prices reduce the cost of being able to buy into the subsidize it further and make it everybody available to everyone here s the deal that costs a lot of money that costs 740 billion over 10 years i lay out how i d pay for that phillip sen sanders sanders well first of all what joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is what you are talking about are workers paying on average 20 percent of their incomes for health care that is insane you ve got 500 000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills we re spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country look we have talked about health care for all in this country for over 100 years now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry of the drug companies and finally provide health care to all through a medicare for all single payer program it won t be easy but that is what we have to do applause biden you can do it without that you can do it without medicare for all you can get the same place sanders no you can t phillip sen klobuchar your response klobuchar yeah sen sanders and i have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long long time and we agree on this but what i don t agree with is that we his position on health care this debate isn t real i was in vegas the other day and someone said don t put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn t even on the wheel that s the problem over two thirds of the democrats in the u s senate are not on the bill that you and sen warren on on you have numerous governors that are democratic that don t support this you have numerous house members that put nancy pelosi in as speaker the answer is a non profit public option the answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health i have a plan for that and then finally what should we do about long term care the elephant that doesn t even fit in this room we need to make it easier for people to get long term care insurance we need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums my own dad i know when his long term care insurance ends and then we have some savings for him he s in assisted living he got married three times whole other story so there isn t much there laughter but then we go to medicaid and i ve already talked to catholic elder care phillip thank you klobuchar they re willing to take him in our story is better than so many other families we have to make it easier for long term care phillip thank you thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar it s not just for seniors it s also for the sandwich generation phillip thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar people trying to help their parents phillip sen warren warren so we need to start with what s happening in america people are suffering i ll just pick one 36 million people last year went to the doctor got a prescription this is what they needed to get well and they couldn t afford to have the prescription filled they looked at it and said it s either groceries or this prescription my approach to this is we ve got to get as much as help to as many people as quickly as possible i have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime what i can do are the things i can do as president on the first day we can cut the cost of prescription drugs i ll use the power that s already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and epipens and hiv aids drugs let s get some relief to those families and i will defend the affordable care act i ve got a plan to expand health care but let s keep in mind when we come to a general election we democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do health care but we re going to be up against a republican incumbent who has cut health care for millions of people and is still trying to do that i ll take our side of the argument any day we re going to beat him on this phillip thank you thank you sen warren vice president biden applause biden the proposal i lay out does in fact limit drug cost it sets up it allows all the drug companies excuse me it allows you to medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price it sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation and by the way there s mental health parity that i call for in the obamacare expanded with the biden option phillip mr steyer steyer look we ve had this conversation on this stage so many times everybody on this stage believes that affordable health care is a right for every single american everybody on this stage knows that americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world and it makes no sense and the government has to step in i do happen to agree with vice president biden that we should move and develop the affordable care act with a public option but the real question is this this is not a new problem why do we keep having this conversation we have a broken government it has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies the insurance companies and the private hospitals that s what i m talking about how do we get back government of by and for the people how do we actually break phillip thank you steyer the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed phillip thank you thank you mr steyer thank you mr steyer sen sanders your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade an unprecedented level of spending not seen since world war ii how would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country sanders no our plan wouldn t bankrupt the country and in fact it would much improve the well being of working class families and the middle class let us be clear what medicare for all does it ends all premiums it ends all copayments it ends the absurdity of deductibles it ends out of pocket expenses it takes on the pharmaceutical industry which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here what we will do through a medicare for all single payer program is substantially lower the cost of health care for employers and workers because we end the 100 billion a year that the health care industry makes and the 500 billion a year we spend in administrative the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans health care is a human right every other major country on earth is guaranteeing health care for all the time is long overdue for us to do the same phillip sen klobuchar klobuchar again i think it is much better to build on the affordable care act and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipedream you have to show how you re going to pay for it and i would also note practically that the affordable care act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the united states so i think the answer is to build on it and yes i think you should show how you re going to pay for things bernie i do this president is treating people out there like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos the way he is adding to our debt i am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit from november s iowa poll majority of likely democratic caucusgoers shy away from medicare for all phillip thank you thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar and i have shown how i m going to pay for every single plan phillip thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar capital gains tax going to the personal level getting rid of oil giveaways phillip let s move on klobuchar doing something about the hedge fund loophole you can go through phillip sen klobuchar your time is up let s move on to the next question klobuchar and we can get the money to pay for things phillip mayor buttigieg you re selling your plan as medicare for all who want it yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured americans into a public option even if they don t want it and force them to pay for it how is that truth in advertising buttigieg well it s making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured american look the individual mandate was an important part of the aca because the system doesn t work if there are free riders what i m offering is a choice you don t have to be in my plan if there s another plan that you would rather keep and there s no need to kick americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver health care for all and my plan is paid for look our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit now we ve got a dramatically better track record on it than republicans do in my lifetime it s almost invariably republican presidents who have added to the deficit a trillion dollars under this president and it s why everything i ve put forward from medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we re going to make in infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for when it comes to health care you can do it in two moves of course my plan costs 1 5 trillion over a decade no small sum but not the 20 trillion 30 trillion 40 trillion that we re hearing about from the others all you ve got to do is two things both of them are commonsense allow medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn t even need it phillip sen warren warren so i started this by talking about 36 million americans including americans with insurance who just can t even afford to have a prescription filled we all talk about plans health care plans that we have and these plans are paid for the problem is that plans like the mayor s and like the vice president s is that they are an improvement they are an improvement over where we are right now but they re a small improvement and that s why it is that they cost so much less because by themselves they re not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can t afford to get them filled what we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from we can ask those at the very top the top 1 percent to pay a little more those giant corporations like chevron and amazon who paid nothing in taxes we can have them pay and we can go after the corporate tax cheats and when we do that we have enough money to provide health care for all our people yes we build on the affordable care act but where we end up is we offer health care to all of our people and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them phillip mayor buttigieg buttigieg it s just not true that the plan i m proposing is small we ve got to move past a washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many americans it can alienate this would be a game changer this would be the biggest thing we ve done to american health care in a half century let s measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes we re taking on cost on prescription drugs we ll have an out of pocket cap even if you don t get the subsidies that would make it free a 250 monthly cap and here s why it s got to be monthly you ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they ve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out of pocket cap hits it makes no sense medically because most of us don t experience the economy on an annual basis our bills don t come in every year they come in every month same with our paychecks biweekly or monthly phillip thank you buttigieg that s why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20 trillion 30 trillion 40 trillion bills phillip thank you mayor buttigieg sen warren your response warren look the numbers that the mayor is offering just don t add up the average family in america last year paid 12 000 in some combination of deductibles and co pays and uncovered expenses and fees you can t cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about the way we have to approach this is we ve got to build this and we ve got to build the alliances to make this happen i can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs we can get help to families but we have to be willing to work together we can let people experience what health care is like when it s you and your doctor your mental health professional your nurse practitioner with no insurance company standing in the middle phillip thank you thank you sen warren warren when people try it and use it then phillip sen klobuchar klobuchar sen warren you acknowledged that medicare for all that you couldn t get there right away you got on the bill that said on page eight which is why i didn t get on it that you would kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance then a few months ago you said no you re going to wait a while to get there and i think that was some acknowledgment that maybe what we re talking about is true and i don t buy that it s not enough it is a big big step to say to people making 100 000 that your premiums will be cut in half which is what the nonprofit public option will do and as you talk mayor buttigieg about medicare and having negotiation i actually have led that bill for years i have 34 cosponsors as president i can get it done that would allow medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can t negotiate for better prices for our seniors phillip senator klobuchar i will get it done phillip sen sanders coming to you now cnn reached out to iowa democratic voters for their most pressing questions edward from here in des moines writes des moines is an insurance town what happens to all the insurance industry the health insurance industry here if there is medicare for all what happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like des moines sanders we build in to our medicare for all program a transition fund of many many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and health care and job training for those people but here is the issue tom steyer made the point a moment ago we are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country that is insane in some cases 10 times more for prescription drugs why is that why is that and the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies and if we want to do what every other major country on earth does and guarantee people health care is a human right not a privilege you know what we have to do we are finally going to have to stand up to the health care industry steyer can i respond to this sanders and end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering phillip mr steyer steyer i just want to emphasize what sen sanders said this is not a complicated problem between what sen warren and sen sanders said it s clear there are two problems we re spending way too much because corporations own the system and we re not negotiating against those corporations and we ve given tax cuts to the richest americans and the biggest corporations for decades that s all this is we have corporations who are having their way with the american people and people are suffering sen warren is right this is cruelty for money in order to break this we re going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem that s why i m for term limits we need to redo washington d c and phillip thank you thank you mr steyer steyer actually take back the government from the corporations who ve bought it phillip thank you mr steyer vice president biden biden i would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five five democratic presidents couldn t get done and that is pass obamacare it was a big deal secondly i would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices you don t have to pay the price limit what they can charge if in fact they charge more than we set the price for they can they can in fact we can people can import from abroad assuming that it is it is it is safe we in fact it s only yellow wolf ok and we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers if they don t like it or the employer gets rid of it they can buy into a medicare plan in the biden plan blitzer let s talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now prescription drug prices in 2018 americans spent 335 billion on prescription drugs alone that s about 60 billion more than they paid a decade ago sen warren you ve called for the creation of a government run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike why does it make sense for the government for the government to manufacture drugs especially when public trust in government is near historic lows warren so let s do this both ways what i also have said is i m just going to use the power that is available and i will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs i will lower the price of insulin we already have the legal authority with the president to do that the president just hasn t picked up and used it i will lower the price of epipens of hiv aids drugs that s going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately but you know there are a whole lot of drugs about 90 percent of drugs that are not under patent they re generic drugs but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up so my view is let s give them a little competition the government lets contracts for all kind of things they let contracts to build buildings they let contracts to build military weapons let s let the contracts out put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices this is a way to make markets work not to try to move away from the market you don t have to even use price controls the whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be blitzer sen klobuchar do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs klobuchar i am open to looking at it but i would try these things first number one i mention the medicare negotiation number two i have a plan 137 things i ve found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without congress that are legal laughter and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries bernie and i had an amendment on this we got 14 republican votes on it it was at midnight they might have not known what they were voting for but we got that laughter i now have an actual bill with sen grassley that does that and i have a bill to get at what elizabeth was talking about which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market the issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of the congress pfannenstiel thank you senator klobuchar they think they own washington they don t own me pfannenstiel thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar and as president i will get this done pfannenstiel we re going to turn now to childcare a huge expense for many new families and a problem that s especially acute in rural iowa we have another question for an iowa democratic voter mayor buttigieg this is for you tiffany from clive writes as a young mom i had to quit a job i love because childcare costs were taking up two thirds of my income many families don t have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed that leads to families using whatever care they can find and sometimes the results are deadly as we ve seen in iowa over the last few years how will you prioritize accessing quality affordable child care in your first 100 days in office child care in iowa iowa s child care crisis worsens its workforce crisis business leaders say and they re digging in to help buttigieg it makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebody s income we ve to drive it to 7 percent or below and zero for those families who are living in poverty but this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum i meet professionals who sometimes say that they re working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working it makes no sense and it must change and we shouldn t be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare writ large we can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody like the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career pfannenstiel sen warren your education plan includes tuition free public college for all but you impose an income limit for free childcare why do your plans cover everyone for public college but not childcare and early learning warren no actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone it just has some people adding a small payment but understand this about the plan i ve been there you know i remember when i was a young mom i had two little kids and i had my first real university teaching job it was hard work i was excited but it was childcare that nearly brought me down we went through one childcare after another and it just didn t work if i hadn t been saved by my aunt bee i was ready to quit my job and i think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on how many of my daughter s generation get knocked off the track and don t get back on how many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on i have a two cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre k for every 3 year old and 4 year old in america and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work largely black and brown women we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in america that s an investment in our babies that s an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it s an investment in our teachers and in our economy pfannenstiel sen sanders will your applause warren it s what we need to do pfannenstiel universal childcare program be free for everyone regardless of income sanders yeah let me pick up on this childcare thing every psychologist in the world knows zero through 4 are the most important years of human life intellectually and emotionally and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment it is unaffordable childcare workers are making wages lower than mcdonald s workers we need to fundamentally change priorities in america we should not be one of a few countries that does not have universal high quality affordable childcare we should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right we should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry tax breaks for billionaires and then tell the moms and dads in this country we cannot have high quality affordable childcare pfannenstiel thank you senator vice president biden i m coming to you now sanders that is wrong pfannenstiel vice president biden infant care is more expensive than in state public college tuition in more than half the country do you support free universal infant care biden there should be free universal infant care but here s the deal you know i was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed my two boys i had to raise i was a senator a young senator i just hadn t been sworn in yet and i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford but for my family childcare it was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that s why there are several things we do when i triple the amount of money for title i schools every child 3 4 and 5 years old will in fact have full schooling they ll go to school and after school programs which will release some of the burden secondly i think we should have an 8 000 tax credit which would put 7 million women back to work that could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an 8 000 tax credit i also believe that we should in fact for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care but bernie s right we have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care and i provide for that as well my time is up i know but i m not going to go over like everybody laughter pfannenstiel mayor buttigieg mayor buttigieg higher education is another huge expense for families you oppose free public college for all because you don t want to make it quote free for the kids of millionaires but lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people like libraries and public schools why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities buttigieg well it s simple we expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade it s not the same for college now again i don t want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college and under my plan it won t be as a matter of fact for the first 80 percent of americans by income it is free at public colleges but if you re in that top income bracket don t get me wrong i still wish you well i hope you succeed when you go to college i just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else there is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise and we need to be using that to support everybody whether you go to college or not making sure that americans can thrive investing in infrastructure and something that hasn t come up very much tonight but deserves a lot of attention poverty you know the poor people s campaign is marching on iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more they are driven by their faith i think because even though in politics we re supposed to talk middle class they know there s no scripture that says as you ve done unto the middle class so you ve done unto me we ve got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference and i don t think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition at public colleges is the best use of those scarce taxpayer dollars pfannenstiel sen warren warren so look the way i think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in america we need to ask people with fortunes above 50 million to pay more and that means that the lowliest millionaire that i would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about 19 million in the first year in taxes if he wants to send his kid to public university then i m ok with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here we need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that s how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it bring down the national debt you do universal childcare and you ve got a lot of mamas who can go to work a lot of mamas who can finish their education we make that investment in universal college we ve got a lot of people who crosstalk pfannenstiel thank you senator sen klobuchar klobuchar yeah you know i appreciate your thoughts elizabeth but i want to step back i actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren t actually thinking big enough i think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy where are our job openings and what do we need we are going to have over a million openings for home health care workers that we don t know how to fill in the next 10 years we are going to have open 100 000 jobs for nursing assistants we as my union friends know we re going to have over 70 000 openings for electricians we re not going to have a shortage of mbas we re going to have a shortage of plumbers so when we look at that then we step back where should our money go it should go into k through 12 it should go into free one and two year degrees like my dad got like my sister got pfannenstiel thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar and then we should double the pell grants because we re going to need four year degrees pfannenstiel thank you sen klobuchar mr steyer klobuchar so the money goes where it should go instead of to rich kids going to college pfannenstiel mr steyer as a billionaire should your children have been entitled to free public college steyer no and let me say this i was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a year and a half ago i believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable unjust and unsupportable and the redistribution of wealth to the richest americans from everyone else has to end and i proposed a wealth tax almost a year and a half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need but i want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we re talking a lot about college but in fact if you talk about the poor people s campaign you have to realize that for the youngest kids they are getting an education that s relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods we need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance so we re not legislating inequality for the next generation and so we actually invest in every single kid specifically poor kids specifically black kids specifically brown kids we need to start using the money dramatically more for that blitzer we ll be back with more from cnn s democratic presidential debate live from des moines iowa stay right here commercial break blitzer welcome back to cnn s democratic presidential debate we re live in des moines iowa tomorrow the speaker nancy pelosi will send articles of impeachment against president trump to the united states senate launching the third trial of a u s president the republican led senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him vice president biden if you re the nominee is it going to be harder to run against president trump if he s been acquitted and able to claim vindication especially after what he s said about your family biden it s irrelevant there s no there s no choice but to for nancy pelosi and the house to move he has in fact committed impeachable offenses whether the senate makes that judgment or not it s for them to decide iowa poll iowa voters are split on impeachment but and by the way i m told that you know we that i don t i say we have to unite the country and it s going to be harder after this trial it may be but look you know i understand how these guys are this republican party they ve got gone after savaged my surviving son gone after me told lies that your networks and others won t even carry on television because they re flat out lies and i did my job the question is whether or not he did his job and he hasn t done his job and so it doesn t really matter whether or not he s gone after me i ve got to be in a position that i think of the american people i can t hold a grudge i have to be able to not only fight but also heal and as president of the united states that s what i will attempt to do notwithstanding that we re going to be more division after he s defeated by me this next time blitzer sen klobuchar you re going to be a juror in the trial in the senate that s about to start do you worry president trump will be emboldened by acquittal klobuchar no we have a constitutional duty to do to perform here and when i look at what the issue is it s whether or not we re going to be able to have witnesses we ve asked for only four people as witnesses and if our republican colleagues won t allow those witnesses they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter they may as well make him king and last time i checked our country was founded on this idea that we didn t want to be ruled by a king and i think the best way to think about this is trial and what we re facing in this election is a story of a man from primghar iowa his name was joseph welch he came from humble beginnings a son of immigrants he became the army counsel and he was the one that went to the joseph mccarthy hearings and when mccarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs there was only one man everyone that was afraid they were afraid of being blacklisted joseph welch he stood up and looked at mccarthy and said have you no sense of decency sir have you no sense of decency this is a decency check on our government this is a patriotism check not only is this trial that blitzer thank you klobuchar but also this election and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage i say this blitzer thank you sen klobuchar klobuchar to americans you know this is a decency check on this president blitzer mr steyer you have spent millions and millions of dollars telling the american people that president trump deserves to be impeached will it have been worth if it he has been impeached but not removed from office who s spending the most on political ads in iowa tom steyer leads the pack steyer well wolf actually what i have done is to organize a petition drive of 8 5 million americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office and those 8 5 million people have called their congresspeople have emailed their congresspeople and have actually dragged washington d c to see that in fact this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency so if you ask me whether standing up for what s right in america standing up for the american people and our safety standing up for the constitution whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the american people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves if you think that that isn t worth it then you don t share the idea that i do about what america is about standing up for what s right is always worth it wolf and i will never back down from that applause blitzer sen warren a senate trial is expected to keep you in washington in the weeks leading up to the iowa caucuses here how big of a problem is that for you as you re making your closing pitch to voters here warren look some things are more important than politics i took an oath to uphold the constitution of the united states of america it says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the united states we have an impeachment trial i will be there because it is my responsibility but understand this what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the american people and something we should all be talking about is the corruption of this administration that is what lies at heart of it it is about donald trump putting donald trump first not the american people not the interests of the united states of america not even helping ukraine defend against russia it is about him helping himself that is what we need to do to win this election we need to draw that distinction and show that as democrats we re not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations people who want to help themselves that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people that s why we re here pfannenstiel let s turn now to the climate crisis here in iowa parts of the state remain under water after record breaking flooding began last spring racking up an estimated 2 billion in damages today many iowans are still displaced from their homes mayor buttigieg you have talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding but what do you do about farms and factories that simply can t be moved buttigieg that s why we have to fight climate change with such urgency climate change has come to america from coast to coast seeing it in iowa we have seen it in historic floods in my community i had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a millennium flood then two years later had to do the same thing in australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place this is no longer theoretical and this is no longer off in the future we have got to act yes to adapt to make sure communities are more resilient to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other but we also have to ensure that we don t allow this to get any worse and if we get right farmers will be a huge part of the solution we need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them whether we re talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community and make clear that we need to enlist them pfannenstiel but mayor buttigieg buttigieg in the national project to do something about it pfannenstiel to clarify what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated buttigieg we are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency and by the way that is happening to farms that is happening to factories and that disproportionately happens to black and brown americans which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward pfannenstiel thank you mayor buttigieg mr steyer what s your response steyer look what you re talking about is what s called managed retreat it s basically saying we re going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and it s unbelievably expensive and of course we ll come to the rescue of americans who are in trouble but this is why climate is my number one priority and i m still shocked that i m the only person on this stage who will say this i would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate applause i would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can t breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely but i also know this we re going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country it s going to be the biggest job program in american history so i know we have to do it i know we can do it and i know that we can do it in a way that makes us healthier that makes us better paid and is more just but the truth of the matter is we re going to have to do it and we re going to have to make the whole world come along with us and it s going to have to be pfannenstiel mr steyer steyer priority one pfannenstiel mr steyer to clarify you say you re the climate change candidate but you made your 1 6 billion in part by investing in coal oil and gas so are you the right messenger on this topic steyer i absolutely am look we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago i realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels that we had to change so i divested from fossil fuels i took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while i m alive and for 12 years i have been fighting the climate crisis i have beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws i have stopped fossil fuel plants in oxnard california i fought the keystone pipeline i have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully pfannenstiel thank you mr steyer steyer so actually yes i am the person here who has the chops and the history that says i ll make it priority one because i have been doing it for a long time pfannenstiel thank you mr steyer sen warren president trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipeline and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can t overturn warren yes climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated i will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day i will roll back the environmental changes that donald trump is putting in place i will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling that will help us get in the right directions i ll bring in the farmers farmers can be part of the climate solution we should see this for the problem it is mr steyer talks about it being problem number one understand this we have known about this climate crisis for decades back in the 1990s we were calling it global warming but we knew what it was democrats and republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem but you know what happened the industry came in and said we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption that is the only way we will make progress on climate on gun safety on health care on all of the issues that matter to us pfannenstiel thank you sen warren sen klobuchar some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all out ban on fracking you haven t why not klobuchar well first of all i would note that i have 100 percent rating from the league of conservation voters and that is because i have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration this trump administration trying to reverse environmental protections i think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasn t been raised by the way is the rules on methane which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on and i would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones when it comes to the issue of fracking
china is close to releasing a national digital currency how would such a currency run by a central bank work china is where paper money was first invented a thousand years ago and it might be where paper as a proxy for value also fades from the world stage china s central bank the people s bank of china pboc announced in august that it would soon roll out a national digital currency to replace cash if it does china would be the first major country to do so and would set a trend that has the potential to upend the entire global financial structure some experts have speculated that china s digital currency will be a crypto currency similar to bitcoin which is built on a blockchain model allowing for vastly dispersed control and anonymous transactions but most indications are that it will rather be a centralized currency that looks and acts much the same as what already exists in the marketplace except in a digital form china is able to lay claim to being the birthplace of paper money during the song dynasty a thousand years ago and it may soon be where paper as a proxy for value also begins its retreat from the world stage the country is already at the forefront of the shift away from banknotes with alibaba s alipay and tencent s wechat wallet leading the way both services process far more digital payments than any other digital payment alternative around the world and are now a part of daily life for most chinese people according to the china daily the number of mobile and online payment transactions in china in 2018 reached rmb 57 01 billion 8 billion up from rmb 23 67 billion in 2013 while the value of all transactions more than doubled to rmb 2 126 3 trillion 297 trillion just about everything can now be paid for with digital payment swipes from a mobile phone including coffee cars and charity payments to beggars but an official china digital currency would take this trend to a whole new level why now although the concept has been in the works since 2014 the official announcement of plans to launch a digital currency came around the time that for the first time in years the chinese rmb fell below the threshold of rmb 7 to the us dollar that was in early august and was also around the time that facebook announced its plans for a global digital currency called libra there has been intense speculation in the markets as to just what the chinese authorities are planning and how it will affect both china s economy and that of the world the pboc s digital currency chief is mu changchun who was appointed head of the central bank s digital currency research subsidiary in september in august he disclosed at a forum in beijing that the bank was now ready to launch a digital currency and some experts saw the announcement as being aimed at offsetting the momentum created by facebook s statements around libra where we are now is just like in a horse race when several designated institutions are taking different technical routes for developing the digital currency and electronic payment mu was quoted by the china daily as saying the winner will be the one who has the best approach accepted by the public and the market so that is a process of market competition mu added that any digital currency must be under central bank control and that would seem to rule out a blockchain kind of option ting lu chief china economist at nomura says the main goal of a national currency would be to strengthen state control over the banking system and china s national currency and it would not be a crypto like currency i don t believe that any central bank in the world would allow the private sector to create money he says i don t think the central bank is trying to compete against crypto currencies addressing the rampant speculation about a digital currency pboc governor yi gang told a news conference in september that more research testing trials assessments and risk prevention was needed before it could be launched in particular if the digital currency involves cross border use it will involve a series of regulatory issues regarding anti money laundering anti tax evasion anti terrorism financing as well as know your client protocols yi added a power grab and while cross border international trading of a digital chinese currency is a major consideration the first concern for financial officials and the markets is how it would affect china s domestic economy the number one factor here is control says christopher balding an associate professor at fulbright university in vietnam who has studied china for more than a decade according to balding it would provide the state with an enhanced ability to monitor private sector companies and increase tax revenues five years ago china was a cash based economy he says that is no longer the case most people even in remote regions pay for goods through private banking systems like alipay and wechat wallet that amounts to trillions of dollars in payments it would also have the impact of restricting corrupt transactions it is much harder to be corrupt if china understands your finances in real time says balding push for centralized control beijing has been strengthening the government s oversight of all corporate affairs in recent years even though the role of the state has been a key issue in the china us trade talks over the past two years they are definitely trying to integrate much more with the private sector balding adds the looming launch of facebook s libra currency is one of the factors putting pressure on the pboc to step up its plans libra doesn t exist yet but facebook s announcement sent shock waves through central banks around the world because it raised for all of them the specter of a loss of control of the basic building block at the heart of the economies they oversee money libra due to be launched in 2020 has been pitched as mirroring real world assets and being backed by a basket of sovereign currencies with us dollars making up 50 of the basket the libra basket does not include china s rmb which unlike other major world currencies is not freely convertible the pboc s mu changchun said in august that china s digital currency would bear some similarities to libra but he did not elaborate he also said that the currency would aim to strike a balance between anonymous payments and preventing money laundering the advantage of a central bank issued digital currency over payment platforms controlled by private companies like alibaba and tencent he said is that such commercial platforms could go bankrupt and cause users to lose money china unionpay is the state backed financial organization that provides the basis for all chinese bank card operations and controls all bank teller machines throughout china its chairperson shao fujun a former pboc official was quoted by china daily as saying the precise form the digital currency would take was still under discussion but added it will have lots of positive impacts including tracking the money flow in economic activities and supporting making monetary policy a true crypto won t work china would not be the first country to establish a digital currency a number of small countries including cambodia estonia and singapore have announced plans to establish such currencies and are at various stages along the road to launching them none of them have so far gone as far as the marshall islands a tiny country in the south pacific with just 53 000 people and a treaty relationship with the united states the marshall islands is going all in on a bitcoin based currency to be called the sovereign or sov it will run in parallel to the us dollar which is currently the only legal currency in the islands that may make sense for the marshall islands but china the world s second largest economy with a population of 1 4 billion people is an entirely different situation any blockchain based currency involves to some extent decentralization but china s model is the exact opposite the centralizing of control says balding this has to do with managing risks and measuring the economy this just gives them more information more than anything it gives china the ability to channel resources they can see what companies are doing beyond that is the question of what impact a chinese digital currency could have on global finance and trade flows and some people see it as having the potential to undermine the us dollar s dominance the chinese government has been trying for years to get the rmb accepted as an international currency but has had only limited success it circumvents the global economic structure that is now in place says michael stout a london based cyber security and fintech expert who consults for governments what they are trying to do is bypass the dollar based system when a central bank makes a play like this they are attempting to create price equalization stout adds it creates price stabilization between the dollar and the yuan rmb it s not tied to an exchange rate what they want to do is control the price of trade the rmb exchange rate has increasingly been under pressure during 2019 to some extent because of the china us trade war china has an incentive because they can move off the dollar stout says they no longer reliant on traders and they can shut down the blockchain if they want to the currency allows them to operate without the oversight of the united states a digital fiat currency the pboc governor yi gang said that the central bank plans to make its digital currency available through four state owned banks agricultural bank of china bank of china china construction bank and the industrial and commercial bank of china as well as the online payment platforms operated by tech giants ant financial a unit of alibaba china unionpay and tencent the pboc s mu said the currency would be based on a system similar to that used to produce minted money with the pboc producing and managing the currency then issuing it to commercial banks and other entities which would then circulate it to consumers a research report from crypto exchange binance said that china s digital currency will be backed 1 1 by the rmb as well as follow a two tiered structured system with the commercial banks and retail market participants the first tier will connect the pboc with commercial banks for currency issuance and redemption binance said the second layer will connect those commercial banks with the greater retail market binance says that the pboc s system could allow fund transfers without the need for a bank account the end goal for the cbdc is to display a turnover rate as high as cash while achieving manageable anonymity binance said in the report in other words in the first layer network of the cbdc real name institutions are expected to be registered while the transfer in the second layer network would be anonymous from the perspective of users chasing libra the extent to which the impending launch of the libra could be influencing the chinese financial authorities is not known but it is clearly not an irrelevant factor despite the gulf that exists between the chinese and international financial systems the pboc s research director wang xin quoted by the south china morning post said the libra might reinforce the us dollar s influence over the global financial system if is widely used for payments cross border payments in particular would it be able to function like money and accordingly have a large influence on monetary policy financial stability and the international monetary system wang xin asked at a conference in july adding that the new digital currency could have a major impact on monetary policy and financial stability stability is a strong requirement of the chinese authorities economic growth has been slowing in recent years and is forecast to fall further in 2020 due to a combination of systemic and international issues a rapidly aging population a falling birth rate a tightening federal reserve and a slowing global economy have combined to put the brakes on china s economy balding says a digital currency could help offset some of these risks but in some ways china is already a long way down the road to having an economy underpinned by digital payments what s the difference between the pboc using digital money and wechat digital currencies are already used on such a wide scale that it makes no difference says nomura s lu fulbright university s balding agrees if you think of the trillions of dollars in rmb that are transacted digitally today he says they are already a cashless society will china go completely cashless sure in five to 10 years
the iranian regime and the saudi arabian regime are longtime enemies both vying for control of the persian gulf region part of the conflict stems from religious differences differences between shia and sunni muslim groups but much of it stems from mundane desires to establish regional dominance for more than forty years however saudi arabia has had one important ace in the hole in terms of its battle with iran the us s continued support for the saudi regime but why should the us continue to so robustly support this dictatorial regime certainly these close relations can t be due to any american support for democracy and human rights the saudi regime is one of the world s most illiberal and antidemocratic regimes its ruling class has repeatedly been connected to islamist terrorist groups with foreign policy magazine last year calling saudi arabia the beating heart of wahhabism the harsh absolutist religious creed that helped seed the worldviews of al qaeda and the islamic state saudis behind the petrodollar the answer lies in the fact that the saudi state is at the center of us efforts to maintain the dollar as the world s reserve currency and to ensure global demand for us debt the origins of this system go back decades by 1974 the us dollar was in a precarious position in 1971 thanks to profligate spending on both war and domestic welfare programs the us could no longer maintain a set global price for gold in line with the bretton woods system established in 1944 the value of the dollar in relation to gold fell as the supply of dollars increased as a byproduct of growing deficit spending foreign governments and investors began to lose faith in the dollar and both switzerland and france demanded gold in exchange for their dollars as stipulated by bretton woods if such demands continued though us gold holdings would soon be depleted moreover the dollar was losing value against other currencies in may of 1971 germany left the bretton woods system and the dollar fell against the deutsche mark in response to these developments nixon announced the us would abandon the bretton woods system the dollar began to float against other currencies not surprisingly devaluing the dollar did not restore confidence in the dollar moreover the us had made no effort to rein in deficit spending so the us needed to continue to find ways to sell government debt without driving up interest rates that is the us needed more buyers for its debt motivation for a fix grew even more after 1973 when the first oil shock further exacerbated the deficit fueled price inflation americans were enduring but by 1974 the enormous flood of dollars from the us into top oil exporter saudi arabia suggested a solution that year nixon sent new us treasury secretary william simon to saudi arabia with a mission as recounted by andrea wong at bloomberg the goal was to neutralize crude oil as an economic weapon and find a way to persuade a hostile kingdom to finance america s widening deficit with its newfound petrodollar wealth the basic framework was strikingly simple the u s would buy oil from saudi arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment in return the saudis would plow billions of their petrodollar revenue back into treasuries and finance america s spending from a public finance point of view this appeared to be a win win the saudis would receive protection from geopolitical enemies and the us would get a new place to unload large amounts of government debt moreover the saudis could park their dollars in relatively safe and reliable investments in the united states this became known as petrodollar recycling by spending on oil the us and other oil importers who were now required to use dollars was creating new demand for us debt and us dollars this dollar agreement wasn t limited to saudi arabia either since saudi arabia dominated the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec the dollar deal was extended to opec overall which meant that the dollar became the preferred currency for oil purchases worldwide this scheme assured the dollar s place as a currency of immense global importance this was especially important during the 1970s and early 1980s after all up until the early 1980s opec enjoyed a 50 percent market share in the oil trade thanks to the second oil shock however much of the world began searching for a wide variety of ways to decrease dependency on oil by the mid 1980s opec s share had fallen to less than one third today saudi arabia ranks behind both russia and the united states in terms of oil production as of 2019 opec s share remains around 30 percent this has lessened the role of the petrodollar compared to the heady days of the 1970s but the importance of the petrodollar is certainly not destroyed we can see the ongoing importance of the petrodollar in us foreign policy which has continued to antagonize and threaten any major oil exporting state that moves toward ending its reliance on dollars as noted by matthew hatfield in the harvard political review it is likely not a mere coincidence that an especially belligerent us foreign policy has been applied to the iraqi libyan and iranian regimes hatfield writes in 2000 saddam hussein then president of iraq announced that iraq was moving to sell its oil in euros instead of dollars following 9 11 the united states invaded iraq deposed saddam hussein and converted iraqi oil sales back to the u s dollar this exact pattern was repeated with muammar gaddafi when he attempted to create a unified african currency backed by libyan gold reserves to to sell african oil shortly after his announcement rebels armed by the us government and allies overthrew the dictator and his regime after his death the idea that african oil would be sold on something other than the dollar quickly died out other regimes that have called for abandoning the petrodollar include iran and venezuela the us has called for regime change in both these countries oil exporters control us assets threats can be leveled in both directions however last year for example saudi arabia threatened to sell its oil in currencies other than the dollar if washington passes a bill exposing opec members to u s antitrust lawsuits that is the saudi regime is aware that it has at least some leverage with the us because of the saudi position at the center of the petrodollar system saudi arabia is one of few states that can even feign to call the us s bluff on matters such as these as has been made abundantly clear by us policy in recent decades the us is more than willing to invade foreign countries that run afoul of the petrodollar system in the case of saudi arabia however the kingdom s position as an iran antagonist and as the world s third largest oil exporter means that the us is likely to avoid unnecessary conflict moreover it is likely that saudi holdings of us debt and other assets are significant when the saudis make threats this implicitly also include liquidating the kingdom s holdings in the united states as bloomberg reported saudi arabia has also warned it would start selling as much as 750 billion in treasuries and other assets if congress passes a bill allowing the kingdom to be held liable in u s courts for the sept 11 terrorist attacks we often hear about how china and japan hold a lot of us debt and therefore hold some leverage over the us because of this the problem here is that were foreigners to dump us assets they would drop in price if us debt drops in price then the the debt must increase in yield which means the us must then pay more interest on its debt but there is good reason to believe that saudi arabia is a major holder as well it is difficult however to keep track of how large these holdings are because the saudi regime has worked closely with the us regime to keep saudi purchases of american assets secret when the us treasury reports on foreign holders of us debt saudi arabia is folded in with several other nations to hide the precise nature of saudi purchases nevertheless as wong contends the saudi regime is one of america s largest foreign creditors the problem grows as us debt grows all else being equal the us should be growing less dependent on foreign holders of debt this should especially be true of saudi and opec held debt since the global role of opec and the saudis has been diminishing in terms of global market share but all else isn t equal and the us has been piling on ever larger amounts of debt in recent years in 2019 for example the annual deficit topped one trillion in a past less profligate age this sort of debt creation would have been reserved only for wartime or a period of economic depression today however this immense growth in debt levels makes the us regime more sensitive to changes in demand for us debt and this has made the us regime ever more reliant on foreign demand for both us debt and us dollars that is in order to avoid a crisis the us must ensure that interest rates remain low and that foreigners want to acquire both us dollars and us debt were petrodollars and petrodollar recycling to disappear it would have a twofold effect on us government finances a sizable decline in petrodollar recycling would put significant upward pressure on interest rates the result would be a budget crisis for the us government as it would have to devote ever larger amounts of the federal budget to payments on the debt the other option would be to have the us central bank monetize the debt by purchasing ever larger amounts of it to make up for a lack of foreign demand this would lead to growing price inflation further if participants began to exit the petrodollar system and say sell oil in euros instead demand for dollars would drop exacerbating any scenarios in which the central bank is monetizing the debt this would also generally contribute to greater price inflation as fewer dollars will be sucked out of the us by foreign holders the result could be ongoing declines in government spending on services and growing price inflation the us regime s ability to finance its debt would decline significantly and the us would need to pull back on military commitments pensions and more either that or keep spending at the same rate and face an inflationary spiral
when thousands of economists gathered for the annual american economic association meeting this month there were overwhelming calls for more and wiser government spending leading economic thinkers laid out the case that the nation will almost certainly have to spend more during the next recession that major challenges such as climate change and inequality will likely require more money and that the united states is significantly under investing in infrastructure and education even under current conditions i think we can afford to increase federal spending or cut taxes to stimulate the economy if there s a downturn said janet yellen the former fed chief who is the incoming president of the american economic association chronic low interest rates create additional fiscal space yellen s remarks are part of a growing chorus of prominent economists who are building the intellectual case for the united states to take on a bit more debt they are not saying that politicians have a blank check to spend more or that higher debt doesn t have any negative consequences the money still has to be paid back at some point with interest but the consensus view is shifting among economists from a belief that debt harms the economy to a belief that responsible borrowing is warranted yellen argued that the timing is right to make smart investments it s cheap to borrow with interest rates so low and unlikely rise much any time soon in a world of low real rates there s also a strong case for programs to invest in infrastructure education research and development climate change mitigation namely investments that would elevate potential growth yellen said her call for more spending noticeably contrasts from her 2017 testimony before congress that the long term budget outlook should keep people awake at night the academic conversation around spending more to strengthen the economy comes at a time when the federal budget deficit topped 1 trillion due to the trump administration tax cuts and increased spending it was the first time the deficit broke the trillion dollar mark during a january to december period since 2012 when the economy was still recovering from the great recession the deficit continues to rise according to the latest treasury report on government debt released monday some economists called for higher taxes especially on the rich to fund additional spending and many denounced trump s tax cuts as wasteful spending that could have gone toward other initiatives including infrastructure but there was a lot less worry about the current debt level if you had been at the meetings seven years ago there would have been a lot of concern about entitlement spending there s very little of that now said lawrence summers the former treasury secretary under bill clinton who helped craft the last balanced federal budget indeed many pointed to japan where debt is about 250 the size of the economy as a good example that debt can rise a lot without triggering a doomsday scenario economic textbooks teach that too much debt can bankrupt a country and trigger massive inflation which can cause a recession but after years of high debt in japan investors are still willing to lend the country money and japan s economy is sluggish but stable u s debt is about 80 of gdp and is projected to grow to 95 of gdp by 2029 largely because of rising social security and medicare spending as baby boomers age but many argued that it s unlikely u s bonds would lose their status as one of the safest assets in the world if debt grew somewhat more i would be very confident the united states would not go bankrupt summers said he would support a prudent program of borrowing to finance reasonable prudent public investment for example on schools and renewable energy that sentiment was echoed by many we are in such bad shape on infrastructure said economist lisa lynch the provost of brandeis university we had such a missed opportunity as part of the response to the great recession to really have doubled down on making major investments in our infrastructure the economists who attend aea are largely academics several who spoke with the washington post estimated that 80 to 90 of the conference attendees are politically liberal which could explain the heightened calls for the government to do more but others say economists views are evolving on government spending because circumstances have changed lower interest rates make borrowing and investing more attractive and rapid technological advances make it more necessary for the united states to invest heavily to remain competitive the u s economy is growing at about 2 a modest pace compared with prior booms summers has dubbed this secular stagnation trump promised his tax cuts and deregulation would lift growth which happened in 2018 but growth slowed closer to 2 in 2019 and economists say a big reason the economy rarely grows beyond 3 anymore is because of the aging population fewer workers and muted productivity growth janice eberly of northwestern university s kellogg school of management put up a slide showing that while the u s government spends more dollars today on the military and domestic programs than it did in the 1960s federal investment as a share of gdp is at an all time low which is likely hurting productivity and growth there s also the reality that if another recession hits the federal reserve is unlikely to be able to do as much to rescue the economy the fed typically cut rates 5 points during prior recessions the fed s benchmark rate is already just shy of 1 75 leaving little room to goose the economy we don t have monetary policy it s very limited at the moment said kenneth rogoff a harvard economics professor who foresaw much of the 2008 financial crisis with monetary policy hamstrung congress would likely need to spend more during the next recession to help revive the economy but rogoff said he is not at all optimistic that can be done several economists including summers proposed automatic stabilizers for the economy which are measures such as payroll tax cuts or extra food stamps that would take effect once the unemployment rate climbs to a high rate but it would take an act of congress to set up the automatic stabilizers which seems unlikely in the current political environment other economists called for bolder moves for the government to spend more on addressing climate change by funding more research on green technologies there were also calls for the government to better address inequalities such as giving children from low and moderate income families baby bonds that can help pay for college and other springboards to a better life everybody now assumes that social programs and social safety nets require more resources said dani rodrik a harvard economics professor nobody stood up and said all of this inequality is because the government is doing too much
pete buttigieg pointed to his own military experience and slammed donald trump over his bone spurs diagnosis as he argued he is prepared to take on the president buttigieg said if trump tried tough talk on the military during a debate with the former south bend indiana mayor he would have to do so while standing next to an american war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve the line came near the end of the debate when buttigieg turned a barb from businessman tom steyer to take on the republican president trump was diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels at the age of 22 in 1968 seven years before the vietnam war ended the diagnosis earned him a 1 y medical deferment meaning he was barred from military service in the same year that roughly 300 000 troops were enlisted into the military buttigieg attacked the president on other topics too i am ready to take on this president on the economy because i am from the exact kind of industrial midwestern community he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on buttigieg said the mayor also hit trump on religion the mayor is an episcopalian trump a presbyterian enjoyed widespread support from white american evangelicals during the 2016 election if he keeps trying to use religion if a guy like donald trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit christianity into the gop i will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith he said and insist that god does not belong to a political party
the iranian regime and the saudi arabian regime are longtime enemies both vying for control of the persian gulf region part of the conflict stems from religious differences differences between shia and sunni muslim groups but much of it stems from mundane desires to establish regional dominance for more than forty years however saudi arabia has had one important ace in the hole in terms of its battle with iran the us s continued support for the saudi regime but why should the us continue to so robustly support this dictatorial regime certainly these close relations can t be due to any american support for democracy and human rights the saudi regime is one of the world s most illiberal and antidemocratic regimes its ruling class has repeatedly been connected to islamist terrorist groups with foreign policy magazine last year calling saudi arabia the beating heart of wahhabism the harsh absolutist religious creed that helped seed the worldviews of al qaeda and the islamic state

biden repeated his false claim that he opposed the war in iraq from the moment the war began biden said he made a mistake in casting a 2002 vote as a senator from delaware to give president george w bush the authority to go to war in iraq but he said he cast the vote because the bush administration had said they were just going to get inspectors into iraq to check for weapons of mass destruction and that once bush actually went to war he became immediately opposed from that point on i was in the position of making the case that it was a big big mistake the facts as fact checkers have repeatedly noted biden did not oppose the war in iraq from the point it started in march 2003 he did begin calling his 2002 vote a mistake in 2005 two years into the war but he was a vocal public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004 and he made clear in 2002 and 2003 both before and after the war started that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war not only to try to get inspectors into iraq cnn s facts first team has debunked various versions of biden s claim that he opposed the war from the moment it started read longer articles on that here here and here here are a few representative biden quotes in a february 2003 speech in delaware he said let everyone here be absolutely clear i supported the resolution to go to war i am not opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from iraq i am not opposed to war to remove saddam from those weapons if it comes to that it s true that biden criticized bush s approach to diplomacy in the lead up to the war warned in the lead up to the war that bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be and he criticized bush s handling of the war from its first weeks on but biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism in a july 2003 speech at the brookings institution biden said nine months ago i voted with my colleagues to give the president of the united states of america the authority to use force and i would vote that way again today it was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today during the debate on tuesday biden also offered a confusing timeline of his positions on the war saying i said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if in fact he couldn t get inspectors into iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon it was a mistake and i acknowledged that when biden said 13 years ago he appeared to be referring to how in 2006 and 2007 he was calling his 2002 vote a mistake the vote itself was more than 17 years ago daniel dale and nate mcdermott cnn
blk earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 blackrock inc blk 0 69 q4 2019 earnings call 8 30 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning my name is laurie and i ll be your conference facilitator today at this time i would like to welcome everyone to the blackrock inc fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings teleconference our host for today s call will be chairman and chief executive officer laurence d fink chief financial officer gary s shedlin president robert s kapito and general counsel christopher j meade after the speakers remarks there will be a question and answer period thank you mr meade you may begin your conference christopher meade chief legal officer good morning everyone i m chris meade the general counsel of blackrock before we begin i d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward looking statements we call your attention to the fact that blackrock s actual results may of course differ from these statements as you know blackrock has filed reports with the sec which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of blackrock to differ materially from what we say today blackrock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward looking statements so with that i ll turn it over to gary gary shedlin chief financial officer thanks chris good morning and happy new year to everyone it s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 before i turn it over to larry to offer his comments i ll review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both gaap and as adjusted financial results i will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results for many years blackrock s differentiated globally integrated asset management and technology business including our risk management and portfolio construction tools has proven its ability to deliver for clients and shareholders in different market environments that continued in 2019 a difficult fourth quarter of 2018 created a challenging start to the year but as we noted a year ago volatile market environments create opportunities for growth at blackrock as long as we remain disciplined to continue playing offense blackrock achieved both revenue and earnings growth during 2019 investment performance across our active products was excellent with 86 76 and 84 of taxable fixed income fundamental and systematic active equity assets respectively above benchmark or peer median for the trailing three year period we generated record net inflows of 429 billion representing 7 organic asset growth and 5 organic base fee growth enabling us to once again meet our aspirational organic growth target for the fifth time in the last seven years and we finished the year with strong momentum reporting over 129 billion in total flows in the fourth quarter the financial strength and stability of our operating model allows us to continuously invest through market cycles and capture growth in areas of highest client demand by technology illiquid alternatives and ishares especially higher growth strategic etf segments such as factors fixed income sustainable and megatrends these investments position blackrock to offer clients not simply products but comprehensive whole portfolio solutions and to generate consistent long term growth for shareholders full year revenue of 14 5 billion was up 2 while operating income of 5 6 billion increased marginally earnings per share of 28 48 was up 6 versus 2018 for the fourth quarter blackrock generated revenue of 4 billion and operating income of 1 5 billion up 16 and 17 respectively from a year ago when results were impacted by significant market volatility quarterly earnings per share of 8 34 was up 37 versus 2018 also reflecting higher non operating income a lower effective tax rate and a reduced diluted share count in the current quarter non operating results for the quarter reflected 85 million of net investment income primarily driven by the mark to market valuation of our minority stake in envestnet and higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 18 driven in part by discrete benefits linked to additional guidance on us tax reform we currently estimate that 23 is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2020 the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on recently enacted tax legislation fourth quarter base fees of 3 1 billion were up 310 million year over year primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta organic growth and higher securities lending revenue partially offset by certain strategic pricing investments year over year quarterly base fee growth of 11 lagged growth in average aum of 16 however due to the ongoing impact of divergent equity beta and client preference for lower lower risk fixed income and cash assets in 2019 in addition while fourth quarter base fees were up 4 sequentially our overall fee rate declined 0 1 basis points versus the third quarter full year base fees ended up 2 notwithstanding the impact of a significant global equity market decline in last year s fourth quarter as a reminder we entered 2019 with an annualized base fee run rate approximately 6 lower than 2018 fourth quarter performance fees of 239 million more than doubled versus a year ago reflecting strong alpha generation from liquid and illiquid alternative products full year performance fees of 450 million were up 9 compared to 2018 despite a significant number of liquid alternative products entering the year below their high watermarks importantly recognized performance fees from illiquid alternatives were up significantly in 2019 and represented approximately 30 of total performance fees for the year quarterly technology services revenue increased 35 year over year and full year revenue of 974 million increased 24 reflecting the impact of the efront acquisition and continued growth in aladdin excluding efront technology services revenue grew 12 for the full year and we continue to target low to mid teens growth going forward demand remained strong for our full range of technology solutions and digital distribution tools including institutional aladdin efront and aladdin wealth fourth quarter advisory and other revenue increased 30 year over year reflecting higher transition management and advisory assignments total expense increased 4 in 2019 driven primarily by higher compensation and g a expense and the acquisition of efront for the full year compensation expense increased 164 million or 4 primarily reflecting higher headcount higher performance fees and higher deferred compensation expense our full year comp to revenue ratio of 34 8 was moderately higher than 2018 as a result of the mark to market impact of certain deferred compensation programs in 2019 and the full year impact of retention awards related to recent acquisition activity recall that year over year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis fourth quarter g a expense was up 130 million sequentially due to seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend higher technology expense and the aggregate impact of 48 million of quarterly expense related to contingent consideration fair value adjustments and foreign exchange remeasurement overall g a expense increased 7 in 2019 reflecting higher levels of technology spend the impact of the efront acquisition and 59 million of fund launch costs related to the successful second quarter close of the 1 4 billion blackrock science and technology trust ii excluding the impact of efront and various non core items such as contingent consideration fair value adjustments product launch costs and fx remeasurement expense we estimate that our full year core g a spend increased 2 versus 2018 while we continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base we would currently expect 2020 core g a expense to increase approximately 5 relative to comparable 2019 levels driven by continued investment in technology and market data including sustainability initiatives and the full year impact of the efront acquisition our full year as adjusted operating margin of 43 7 was down 60 basis points versus 2018 reflecting our strategic decision to continue investing responsibly in 2019 despite the more challenging overall revenue capture environment created by last year s fourth quarter market volatility we continue to see strong performance in our future drivers of differentiated growth including etfs alternatives technology and portfolio construction and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long term and optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible and we are prudently using our balance sheet to best position blackrock to achieve this success during 2019 we allocated over 750 million of new seed and co investment capital to support our growth with our investment portfolio now exceeding 3 billion for the first time we also closed the strategic acquisition of efront which in combination with aladdin will provide clients with an ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform and we remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases returning an aggregate of 3 8 billion to shareholders in 2019 we repurchased approximately 1 7 billion worth of shares and an average share price of 414 per share taking advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities that arose during the year since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013 we have now repurchased approximately 8 7 billion of blackrock stock reducing our outstanding total shares by 9 and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 14 for our shareholders at present based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions including the relative valuation of our stock price we would anticipate repurchasing at least 1 2 billion of shares during 2020 consistent with our guidance a year ago in addition and also subject to market conditions we expect to seek board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2020 dividend blackrock s globally diversified investment platform combined with industry leading risk management and portfolio construction technology enables us to bring together the entire firm to partner with clients in order to meet their evolving needs fourth quarter total net inflows of 129 billion representing 7 annualized organic aum growth and 10 annualized organic base fee growth were led by flows into strategic focus areas including ishares and illiquid alternatives full year flows of 429 billion were positive across active and index all asset classes client types and regions and reflected significant strength in fixed income and cash which accounted for approximately 85 of organic growth global ishares generated 183 billion of net inflows for the year representing 11 organic growth importantly we saw momentum into year end driven by a resurgence in equity etfs fourth quarter ishares net inflows of 75 billion represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 15 notably in 2019 over 80 of ishares flows were driven by strategic product segments which is about 28 organic growth we also saw continued strength in the core segment with 15 organic growth partially offset by volatility driven outflows from precision exposure etfs primarily in may and august within the higher fee strategic segment it was a record year for fixed income etfs where ishares is the market leader we generated 112 billion of net inflows into ishares fixed income etfs representing 26 organic growth demand remains exceptionally strong as investors seek more efficient market access portfolio construction evolves in wealth management and technology accelerates the modernization and electronification of the bond market we achieved the number one share of industry factor etf flows with 34 billion across a diverse range of factor ishares during 2019 us min vol or us mv was our largest and the industry s fourth highest asset gathering etf capturing over 12 billion in net inflows this is the first time a factor exposure outpaced every market cap weighted ishares etf in terms of aggregate flows our ishares sustainable etf lineup represents the fastest growing of our strategic segments generating 12 billion in net inflows and ending the year with 22 billion of aum more than any other active or index firm during 2019 the ishares esg leaders fund raised over 1 billion representing the largest equity etf launch in the past 15 years blackrock generated full year retail net inflows of 16 billion outperforming the broader active mutual fund industry inflows were led by our suite of active fixed income products and liquid alternatives partially offset by outflows from multi asset world allocation products fourth quarter retail net inflows of 8 billion reflected similar trends but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains reinvestment blackrock s institutional franchise generated record long term net inflows of 136 billion in 2019 representing 4 organic base fee growth institutional flows reflect strength in fixed income illiquid alternatives and multi asset solutions active net inflows of 2 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies where long term performance remains strong momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise accelerated and we saw 14 billion of net inflows into 2019 we also have 24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies representing a significant source of future growth and performance fees finally blackrock s cash management platform continued to increase share by leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions in 2019 we saw 93 billion of cash management net inflows across the platform including prime sustainable government and muni funds our innovative liquid environmentally aware fund or leaf continues to see strong momentum with 1 billion of net inflows since launch earlier this year in summary our 2019 results demonstrate the resilience of our platform which allows us to invest through market cycles and drive consistent and differentiated growth in a variety of markets our strategy is working we will continue to invest responsibly during 2020 including in key growth areas like ishares alternatives and technology to deliver the solutions our clients need to best position our employees for professional growth and to generate long term returns for our shareholders with that i ll turn it over to larry larry fink chairman and chief executive officer thank you gary good morning everyone and happy new year and welcome to a new decade blackrock has consistently and systematically invested for the future in preparation to meet clients changing needs by building a whole portfolio investment and technology platform providing thought leadership on the macro and geopolitical environment and innovating in areas like factors and sustainable investing we are adapting to and driving change in our industry and building deeper more strategic partnerships with more clients than ever before the benefits of our investments are evident in our results this morning we generated a record 429 billion of total net inflows for the year representing 7 organic asset growth and 5 organic base fee growth blackrock s result reflects the strength of our platform which is diversified across now 2 trillion in active strategies 5 trillion in ishares and index strategies and now over 500 billion in cash strategies we generated 226 billion of net inflows in ishares and index we generated a 110 billion of flows in active investing and we generated 93 billion in cash strategies flows were positive across all client channels across all asset classes and across all regions including more than 1 billion of net inflows in each of 16 countries and in more than 71 different products the total net new assets our clients entrusted to us in the past year equates to the level of assets under management of a top 50 global asset manager after dramatic fourth quarter 2018 market decline which lowered blackrock s aum last year by 500 billion we began 2019 at a challenging starting point we ended the year with a base fee rate run rate that was about 6 lower than 2018 base fees however the successful execution of our 2019 strategy delivered revenue growth operating income growth earnings growth and alongside we are continuing to invest in future opportunities 2019 was marked by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions which created volatility in financial markets uncertainty around the us and china trade negotiations brexit and other concerns about a slowdown in global growth all impacted investor sentiment driving industry flows into safer fixed income and cash strategies cash assets throughout the year in a late cycle dovish turn by central banks globally monetary policy proved again a powerful tool in offsetting so much of the geopolitical risk we saw equity markets close 2019 at record highs followed by decisive uk elections to move forward with brexit and now we have a preliminary agreement on trade that will be signed today by the us and china the s p 500 finished the year up 29 and yet emerging markets only rose 15 2019 also marked a year of milestones and transformations for the asset and wealth management industries the etf industry crossed 6 trillion in assets and ishares crossed 2 trillion we still believe ishares in the industry are at the early stages of growth however as clients are using ishares in many ways including as liquidity management for hedging instruments but also market access vehicles for central banks and to tactically access markets for alpha managers increasingly we are hoping clients use ishares as an instrument of active returns in public markets that s creating large and significant new market opportunities sustainability reached an inflection point with more and more clients focused on the impact on environmental social and governance factors on their portfolios some to better align their investments with their values and more because of the implications of financial risk and returns related to sustainability and climate change as i discussed in my letter to ceos which came out yesterday we re entering a new era of finance the investment risk presented by climate change are set to drive a significant reallocation of capital and companies investors and governments we all need to be more prepared throughout the year blackrock continued to invest in further differentiated that further differentiated our business model we adapted to and drive change in our industry and ultimately enabled a deeper a more comprehensive partnership with more clients than ever before the benefits of our investments in strategic growth areas are clear we saw strong flows in ishares record flows and commitments in illiquid alternatives record revenues in technology services in 2019 and active strategies where the industry faced muted flows blackrock generated 110 billion of net inflows and our active aum is at a all time high our liquid environmentally aware fund franchise is nearing 8 billion in size less than a year after our launch and we made significant progress to lead the industry in growth areas like ocio factor based and sustainable investing and our regions around the world including most recently china ishares is the etf market leader and generated 183 billion of net inflows for the year 57 ishare etfs each generated more than 1 billion of net inflows and we saw record flows in fixed income and we saw record flows in europe we once again captured the number one market share of 2019 in industry flows globally also in the united states in europe and in high growth segments such as fixed income etfs factor etfs and sustainability etfs we are optimistic about continued double digit growth in ishares because we see vast new markets opening up in how clients want to use these exposures ishares is expanding its range as a modernizing force in financial markets nowhere is this more true than in fixed income etfs fixed income etfs will be one of the largest drivers of blackrock s growth over the next decade the combination of blackrock s history as a bond manager our expertise in etfs and our industry leading technology and data capabilities has created significant differentiation for ishares after having pioneered the first fixed income etf in 2002 ishares fixed income aum surpassed 565 billion and generated a record 112 billion of net inflows in 2019 compared to the previous record of 2017 of 67 billion while some of this has been as a result of a strong year in fixed income markets overall we see this as a secular shift we see this as a technology shift we expect to reach 1 trillion in fixed income ishares within the next five years and the growth path is going to be differentiated than equities growth in fixed income etfs is coming from the modernization of the 100 trillion bond market itself and from conversations conversations of bond securities from institutions central banks and even other alpha managers into etfs more investors than ever before used ishares factor etfs to take active risk tapping into factors as an additional source of potential return beyond strategic asset allocation we generated 34 billion in factor flows in 2019 significantly outpacing all other index and all other active factor providers at the same time we are seeing secular shifts in the regulatory and distribution landscape that is propelling more and more investors to ishares for instance in europe we believe the etf industry could double to 2 trillion over the next five years as mifid ii is driving change across a variety of business models and price transparency is focusing clients on value for money which will drive more demand for etfs in this region we are generating record ishares inflows of 60 billion and the industry crossed 1 trillion of aum as etf adoption accelerated and in the united states we see independent financial advisory and direct platforms shift their strategies to eliminating transaction costs to marketization access to investing through etfs and enabling more people to invest to reach long term financial objectives we think this will be beneficial for brands like ishares that can deliver client high quality exposures with transparency with ease of access and for good value while i ve seen our monthly flows accelerated across this platform since the move to commission free trading in october our expectation is for the benefit of these moves to play out in the coming months and years especially for firms like us that can invest its scale and can invest for the long term we also had a record year in our illiquid alternative business and momentum is accelerating evidenced by increased fundraising and fund vintages as more clients reassess their liabilities and their liquidity needs associated with them they are taking a longer term view on the assets in their portfolio and increasing allocation to illiquid alternatives blackrock generated 14 billion of illiquid alternative net inflows in 2019 up from 8 billion in 2018 and just 1 billion of net flows in 2017 growth was driven by our infrastructure business by real estate by ltpc and private credit fourth quarter illiquid alternatives results included the 1 billion close of a third global renewable power fund as well as our second and third close of ltpc in which we secured an additional 1 1 billion of commitments growth in our illiquid alternative business will further enhance and supported by our acquisition and integration of efront as we leverage technology to enhance better solution we provide to our clients technology remains a key differentiator for blackrock and a strategic growth area technology is how we ve been able to scale our business into a global multi asset organization we are today and it enables us to have a deeper more resilient conversation with more and more of our clients our long term strategy is to provide technology for as much as much of the asset management value chain as possible and make aladdin the language of portfolios demand remained strong for aladdin and our technology capabilities and we expect growth will be driven by expanding aladdin s capabilities to existing clients to attracting new clients to inorganic growth including efront and the growth of our clients businesses as they scale themselves technology service revenues of 974 million increased 24 year over year and more than doubled since 2014 mckinsey research shows that only 3 of technology start ups reached 1 billion of revenues and i m proud that blackrock will soon cross that milestone our aladdin and efront technology is used by more than 900 clients in 68 countries including 16 wealth managers that have 35 000 financial advisors serving millions of end investors the vast majority of our technology service revenues today come from our institutional aladdin capabilities which set the standard in investment management technology and now with the integration of efront this will reinforce our value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system for investors in the world one of the biggest future growth opportunities is aladdin wealth macro forces are impacting the wealth industry including a more challenging market environment heightened customer expectations more regulation technology advancements and this is driving demand for a deeper portfolio analytical and risk transparency portfolio construction product and scale these are all core to the aladdin wealth value proposition additionally we are seeing more and more clients using aladdin wealth as a business enabler particularly in markets such as europe and asia where wealth managers are using aladdin wealth to move their business away from transaction commissions and retrocession based revenue model to more of an advice driven model blackrock s technology facilitates our ability to fulfill our purpose in helping more and more people experience financial well being by building best in class tools for ourselves and for our clients we are able to construct better portfolios and then deliver better outcomes tools alone however are not sufficient as i wrote about in my letter to ceos blackrock like all other investors need clear uniform and useful data on not only financial disclosure but increasingly more uniform and widespread standard for sustainability disclosure which will be vital to financial analysis and investment decisions making going forward as sustainability becomes increasingly material to investment outcomes blackrock is putting esg data and analytics at the heart of aladdin and our risk and quantitative analysis team we are increasingly evaluating esg risk with the same rigor as traditional measures such as credit or liquidity risk client demand for sustainable products and solutions continue to accelerate as a global leader investment management our goal is to also be the global leader in sustainable investing by incorporating sustainability at the core of how we manage risk how we construct portfolios how we design products and most importantly how we engage with companies as we wrote in a letter to clients yesterday we will be making sustainability the standard for investing including making sustainable investing more accessible to more of our investors we intend to double our esg offerings to 150 funds over the next two years including sustainable versions of our flagship ishares product so that clients have more choice for how they invest their money client demand is also increasing for outsourced cio solutions as many are being asked to do so more with less they do more with less blackrock generated 16 billion of ocio net inflows in 2019 representing a 10 organic growth including winning the largest ocio mandate awarded in the uk in recent years outsourcing currently represents only 2 trillion of the 85 trillion of managed assets globally and we believe the market will increase by 50 over the next five years i ve talked many times on these phone calls in the past about blackrock being one of the largest long term growth opportunities for blackrock in line with our commitment to invest and operate there blackrock entered into a memorial a memorandum of understanding last month to explore establishing an asset management joint venture in china which will enable us to provide more people with access to blackrock investment capabilities as i said in the past purpose is the agent to long term profitability a company s prospect for growth is inextricably from how it manages sustainability and serves its full set of stakeholders and that is so true for blackrock one of our greatest opportunities is to fulfill our purpose lies in the responsibility as the largest manager of retired assets in the world we estimate that two thirds of the assets we manage are related to people s retirement including our 1 trillion defined contribution business we are levering the full breadth of our capabilities and scale to benefit all our stakeholders including clients employees and stakeholders and shareholders everything we do is rooted in the culture of focusing on the long term and we are aggressively embracing change and investing to stay in front of the industry changes but most importantly we re investing to stay in front of our clients need so we could have them better prepared for their future the benefits of blackrock s investments are evident in our consistent growth over the last three years we ve generated nearly 1 trillion of net organic inflows 30 of revenue growth 19 operating income growth and a 43 total return for our shareholders we entered 2020 better positioned than ever to serve our clients to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come i want to thank blackrock s employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and living our purpose which was critical to our success in 2019 we remain focus in making sure that all our people stay true to our culture and our purpose and that is what differentiates blackrock in the asset management industry with that let s open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you your first question comes from the line of dan fannon of jefferies dan fannon jefferies company inc analyst thank you good morning larry fink chairman and chief executive officer good morning dan dan fannon jefferies company inc analyst as you think about 2020 can you talk about the outlook for fixed income in 2019 i think at the start of the year you talked about re risking within your client base you saw big inflows and now on the active side the second half of the year we ve seen modest outflows can you can you just kind of level set kind of what clients are doing your outlook for growth and how you re positioned larry fink chairman and chief executive officer well i think probably the biggest macro change for fixed income beyond if interest rates go up or down is going to be the utilization of fixed and etf for active strategies as i said in my prepared remarks and gary mentioned and i ll let rob talk about it a little more we believe this is going to be a fundamental shift in how people use fixed income as an exposure and they re going to be using etfs as that vehicle for active returns i believe this is going to be an overwhelming trend in the fixed income landscape as it s easier to navigate it s cheaper to navigate and importantly you provide much greater flexibility with substantially less operational risk when you use etfs versus the myriad of thousands of bonds the specifics of the outflows in fixed income were very idiosyncratic with one or two clients we you know we are seeing some clients as i said replace the what we define as an active strategy into more etf strategies and so it s hard to differentiate those two things as we build deeper broader dialogues about how to use etfs in a portfolio setting rob do you want to add more to that robert kapito president no i would just add in general i think there is a common belief now that rates are going to be longer lower for longer and with the amount of money that has been sitting on the sideline in cash clients cannot afford that anymore at getting less than 1 returns so they are more than willing now to extend out of cash into fixed income and those are the flows that we are seeing and rather than come into individual bonds the trend has been to use a more diversified portfolio that they can go into and etfs have been the beneficiary and because of blackrock s position in fixed income we have been the beneficiary of those particular flows which we expect will continue into 2020 larry fink chairman and chief executive officer let me just add putting a whole year perspective because i can t respond to one quarter versus another but for the full year we had 75 billion of active inflows in fixed income for the full year we had 112 billion in etfs and so when you put it all in perspective and then we had obviously even more an index and other types of ldi and other types of strategies so we had a very strong year in fixed income and but we are one of the one of the business propositions we provide to our clients is having a holistic conversation about how one can use etfs in their fixed income strategy and so the active etf mix is kind of harder for you to decipher but we are having broader deeper relationships with more clients in fixed income than ever before operator your next question comes from the line of robert lee of kbw robert lee kbw analyst great good morning happy new year everyone i just want to maybe going back to efront i know it s only been like seven months or eight months but can you maybe just kind of give us a sense of how you ve incorporated maybe started to monetize that and then maybe more broadly within aladdin you mean to the extent you want it to be kind of the language of portfolios do you think you now have kind of the full the full set of capabilities that you need and it s really just kind of execution or are there other aspects to the platform that you feel like you need to build out and add on to gary shedlin chief financial officer so rob i think that early stages are suggesting that everything we anticipated about the efront strategic fit with aladdin was well thought through and ultimately is going to come true again remember aladdin effectively began as more of the premier risk analytics and portfolio analytics system designed primarily to liquid as you know we spent a bunch of time thinking about attempting to build what we ve done on the liquid side for illiquid as we thought about doing efront and the reality is doing efront will accelerate that by a number of years for us i think clients have been very engaged with us in terms of thinking about getting and bringing their entire portfolio together on a single technology platform that allows them to basically bring the same expertise we ve been doing for them for years on the liquid side to their illiquid to get a complete view of the entire whole portfolio that they have from a risk and analytics perspective we ve had a strong and growing pipeline with a number of live opportunities globally we actually won our first joint client which we announced earlier in the year and our expectation is that this will that as we bring this together over the next six months to 12 months it will continue to basically reinforce our long term growth of low to mid teens for the combined technology business larry fink chairman and chief executive officer i would just add you know the language of portfolio is becoming more and more real and we re committed to that this is why we believe we have to add sustainability sleeves to aladdin to making sure that our clients and our investors at blackrock can look at sustainability as one of the key investment risk going forward what we did in factors and adding factor sleeves onto our aladdin system i think the key that we ve been doing is we are providing more content for the same value proposition and so what we continue to drive elevated content with the same fee structure and as what then happens is as the clients grow we grow with them and that has been one of the key characteristics of how we ve designed aladdin growing with our clients needs but as the clients now believe in more of the components of aladdin they re putting on more of their assets on to aladdin and so then we grow with aladdin and so the key characteristic is for us to continue to innovate to stay in front to be more additive and i m looking back now with our efront acquisition i don t even know how we were able to operate without having those sleeves now and making we ve been spending years talking about the need with our investors to have more illiquids and now we have the technology to be helping them to and this is why we believe it s additive not only for the aladdin business it is very additive for our all for our entire business operator your next question comes from the line of ken worthington of jp morgan larry fink chairman and chief executive officer good morning ken kenneth worthington jp morgan analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question to follow up on that so your annual letter the focus on climate change so as you did with aladdin and risk management are you planning or are there opportunities to leverage the expertise you re developing in sustainability to profit either by selling sustainable technology or esg strategy solutions in other words can sustainability be a new aladdin for blackrock rather than just another element of aladdin robert kapito president so following up on larry s last answer we certainly see huge opportunities in using the sustainability platform that we have for other profit centers for blackrock and to add into our aladdin value proposition so what i could see coming forward would be creating new screens that others would be interested in to screen for esg creating specific model portfolios and models that many of our distribution networks would want to use potentially creating new indices in the market as people are looking for someone to take the lead and creating an appropriate indices to pinpoint specific areas of sustainability in the future and offer new products like specific esg etfs and it s already working in that sustainable etfs for ishares were the fastest growing category in 2019 and it generated 4 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter or a total of 12 billion for the year so i can see also adding on new products which many of our clients would look for so as larry mentioned the value proposition of aladdin would grow as we incorporate our platform into the aladdin platform for other clients of aladdin to be able to use that s just the beginning of some of the ideas we ve come up with that that we can put forward in 2020 larry fink chairman and chief executive officer let me just add to that as i said yesterday in my ceo letter and the firm s client letters we believe sustainability and the issues is going to have a very large investment impact for those investors investing in investing in a long illiquid product they have to think now in 10 years if there is evidence of climate change how that will be impacting that investment that has a 10 year horizon so more than ever before we have to drive analytics to help more and more clients more and more investors understand the interconnectedness of how climate change the potential impact of climate change how does that impact every single investment we have and because of the resources of blackrock the scale of blackrock i believe more than ever before if we execute on what we intend to do and we could that s our intention if we execute we have probably one of the broadest opportunities that we ve ever had i believe we will be able to differentiate ourselves more than any other firm by providing these analytics by using them on aladdin as using them as an investment tool this can differentiate us more than every any other organization and this is a call to arms at blackrock this is probably the biggest project that we ve worked on in years that we have embraced the entire organization and i want to underline the entire organization to be more prepared to start focusing on the analytics so we have better understanding overlaying let s say imaging technology on the physical impact on the world and different elements of rising temperatures or rising water levels by having a better understanding how insurance companies are focusing on their insurance risk and looking at areas that have potential climate risk implications whether that is from fire flooding or other actions i do believe as i said in my letter the possible changes from climate risk have serious implications in other countries that have heat issues and beyond any flooding issue it could just be heat that s changing the output of their crops what does that mean for that country s gdp should we be should we honor that country s debt these are all really important things and that i don t believe the investor universe is prepared and it s the management s expectations at blackrock that we become the leader in designing better tools and helping people navigate this uncertain sustainability future pretty passionate about it operator your next question comes from the line of patrick davitt of autonomous research larry fink chairman and chief executive officer good morning patrick patrick davitt autonomous research analyst good morning guys on the 5 g a growth guide it sounds like there s kind of a lot of adjustments we should be making to 2019 to get to the base for that 5 growth could you kind of walk through everything we should be backing out specifically gary shedlin chief financial officer sure patrick i mean i think we ve been we ve tried to be pretty transparent on our definition of non core so just for a little perspective i mean if you look at the fourth quarter the fourth quarter was up about 130 million we talked about some of the seasonality in there but there was about 50 million of again what i would call non core in that case it was contingent purchase price value adjustments as well as foreign exchange remeasurement that 50 million is probably about 150 basis points of margin in the fourth quarter alone if you look at the full year we had about 164 million of what i would call non core that included 60 million plus for fund launch cost that s already adjusted out of margin but it also included a little over 50 million of these purchase price fair value adjustments which is actually as those go up it means that the businesses that we ve acquired where we have contingent payments are doing better so that s a good thing we had about 31 million of fx remeasurement and there s probably a 15 million to 20 million knocked in there for just deal fees related to things that we were doing during the year so that s kind of the numbers that we would basically think is kind of a non core and so while we think about that 5 we re trying to look at apples to apples and remember we also have a little bit of lift up from the year just generally because we have 12 months of efront relative to the eight months that we had in 2019 operator your next question comes from the line of alex blostein of goldman sachs larry fink chairman and chief executive officer good morning alex alexander blostein goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everybody so i wanted to turn discussion a little bit to pricing to gary i think at the end of last year we talked a little bit about potential kind of strategic reinvestments in some of the etf areas as you ve done in the past could you expand on that a little bit i guess which product categories do you guys think you could target here and how is your kind of tech enabled distribution could help blackrock capture aum in product categories that i guess more sensitive to price moves gary shedlin chief financial officer so alex it s really no different than the messaging we offered at your excellent conference at the end of the year i think that frankly obviously we ll react to pricing in various segments of our business but the reality is most of our strategic pricing investments are really driven towards our ishares business and i think as we said for the most part we have a number of criteria we need to meet in terms of when we will make those decisions we need to see high future growth but we need to basically see growth in particular where clients are price sensitive and if we see basically the combination of those two things we will consider basically making pricing investments since about 2016 we ve invested approximately 1 5 to 2 5 of ishares revenue annually and over that period of time ishares revenue has grown very substantially roughly by 25 and we think that in that respect as a look back that pricing investments have been good not only for clients but actually also for our shareholders by virtue of the positive npv that we ve delivered in 2019 our pricing investments were at the lower end of that range but i would expect that we would move to a more normalized pricing level of pricing investments during 2020 and obviously that s an important element of maintaining leadership within our within our ishares franchise we know that those tend to be long term sticky assets and revenue streams and we think about pricing investments no different than any other strategic investment in our company and we tend to budget them and take them into consideration as we think about making sure that we re growing or optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible there is no question that we think at the moment most of the pricing will be focused on the core and likely in certain elements of more of the core related fixed income categories but importantly i think most of the growth that we re seeing in the strategic segments that rob mentioned earlier as well as where the client simply don t focus on price as a key decision of their of their buying decision in the precision instruments and importantly in the liquidity areas those are higher fee today and those will not be a target of any of our pricing investments going forward operator your final question comes from the line of brian bedell of deutsche bank brian bedell deutsche bank analyst great thanks very much hey good morning thanks very much maybe just to hone in one more time on the fixed income ishares in terms of the so far we re seeing quarter to date or january to date about 7 billion of fixed income ishares flows about little less than 2 billion of core and about 5 billion institutional so just talk about that institutional trend which seems to be continuing is it more are you seeing it more from targeting specific allocations or are institutional managers substituting the etfs for bonds because of the tighter bid ask spreads that they re seeing in the etf and do you see that latter element being a more powerful growth driver going forward robert kapito president yeah so it s both so i think there is a lot of reallocation done and our forte because of our scale and size is to capture those institutional flows into our fixed income ishares so one is its allocations that are being done as people have their view to the value of equities and value of bonds in their portfolio and then as you know the supply and the time it takes to find fixed income and build a diversified fixed income portfolio is quite difficult and can be quite expensive this is a very quick convenient less friction way more liquid diversified way to get in so people have now substituted building those portfolios by simply going out and getting that portfolio on the exchange and it is winds up being cheaper and more effective they are also using we re seeing a lot of model changes and in the models that we have seen that are being used by institutions they are also targeting etfs and then if they want to have any sort of precision any sort of view on factors or any sort of view on particular areas of the market they are able to achieve it much quicker and faster in fixed income so we saw that at the end of the year as the market went down and now this is the time when most institutions sit down and talk about their strategy we ve seen that continue those flows into the beginning of the year so i think we re very positioned well to attract these institutional large flows operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions mr fink do you have any closing remarks larry fink chairman and chief executive officer yes thank you operator thank you everyone for joining our morning and your continued interest at blackrock i am proud of the progress we have made to lead the industry throughout 2019 and i can promise we will continue to invest we will continue to innovate in the years to come so we could be better at what we do and better to meet our clients needs and through that we will generate more growth and if we continue to fulfill our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well being we will be better positioned as an organization and to you our shareholders have a great start of the new year and enjoy the next decade thank you operator duration 62 minutes call participants christopher meade chief legal officer

biden repeated his false claim that he opposed the war in iraq from the moment the war began biden said he made a mistake in casting a 2002 vote as a senator from delaware to give president george w bush the authority to go to war in iraq but he said he cast the vote because the bush administration had said they were just going to get inspectors into iraq to check for weapons of mass destruction and that once bush actually went to war he became immediately opposed from that point on i was in the position of making the case that it was a big big mistake the facts as fact checkers have repeatedly noted biden did not oppose the war in iraq from the point it started in march 2003 he did begin calling his 2002 vote a mistake in 2005 two years into the war but he was a vocal public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004 and he made clear in 2002 and 2003 both before and after the war started that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war not only to try to get inspectors into iraq cnn s facts first team has debunked various versions of biden s claim that he opposed the war from the moment it started read longer articles on that here here and here here are a few representative biden quotes in a february 2003 speech in delaware he said let everyone here be absolutely clear i supported the resolution to go to war i am not opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from iraq i am not opposed to war to remove saddam from those weapons if it comes to that it s true that biden criticized bush s approach to diplomacy in the lead up to the war warned in the lead up to the war that bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be and he criticized bush s handling of the war from its first weeks on but biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism in a july 2003 speech at the brookings institution biden said nine months ago i voted with my colleagues to give the president of the united states of america the authority to use force and i would vote that way again today it was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today during the debate on tuesday biden also offered a confusing timeline of his positions on the war saying i said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if in fact he couldn t get inspectors into iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon it was a mistake and i acknowledged that when biden said 13 years ago he appeared to be referring to how in 2006 and 2007 he was calling his 2002 vote a mistake the vote itself was more than 17 years ago daniel dale and nate mcdermott cnn

economic growth trade tensions reduced fiscal stimulus and aerospace production cuts are the primary drivers of softer u s growth job growth will continue in 2020 but at a slower pace from 2019 due to both difficulty in finding workers and slower economic growth the unemployment rate is expected to increase slightly in the near term but the labor market will remain tight pushing wages higher and

it doesn t require a lot of digging to wonder whether the laissez faire free market mantra of the past several decades has worked out as promised stock prices and corporate profits have far outpaced wage growth in the united states lax antitrust enforcement has set the path toward enormous amounts of corporate concentration often to the detriment of american consumers inequality is a central fact of american society but if neoliberalism is failing is there a vision to replace it specifically a progressive vision coming from the left a new set of papers says yes on wednesday the progressive think tank the roosevelt institute released a pair of papers examining the shortcomings of neoliberalism and mapping out an emerging progressive worldview for what comes next laying out the left s emerging ideas on everything from taxes and government debt to antitrust policy unions and industrial policy the papers create a who s who and what s what in progressive economic thinking their overarching theory it s time to reject not only the conservative guiding principle that there is always a strict trade off between redistribution and growth but also the faith that many mainstream and moderate democrats have had for the past several decades that efficient markets needed some regulations and redistribution but can largely take care of themselves instead it s time for a broad based democratic effort for the government to shape the economy and foster the public good all of the critiques actually imply a set of real solutions so it s not just yes a lot of people see that inequality s getting worse and we have a lot of complaining about it and can identify the problems felicia wong president and ceo of the roosevelt institute told me actually what it suggests is there are a lot of policy solutions that we could actually put into practice and would not harm growth would not harm economic health in fact we would strengthen the economy and make people s everyday lives better it s a moment when there could be a shift in thinking and perhaps even policies on these issues in the us the 2020 democratic field is well to the left of the 2008 and 2016 cycles the members of the squad have introduced themselves as a cohort of high profile progressive women in congress the sunrise movement is leading the charge on climate change the roosevelt institute doesn t specifically lay out new research or concepts but instead puts progressive thinkers and institutions in conversation with one another and distills thousands of pages of research into a more digestible format the papers are fewer than 100 pages combined the result is a broad map of a potential leftward direction for government policy and enforcement and a warning against continuing with the prevailing neoliberal thinking that has in many cases become the norm or allowing the rise of right wing populism that marries anti corporate sentiment with white nationalism efficient markets for whom the first plank of the roosevelt institute s effort is an examination of neoliberalism and where it has and more prominently hasn t worked authored by mike konczal and katy milani fellows at the think tank and ariel evans executive assistant to the roosevelt institute s president and ceo the paper looks at what free market thinking was supposed to deliver and the actual results here was the promise that many mainstream policymakers over the past 50 years bought lower corporate taxes deregulation and privatization will translate to economic growth namely a higher gdp and they believed the inverse too that government intervention and overregulation will hold the economy back within the democratic party it hasn t played out as dogmatic free market libertarian thinking but rather as an approach that tempers the market in some ways some extra money for low income people environmental regulations consumer related guardrails without in the private sector s view overstepping it still gives financial markets a leading role in shaping investments and corporate decisions the idea being that the markets know best and will compete away problems and inefficiencies but a lot of research shows and many americans feel in their everyday lives that s not exactly how it s worked out profit seeking investors and corporations focused on profits above all else haven t created the type of broad based prosperity envisioned according to the paper s roundup of dozens of studies and pieces of research neoliberalism didn t necessarily promise an equitable fair society but it was supposed to deliver gdp growth and that hasn t really happened different economists may have different theories on why the economy isn t growing like it used to but looking to the markets to deliver outsize growth doesn t appear to have worked as for the other side of the coin evidence suggests that higher levels of redistribution don t have a big impact on growth at least not in extreme circumstances but the belief that redistribution comes at the cost of growth has led to an increase in inequality as the paper s authors note research from economists emmanuel saez and thomas piketty shows that the share of income of the top 1 percent grew from 8 percent of total income in 1979 to 18 percent in 2017 wage growth has slowed economic mobility rates have worsened and people who start at the bottom are not more easily able to move up lots of people are still waiting for tax cuts given to those at the top to trickle down it turns out lax antitrust enforcement doesn t increase competition and innovation just ask yourself how many options you have for internet providers in your neighborhood or the last time you had an array of good affordable options to book a flight the authors also point to the deregulation of the financial sector which has translated to growth and profits for the industry but not a better scenario for everyday americans and shareholder primacy where corporate boards prioritize maximizing shareholder returns over other stakeholders such as workers and communities has led to short termism that can sometimes hamper a focus on long term investment and growth free market thinking has fallen short when it comes to racial inclusion and equality as the theory goes unbiased employers consumers and producers get a competitive advantage by dealing with people of color and women so market competition would compete away wage gaps and wealth disparities but again that s not how it s gone recent research by leading thinkers studying racial inequality has exposed the shortcomings of this theory by analyzing data on employment income and wealth disparities for people of color at every level of education people of color experience higher rates of unemployment are paid less than their white counterparts have fewer assets than their white counterparts and accrue less wealth mapping out a new progressive view of the world the roosevelt institute examined work from more than 150 thinkers in order to distill a new progressive vision for the united states there s no one set answer but instead of a world where capital returns will always outpace wage gains the progressive worldview puts in place higher taxation it focuses on robust antitrust enforcement instead of allowing for corporate concentration puts power back into the hands of organized labor and ensures women and people of color are included this isn t just a flash in the pan this is really based on a lot of work by a lot of preeminent scholars and thinkers and policy experts wong who authored the paper outlining the positive vision for a progressive worldview said she identified the various critiques of neoliberalism that are embedded with positive progressive solutions and distilled them into four groups it s not a cohesive progressive answer but instead a set of four broad categories of answers many of which work in concert new structuralists the theory at the center of the new structuralist belief system is that government rules structure markets and a new set of rules is needed to foster more equality and widely shared prosperity a major plank of this is tied to antitrust enforcement and a government that prevents a wider range of merger types and considers a broader set of stakeholders when deciding whether to approve a deal it also entails higher taxes on the rich and corporations and measures such as a potential financial transaction tax it also puts limits on corporate governance matters such as stock buybacks the theory at the center of the new structuralist belief system is that government rules structure markets and a new set of rules is needed to foster more equality and widely shared prosperity a major plank of this is tied to antitrust

and corporations and measures such as a potential financial transaction tax it also puts limits on corporate governance matters such as stock buybacks public providers the public providers advance the idea that the government should provide essential goods and services instead of leaving it up to private actors they promote more public spending and government involvement in arenas such as child care and paid family leave as well as guaranteed health insurance broadband access and access to jobs the basic theory is that the government can be more efficient at providing certain public goods not less and that concerns about the public debt have been overblown there s a specific focus on public provisions that correct for racial and gender discrimination the public providers advance the

transformers call for a greater government role in directing the economy so that it produces better outcomes for people and the planet and also makes sure that wide swaths of the population aren t left behind amid technological change and globalization the paper points to the green new deal as a prime example of the approach a public investment led initiative that employs different policy tools to promote innovation equity jobs and decarbonization the economic transformers call for a greater government role in directing the economy so that it produces better outcomes for people and the

public investment led initiative that employs different policy tools to promote innovation equity jobs and decarbonization economic democratists implementing the types of policies being proposed in progressive circles isn t going to happen overnight or without some real electoral and institutional shifts first that s where the economic democratists come in they argue that economic reform hinges on participatory democracy where unions are strengthened communities are activated and public agencies are open and transparent at the center of the thinking among the four groups are some identifiable themes markets are structured by choices and by power whether in public or private hands and policy choices make a difference but as wong notes in the paper there are also tensions there s still a debate to be had over whether authority should be more localized or more centralized and how heavily we should lean on expertise in designing policies and making decisions the papers are meant to serve as a tool to organize the conversation and hopefully connect these big structural issues to people s everyday lives it s not just about my struggle it s not just about my attempt to find day care but we need a system that can provide these things and by the way that s possible but it s only possible if we see these problems as systematic wong said there could be a return to normalcy or an economic populism that ignores race the papers authors believe that now is a moment for the way we think about the economy to move to the left progressive sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are among the leading candidates in the 2020 polls running on ideas such as a wealth tax universal health care free public college and the green new deal but a rejection of neoliberal thinking isn t just developing on the left there s also a growing strain of it on the right it s evident in the appeal of president donald trump s calls to drain the swamp even as he s filling it it s also evidenced in freshman sen josh hawley s r mo attacks on corporate power and big tech and conservative pundit tucker carlson s assailing of the ruling class and moneyed interests many progressives acknowledge that there is some overlap with figures such as hawley and carlson in their economic thinking however they emphasize that the views of some on the far right are also aligned with white nationalism and a belief in a sort of welfare state for white people and the type of vision the left promotes is one that specifically addresses racial and gender inequality from wong s paper carlson might be a single attention seeking talk show host but nationalism based on building walls at the border racial exclusion based on beliefs about the undeserving poor and traditional views of family that keep women out of the labor market and in the home are deeply embedded in new thinking on the right and are irreconcilable with progressive values one version of the post neoliberal future is anti corporate but it s also white nationalist and racially exclusionary wong said she also warned of the risk of returning to normalcy for which in the era of trump there is a deep desire among many americans it s the difference between the type of promise former vice president joe biden makes versus sanders and warren a world where americans can return to not paying attention to what s going on in government compared to a world that necessitates mass action and pressure to implement big structural change by the progressive worldview s assessment inequality is too problematic and monopoly power too destructive to return to the efficient markets hands off approach basically the current system is vacuuming too many resources to the top so even if you re going back to normal with respect to how we do politics there is no going backward there is no normal that is going to solve our problems wong said

contingencies these statements are based on our views that u s economic growth after accelerating a few years ago has slowed since mid 2018 and is expected to slow further in 2020 slower global economic growth trade tensions reduced fiscal stimulus and aerospace production cuts are the primary drivers of softer u s growth job growth will continue in 2020 but at a slower pace from 2019 due to both difficulty in finding workers and slower economic growth the unemployment rate is expected to increase slightly in the near term but the labor market will remain tight pushing wages higher and supporting continued gains in consumer spending near term risks are generally to the downside including a further softening in the global economy a further escalation in trade tensions and geopolitical concerns but there are some upside risks as well such as a quick u s china trade deal and stronger labor force growth inflation slowed in 2019 to below the federal open market committee s fomc s 2 percent objective but is expected to gradually increase over the next two years we do not expect further federal funds rate cuts in 2020 the federal funds rate is modestly positive for near

of the u s consumer in the biggest economy in the world we continue to be well positioned here in driving market share gains and great service and capabilities this quarter is also one of transition from a period of rising rates in 2018 to one that is moving through the impact of the declining rates in the second half of 2019 how do you run a company a big bank and deal with lower rates well we drive what we can control with our internal commitment to responsible growth we drive more loans more deposits more assets under management and driving growth for the right pricing and at the right risks we also have to manage our cost base carefully while making the required investments and we have to take advantage of a strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders at bank of america we checked the box in all of these in the quarter we grew loans average loans by 6 in all lines of businesses we grew deposits by 5 with very disciplined deposit pricing our expenses were relatively flat again while we increased investments across our whole company and when doing that we earned 7 billion after tax this quarter with a return on tangible common equity of 15 and due to our strong balance sheet we returned 9 1 billion in capital to our common shareholders this quarter at the same time we deployed capital to support growth for our clients committees and teammates let s start on slide 2 i m referring to the full year results excluding our third quarter 19 joint venture impairment charge we generated 29 billion net income in 2019 a record for our company that was 3 better than the prior year s results we were also able to reduce shares by 9 driving earnings per share up by 12 for 2019 these results were driven by execution on all the pillars of responsible growth we grew by serving our clients well and improved our market share across the board we remain disciplined in our risk and our client selection framework and by the way our results are more sustainable as our focus on operational excellence led to a 58 efficiency ratio in 2019 while making the investments we need to make our return on equity was 11 for the year and our return on tangible common equity was 15 8 for the year record earnings allowed us to invest in our client capabilities invest in our people and invest in our communities all while holding the expenses in check take a look at slide 3 you can see the investments we made across all our constituencies and at the same time we delivered strong returns for our shareholders to deliver for our clients we continued our investment in talent in 2019 we grew the company by 3 600 teammates overall we hired 32 000 teammates in 2019 including 6 300 new employees from low and moderate income neighborhoods 4 000 college and mba graduates and we also completed our five year goal to hire 10 000 military veterans into our company we completed more than 3 billion in new technology code initiatives last year betting on years of investments and award winning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates to be more efficient most importantly these investments are bearing fruit as you can see in our customer usage numbers that paul will talk about just a simple example we surpassed 10 million clients using erica our industry leading consumer ai agent we introduced erica about 18 months ago and now it s starting to reap the scale benefits erica is an example of billions of dollars of scaled innovation fueled by our work on operational excellence these savings generated by operational excellence also enables to make capital investments in our company of 1 7 billion during 2019 for newer modernized facilities and other related priorities and in the past three years we ve built 207 new financial centers and modernized more than 1 300 for our employees we will start at 20 per hour minimum starting pay beginning in march the costs saw all these enhancements incorporated in our run rate of expenses providing the capacity to keep investing in the future without increasing expenses also for 2019 for the third consecutive year we shared our financial success with our teammates with special compensation awards to approximately 95 of them three years of special compensation awards totaled over 1 6 billion in compensation addition to all other bonuses and merit and everything else allowing our teammates to do more with their families last year we also delivered more than 5 billion of community development and financing for affordable housing another important local priority who made more than 250 million of philanthropic contribution to help drive economic mobility including workforce training and development and many other local priorities where we help to make a difference we also completed our 10 year 125 billion environmental business initiative goal in 2019 we made that commitment four years ago and it was a 10 year commitment and we completed six years early that s why this year we set a new goal of 300 billion environmental initiatives across the next decade it was a strong year for our company and our team capping our first decade but here at bank of america we have a saying nice start we know we can do so much more in the future so on slide 4 i want to talk about the line of business results the team s hard work has created a strong improvement in earnings across the board in the lines of business dean athanasia and the consumer team generated an impressive 13 billion in after tax earnings in our consumer and small business group by driving responsible growth they continue to provide real value for clients through innovative products and services while driving improvements and upgraded facilities entering new markets and driving innovation consumers record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way andy sieg and katy knox together run our global wealth and investment management businesses they drove net new household growth in 2019 and more integration across those businesses with the rest of the franchise merrill lynch alone brought in more than 40 000 net new affluent households during 2019 margins in that business remain near the record levels we generated 1 billion plus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of 2019 and topped this quarter 3 trillion in client balances for the first time tom montag and his team across global banking global markets franchises are running one of the biggest commercial lending business in the world and were the top market making investment banking platforms this powerful combination of global banking global markets generated 11 6 billion in after tax net income this year the team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became the more important partners for many of the world s largest clients with a renewed focus our investment banking team had gained some of the lost market share from a couple of years ago and paul will give you those numbers later matthew koder and team have done a great job in doing this in addition that team across the board continues to drive innovation our global services platform paul is going to show you some of those capabilities in the slides later all these business accomplishments across all these businesses while driving relatively flat costs let s move to trends on slide 5 our strong balance sheet and stronger earnings have driven the corresponding strong increase in our return of capital we have now dropped below 9 billion shares outstanding 9 1 billion shares on a fully diluted basis as shown here on the left side of the page in total we reduced the share count by nearly 2 5 billion shares from its peak a few years ago as we look into 2020 paul will give you some specific guidance on the company s view of what we see at our outlook but for more general guidance our research team our award winning research team sees more generally the u s gdp growth at just below 2 and a global gdp growth just above 3 we at bank of america are seeing our consumer business a substantial amount of activity in our consumer business we see that our customers are coming off a strong finish in 2019 in their spending activity in addition there is good loan demand this results from good employment levels and growing wages at bank of america spending by our consumers grew at 5 9 over 3 trillion in spending from 2019 over 2018 we saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year but that moderated in the second half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about have been dragged on today we see some resolution to those issues and that combined with continued consumer strides leads us to expect to see businesses continue their solid activity and we re hearing more optimism all of this provides a great backdrop to drive responsible growth and continue to deliver for you with that i ll turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer thanks brian good morning everyone you can see the summary of our q4 results on slide 6 and i m going to begin on slide 7 in the fourth quarter we reported 7 billion in net income and 0 74 in eps eps increased 6 from q4 18 reflecting modestly lower earnings more than offset by a 9 reduction in average diluted shares returns remained strong in q4 but the return on assets of 113 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 15 well above the company s cost of capital our results were driven by our team s focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining market share in an economy that grew at a low single digit pace in q4 we again stayed focused on what we can control client activity remained solid allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower short term rates over the past three quarters we also continue to see healthy consumer trends in spending and asset quality lastly we experienced a nice rebound in ficc trading from a more negative environment a year ago so having set the stage let s turn to the detail starting with the balance sheet on slide 8 overall compared to the end of q3 the balance sheet was relatively flat at 2 4 trillion as growth of both loans and securities was modestly offset by lower global market assets deposits grew 42 billion and were first deployed to fund 11 billion of loan growth with most of the excess funding the growth in debt securities liquidity improved as the average global liquidity sources benefited from deposit growth shareholders equity declined 4 billion driven mostly by the return of excess capital in q4 we returned 9 1 billion in capital through net share repurchases and dividends which exceeded the 7 billion earned oci declined by roughly 1 billion notable book value per share of 27 32 has improved 9 from q4 18 with respect to regulatory metrics we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements driven by the excess driven by the return of the excess capital i just reviewed our cet1 standardized ratio decreased to 11 2 but remained well above our 9 5 minimum requirement our risk weighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and increased global banking exposures lastly our tlac ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements looking at how client activity impacted average balances let s start with deposits on slide 9 average deposits grew 65 billion or 5 year over year for 4 5 years now we have grown deposits on a year over year basis every quarter by more than 40 billion consumer banking deposits grew 33 billion or 5 as we believe customers value the convenience of our financial centers and atm networks leading online and mobile capabilities and our unique preferred reward program but much of this growth continues to be led by checking balances which we consider to be the core operational deposits of these customers wealth management deposits grew 8 billion or 3 year over year global banking deposits grew 19 billion or 5 year over year and reflected both our strong gts platform and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years looking at average loans on slide 10 we see pretty consistent client activity overall average loans of 974 billion were up more than 4 year over year more importantly average loans in our lines of business grew 54 billion or 6 year over year as consumer loans grew 7 and commercial loans grew 6 as you can see in the bottom right hand chart we continue to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible growth commercial loan growth was broad based loans to middle market clients grew 10 but i would note the more stable linked quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower we also saw growth in lending to small businesses growing 7 and within consumer we saw strong growth of residential mortgages i would also note the stability of credit card balances which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional balances as we continue to prioritize sustainable long term profitability turning to slide 11 and net interest income on a gaap non fte basis in q4 nii was 12 1 billion 12 3 billion on an fte basis and was relatively flat compared to q3 19 the benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across short term rates of a linked quarter 47 basis point decline in the average fed funds rate and while long term rates were up modestly on a spot basis on average for the quarter there was little change for the full year of 2019 gaap nii of 48 9 billion was up 1 despite lower short term rates this is consistent with the perspective we had conveyed to you since the middle of the year we remained disciplined with respect to deposit pricing in q4 the rate paid on total interest bearing deposits of 61 basis points declined 15 basis points in consumer banking which accounts for more than half of our 1 4 trillion of deposits customer pricing remained relatively unchanged on the other hand in global banking and wealth management the decline from q3 and the rate paid on interest bearing deposits was more in line with the 38 basis point drop in average one month libor looking forward as we move into 2020 let me start by saying our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment i e flat rates relative to the end of the year given those assumptions we expect nii in q1 to be lower than q4 as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things first with respect to q1 we will have one less day of interest second we expect lower loan yields to be more fully reflected from the late october fed rate cut third reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields despite fractionally higher long end rates moving to q2 we typically experience seasonally lower nii for two reasons first we typically see higher interest expense from funding increased seasonal global markets client activity in equities the benefit of this activity shows up in non interest income instead of interest income second we also typically see lower average card balances as clients pay down their holiday balances both of these seasonal patterns have historically led to lower nii in q2 compared to q1 so we would expect nii in the first two quarters of 2020 to be a bit lower than q4 19 from there we would expect nii to rise modestly in the second half of the year driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth turning to slide 12 and quarterly expenses over the past two years at 13 2 billion this quarter expenses were 1 higher than q4 18 as increased investments throughout 2019 in people real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles we have been operating in a tight range for more than two years now with quarterly expense in the low 13 billion range and all but one quarter if you adjust for the 3q 19 impairment so annually we ve been able to maintain a 53 billion expense base despite increased investments in tech infrastructure buildings people philanthropy and the other costs that brian mentioned in the opening of the call with respect to headcount year over year savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals as our lobs added nearly 4 000 associates over the past 12 months with respect to outlook our expectations for expense in 2020 haven t really changed from where we provided it in 2016 despite all the added costs of the higher investments and unknowns like brexit and others since 2016 we expect our full year expense to be in the low 53 billion range this year and as long as client activity and the economic environment remains stable our investment plans will likely remain unchanged having said that i want to provide you with a few reminders with respect to expenses first q1 is expected to include about 400 million of seasonally elevated personnel costs related to payroll taxes with the remaining quarters of 2020 expected to return to a low 13 billion range also beginning in q3 the accounting for the bams jv is expected to change following its dissolution at that time we will separately record revenue and expense from merchant servicing operations rather than reflecting our share of the joint venture earnings as a single amount in other income this will gross up both expenses and revenue with little bottom line impact and like we told you in q3 it s not included in our forward guidance we will update you as we move closer to that timeframe all right turning to asset quality on slide 13 our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years now and asset quality trends reflect this even in this relatively benign credit environment total net charge offs in q4 were 959 million compared to 811 million in q3 when comparing to q3 remember we sold in q3 we sold some loans in q3 that resulted in recoveries totaling 198 million that reduced net charge offs adjusting for those recoveries net charge offs declined 50 million and the net charge off ratio declined 3 basis points to 39 basis points compared to q4 18 net charge offs were modestly higher driven primarily by seasoning of the card portfolio provision expense was 941 million and mostly mass net charge offs with only modest releases in both q4 19 and q4 18 on slide 14 we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios these metrics show you that asset quality remained strong in both categories before turning to the business segments i will just provide a couple of perspectives on cecl our day one implementation resulted in a 3 3 billion increase in allowance this is in line with the last update we gave you all else equal this would lower our cet1 ratio by roughly 20 basis points but as you know it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through 2023 okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide 15 consumer banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second half of 2019 net income of 3 1 billion declined 10 as revenue fell 4 as you know we have been renovating and adding financial centers adding sales professionals and advancing digital capabilities plus we increased our minimum wage in 2019 and will again in q1 despite the cost of increased investments we have been able to hold expenses relatively flat and our efficiency ratio was 47 away from the impact of rates which we can t control client momentum continued as we saw healthy spending borrowing and savings by clients as a result year over year average deposits increased by 33 billion up 5 to 720 billion while maintaining strong pricing discipline client investments increased 54 billion up 29 year over year to 240 billion driven primarily by the market but we also saw 20 billion of client flows and our total net accounts grew 7 loans were up a healthy 7 driven by home loans debit and credit spending by our customers was up 6 year over year consistent with a record holiday season and asset quality in this segment remained strong with a net charge off ratio of 118 basis points down modestly from last year turning to slide 16 i will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits loans and investments all of which i touched upon earlier this level of activity continues to drive the acknowledgments and rankings in the upper left and this is a short list of the more than 60 industry awards consumer and digital banking received in 2019 turning to slide 17 digital banking continue to drive growth in client engagement as we continue to invest heavily in this channel as a strong complement to our financial centers and atm network together they allowed our customers to bank with us anywhere anytime and anyway they want over 56 of our clients are now digitally active and logged in 8 1 billion times this year that s up 9 year over year digital channels generated 27 of overall sales 34 of mortgages and 56 of client direct auto loans originated through our mobile app or online banking site the digital mortgage experience itself originated 11 billion in loans in 2019 as we continue to add capabilities such as the ability to transfer heloc balances on a mobile device and with respect to mobile car shopping we closed the year with the ability to provide clients access to roughly 2 million cars from our participating dealer inventories our market share with zelle payments continued to increase this year as well we now have 9 7 million zelle users and they sent and received 300 million transfers this year totaling over 78 billion erica surpassed 10 million total users and completed nearly 100 million requests since its launch with 38 penetration of active bac mobile users 27 of total deposits are now coming from mobile and over 50 of our clients have gone completely paperless enhancing our efficiency and their experience and customers increased their use of our mobile banking app to make appointments with 2 3 million digital appointments scheduled in 2019 up 19 year over year our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever and we believe industry leading turning to global wealth and investment management on slide 18 strong results were led by growth across aum loans and deposits as well as good market conditions in the quarter but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates record level client balances topped 3 trillion and our full year pre tax margin was 29 with 256 billion in deposits this segment would rank stand alone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the u s so when rates fall feels it but much of the impact of foreign rates was offset by advisory fees generated from our industry leading wealth management platform net income was just over 1 billion down 4 from q4 18 reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a non core asset which also impacted the revenue comparisons excluding the prior year gain revenue was flat and earnings grew 3 asset management fees grew 5 year over year due to higher market valuations and the fees from aum flows which more than offset general pricing pressures and lower transactional revenue expenses decreased slightly as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs digital engagement with affluent clients continue to increase in importance as 64 of merrill clients are actively using our mobile or online platform and that statistic increased to more than 75 for the private our private bank clients moving to slide 19 gwim activity reflects the confidence clients place in bank of america and its advisors at both merrill and the private bank as brian mentioned household growth has been strong as merrill added more than 40 000 net new households this year and we added 60 more private bank relationships in 2019 than we did in 2018 on the bottom right note the 427 billion increase in client balances in q4 18 383 billion of that increase reflected strong market conditions increasing the value of assets 44 billion of the increase is from client flows aum flows accounted for 25 billion while brokerage flows contributed 6 billion banking product flows were driven by loans of 12 billion which doubled from 2018 and deposit flows were modestly negative as clients shifted cash back into investments during the year following the 4q 18 equity market declines average deposits rose 3 turning to global banking on slide 20 the business earned 2 billion and generated a 20 return on allocated capital in the quarter an 8 decline in net income was driven by lower nii and higher investments costs which outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing our client coverage as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services these investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come as new bankers deepen existing relationships and add new ones looking at trends on slide 21 and comparing to q4 last year throughout the year we continue to add investment bankers both in the u s and internationally with a focus on expanding our client coverage this benefited nii fees with q4 fees of nearly 1 5 billion up 9 year over year despite excuse me double digit increases in both debt and equity underwriting fees led the year over year improvement bank of america was involved in seven of the top 10 debt deals and six of the top 10 equity deals in the quarter based upon dealogic data this performance drove a 50 basis point improvement in market share for the full year turning to slide 22 one of the reasons for the growth in deposits and global banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page switching to global markets on slide 23 as i usually do i will talk about results excluding dva global markets produced 639 million of earnings year over year revenue was up 10 from both higher sales and trading results and improved investment banking fees expenses were up a more modest 2 year over year within revenue sales and trading improved 13 year over year driven by fixed income currency and commodities with a more risk on environment when compared to q4 last year ficc was up 25 from q4 14 while equities declined modestly ficc revenue showed improved results across most products but was particularly strong in mortgage products the muted performance in equities was driven by lower client activities and derivatives which was partially offset by our financing business where we have focused some investments on slide 24 you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered within ficc revenue mix remained weighted toward credit products and importantly please note on the bottom left at roughly 13 billion the consistency of our sales and trading revenue over the past six years in the face of declining fee pools it is particularly noteworthy considering the risk reduction note at the bottom right this goes against the perception that these revenues are generally considered to be more variable finally turning to slide 25 we show all other which reported a profit of 262 million comparing against q3 19 is tough because that period included the 2 1 billion pre tax impairment charge on our bank of america merchant services joint venture but there are two things worth noting as i close out first other income at the total company level this quarter included tax advantaged investment partnership losses that were about 200 million higher when you compare to q3 the benefits of this activity shows up in global banking in our global banking business and are produced by client activity related to tax advantaged solar and wind investments these investments generate good returns however the partnership losses which reduce non interest income and the tax benefit in our tax line from these investments are not always realized in the same quarter depending upon the type of investment the second thing i want to mention is the effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately 14 it included the impact of higher tax credits from the increased tax advantaged investments and it also included roughly 300 million in discrete benefits from the resolution of several tax matters absent the discrete benefits in the quarter our q4 19 tax rate would have been roughly 18 and absent any unusual items this is roughly where we expect the etr for full year 2020 to be so thanks and with that we will open it up to q a questions and answers operator we ll take our first question today from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john mcdonald autonomous research analyst hi good morning paul wanted to ask on the nii outlook when you put together your your commentary about the quarters year over year does that imply flat to down a little bit maybe on the nii in terms of your outlook against flat rates paul m donofrio chief financial officer yeah year over year modestly i would say john mcdonald autonomous research analyst down modestly paul m donofrio chief financial officer yes john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then how are you feeling i guess if we think about positive operating leverage for this year you mentioned the stability and expenses while you continue to invest how are you feeling on fee income growth when you wrap it all together the prospects for positive operating leverage into 2020 paul m donofrio chief financial officer so obviously we talked about in the prepared remarks the transition that we re going to with the in the rate environment i would just remind everybody we had 18 consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage and admittedly it s a little bit more difficult to achieve operating leverage given the decline in interest rates last year and the associated impact on nii as i said though assuming a more stable rate environment we would expect nii to return to growth in the second half of 2020 driven by loan and deposit growth and remember nii is not directly linked to expenses the way other revenue is in for example investment banking sales and trading wealth management we run and invest in the company for the long term sustainability and for growth and by the way these investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage so having said all that we re not blind to changes in the operating environment but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics we are focused on the things that we can control like driving client activity deposits loans investments efficiency improvements we are focused on operational excellence so if things change we ll adjust but currently we feel our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the near term john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay fair enough thank you operator we ll take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore analyst thank you i have a follow up question on your comments on the promo balances in cards and your pullback there and i m curious if that is a function of pricing getting tougher there terms getting tougher there or is that your just responsible thought process 11 years into a recovery paul m donofrio chief financial officer i think it s more a reflection of responsible growth and how we run how we re focused on the customer and how we re focused on total revenue and not necessarily nii or fees when you look at card balances they certainly reflect a couple of items that we talked about and it certainly reflects our focus more on profitability first we ve been reevaluating some relationship prospects who are just looking to gain rewards or take a short term take short term advantage of promo balances so clearly that s affected balances a little bit also with less promo balances the percentage of the portfolio paying off each month has risen a bit i think what you see though as you look at our risk adjusted margin that s up 25 basis points year over year to 8 7 if you adjust out the 4q gains we had last year and we continue to add more than million cards each month again with a focus on profitability of new accounts so i think that line is going to start to grow from here brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer i think glenn just to be with paul s lost point production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow so we had 1 million plus new cardholders we still have a lot of room to go from a two thirds type of penetration of customer base and then how many people use it as a primary card so we really focus a lot on that and while we re focused on that generating new customers who are surfing is not exactly the strategy so it s a mix of profitability but also really sticking to that core holistic customer strategy glenn schorr evercore analyst appreciate that just one more maybe on gwim so market s up a lot and more people going fee based offset lower rates and you talked about that so we ve been hanging in this 28 to 30 range which is great but the question i have is is can as scale continues to build in all the investments that you ve made there can we see margins start to tick up a little bit above there i know we are constrained by the payouts and things like that just curious the bigger picture over the next couple of years brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer yes so think about it in two dimensions one inside the wealth management business is a very large bank so if rates stable here from here then the loan to deposit growth which have been strong will then pick up that and that s very leveraged to the margin contribute to the margin that s one point so you know you are going through the same twist in that business and with the 75 basis point drop in rates in this very late part of last few months of 2019 so that s no different than many other situations so that will mitigate and go forward if you think about the the other side of the question which is sort of can you get it higher you ve got the basic thing the way that the compensation system runs from a way of presentation is you ve got 30 of revenue round numbers goes into the compensation so you re basically making 0 30 on other 0 50 and profit margin which is a pretty strong margin so it has all the opportunities along the dimensions which is set of things that we ve got to go after which is if you think about the merrill edge assets growing in the megi portfolio which is over 4 billion and growing 30 50 a year type of things as they grow and the products are available to andy s whole team of fas that provides additional efficiency and then you think about the digitization of that customer base in both private bank and wealth in merrill lynch which is the least penetrated of all the customer base in terms of digital statements and things like that we can drive the margins that way then the physical plant we continue to increase the density of the physical plant with other physical plant in various cities and towns consolidating offices and getting people in a common space that saves money so there is a lot of way we can work on digitization physical plant efficiency adding more financial advisors to have more scale in contributing the overhead which then generates more margin so that s you re working it s pretty good to make 60 of your margin after comp and we re not changing the comp system but there s a lot of things forward and i think we can continue to improve them it would appear to be easier if in fact rates stay stable and drive loan growth which is what our projection is and if rates start rising again it will we will look like heroes in terms of margin but we ve been able to sustain it even in a falling rate environment glenn schorr evercore analyst thank you operator our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good morning so i wanted to ask a follow up on fee income so the nii resiliency has been quite impressive loan deposit account growth as you noted paul and brian continues to track very well the core fee growth was a bit softer this past year declined modestly despite some of the strong market tailwinds i know brian in the past you haven t given explicit guidance on core fee growth expectations but you did note that it should traject in line with gdp and just given some of the moderating u s and global gdp growth expectations you cited earlier just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer i think each category if you think about the broad categories where most of them come through the strategy in the consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decade plus on penalty fees and things like that we kind of hit status quo on that in other words we brought it down significantly from reg e and all that stuff is kind of done the interchange in the consumer fee areas the card income stuff that s through the system at this point the rewards impact that but you get the benefit back in a preferred reward system through the ability to have that stable margin so i think we should see those fees which have we ve gotten to a point where they ought to grow marginally but remember that part of the strategy is to invest in our client base loyalty to our company and our products and so there ll be modest because of the nii growth think about 8 growth in checking balances year over year in consumer that is helped driven by people consolidating a relationship with you what you pay back to the reward system through the card usage so it s always going to be there when you go to wealth management you tell me what the market is going to do and you ll see that it will be heavily influenced there that should grow faster as you know trading as paul said isn t as volatile as people want it to discuss it but it on the other hand there s compression on the fee side so each line items has a different element treasury services revenue is up i think high single digits but the fee line piece of it s flattish that s because people are paying us through balances so i think that steven a guy like me who has been around banks for a long time the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue so got to get revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses grow below that by couple hundred basis points and we ve been able to do that and as this twist in rates ends this quarter you ll see us get back on track as we move through 2020 steven chubak wolfe research analyst thanks for that color brian and maybe just a follow up for you paul you ve been retaining a substantial percentage of mortgage loans on balance sheet in lieu of selling those loans you re deploying that excess liquidity into mbs and i m just wondering as we prepare for cecl does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path and just separately just given the strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet was sort of hoping you guys could be cecl pioneers and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance in terms of day two provision impacts or expectations paul m donofrio chief financial officer well in your first point we are originating mortgages and putting 94 of them i think this quarter on the balance sheet that will continue to trend that we ve been doing for many many quarters now we ll see how that develops over the long term but for now that s our plan clearly we consider the effect on liquidity we consider the effect on capital balancing returning capital with growing the balance sheet those loans don t really have a high amount of cecl impact but i m not saying we re going to never change what we re doing there in terms of cecl i think we ve given you the guidance that we re comfortable with we would expect provision to be a little higher than net charge offs in 2020 and due to cecl we ve been running when you back everything out we ve been running net charge offs at approximately 1 billion a quarter we don t see that changing much in the future and when you just factor cecl into that it means that our provision s going to have to be a little bit higher than net charge offs brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer you always have to remember that the not on the last part but on the first part at the end of day the reason why we have securities and mortgage backed securities and treasuries is simple when you re doing 60 billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grew by 10 billion or whatever 10 billion or 20 billion the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and you re raising this money in all in costs in the 40 basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board and a lot of it s coming in non interest you re not going to turn down that good customer activity and we don t take credit risk in that part of the portfolio because we take enough credit risk around the rest of the company and so the strategy on the investment side mortgage backeds equipped with treasuries and think that as just excess liquidity on mortgages paul told you that we ve been putting on the balance sheet because they re better yielding than mortgage backed securities and frankly our credit risk is better than the mortgage backed securities availability so why would we pay for somebody else for taking that risk steven chubak wolfe research analyst fair enough and i appreciate you guys taking the day two plunge as well operator we ll take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer good morning betsy betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst brian 10 years of excellent management here driving the bus on improving operating leverage especially over the past three four years can you give us a sense as to how you see the rate of change go from here because we ve had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side and the question i get from people is is it over and by the way how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets given the skew to producers and is there that much opportunity in the back office side so maybe if you could hit on those that would be helpful thanks brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer so let me paraphrase a little bit but it s it s a delectation to be able to run this company with all the power and have the honor doing it for decades so we just passed a decade with the team and they ve done a great job but what you point out as they ve done a great job of putting the position so if you look at the operating efficiency of the consumer business or the wealth management business or the banking business which we show separately from the markets business so you can see these are 38 40 efficiency ratios here 45 here it s how can you improve and betsey what i d say is we just don t know how far this digitization of the actual processes and work goes in the company and we just keep coming up we had 6 000 simplified improved ideas over the last few years we ve implemented they continue to produce great savings and so we just don t see an end of that and so leave aside that the economy is growing at sub 2 level predictive to 20 leave aside that the rate environment is low we ve been able to push forward the activities that can produce more efficiency and we think that there is a lot ahead of us and so i d like to we d say nice start to our team saying thanks for all the hard work you ve done but also we re only getting started here and if you start thinking about we just passed the number of checking accounts that we had in 2007 in this company this quarter and so we ran off all the non primary accounts but on our primary accounts the average balance of 7 000 if you think about the cost of deposits and consumer i think it went down by 4 basis points year over year something like that so it s a grind and it s a lot of hard work but the incremental efficiency that we can get at this scale by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out of activity which costs more another example is checks written since zelle became really pushed out there about two years ago has started dropping 10 per year so five years ago we had almost 1 billion checks written by consumers and now we re down to 600 million each one of those checks is a piece of paper that requires processing time and you re seeing that drop by 10 a year is that going to change overnight where they re gone absolutely not but on the other hand it s constant positive operating pressure benefit for us so look for us to improve it across the board your colleague earlier asked about the wealth management business we think we have upside there andy and katy and the teams are working on it there is lot of process simplification that we ve worked on hard but there s a lot ahead of us and then you get the markets business the electronification effect will make it more and more efficient over time like we ve seen in equities as you know though that s a market price business so that you always fighting the revenue changes at the same time and in fact if you look at most of this from four five years ago we actually had the same amount of trading profits we had then we just turned it into this quarter 600 million of profit generally 1 billion of profit when it s getting a little bit better in the earlier quarters and the activity is higher that s a good business it s just you re fighting both sides of equation so look for us to improve everything there is room to improve tremendous scale advantages the new markets opening up provide extra lift and it s our job to do it and the team is excited too betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay good forward look there paul on the longer term paul maybe i could just be a little bit nearer term with a question for you i think you mentioned a couple of times that nii expectation for 2020 being down modestly from 2019 for your full year but then you talked a little bit about a better second half than first half and maybe you could give us a little bit more detail on the granularity why you expect that to be the case i assume it s with the forward curve and flattish rates but i know you some color earlier on but maybe give a little sense more of like what s behind that conviction level that year on year you get some improvement in the back half paul m donofrio chief financial officer i think it s look it s about loan and deposit growth and its about deposit pricing discipline on deposit pricing we planned some modest reductions in deposit pricing assuming no further cuts as we continue to bring deposit pricing to an appropriate level given the three cuts that we ve experienced if the forward curve materializes and we get another short end cut we expect deposit rate paid for the industry and for us to decline even further as higher pass through products in wealth management global banking react relatively quickly to any rate cut so it s about the confidence we have and how we price our products and the confidence we have in growing deposits and growing loans the guidance is more about we have an one less day in q1 we ve got to deal with we have the second quarter normal activity that we see in equities which again that s a plus that just shows up in non interest income instead of interest income and by the time you get to the third quarter we would expect assuming the current sort of economic environment we would expect our loan and deposit growth the lack of that seasonality the deposit pricing to have an effect and we ll start growing again brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer i d just add to that your question and john s question go the same direction which is you ve got this quarter and the first couple of quarters because of the dynamics paul just described that you have to push through but what we see is getting back on as we move into the middle of 2020 we re back on that basic operating leverage through nii stability to growth and expense flatness so but it just takes a lot to get underneath 75 basis point rate cut in four months betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay that s helpful thank you operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good morning guys maybe i could just follow up on that last question in a different way is your expectation that the net interest margin should start to stabilize in the back half of the year is that what gives you the confidence in the nii growth or is it really do we still should expect maybe a grind down of nims but the balance sheet growth starts to takeover how do we think about when in the current rate environment the sort of net interest margin assuming mix is unchanged obviously it s a big assumption but do we assume that nim starts to stabilize in the second half of this year paul m donofrio chief financial officer i think that s what you ve correct you correctly summarized succinctly what we said james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay so maybe i get another question so just on the deposit brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer we will award you a bonus question for that one james mitchell buckingham research analyst just on the deposit growth the industry we ve seen some acceleration in 4q we have lower short term rates we have the fed balance sheet expansion there tends to be some seasonality in 4q how do we do you think this acceleration can continue into the at least the first half of this year i guess how do you think about the deposit growth and if there if we could see continued sort of above mid single digit growth paul m donofrio chief financial officer i think if you look at page 9 when you have rate movement due to the types of things that are reestablish the reserve levels by the federal reserve etc etc etc that s going to affect the lower our markets business in the lower right hand and banking stuff like that but it really doesn t have that much of an impact in the the wealth management and the consumer banking area and that s really what drives the value so for the 700 billion odd dollars in the consumer business which grew checking at 8 year over year and that s fairly consistent with what they ve been doing remember that its 11 basis point all in including the interest bearing part of which also grew year over year so that 700 million a year in total interest expense for 700 million of deposits that s what drives the economics in wealth management global banking also but and so that isn t really affected by all the sort of broad macroeconomic variables that s just us doing a great job with consumers the great customer satisfaction great product capabilities high touch high tech and then generating more and more checking accounts where the average balance per checking account is 7 000 plus and growing and that s what s going to drive it so i d say you re absolutely right there can be momentary things that would enhance deposit growth in some of the pure institutional businesses but it doesn t make much difference to the general us consumer james mitchell buckingham research analyst okay that s helpful thanks operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo analyst hi brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer hi mike mike mayo wells fargo analyst the simple question is what is the dollar amount of tech spending and investment spending in 2019 and how does that compare to last year and this coming one and the backdrop to that question is the efficient you ve gotten a lot of questions on efficiency on this call and it was worse in the fourth quarter and your 58 efficiency for the year is not where some other banks are targeting like 55 now we know that you re spending a lot of money we can see slide 3 you ve pointed out that the spending is paying off so if you could just put a wrapper around the spending and put a number to it then we as analysts can figure out ok a more core efficiency level if you would brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer so one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people or 58 for the year but remember that we have a lot more wealth management at 30 or 28 29 profit pre tax margin i e 71 percent efficiency ratio than anybody else does that changes that answer relative to some of our core banking peers it s just a bigger bigger number because we have the biggest business for 3 trillion in assets making 1 billion a quarter after tax at the best margins but it s just the sheer math so when you look at it by business unit by business unit our efficiency is the tops in the class just our mix is different so i ll let you figure that out mike but back to your tech spend we spent 3 2 billion or 3 billion in 18 the same in 19 we have it scheduled to be the same this year it s just this constant level of spending now its different products obviously every year that s pure technology initiatives you put that on top of the backbone and everything and the number of people could talk about be higher but that is just to drive new products and capabilities and through the system and we aren t changing that because that s what s driving that ability to keep expenses flat if you look across the chart paul showed you when you see 17 18 and 19 in the expenses per quarter running 13 1 billion 13 3 billion etc think about how much we ve done in there in terms of hundreds of new branches 1 300 or so complete redos new buildings for our teammates in wealth management etc etc and so that those are tremendous investment levels that are all in the run rate while we re chopping away and that s coming from the operational excellence so we re spending that much on technology but the question isn t spend mike it s are you getting the usage out of it and that s where you got to look at things like the usage of zelle which we re going to 80 90 a year the use of the cash per mobile which grew over 100 a year the usage what i talked about in checks written coming down even i talked about that we have 4 300 branches but in there we ve actually opened up to new markets over the last couple of years 15 branches to 20 branches etc and continue to do that so the efficiency in the rest of markets funds that even though your numbers of branches are relatively flattish so we re coming down slightly so it s a complex set of things but hopefully that gives you some color mike mayo wells fargo analyst yeah i guess i ll try one more time in terms of your check number like you are expanding to new markets you are opening new branches you are hiring new associates how much does this investing increase the growth rate of expenses brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer it s 3 3 billion so it s in the run rate and last year and it will be the like amount this year so could you take half of that out you could it d just be not the right thing to do for the company but it s paid for by the other the cost takeout that supports or the mix in how the customer uses which provides efficiencies so more than 50 of our auto loans are originated digitally today i think we did something like billion or 5 billion of mortgage originations so its we re reaping the benefits of it mike three years hence is the investments we made in 17 as you go into 20 are produced for example digital audit did not exist and now you are getting 58 just think how much more efficient that processes is digital mortgage mike mayo wells fargo analyst let me just try one more and then one more time like this tax spend to run the bank change the bank i assume you re spending more to change the bank today versus three or four years ago and you that mix goes more toward change the bank what are and where do you think they are headed brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer yeah the 3 billion plus obviously with brexit behind us with by the regulatory environment rules behind us in terms of implementing the ccar and the capital rules and then lot of modeling and you re still spending money improving that data to make those models work that s gone the only thing that works against that is so yes if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives the mobile banking feature functionality it s higher in 2020 than it was in 19 than it was in 18 largely around this issue that you are running off some of these long term projects which is good mike mayo wells fargo analyst all right thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer good morning gerard gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst good morning brian how are you brian can you remind us you touched on in some of your comments already about the number of checks that were processed five years ago versus today when you move it from the paper to the digital can you share remind us what the cost savings are when you do that per unit brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer so that was kind of checks written by our customers which is this good point because that stops the thing before it starts but it basically if you look at deposit which i think is what you re referring to gerard we are now more mobile than we are at the branches and have been for about five quarters and then the atms are still half the mobile is a little over like 27 or something like that and branches are the rest so if you think about that that is 5 in physical movement 0 50 and 0 05 0 50 0 050 at the atm 0 05 round numbers gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst great and then moving on with credit can you guys give us any color i mean credit is strong across the board for almost all the banks and are you guys keeping an eye on any particular sectors within your portfolio and then as part of that question we sensed from some of your peers that have reported that the corporates or commercial customers seem to be maybe a little more optimistic in the fourth quarter because of some of these trade issues if you could comment on that if you re seeing that in your customer base as well brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer i ll take the second half and i will let paul yes you are seeing with the leave aside what happens day to day but generally companies are seeing the resolutions emerge for some of these issues that makes some a little bit more confidence in terms of our activities we ll hopefully see that in the first half of this year if nothing goes backwards at the market being up obviously gives people a good feeling but one of the thing you have to think about is in the first part of 19 you are your inventory decline recession as people would call it that went through the system so you ve entered a new place so you come down you hit a bottom and then you start to grow out from there we re kind of in that transition phase so i think the combination of the external environment getting the deal today with china obviously as a resolution one of the issues that was over people s minds there are other u s mca everybody says it s going to be past i think if that capacity would be very helpful to people the fact that people have done what they needed to do it was during the year 19 change of supply chains and think about it that s disruptive without endpoint value the customer so to speak and it s like us with brexit we spent 400 million plus money of the customers didn t get better services out of it we just had to create more entities and get them up and running those things are sort of through the system so i think that what you re feeling is a little bit of a relief on the other side of that work which was being done and worry which is being done without a lot of activity and so even capital expenditures which grew grew at a much slower rate off the high in 2018 you re starting experts say will stabilize and kind of come out from there and on credit paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer sure so on credit i d start by saying that we are always running through the portfolio routinely analyzing various sectors bringing it to senior management discussing it so we ve got a real great process for always looking for some risks that are on the horizon as you know we ve been running the company with strong underwriting standards for years now you see that in our ccar results so i mean i hesitate to sort of pick one sector or another because because we notice stuff out in the marketplace but it may not affect us directly given how we ve run the company for years now but if you re looking for some sectors that we re paying attention to not that we think we re overly concerned about them given how we ve managed the company but we re certainly paying attention to leverage loan market leverage lending we re certainly paying attention to energy with respect to natural gas prices we are certainly looking at retail with respect to enclosed malls we ve got our eye on always have our eye on spots around the world that maybe experiencing a little disruption so that s how i d answer that question gerard cassidy rbc capital markets analyst very good thank you operator we ll now go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin jefferies analyst hey thanks good morning just a question on the balance sheet and capital so you re at 11 2 cet1 your stated target has been around 10 we re still waiting for the scb finalization two questions so one any anticipated changes to where you think your capital goal might be depending on what we get and then secondly have you gotten a point where you would might rethink the mix between your dividend payout which is lower than peers and the buyback in terms of the mix thanks paul m donofrio chief financial officer i mean i ll start on i guess buffers and you can and brian you might want to pick up on the dividends or buybacks but look today as you point out we have a meaningful cushion so it s really not an issue for us right now in terms of what our ultimate buffer is going to be when we don t have as much of a cushion we haven t really talked about that publicly because we don t think it makes sense today to prejudge what a buffer needs to be given the size of the current question and given as you mentioned regulations scb other things are still changing and lots of things can affect that buffer when we get there so but i would just emphasize we have a sizable buffer right now brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer in terms of dividend versus buyback yes we will keep increasing the dividend as we move up to sort of the 30 level and earnings payout we ve been clear about that and then the rest will go into reducing the share count and if you look at the page we showed you earlier part of the issue was the share count was a lot higher than people expected sort of in the 2009 timeframe after the merrill transaction so we re pushing that back down and we think that s a good use of our capital we don t need the capital to fund the loan growth and deposit growth you re seeing us able to do that through continuing to fine tune the balance sheet and so expect us to move the dividend up consistent with what we ve done before assuming ccar approval and all that good stuff but it s the idea is we will keep it we will keep it at a level that allows us to use the share buyback to help drive the eps growth and you saw the benefits of that year over year in an environment where the rate movements made earnings flatten in the second half of the year what you saw was eps year over year was up double digits because we can retire the shares and so we think that s the best thing to do for the shareholders ken usdin jefferies analyst understood thank you guys operator we ll take our next question from matt o connor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt o connor deutsche bank analyst hi guys i was just wondering if you could talk about the pace of loan growth that you re expecting for 2020 maybe both kind of within the business lines and then net from the drive for run off and then maybe the drivers of growth and if that s changing at all versus what it has been the last kind of 6 12 months obviously commercial for the industry has slowed maybe that s temporary so just talk about the pace and the drivers of loan growth this year thanks brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer sure so look growth in our business segments should continue to be kind of mid single digits as you know we grew 6 this quarter both consumer and gwim grew at 7 driven by increased residential mortgage activity global banking grew 6 year over year and that was driven by large corporates middle market companies leasing activity and solid growth in international regions so pretty broad based we anticipate solid growth in consumer loans assuming the current economic environment as well as the sort of pull through of applications through the mortgage application through the pipeline with respect to card we ve already talked a little bit about that we expect that we can start growing card over time here with respect to residential mortgages originations were strong this quarter they were up significantly so that s going to translate to solid q1 growth however you have to remember that that s going be partially offset by continued run off of the non core portfolio we expect our growth to be up modestly year over year we expect solid growth in small business and remember in all these categories that i m talking about we remain focused on prime and super prime and on commercial loans our outlook remains favorable again growth year over year should be in sort of mid single digits so that s matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay then netting out the kind of mid single digit growth in the business segments with the run off do you think you kind of stay in the space of 4 growth that you saw this quarter assuming the macro holds paul m donofrio chief financial officer yeah if you look at the run off chart on the loan page there in right hand corner you see that we basically have gotten really to the point where that s now natural run off will there won t be any sales of major impacts for purposes that we were doing before to we continue to move loans on which we weren t getting any income on because of their status in terms of restructuring and things like that out and cleaning the portfolio up so that s just smaller so i think that helps the overall nominal growth for the company brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer it s going to be 1 5 billion 2 billion a quarter matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay so it might be 1 5 billion or 2 billion of loan sales but nothing major that s what you are saying brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer no no not loan sales the run off is running at about 1 5 billion 2 billion per quarter paul m donofrio chief financial officer of just natural paydowns in those mortgages and matt o connor deutsche bank analyst got it okay that s helpful thank you operator we ll take our last question today from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead your line is open saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning guys so forgive me for beating a dead horse on the efficiency ratio question but i guess i ll ask it in a slightly different way i mean you guys are out about 57 58 even with tier 1 being a big part of the overall mix revenue mix but if we assume that revenue growth gets back to say gdp growth over time is there any reason why you couldn t reduce your efficiency ratio below say the mid 50s percent range into the low 50s given some of the opportunities you talked about brian and just secular trends toward digitization electronification of payments which obviously reduce to this unit costs pretty materially it doesn t seem like there is an obvious reason why you couldn t continue to drive that down pretty materially even from here brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer that s what we re doing if we keep expenses flat and the basis if the revenue grows 80 billion plus that s 200 basis points of operating leverage and that will keep producing the efficiency ratio by definition so you re stating what our job is and we ve been able to do it and we ll continue to saul martinez ubs analyst okay so there is no obvious is there any point at which or any obvious point at which it becomes just much more difficult or is there is the glidepath from here is just it seems like there is nothing really to prevent you from doing that for a while brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer we ll let you know when we think we can t do it anymore but we don t see it saul martinez ubs analyst okay got it all right thanks a lot operator we have no further questions at this time it is now my pleasure to turn the call back to brian moynihan for any closing remarks brian moynihan chairman of the board chief executive officer well thank you all of you for your attention on the call we finished another strong year in 2019 for the team and they did a great job growing the earnings doing it the right way making the investments across the franchise as we say it s a nice start we ll continue to focus on responsible growth we ve got a lot of room to run in this company every business had good client activity the loan deposit underlying customer growth at the size and scale this institution tremendous work by our teammates and all that helped us provide stable performance with a rate cut that came through relatively late in the year so we feel good about that and we feel good about working through the other side of it as paul described earlier we are focused on the costs as many of you asked about but we re focused on continuing to develop and implement products and services which meet the markets needs and continue to help us grow our market share across every business at the rate we re doing it which we think is an opportunity which is ours to continue to take thank you operator duration 80 minutes call participants lee

it took just three days of 2020 for optimistic financial markets to run into harsh reality says the financial times equities had made impressive gains in 2019 with the us s p 500 index rising by more than a quarter and britain s ftse 100 climbing by 12 investors were looking forward to more but america s assassination of qasem soleimani a key iranian general prompted a reassessment of risk and sent investors scurrying into safe haven assets after iran s retaliatory strike on us airbases in iraq on wednesday there were growing fears that a series of tit for tat strikes could spin out of control ultimately causing a war between washington and tehran oil prices rose 4 following the us attack eclipsing 70 per barrel on monday before falling back a 1 5 bounce which also soon subsided followed iran s retaliation at 70 73 brent crude rose to its highest level since september when a drone attack on a major saudi oil facility at abqaiq temporarily knocked out 5 of global supply yet that spike proved short lived and prices are still below their 2019 high of 74 5 per barrel so what will happen this time will oil hit 150 a barrel middle eastern turbulence would endanger at least a quarter of the world s 100 million barrels per day of oil production says avi salzman in barron s saudi arabia and iraq the region s two biggest producers pump about 15 million barrels per day between

could see oil prices leap by 20 per barrel the doom mongers are right to worry says caroline bain of capital economics previous episodes of oil supply disruption which include the 1970s oil embargo the 1990 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 2011 arab spring show that prices can quickly double or triple in response to serious geopolitical shocks prolonged tensions in the strait of hormuz could see the price of brent double leading it towards an eye watering 150 per barrel such a spike would wreak economic havoc the 1970s oil shock tipped the world into recession and triggered a bout of inflation that took nearly eight years to tame says russ mould of aj bell oil shocks act like a tax increase reducing purchasing power and choking off demand on six of the last eight occasions when oil prices have risen by more than 100 year on year the global economy has slowed or even shrunk if the iranians blockade the strait of hormuz then we are in trouble agrees jeremy warner in the sunday telegraph surging oil prices would tip the world economy into recession the oil market has changed the latest oil price surge looks like a rather 1970s reaction paul donovan of ubs global wealth management told the guardian s jill ambrose but it is perhaps not appropriate for 2020 given the weak global growth outlook and structural oversupply oil cartel opec used to produce half the world s oil but now makes less than a third of it alan gelder of wood mackenzie told nell mackenzie on the bbc during the 1990 gulf war oil came from two places opec states or expensive and risky fields in places such as the north sea yet the fracking revolution means that finding hydrocarbons and getting them out of the ground has never been easier particularly in north america when prices jump the frackers are happy to start pumping that keeps a lid on prices globally there is a glut of oil and so has the world economy greater energy efficiency also means that western economies are less dependent on fuel than in the past notes robin pagnamenta for the daily telegraph in the 1970s energy accounted for 8 of us household consumption today that figure is just 2 5 that should reduce the economic impact of petrol price spikes the post soleimani oil price surge was a knee jerk response conditioned by decades of headlines about middle eastern oil says spencer jakab in the wall street journal it is not a given that a regional conflagration would mean higher prices in 2020 iranian retaliation in the form of cyber or terror attacks could actually reduce energy demand by hitting the global travel industry sanctions on iranian oil exports also mean that tehran has little to gain from surging prices most importantly these days the us is a net exporter of crude oil leaving the world s indispensable economy less exposed to an oil price shock than in the past a combination of central bank monetary easing and calmer us china trade relations had convinced many traders that 2020 would be a good year yet the worsening us iran picture has pushed geopolitical risk back up the list of things to worry about in 2020 says michael pearce of capital economics the trump factor donald trump s decision not to respond to september s abqaiq attack meant that analysts thought they had the measure of the white house s middle east strategy says the ft his unexpected decision to kill soleimani is a reminder that the mercurial us president remains one of the biggest unknowns for investors the strike on the general calls for a serious increase of the geopolitical risk premium says olivier jakob of consultancy petromatrix clearer heads may yet prevail says tom holland of gavekal research for all the blood curdling rhetoric pouring out of washington and tehran the odds of an all out shooting war are still small fearful of becoming embroiled in another middle eastern quagmire the white house regards the assassination of soleimani as an extension of its existing strategy of squeezing iranian regional influence not a prelude to outright conflict for its part tehran knows that it would surely lose a full scale war with the us and its regional allies in short both sides have powerful incentives to avoid open conflict and minimise further escalation note that tehran s retaliation so far has been moderate in the context of the blood curdling threats we heard shortly after the us strike markets are right to price in an elevated risk premium in the wake of soleimani s death yet the magnitude and persistence of that premium is likely to prove limited expect oil prices to remain capped below 75 per barrel for the time being is russia a safe haven from the turmoil russia decried the killing of soleimani but moscow could prove a key winner from the fallout says robyn dixon in the washington post higher oil prices would be a boon for the country s energy sector russia is the world s second biggest oil exporter and the top exporter of natural gas bad news for oil consumers is good news for emerging market producers such as russia says lex in the financial times the country is already something of a comeback kid among emerging markets the stockmarket rose by 39 last year stocks in energy companies which make up over half of the market s capitalisation delivered double digit returns in 2019 but valuations remain cheap ubs is forecasting a hefty 14 dividend yield from energy firm lukoil that said concern about climate change is feeding a growing aversion to energy firms among portfolio managers that should continue to keep a lid on energy stock prices russia has agreed to curb its oil output by about 300 000 barrels per day from an october 2018 baseline as part of a joint effort with opec nations to prop up oil prices say dina khrennikova and jake rudnitsky on bloomberg yet the country overshot its quota in nine of the 12 months last year drawing complaints from allies indeed russian crude oil and condensate output actually hit a post soviet high last year if russia scraps the opec deal altogether it could unleash spare production capacity of as much as 500 000 barrels per day onto the market on a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio of 7 8 the russian market is among the world s cheapest major indices but with good reason the country s poor record on property rights and the rule of law means that assets are at constant risk of expropriation if a company s management upsets the wrong people russia rarely looks like a safe haven as lex puts it but with us missiles streaking across middle eastern skies perhaps this is one of those times golden days for gold these are golden days for gold writes arthur sullivan for deutsche welle renewed global uncertainty helped the yellow metal to a seven year high this week in dollar terms with the

while macroeconomic factors also bode well for the yellow metal says elliot smith on cnbc persistently negative interest rates on major government bonds have reduced the opportunity cost of holding gold an asset that also pays no income the price is also likely to be supported by ongoing central bank purchases as the likes of turkey russia and china look to reduce their reliance on the us dollar

over the past two years washington has unilaterally and repeatedly imposed tariffs and otherwise pressured china based on a fundamental accusation that china practices state capitalism or statism the 2016 report to congress by the u s china economic and security review commission said that china had been pursuing a series of industrial policies to help its domestic companies gain an unfair advantage over their foreign competitors in the overseas market dennis shea the u s ambassador to the world trade organization said in 2018 that china s economic model is trade disruptive other washington élites blame china for mercantilism some assert that the chinese government controls all its key economic entities through public ownership the accusations are not based on hard facts but on interpretations or fabrication such misinterpretations of the chinese economic system are extremely misleading and destructive private sector accounts for 60 percent of chinese economy the chinese constitution stipulates that the country s economic system is owned by all the people but private enterprises exist as well in fact private ownership accounts for the largest share of gdp 60 percent that s considerably higher than the state owned sector s 34 percent china depends on the private sector for 50 percent of total tax revenue 65 percent of new patents 75 percent of technology innovation 80 percent of new products and 90 percent of job creation one can only imagine what a catastrophe it would be for the whole economy if the government exercised exclusive control over leconomic entities through public ownership supporting the state owned enterprises to the exclusion of the private sector would mean that china could lose major tax revenues most of its new technology and new jobs in fact the private sector has been consistently supported by the government during the eight years from 2010 to 2018 the industrial asset value of soes increased by 77 6 percent while that of the private sector increased by 104 8 percent guangdong zhejiang and jiangsu provinces have experienced much faster economic growth than northeast china precisely because of the robust private sector nor can subsidies to soes drive chinese export growth in 2018 soes accounted for only 10 3 percent of chinese exports of goods while 48 7 percent came from the private sector and 41 7 percent came from foreign invested enterprises if the government were to subsidize soes alone to help 10 percent of the country s exports it would beyond any doubt create an unfair competitive advantage over the other 90 percent of exporters if true such a policy helping the 10 percent at the expense of the 90 percent must be hidden from public knowledge somehow no that s not how it works the state owned economy is does not equate to estate capitalism rather it is a logical part of the overall national economy in many countries the world bank reports that the share of the state owned is 72 percent in norway 68 percent in sweden 56 percent in finland 54 percent in luxembourg and 52 percent in iceland all far higher than in china among the leading western economies france has a state owned economy representing 31 percent of its total only slightly lower than china the key entities in france s nuclear energy high speed railway and electricity industries are all state owned the us postal service is also state owned so the question is not ownership but the rule of law in other words enterprises whatever their ownership must operate and compete on a strict basis of equal compliance with the law as such they receive equal protection core principle behind industrial policy is non discrimination the washington elites make a big fuss about china s industrial policy and government support for enterprises as a fatal problem in china s economic system in fact it is a common practice in many countries including the u s the united states was among the pioneers in industrial policy and has implemented many more industrial policies than what has been announced officially those policies include support of technology innovation government procurement tax credits tariff rebates interest rate subsidies and other things in august 2011 president barak obama signed into law the u s manufacturing advancement act which provides preferential tax rates for business to under 25 percent with a total volume of tax cuts of up to 4 6 billion it also provides tax credits for research and development institutions increases in federal government spending in r d export credit supports and import tariff cuts on relevant materials and intermediate goods in june the white house science and technology office announced the strategic plan of artificial intelligence research and development in the united states envisioning billions of dollars of support through federal agencies the website of the u s department of energy announced in early january 20 million in appropriations for development of materials for use in extreme environment related to power generation it also announced 25 million for 16 projects to improve natural gas operations 20 million to develop feedback monitoring and carbon storage technology and 55 million for electric aviation technology programs the world investment report 2018 by the un s conference on trade and development shows that over the past 10 years at least 101 economies representing 90 percent of total global gdp have announced official industrial development strategies to cope with the opportunities and challenges of the new industrial revolution in conclusion it is a common international practice that national governments make and implement industrial policies to support new technologies necessary government support reflects responsibility and does not violate wto rules the core principle found in the wto rules system is non discrimination that is all government support policies and measures should be transparent and equally applicable to both domestic and foreign companies the support should be directed to basic research and technology development and overseas sales should be carried out equal footing with the host country s own companies no need for china to pursue mercantilism mercantilism is a recurring label washington uses in describing china s approach the elites are quite sure that china is threatening american industries and jobs with an export led strategy and heavy subsidies again this is unfounded the core of mercantilism is the description of precious metals or ores as the only real wealth if unable to acquire adequate wealth at home a country must get it from abroad through trade surpluses this makes no sense for china but home products and services not just precious metals or ores also represent real wealth china has no need to obtain wealth through trade surpluses the assertion that china is an export led economy seems valid at first glance but in fact it s an incorrect conclusion according to the world bank china s gdp share of goods and services exported was 19 5 percent in 2018 much lower than the world average of 30 1 percent and far below germany s 47 4 percent canada s 32 1 percent france s 31 3 percent and the united kingdom s 30 1 percent no one would think of india as an export led economy but its share was 19 7 percent only slightly higher than china in fact goods exports represents a small share of china s total output in 2018 chinese exports of goods amounted to 2 5 trillion or 18 3 percent of gdp this ratio is highly misleading taken generally as the part of gdp that is exported in fact it is a parameter not a share export volume measures the gross value of goods while gdp measures added value let s assume that all chinese goods exports are industrial goods in 2018 the added value of industrial production was 30 52 trillion yuan 4 4 trillion converting to gross output value it was 127 88 trillion yuan a ratio of 1 to 4 19 in shanghai as a reference for the country total export delivery in that year was 12 39 trillion yuan or only 9 7 percent of total gross industrial output another key supposition about china by washington is that it boosts exports by artificially depreciating the yuan however empirical study leads to a different conclusion over the past few years exchange rate changes have had little linkage to chinese export performance in 2015 the yuan fell by 1 1 percent against the dollar chinese exports that year fell by 2 9 percent in 2016 the yuan s fall against the dollar accelerated to 5 9 percent this did not help chinese exports which fell even more sharply at 7 7 percent hence the fall of the yuan failed to boost export in 2018 the scenario played out in reverse the yuan rose by 2 6 percent to the dollar and chinese exports increased even faster by 9 9 percent therefore the rise of the yuan did not check the export increase based on actual performance there is apparently no need for chinese government to artificially depreciate the yuan without doubt the chinese economic system has its imperfections and thus needs further reforms to ensure the open transparent and equal treatment of all businesses be they soes or private or foreign companies while upholding the multilateral trading system with the wto at the core the chinese government is working in this direction with the new foreign investment law having taken effect on jan 1 for years china has been open to constructive help from the governmental business and academic sectors of the united states however the irresponsible subjective misinterpretation of the chinese economic system will only lead to wrongheaded policy and harm bilateral trade relations
the us china trade deal is like watching a live show in the theatre of the absurd the trump administration revealed a detail that nobody expected just before the signature of the phase one trade deal today the tariff cuts will not take effect before the us election in november this means that the us tariffs will continue weighing on chinese exports for almost an additional year while the emerging market giant will certainly be asked to deliver on its promise to buy massive amounts of us farm goods and manufactured products immediately the risk here is that the double standard agreement could provide a weak basis for the future negotiations impair the benefits or even spoil the deal us equity futures and treasury yields slipped gold and the japanese yen gained as latest news raised a few eyebrows the swiss franc remained muted ftse 0 18 and dax 0 30 futures are set for a negative start to the session following a mixed sentiment on tuesday wti crude consolidated near the 58 a barrel as tensions between us and iran left its place to renewed trade concerns with china the only highlight of the day was jp morgan posting a solid 21 profit in the fourth quarter thanks to an impressive fixed income trading revenue jp morgan advanced to 140 a share in new york financials in wall street gave a boost to the dow jones index bank of america and goldman sachs will post their q4 earnings today in the fx the euro rebounded from 1 1104 against the us dollar ahead of the german annual gdp release expected to have retreated from 1 5 to 0 6 in 2019 the european industrial production on the other hand may have improved to 0 3 month on month in november versus 0 5 posted a month earlier cable advanced above the 1 30 mark it seems that this level is a magnet for the buy side despite soft economic data and a significant dovish shift in the bank of england s boe policy stance due today the inflation data will likely confirm that british consumer prices have stagnated near a three year low of 1 5 in december soft data could give a stronger case for a boe rate cut in the coming months therefore the pound s advance against the us dollar could remain limited following a soft inflation figure speaking of inflation the headline inflation in the us advanced from 2 1 to 2 3 year on year in december versus 2 4 expected by analysts higher gasoline and energy prices were the root cause of faster price inflation last month while the core inflation excluding food and energy prices remained under control at 2 3 not low enough to give the fed a blank check to pull its rates lower yet not alarmingly high to call for a tighter monetary policy either

2018 we finished the year with a return on tangible common equity of 12 1 just ahead of our 12 target for the year this is 120 basis points higher than our 2018 return on tangible common equity of 10 9 in constant dollars our 2019 underlying revenues increased by 4 in both global consumer banking and our institutional clients group good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise pre tax earnings were up 5 we also had loan and deposit growth for the year and for the 16th consecutive quarter our return on assets rose to 98 basis points for the year our strong finish to 2019 was a result of balanced performance of both across both products and geographies both north america and international consumer banking had 4 year over year revenue growth in the us branded cards revenues continued to grow at a healthy clip with a 10 increase for the quarter bringing the full year increase to 8 we continued to attract digital deposits from both existing and new customers bringing the total to 6 billion for the year better sentiment helped increase our wealth management revenues in asia and our cards business contributed to growth in mexico investor sentiment also positively impacted our institutional business for the fourth quarter fixed income was up nearly 50 from a tough final quarter of 2018 equities didn t perform as well mainly due to weakness in derivatives we continued to gain share in investment banking and the private bank posted good revenue growth of 6 treasury and trade solutions continued to grow despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients we ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11 7 and we re on track to deliver our investor day commitment of returning more than 60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three ccar cycles having returned over 22 billion in 2019 alone our dividend creates a very respectable yield for our common shareholders and we reduced our shares outstanding by 11 during the year our tangible book value per share increased to over 70 a 10 increase for the year i m very proud of our firm s performance as we did in 2018 we hit our return target for the year despite an uncertain environment which saw trade disputes rising geopolitical tensions and still no finality regarding brexit as we told you entering the year we prepared for multiple scenarios and used multiple levers to manage the firm through the uncertainty and deliver a solid year for our shareholders we enter 2020 in a strong competitive position from capital and liquidity to talent and technology we continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for client led growth and in our infrastructure in light of the enduring need to be an indisputably strong and stable institution we re looking forward to sharing with you how we ll take our firm forward over the next several years with that in mind we will hold our next investor day on may 13th the environment has changed meaningfully since our 2017 investor day and we ll lay out what we aspire to this year and beyond now let me turn it over to mark and then we d be happy to answer your questions mark mark mason chief financial officer thank you mike and good morning everyone starting on slide three net income of 5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18 from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate eps grew 34 including the impact of a 10 reduction in average diluted shares outstanding as we ve continued to buy back shares throughout the year consistent with our capital plan revenues of 18 4 billion grew 7 from the prior year driven by higher non interest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer as well as our accrual businesses in icg along with a rebound in markets expenses increased 6 year over year reflecting higher compensation and volume related expenses along with continued investments in the franchise partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer as well as volume growth and a few episodic downgrades in icg while overall credit quality remained stable our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12 better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items the discrete tax items equate to a benefit of 0 25 per share this quarter excluding this benefit our tax rate would have been roughly 22 in constant dollars end of period loans grew 2 year over year to 699 billion as 3 growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets and deposits grew 6 with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises on slide four we show our full year results looking at 2019 our progress was broad based with revenue growth positive operating leverage and operating margin expansion across both our consumer and institutional businesses revenues were up 4 on an underlying basis excluding the impact of fx as well as the 150 million gain on the sale of the hilton portfolio and the 250 million gain on the asset management business in mexico in 2018 in global consumer banking we generated 4 revenue growth across all three regions in icg revenues also grew 4 with continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as growth in our market sensitive businesses and even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise we maintained expense discipline delivering roughly flat expenses for the year in line with our outlook credit quality remained broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pre tax earnings grew by 5 eps grew by 21 and we generated an rotce of 12 1 ahead of our target for the full year turning now to the businesses slide five shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars the consumer business showed continued momentum in the fourth quarter for the quarter revenues grew 4 with contributions from all regions while expenses were down 1 driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings and looking at full year results in consumer excluding both gains in 2018 we also generated 4 revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat resulting in 9 growth in operating margin and 13 growth in pre tax earnings slide six shows the results for north america consumer banking in more detail fourth quarter revenues of 5 3 billion were up 4 from last year we have continued to make meaningful progress against our strategy to create a more integrated client centric relationship model launching new value propositions across cards and retail banking and continuing to enhance our digital capabilities in 2019 we introduced the rewards card digital lending products flex loan and flex pay new digital checking and savings accounts and relationship offers for both cards and deposits and in digital we enhanced our account opening and servicing capabilities for example streamlining the digital account opening process which has roughly doubled our application submission rate these actions are resonating with our clients driving deeper relationships and better growth in deposits aums and loans and while most of the new offerings we ve introduced in 2019 have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs this year we will be expanding our reach and the breadth of our customer base with both existing and new partners for example we are expanding our partnership with american airlines to include deposit products and we recently announced a new partnership with google to attract clients digitally importantly we are building these capabilities in a scalable manner with the ability to expand to other partners efficiently turning now to the results of the individual businesses branded cards revenues of 2 4 billion grew 10 year over year client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7 and average loan growth improved to 4 while our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans expanded to 921 basis points this quarter in retail banking our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up 7 with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels and our aums were up 20 or 8 excluding market movements reflecting strong engagement from our citigold clients we saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales bringing our full year total to roughly 6 billion versus the 1 billion we raised in 2018 and our experience to date gives us confidence in our ability to drive toward national scale in retail as we deepen relationships over time however retail banking revenues of 1 1 billion were down 4 year over year as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads finally retail services revenues of 1 7 billion were up 1 year over year with continued growth in loans and purchase sales across the majority of the portfolio total expenses for north america consumer were down 4 year over year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses turning to credit net credit losses grew by 10 year over year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios our full year ncl rate in us branded cards and retail services were 319 basis points and 513 basis points respectively looking ahead we expect ncl rates in 2020 to be at or slightly above the high end of our outlook range of 300 basis points to 325 basis points for branded cards and 500 basis points to 525 basis points for retail services and i d also note that we typically see higher ncl rates in the first half relative to the second half of the year reflecting normal seasonality on slide seven we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars fourth quarter revenues of 3 2 billion grew 4 in latin america consumer revenues grew 6 including a few small episodic gains loan and deposit growth was muted in mexico again this quarter as we are seeing lower levels of client demand in the current environment of decelerating gdp growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes but importantly we delivered strong year over year ebit growth again this quarter turning to asia consumer revenues grew 4 in the fourth quarter we continued to see strong growth in our wealth management drivers in asia with 10 growth in citigold clients and 9 growth in net new money versus last year in total operating expenses for international consumer banking increased 3 in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit was down 6 driven primarily by mexico slide eight shows global consumer credit trends in more detail as a reminder this quarter we realigned our commercial banking business with all commercial banking activities including those previously reported as part of gcb now reported in icg the consumer credit trends on slide eight reflect this change in north america and asia this shift resulted in only a slight increase in the reported ncl rates however it did have a larger impact on reported ncl rates in latin america given the relative size of the commercial business there which had structurally lower ncl rates and represented roughly one third of the gcb loan book overall credit trends remained favorable again this quarter turning now to the institutional clients group on slide nine revenues of 9 4 billion were up 10 in the fourth quarter reflecting continued momentum in the accrual businesses as well as strong performance in both investment banking and fixed income markets partially offset by softness in equity markets total banking revenues of 5 5 billion were up 3 treasury trade solutions revenues of 2 6 billion were up 2 as reported and 3 in constant dollars as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates we continued to see robust underlying business drivers in tts reflecting growth with new clients as well as the deepening of relationships with our existing clients including 10 growth in average deposits as well as double digit growth in our cross border payment flows this quarter investment banking revenues of 1 4 billion were up 6 from last year outperforming the market wallet reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting particularly investment grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs private bank revenues of 847 million were up 6 driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients partially offset by spread compression and corporate lending revenues of 732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio total markets and security services revenues of 3 9 billion were up 28 from last year fixed income revenues were up 49 largely reflecting a recovery from the fourth quarter 2018 coupled with strong performance particularly in rates and spread products equities revenues were down 23 primarily reflecting a more challenging environment in equity derivatives and finally in securities services revenues were down 1 on a reported basis but largely unchanged in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients were offset by lower spreads total operating expenses of 5 4 billion increased 8 year over year driven by higher compensation related expenses and legal costs and credit costs increased to 246 million reflecting overall volume growth as well as a few episodic downgrades while overall portfolio quality remained strong and on a full year basis credit cost of 563 million were consistent with what we would expect annually given the size as well as the quality of our portfolio for full year 2019 our net income grew 3 on the combination of revenue growth positive operating leverage continued credit discipline and a lower tax rate on a constant dollar basis full year revenue growth was 4 from a client perspective our revenue growth was largely driven by continued strong engagement with our corporate clients across tts and investment banking as well as both fixed income and equity markets and looking at our results from a product perspective we generated over half our revenues in banking which grew 3 as reported and 5 in constant dollars on continued momentum in tts investment banking and the private bank security services revenues were largely unchanged on a reported basis but grew 4 in constant dollars as we continue to acquire new clients as well as deepen existing client relationship and in fixed income revenues grew 10 with strong contribution from both rates and currencies as well as spread products the combined solid performance in these businesses helped to more than offset weakness in equities and deliver positive operating leverage for the year and finally while our cost of credit was higher it was in line with our outlook for 2019 reflecting a normalization in credit trends and credit quality remained strong with roughly 10 basis points of losses for the year slide 10 shows the results for corporate other revenues of 542 million increased 8 from last year reflecting gains on investments partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets expenses increased 34 reflecting higher infrastructure costs partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets and the pre tax loss was 80 million this quarter roughly in line with our prior outlook looking ahead for 2020 we would expect a quarterly pre tax loss of roughly 250 million in corporate other as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates as well as a reduced level of gains slide 11 shows our net interest revenue split between our markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding markets on the top of the slide as you can see we delivered 3 growth in net interest revenue or roughly 1 4 billion year over year in constant dollars in 2019 in line with the high end of our latest outlook mainly reflecting strength in north america branded cards and tts looking at results for the quarter we saw a rebound in markets net interest revenues both year over year and sequentially while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates and net interest margin increased by 7 basis points sequentially also driven by the higher markets net interest revenue and turning to non interest revenue for total citigroup this quarter we generated strong year over year growth in non interest revenue of roughly 1 2 billion the strong end to the year allowed us to deliver nearly 650 million of growth in non interest revenue on a full year basis or 2 above our original forecast for roughly flat so if you look at our total revenues for full year 2019 we realized 2 growth on a reported basis and 4 on an underlying basis with a balanced contribution from both nir and non nir revenues looking ahead to 2020 we do expect to deliver some growth in net interest revenues this year despite the change in the direction of rates as loan growth and mix become the primary drivers and we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver continued growth and non interest revenues this year driven by continued fee growth across both our consumer and institutional businesses so in aggregate for total citigroup we expect to generate modest year over year revenue growth in 2020 on a reported basis on slide 12 we show our key capital metrics in the fourth quarter our tangible book value per share increased 10 year over year to 70 39 driven by net income and lower share count and our cet1 capital ratio increased sequentially to 11 7 driven by a decline in risk weighted assets in summary we made good progress in 2019 with broad based revenue growth positive operating leverage earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders we improved our rotce by over 100 basis points achieving a full year rotce of 12 1 ahead of our target of 12 for the year we drove 2 revenue growth with a balanced contribution from both our consumer and institutional businesses on the expense side we were able to hold expenses flat while making significant investments in the franchise as productivity savings continued to meaningfully outpace our incremental investments as well as offset volume related expenses we maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio while maintaining loss rates within our medium term expectations across every business and region on the tax rate we continued to work to better position the firm post tax reform and we delivered on our capital optimization goals returning over 22 billion of capital through share buybacks and dividends during the year importantly we continued to deepen and broaden our client relationships in order to drive sustainable client led growth and a steady improvement in returns our results in 2019 give us confidence in 2020 and we are committed to delivering continued progress going forward for 2020 we expect to deliver modest top line growth and roughly flat expenses while continuing to manage the franchise responsibly we expect cost of credit to remain manageable and we expect our effective tax rate to be around 22 in 2020 excluding any discrete tax items as mike mentioned the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates slower global growth and the pressure we ve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking in an environment similar to the one we are operating in today we expect to deliver an rotce in the range of 12 to 13 for 2020 so we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our investor day in may with that mike and i are happy to take any questions questions and answers operator the first question will come from john mcdonald with autonomous please go ahead john mcdonald autonomous research analyst good morning mark wanted to ask you about deposit growth it seemed like it accelerated throughout the year you re kind of doing that 2 billion per quarter it seems like toward the end of the year is that a pace you think you can keep up with the new initiatives on deposit growth mark mason chief financial officer so we ve seen good deposit growth as you said through the year in both our consumer business as well as on the institutional side and that in many ways i think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy we re continuing to focus on value propositions on the consumer side in order to grow with our card customers and outside of our retail banking markets we just launched the high yield checking account and we ll continue to develop new products such as with our partner in american airlines and those types of initiatives we expect to continue to fuel continued growth on the deposit side in consumer we ve also as i said seen good momentum on the institutional side we expect that growth to continue and that s an important metric as we think about how we continue to increase our engagement with clients and so yes we do expect to see continued growth in deposits operator the next question is from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr evercore isi analyst hi how are you good morning so i m curious branded cards is doing well up 10 when you look at retail services up 1 i m curious if you could talk about the compare and contrast of what s driving one to have better growth i don t know if there were any partnership or repricing so lost partners along the way thanks mark mason chief financial officer sure so on the branded card side you ve heard us say through the course of the year we ve continued to see good traction with our clients there we ve seen purchase sales up 7 and you ve seen continued growth in loans and on the branded side so 1 growth in quarter one 2 growth in quarter two 3 growth in quarter three 4 in quarter four so good good momentum there a good pace of increase in the average interest earning balances and so that has been a big part and contributor to that 10 growth that you referenced and sizable growth for the full year as well on a retail services side as you know there are multiple portfolios that make up retail services and we ve seen good momentum in a good number of those portfolios but within that obviously is sears which is a partner of ours and that the results that we have do reflect the impact from sears that said we ve delivered on the 1 we ve talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and i think it s 2 for the full year we would expect to see continued pressure from the sears portion of the portfolio particularly on the purchase sales and that said it is still a very profitable portfolio for us we are still very engaged with the customers there and some 80 of the spend is outside of those stores and so profitable good returning but some pressure given everything going on with that partner glenn schorr evercore isi analyst in particular the store closures mark mason chief financial officer yes and very important partner but a lot going on there operator the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak wolfe research analyst hey good afternoon mark mason chief financial officer good afternoon steven chubak wolfe research analyst so mark wanted to start off with a question just on some of the rotce guidance certainly commendable you guys delivered on the 12 this year that said i believe it does include about a 50 basis point benefit from discrete tax item and so as i think about the core rate it s maybe somewhere in the zone of 11 6 and i m just thinking as we try to unpack the walk to that 12 to 13 you spoke of and the fact that you do have provision likely trending higher in 2020 and assuming no further benefit on the tax side just help us think through what are some of the key drivers to help us get to that 12 to 13 mark mason chief financial officer sure so look i think it s if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top line growth underlying and good ebit performance we expect that top line growth to continue particularly as we continue to execute on our consumer strategy and more deeply penetrate the card customers that we have there and develop new value propositions that we can get out to market having proven those digital capabilities that we ve invested in so continued top line growth on the consumer side we do expect to see good underlying metrics with our institutional clients particularly in tts which is core to our network but also has linkages around linkages with the rest of the icg so good continued momentum deposit volumes and engagement with both new and existing clients on the institutional side and in tts and so top line growth of a couple of percentage points in a constructive capital markets environment with flat expenses and so you we ve referenced that at the beginning of this year and manage to that with all the uncertainty playing through the year and we are targeting that again for 2020 and the combination of that and continued work on the cost of credit and of course we ll continue to look at the tax line but we believe the combination of that focus and continued productivity benefits funding the volume growth that we expect to have will get us to the range of the 12 to 13 that i referenced operator the next question is from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead saul martinez ubs analyst hi hey guys good morning good afternoon sorry so i guess following up well actually first it s more of a clarification i just want to make sure i heard something correctly you said mark you said on the corporate and other pre tax estimate for next year i thought i heard 250 million per quarter that can t be right is that did i that seems awfully higher obviously it s a much higher run rate than what you ve been doing what was can you just repeat what that outlook was for pre tax corporate and other mark mason chief financial officer sure so i did reference that we would expect to see an impact of about 250 a quarter for corporate other that is higher than the prior guidance that i had given of a 100 million to 150 million the last time i gave guidance on corporate other so a bit higher there are couple of things that impact that or that will drive that one of which is the impact of rates we obviously had three rate cuts in the back half of 2019 that plays through the business performance but some of it also plays through the revenue that s in corporate other we also have we ll have fewer gains i referenced some gains that we have from investments that play through 2019 and through the quarter here so likely to have fewer of those and then we are and i ve referenced the investments that that we continue to want to continue to make or will continue to make in infrastructure and controls and those investments will be in the form of technology and people and focused on things such as data data governance and infrastructure and so those are important investments that we ll be making and those three drivers will be what impacts or is underneath that guidance not all in the expense line but as i mentioned we will move to keep the expenses flat operator the next question is from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead jim mitchell buckingham research analyst hey good afternoon guys mark mason chief financial officer good afternoon jim mitchell buckingham research analyst a follow up and i appreciate the unpredictability of particularly capital markets revenue and i assume that s why the wide range in rotce but if we look at the second half of last year the operating leverage particularly in the investment bank has been minimal it s been ok but you had 7 as a firm you had 7 growth top line growth with some investment gains 6 expense growth in the fourth quarter so i just wanted to understand i think the upside the upper end of that range would imply some pretty good operating leverage so is it just some unusual items in the back half of the year accelerated spending that you expect to slow or if we see higher revenue growth is that going to be offset by volume related expenses and you just can t get a ton of operating leverage just help me think through the expense trajectory and different revenue scenarios michael corbat chief executive officer well let me mark why don t i start maybe just talk a little bit about the revenue environment and what may drive so if we look jim at 2019 mark referenced the back half of the year and rate cuts but i would say throughout the year we saw what i would describe as a lot of things out there that was driving uncertainty be it the lack of a china trade deal us mca where was that headed brexit hong kong and i think we see ourselves in a position now where the horizon looks like some of those things may clear right hopefully we get a trade deal in the next couple of days here at least phase 1 of the trade deal hopefully us mca and it looks like it should be pretty well along the path to being ratified and it looks like we ll get a brexit deal so i think some of the things that were overhanging some of the volume related parts of the market might have a chance to lift and we maybe get a bit more action out of the c suite nod of some of our investors you would see volumes pick up but i think as we look at the activities that we see and again i think a pretty reasonable close to the year here when you look at the combination of ecm when you look at the combination of dcm banking more broadly obviously m a down a little bit but i think the backlog looks pretty good and i think the forward calendar as we look into the other areas look good so one is i think there is a pretty good driver on the revenue side mark mason chief financial officer yes i guess i d just add to that i guess a couple of things so one in the broadest sense again we as we think about 2020 we re targeting flat expenses with that said there are couple of things that are playing through that that i think will benefit the expense line in 2020 and cover any volume related increases or investments that we re planning to make so one is the productivity saves that we ve talked about over the past couple of years and those outpacing investments and so we expect yet another 500 million to 600 million of productivity benefits to play through 2020 and that will be used to fund some of those headwinds or investment opportunities two you would have heard us reference a number of times through the course of the year repositioning charges that we ve taken severance charges as we ve adjusted capacity those were obviously increases in expenses in the year that will play out or damage or reflect or generate benefits in 2020 again creating capacity and then you referenced the back half and particularly if you look at the icg in the last quarter you got to kind of keep in mind that growth in expenses is 10 top line growth is 8 expenses expense growth but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues the volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year and so you really got to think about the full year expense base as we go into 2020 as the timing for both investments and the productivity benefits will vary through the course of the year and we ll get into much more of this and the forward look beyond 2020 obviously at investor day operator the next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi can you talk about technology spend and where you are in the process and priorities for the back office and the front office i know it s a broad question but maybe for the back office like the number of data centers you have or the percent of workload you intend to move to the public cloud or for the front office little bit more color on the relationship with google and where you expect that to go and then just overall with total tech spend and where you are in terms of spending or reaping the benefits of past spend michael corbat chief executive officer sure so why don t i start out and mark you can chime in so again i don t want to steal the thunder we ll go into a fair bit of this in detail at investor day but mike i ll give you a couple of examples you ve asked the question before in data centers and citi at its peak had just over 70 data centers at investor day we told you we were down to 20 and today we re down to 10 what i would say is based on the combination of the necessity of redundancies gdpr and other things i won t say 10 is the static number but as you get to 10 and you run a global organization approaching 100 countries i don t think there is massive opportunity and again we ve got to see how the regulatory and how the legal landscape unfolds in terms of data and data storage second piece beyond data storage is around data itself that in many ways citi personifies big data operating all the places that we operate and if you look at the way that the company came together through acquisitions and through other bolt ons we think there is a significant opportunity to really modernize or to take our data to the next stage in terms of giving us benefits in terms of safety and soundness in terms of giving us benefits in terms of straight through processing all of those manifesting itself in better client experiences show a part of the number or reasonable part of the number that mark is referencing here in terms of spend is around what i describe as the modernization of our data and our data approach and so we re excited about that i ll give you one example on the consumer side that we talked about last time and i ll take you to back to page 23 again around our consumer drivers but if you look at as an example the things that we ve been doing around our technology in the call centers and if you look at the upper right hand box around agent contact rates what you ve seen is you ve seen basically circa 15 million reduction in calls inbound calls into our call centers and at the same time the way we re handling those calls through the combination of ivr and chat has changed where we re able to dedicate our specialist to the more complex things and not being forced to deal with what s my balance when s my payment due how do i collect my thank you points types of calls and show at the same time we re reducing significantly those contact rates and you can see it there we re also taking on more volume right as we re growing as you re growing your cards footprint as you re growing your digital deposit base obviously you re getting more engagement and so we re not only on the absolute level of reducing the number of inbounds but we re also taking on volume at obviously very attractive rates so i think that underscores or highlights why we believe and i think you ve seen in the numbers that we ve put up as we ve made some of these investments in technology we ve gotten pretty good paybacks and we think the paybacks that we can get out of the things that we ve got on the slate certainly warrant going after them mark mason chief financial officer yes i d agree with that and mike i think about it as mike described but kind of in four buckets and so as we think about technology investments there are investments that we are making that are directly client related think about new products new solutions think about the work we do with our tts clients and as we identify pain points whether it d be managing their receivables or managing their invoices we invest in other technologies we invest in our own solutions to service those client related needs if you will think of our client service from a client experience point of view and the investments that we re making to do things like streamline on boarding i referenced that regarding digital customers on boarding but we also invest a lot in how we on board our corporate clients in new countries as we enter markets with them those are technology investments that s the second bucket the third bucket is just how we streamline our own operations our own internal processes how we do more in the way of automation less manual reconciliation and manual work there is an opportunity there for to manage data from input straight through output as mike s reference and there are and paybacks on the streamlining of internal processes and then the fourth bucket and i separated because of in part because of it s significance mike has referenced before which is cyber and so cyber is a very important technology investment for us to both protect the franchise and protect our clients and we ve been growing that over the past five years and expect to continue to grow our investment in cyber so just another way to think about the lens that we look at the technology and investment and need for it as we go into 2020 operator the next question will come from erika najarian with bank of america please go ahead erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes thank you good afternoon mike does the 12 to 13 rotce for this year fully capture the potential of the franchise or and i expect you to give us more detail on investor day or do you think continued improvement could be realized from here if we keep the rate curve fairly flat and there is no major change in the global economic outlook michael corbat chief executive officer yes again we ve kind of talked about the steps along the way and you mentioned the word improvement and improvement is paramount in terms of the way we re approaching 2020 and we think we ve got the ability using technology client engagement wallet share of gains a lot of the leverage that we ve spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks mark mason chief financial officer yes i completely agree i mean we are focused on significant improvement over time we ve made progress over the past couple of years when we talked last about our underlying performance consumer and the icg we pointed to consumer as having the opportunity to close the gap between where we were two years ago and something we thought it was up in the 20 or so we re making good progress on that we think there is continued upside there we also have talked about when you think about our tce and how it s broken out between consumer icg and corporate other we know that over time some portion of what we have in corporate other that tce that s tied to the excess capital that we have the dta citi holdings over time that will work itself down and that in and of itself will contribute to improved rotce so we ve got a real sense of urgency to improve our rotce responsibly over time and we intend to continue to do that erika najarian bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you mark mason chief financial officer welcome operator the next question will come from matt o connor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good afternoon mark mason chief financial officer good afternoon matt o connor deutsche bank analyst i was wondering if you could just talk about what you re working on in the equities business obviously it has been an area of focus the last few years you had some signs of progress a tough quarter this quarter i don t want to kind of overplay it it s only a few percent of revenue but you re very strong in gaining share in sick strong and it seems like gaining some share and banking and it s still kind of call it the missing piece in the puzzle from my perspective so maybe you could just talk about the strategic outlook there and what you re working on michael corbat chief executive officer sure so as you recall several years ago we embarked on the mission and at the time we were about number nine of moving into the top five today we find ourselves at number six and along the way we ve consistently taken share and this year probably not so we look like based on some coalition delta or others were probably kind of flat to market but certainly not where we want to be and not where this ends i think as we look at things that we ve done you ve seen us adjusting in particular front end capacity against the business in particular in terms of cash making investments in delta one derivatives prime broker but i would also urge you not just to look at what we post as the trading revenues call it roughly 3 billion for the year i think you ve got to look at the aggregate business which include gcm about another 1 billion of revenue as well as our security business about another 2 5 billion of revenue so as we look at and think about our equity business it s about a 6 5 billion business to us so it is in aggregate a meaningful business that being said we still have our objective to break top five that being said we still think we can improve profitability and returns in the business but again we re focused on the end to end the pre trade the trade post trade and trying to maximize the overall benefits of that to our franchise but matt more work to do there operator the next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst hi good morning mark mason chief financial officer hi betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst couple of questions one on the capital side of the rotce i think you did indicate that you feel like you have some more opportunity there to give back excess capital i guess i wanted to understand in the most recent ccar cycle do you feel like you maxed out that ask or that you were holding back and i m just i think is i m wondering if we should be expecting acceleration from here as we go into 2020 ccar cycle mark mason chief financial officer yes thanks so we we ve obviously worked down over time much of the excess capital that we have we ve gone from having a cet1 ratio somewhere around 13 or so and kind of working that down to we ll end the year roughly at 11 7 and so there ll be less excess that s there we obviously will go through the ccar process as we ve done in the past and try to responsibly come up with as much as we can return to shareholders that is an important driver in us delivering on the continued progress that we ve talked about we obviously would want to and will first look to what opportunities for growth of the business exist so out of the earnings we re able to generate first to fund that growth and then with what s left in available to shareholders including the benefits from the reduction in the disallowed dta that we ve been targeting from year to year we would look to distribute that both in the form of continued dividends as well as buybacks and so there is some excess that s there obviously there are number of factors that go into that analysis including the scenario and so on and so forth but we ll continue down the path of returning as much as we responsibly kind of it makes sense given the growth trajectory we see betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst and so on your 12 to 13 rotce goal is the degree of capital you re envisioning returning i would think a function of that range as well that range is being driven in part by the capital i know you discussed the mark mason chief financial officer yes so that yes the range does include continued return of capital not at the payout ratios we ve seen in the past for the reasons that i ve mentioned but absolutely it includes a competitive continued payout in that 12 to 13 range 12 to 13 rotce range betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst right ok and then just separately on your card guidance you gave some guidance for card net charge offs both on the branded and the retail partner card and i guess i m wondering does that include your expectation for what day two cecl impact is likely to be and maybe you could speak a little bit to how you re thinking about cecl and what s your assumptions are for the reasonable supportable period of cecl from an economic input perspective mark mason chief financial officer sure let me kind of break that in two pieces if i can so on the guidance that i gave regarding cost of credit in cards or ncl rates i should say in cards i referenced that it would be a little bit above the 300 basis points to 325 basis points of a medium term target that we d set and we re branded and my reference there and i think i ve mentioned this in the past is that we ve seen a higher percentage of conversion into average interest earning balances and so with that higher volume than expected which is a good thing that comes with it s profitable high quality of volume activity but with that comes higher ncls and so much of the increase that i referenced that would put us potentially outside of that range is driven by that in terms of we have in how we think about our forecast and certainly a range that i ve articulated we have factored in the impact of how we think about cecl we ve i ve referenced in the past a range of roughly 20 to 30 on the high end in terms of the day one impact we expect the day one impact to increase the reserves by roughly 29 to get a little bit more precise or roughly 4 billion so inside of the range that i ve communicated in the past the regulatory capital perspective from a regulatory capital perspective that will be about 6 basis points of cet1 capital in 2020 with a full impact of about 24 basis points by the time we get to the first quarter of 23 2023 as you would imagine the significant build is on the consumer side so to your reference to cards it s being driven by cards and that is based on the increased coverage from 14 months to about 23 months and so that s the more significant pieces offset by a decrease in the corporate build which nets down to about the 4 billion you reference kind of day two and we ll talk more about that i m sure in the forward quarters but there are obviously a number of moving variables that go into that calculation whether it d be kind of economic conditions or the seasonality of the business there a number of factors there that impact day two and we ve consider that as we look at our 2020 forecast and as i ve given you that range it factors in that consideration betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay thanks mark mason chief financial officer welcome operator the next question is from ken houston with jefferies please go ahead ken houston jefferies analyst thanks thanks a lot good morning just a question on capital i know we re all waiting just the finalization of scb and stress test framework also coming out of the year end any i assume that there was no change to your g sib where you landed in all and so i guess it s just a question is just what do you how are you setting up in terms of the expectations for regardless of timing around scb any potential changes to what the final framework might look like and any anticipated changes how you have to think about that mark mason chief financial officer sure so i guess i ll first address directly your reference to the g sib score at the third quarter we ended up at about 6 28 which is right below the 6 29 and so still in the 3 bucket we should end the fourth quarter well into or inside of that 3 bucket as well so below the 6 29 in the low 600s or so just given some of the seasonality that we see and the focus that we obviously put on ensuring that we re managing the business in a responsible way and so 3 bucket is where we expect to be by the year end or for the year end here 2019 in terms of the stress capital buffer we ve heard as you ve heard a lot of a number of comments around the interest in getting something out for this next ccar cycle we haven t seen anything as of yet that would need to come out i think by middle of february we obviously are continuing with the normal planning of our ccar submission when i think about how we consider that or how we factor that in i kind of go back to the cet1 ratio that we managed to about 11 5 and we have kind of a number of buffers in there but one buffer in there to account for our estimation of the impact of the stress capital buffer so about 50 basis points above the capital conservation buffer that we have there and then we also have a management buffer and so my thinking is that as that as we get more information and clarity on the proposal we should be able to cover that inside of how we re managing the target that we already have for ourselves the final point i ll make is that we continue to take some comfort in the regulators comments and views that whatever we do with any one of these proposals including the scb that we re targeting capital neutrality across the industry and i want to take a holistic approach that is factoring in how each of these proposals will work together in an integrated fashion while preserving the capital neutrality so ken houston jefferies analyst got it understood and just outside of the seasonality is there anything that just given the environment and some of the ins and outs of balance fed balance sheet of volatility seasonality got you inside that g sib thanks for clarifying that anything else just changing in terms of just flows that you see from the business outside of normal course that s coming via the repo market the fed balance sheet expansion or is it just really was a seasonality mark mason chief financial officer it was seasonality and we obviously work to ensure that we were meeting client needs while being able to deliver inside of that bucket but nothing outside of that nothing related to kind of the repo activity as you mentioned in the market ken houston jefferies analyst okay thank you mark mark mason chief financial officer yes operator the next question is from brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst great thanks it is a quick question on the nir guidance can you kind of walk through some of the puts and takes that gets you comfortable with being able to grow in 2020 and then also what s the macro assumptions you re using behind that thanks mark mason chief financial officer yes so as i mentioned we expect kind of total revenue growth in 2020 with a mix from both nir and non nir we would expect that that would be driven by both loan growth as well as mix to get to that nir growth that s there there ll probably be some or there will be some kind of volatility on a quarterly basis just due to the idea that nir has market business nir that flows through there as well and i walk through that dynamic last quarter but we do expect loan growth in mix to be primary drivers there offsetting obviously some of the pressure in terms of the impact of rates of interest rates and your point around kind of how we think about the forward look as we plan for 2020 similar to what s out there in the way of the forward curve we ve assumed one additional rate cut of about 25 basis points toward the back end of 2020 so 2020 will have the full impact of the three cuts we saw in the back half of 19 and assumed one incremental rate cut in the back half of 2020 brian kleinhanzl keefe bruyette woods analyst great thanks operator the next question is from marty mosby with vinings sparks please go ahead marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks for taking the question and the net margin kind of bounced around and it s not really hard or trending like what you would see in the rest of the group so just was curious positive benefit you got this quarter it didn t seem like the balance sheet really creative it looked like it was a real positive earnings impact does nii was stronger is it more sustainable or how do you kind of one of the bearings that kind of move that as we go forward mark mason chief financial officer yes so the net interest margin grew by about 7 basis points quarter over quarter and much of that as i mentioned earlier was driven by the markets revenues so we saw a big uptick obviously year over year as the fourth quarter rebounded and so that mix resulted in an increase in the nim up to 2 63 and as we go forward i haven t really i haven t given a forecast on nim going forward i have spoken obviously as i just mentioned to nir and non nir but obviously all of the factors you would imagine such as the loan growth in the mix and all of those things will factor into how nim plays out in the balance of 2020 marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then mike i wanted to ask you on the last investor day that citigroup posted it really was about capital you also then talked about how you had to invest in the business in the overall revenue outlook it was pretty dicey it s feels like we re in a totally different place where revenue starting to pick up a little momentum the investment that was required over the last couple of years you could accomplish that so maybe not as much going forward so the dynamic kind of move away from just capital is being the driver to actually now the fundamentals of the business starting to perk up a little bit going into this next investor day michael corbat chief executive officer marty i d love to tell you it s an easy environment but i think as we as we look toward the future i think one is that our levels of client engagement and what you ve seen since investor day we talked about revenue gains coming off of kind of potential while is expansion but in particular market share gains and i think as you look across all of our businesses certainly most of our businesses we ve had there and i would expect at investor day we re going to talk more about that as the things we do i think continue to resonate with the clients is the investments that we ve made in our products the investments that we ve made in service i think continue to reap good benefits you ll hear us talk again about continued expense discipline but at the same time you ll hear us talk about the investments in technology and technology infrastructure in those pieces which we think gives us a multiple benefit to safety soundness gives a benefit to customer experience and obviously gives a benefit on the cost side of things so again i think as you cite i think the big the big outsized times of capital return versus net income are probably coming to an end but i think at the same time the momentum in the franchise accelerates marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks operator the next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy rbc analyst thank you good afternoon mike and mark michael corbat chief executive officer hey gerard mark mason chief financial officer hey gerard gerard cassidy rbc analyst mark i know you just gave us some of the assumptions that you guys are looking at on the macro for your revenue growth for 2020 if we are talking on this call a year from now and you guys have better than expected than modest total revenue growth what are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger mark mason chief financial officer sure so when i think about 2020 there are couple of i think critically important factors that i look to one is continued execution on our north america consumer strategy we ve gotten some good momentum through the course of 19 we ve made meaningful progress in terms of the capabilities to more deeply penetrate our customers we ve seen good client engagement across that portfolio and so that continued momentum playing into 2020 and to the extent that it plays in even more significantly i think you ll see that as we penetrate more customers as we grow volumes with those customers as they use our products and services more whether through purchase sales or any of the other metrics with citigold households etc the second category is as i think about our global corporate client in our institutional client group and the continued good great engagement that we re seeing with those clients not just in tts around the world not just existing clients but new clients that we ve been able to on board and grow with very rapidly not just with cash management products but also with capital markets offerings like our fx capabilities and the benefits that those clients are realizing as we invest in technologies that bring those product capabilities together to create solutions that allow them to run their operations more efficiently and so more traction there would be a second thing that you would look to i think and then the third thing would be something that one of the things mike has reference to a number of times on this call but that discipline around the need to invest across the franchise and not just in growth but certainly in growth around those important capabilities but also in how we improve the way we go to market the way we run our businesses and the efficiency around that i think the combination of those things and return of capital obviously will be the things that you will be able to look at at the end of 2020 and have a greater sense of clarity as to why we ended up where we ended up and or better than that range mike do you want to add to that yes michael corbat chief executive officer no thank you gerard cassidy rbc analyst and tying into some of your answer mark mike obviously the consumer business credit cards is a great example is the economies of scale and the community banks in this space and even some of the regional banks really cannot compete with you and your peers at a profitable level that most investors would find acceptable if we shift over now to the capital markets business and i know you have that economies of scale in treasury and trade solutions do you think mike in three to four years could the capital markets be something similar to the credit cards where the five dominant banks really kind of run the show like in credit cards for example michael corbat chief executive officer i think i think gerard you re already seeing some of that and we can cite different examples but one is in europe the fact today that in europe the top five banks in the market space are all us banks right and by nature of the businesses those bank are largely all certainly we are operating at scale in the businesses that we re in and so scale matters and we measure scale lots of different ways and certainly in the consumer business but also in the institutional business part of scale is your ability to invest control and build your tech stack your tech infrastructure to make sure that you re at or out in front in terms of the evolution of the business so i think you continue to see consolidation in the capital market space gerard cassidy rbc analyst thank you michael corbat chief executive officer thank you operator the next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja jpmorgan analyst thanks couple of questions mark firstly your guidance on revenue growth as well as an outlook for 2020 when i look at revenue growth of 19 as a starting point you had about 1 billion increase in securities gains and the so when i exclude that it was about 2 so i guess the question is as you look out to 2020 do you expect securities gains to continue do you have any impact of one time gains and also what are your assumption for outside of the us mark mason chief financial officer vivek i apologize i just have had a hard time hearing your question i really apologize if you could repeat that please vivek juneja jpmorgan analyst sure when you look at revenue growth if you look at the revenue growth it was when i look at it on a core basis excluding trade rev gain and 1 billion increase in securities gains it was about 2 year on full year 2019 for 2020 when you look at your guidance mark are you expecting more securities gains are these gains to continue and against from further sales of business as portfolios and also what assumption do you have for rates outside the us mark mark mason chief financial officer sure so there are couple of questions in there as i think about our forward look an estimate of revenue growth we are expecting net revenue growth from all of the buckets that i ve described so core underlying revenue performance is what s going to drive what we see going into 2020 i d be careful about looking at 2019 just through the items that you mentioned there there are other things that don t necessarily reflect the underlying strength of the franchise there are some so anyway to just be careful about kind of narrowing it to just those two things but the answer to your question is in fact that we see good underlying growth in our businesses in terms of the forward look on rates i guess what i d point you to is if you look at kind of our interest rate exposure that s in our queue and ultimately be in our k we often talk about the impact of a 25 basis point move there is an analysis there for both us dollar and non us dollar and you ll see that the non us dollar impact to get to your question around non us rates is not a material impact on a quarter to quarter basis it s a little bit less than 30 million a quarter for a 25 basis point shift in the non us dollar rates and obviously there are a number of different countries that make up that but it s about it s less than 30 million vivek juneja jpmorgan analyst okay thanks and i have a question from mike mike just going back to the equities business and i recognize it is relatively a small business but i know you had big hopes for this business with 1 billion increase in revenues a couple of years ago when you were talking about it recently you ve had some headcount cuts i know you ve already put more capital to work in the prime finance business so what do you do what can you do tangibly now differently to really to get that revenue growth going again because full year 19 was you were at the lower end of where you ve been in the last five years michael corbat chief executive officer yes we prior to 2019 we ll see where the coalition debt and other data shuttles but it seems like we re coming in somewhere about flat to market wallet where we had in the past several years taking taken share so one is we ve got to get back on the track of taking share i think the second piece is that we ve got to continue to assess the capacity of our front end and continue to use technology to drive parts of our lower or low touch business i think we feel pretty good about the derivative space i think we feel good about delta one we feel good about prime broker we feel good about our security services business and all of those are obviously higher returning businesses i e in some cases less capital and again i think based on the nature of the clients that we cover the consolidation of assets not just in the us but around the world we think we ve got the ability to face off against those continue to take share and again as we pull the business together to drive returns did have it makes sense vivek juneja jpmorgan analyst thanks if i may one quick one mark you went to the high end on cecl day one from the 20 to 30 given the economic environment has held up pretty well any color on what brought you toward the high end is it a shift in your card business which also drove that little increase in charge offs or is there something else mark mason chief financial officer again it was just a there was no particular change as we work through it we obviously developed our model there were shifts in balances but there are a number of different factors that go into that and i think i ve been communicating guidance toward the high end not just on this call where i talked about the actual number but in the past couple of calls and so no meaningful shift that i d point to vivek juneja jpmorgan analyst thank you operator the final question is a follow up from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst hi i wasn t able to get this in earlier just as you look at efficiency clearly your guidance implies better efficiency ahead and it s improved for the last several years but we slice and dice the number in different ways it doesn t seem to be as efficient as it could be if you take it out cards for example so where do you how much does technology help keep the expenses flat and where do you think efficiency can go in the short term the long term and just i had also asked the prior question of the google relationship if i can throw that into michael corbat chief executive officer so i ll start with google and mark you can chime in as well so we are out with the announcement obviously q1 to q2 we re going to be launching some products here in the us with them and so we re not out with the exact design of that but more to come in the not too distant future mark mason chief financial officer yes and on the operating efficiency in the earnings deck we kind of showed a chart on page 18 of just the ltm efficiency ratio and there you d see we ve got discontinued downward trend of 56 5 for the year 89 basis points of improvement what i would say mike is that we ve put out a target not just on returns but on flat expenses again this year we re gearing up for investor day we re going to make sure that we can talk to how we think about the future but also how we think about technology and the role that it plays now and going forward we ve given you some descriptions on the benefits that accrue to the firm from the investments we ve made already i think we ve demonstrated proof points of those generating productivity savings consistently and we expect that to continue but in terms of much more detail around the technology benefits or around how we think about beyond 2020 i d ask that you kind of wait for us to get to investor day where we can talk about it in a more holistic way mike mayo wells fargo securities analyst i guess i ll reserve may 13th to my calendar thanks a lot mark mason chief financial officer thank you michael corbat chief executive officer thank you operator at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments elizabeth lynn head of investor

us equities continued to power ahead to fresh record highs overnight with the us and china finally signing the long awaited phase one trade deal in contrast global rates have fallen after a very weak uk cpi release led the market to price a better than even chance of a boe rate cut later this month despite broad based usd weakness the nzd has again underperformed and is unchanged from this time yesterday a short while ago the us and china signed the phase one trade deal in the preceding press conference trump said phase two talks would start shortly and all tariffs would be removed after this phase was completed however with the two sides prioritising the easy wins in phase one leaving the more complicated and structural issues such as chinese state subsidies for the second phase phase two is likely to be a long slog bloomberg reported yesterday that the us would keep the current tariffs on chinese imports in place until after the election in november to ensure that china complies with the agreement market sentiment remains very positive with us equities pushing ahead to new highs overnight the s p500 is 0 2 higher while the vix remains very low near 12 although it should have been well priced by now the signing of the trade deal is seen as reducing the risk of a flare up in us china trade tensions this year and a sign that trump doesn t want to compromise the economy or stock market in the lead up to the election later this year equities received a boost from comments by white house economic advisor kudlow who told cnbc that the administration was working on plans for a second round of tax cuts aimed at the middle class however unless the republicans win back congress later this year something the prediction markets see as unlikely these plans are unlikely to happen the financials sector underperformed the broader market overnight following softer earnings from both bank of america and goldman sachs although both saw a rebound in trading revenue last quarter uk rates plunged and the gbp underperformed overnight after a much weaker than expected cpi release core inflation fell to just 1 4 its lowest level since late 2016 before the post referendum fall in the pound boosted uk inflation several boe mpc members including governor carney and external members tenreyro and vlieghe have made dovish noises recently with vlieghe saying over the weekend he would need to see an imminent and significant improvement in uk data to justify waiting a little bit longer the weaker cpi data could push these members to join the two who were already prepared to vote for a rate cut at the last meeting including michael saunders who reiterated his case for more stimulus in a speech overnight the market moved to price a 65 chance of a cut in january with a 25bp cut fully priced by may the uk 10 year gilt yield fell 7bps to 0 65 while the gbp fell back below 1 30 before subsequently recovering the gbp underperformed most other major currencies overnight the fall in gilt yields spilled over into the us and european markets although us rates have since mostly recovered the 10 year us treasury yield is at similar level to the close of the nz trading day at 1 8 having traded a couple of basis points lower at one point overnight the continued rise in equity markets again had little impact on us rates with the 10 year yield remaining firmly contained within a 1 70 1 95 range amidst expectations the fed is reluctant to move rates in either direction dallas fed president kaplan told bloomberg that he believed risk assets had been boosted by the fed s recent expansion of its balance sheet along with the rate cuts last year and the market s perception that going forward the fed is reluctant to hike the fed resumed buying treasury bills late last year to counter pressures in the repo market but kaplan warned that the fed should consider financial stability in its framework and have a plan for tempering the growth in the balance sheet going forward us data released overnight was second tier and had little impact ppi was in line with expectations while the empire manufacturing survey based on firms in the new york region increased slightly although this regional survey hasn t provided a very good steer on the nationwide ism survey over the past year in germany the statistics office reported that the german economy had grown at a meagre 0 6 pace last year although this matched economist estimates the usd is weaker across the board over the past 24 hours although the magnitude of the move a 0 1 fall in the bloomberg dxy is modest the usd indices remain range bound the swiss franc has been the top performing currency 0 4 following on from us treasury s announcement yesterday that it had designated the country a currency manipulators the market is therefore testing whether the snb will pull back on its intervention activities that it has been using to lean against franc strength the jpy has underperformed amidst the risk on backdrop as it hovers just below 110 the nzd has underperformed leaving it as the worst performing g10 currency for the second day running the nzd reached a one month low overnight at 0 6520 although it has since bounced back to be unchanged on the day at 0 6615 there doesn t appear a clear catalyst for the nzd underperformance with little change in ocr expectations over the past few days we continue to see the nzd as being on the cheap side in domestic data released yesterday nz food prices fell 0 2 in december which was close to our estimate and kept our q4 cpi forecast at 0 5 higher than rbnz s 0 2 cpi is released next friday nz rates fell 1 2bps yesterday in line with global moves nz electronic card spending data is released this morning

alliance news london stocks edged into the green at midday on wednesday as investors pondered how to trade the phase one us china trade deal set to be signed later in the day the big day has arrived

marginally lower following a lacklustre start to the week he continued we ve been waiting for the signing ceremony for so long but there is a worry that despite details of the deal being largely concealed what we are hearing is a little underwhelming and may be already priced in maybe even too much meanwhile the pound recovered after data showed uk inflation slumped to a three year low in

world s two dominant economic powers the us and china are poised to sign a trade truce wednesday however the most difficult issues remain to be dealt with in phase two negotiations including massive subsidies for state industry and forced technology transfer and even the achievements in the deal take the relationship back to where it was before us president donald trump took office restoring elements he scrapped us treasury secretary steven mnuchin dismissed a bloomberg report that the initial agreement could include provisions to roll back more tariffs on china after the election the tariffs will stay in place until there is a phase two if the president gets phase two quickly he will consider releasing tariffs if not there won t be any tariff relief mnuchin said on bloomberg tv

influential external member being the last to break silence and pledge to vote for a rate cut should the uk economy fail to bounce in q1 2020 all data are closely monitored this month uk cpi printed below expectations this morning confirming the recent trend of muted inflation and overall softer data the mpc meeting seems more live than ever in january with a 62 probability from 50 yesterday for a 25bps rate cut said olivier konzeoue fx sales trader at saxo markets adding to the rate cut drumbeat on wednesday was monetary policy committee member michael saunders who has voted for a rate cut at the past two boe meetings speaking in northern ireland he noted that economic growth has slowed markedly over the last year both at home and abroad to sum up on the current situation economic growth is sluggish spare capacity is rising while inflation is subdued the economy still has a slow puncture and this seems to be spreading to the labour market unless prospects for demand improve very quickly some increases in unemployment or under employment seem likely in the next few quarters he said it may be appropriate to cut interest rates further saunders added elsewhere in europe

bernie sanders supporters are quick to make clear that their guy doesn t want to turn america into cuba or venezuela or the old soviet union by democratic socialism the us senator from vermont means scandinavia more or less and what s wrong with that the nordic nations are pretty nice even president trump has conceded that norway produces a quality immigrant via twenty20 but does sanders really want to import scandinavian socialism he brags that his universal health care plan eliminates patient cost sharing but scandinavia has it sanders wants to raise a lot revenue though heavy taxes on business and investment scandinavia doesn t sanders has a big problem with billionaires scandinavia doesn t indeed as i have written the egalitarian nordic nations have as many billionaires relatively as the us and more concentrated wealth at least as measured by the share of wealth controlled by the top 10 percent i could do on and on mentioning how the nordics score highly in the conservative heritage foundation s economic freedom index especially when it comes to government regulation they re also free traders unlike sanders who opposed the north american free trade agreement in the 1990s and its successor agreement today as a jpmorgan analysis cautioned copy the nordic model if you like but understand that it entails a lot of capitalism and pro business policies a lot of taxation on middle class spending and wages minimal reliance on corporate taxation and plenty of co pays and deductibles in its healthcare system here s a tale of scandinavian socialism that team bernie never tells via a milken review institute piece from swedish economist andreas bergh in the 1970s several well intended political reforms backfired the desire to increase income equality through high marginal tax rates and generous welfare benefits weakened work incentives and created strong incentives for tax avoidance indeed in the 1970s and 1980s many wealthy swedes notably bjorn borg left the country to avoid the taxman meanwhile the desire to tame the business cycle and minimize unemployment led to the subsidization of noncompetitive industries the unions desire to drive wages ahead of productivity growth led to inflation while efforts to restore sweden s competitiveness through repeated currency devaluations led to both a lower living standard and investment sapping uncertainty perhaps most important the mix of subsidies and devaluations sent the signal that firms in trouble could turn to the government for help rather than be forced to innovate in order to stay competitive when that happens economies inevitably pay a price after the crisis of the early 1990s the swedish economy recovered smartly in many ways sweden learned from its mistakes and took measures to avoid large budget deficits and inflationary wage pressures by the mid 1990s these changes were institutionalized and strikingly often with support from social democrats as well as the right wing parties prominent examples include a tax reform that lowered marginal rates substantially and a pension reform that balanced the risks between pensioners and taxpayers by automatically adjusting payments to demographic and economic conditions whatever sanders wants to turn america into it doesn t sound much like scandinavia as it exists in current reality then again as that jpmorgan report concluded a real life proof of concept for a successful democratic socialist society like the lost city of atlantis has yet to be found

the us china trade deal is like watching a live show in the theatre of the absurd the trump administration revealed a detail that nobody expected just before the signature of the phase one trade deal today the tariff cuts will not take effect before the us election in november this means that the us tariffs will continue weighing on chinese exports for almost an additional year while the emerging market giant will certainly be asked to deliver on its promise to buy massive amounts of us farm goods and manufactured products immediately the risk here is that the double standard agreement could provide a weak basis for the future negotiations impair the benefits or even spoil the deal us equity futures and treasury yields slipped gold and the japanese yen gained as latest news raised a few eyebrows the swiss franc remained muted ftse 0 18 and dax 0 30 futures are set for a negative start to the session following a mixed sentiment on tuesday wti crude consolidated near the 58 a barrel as tensions between us and iran left its place to renewed trade concerns with china the only highlight of the day was jp morgan posting a solid 21 profit in the fourth quarter thanks to an impressive fixed income trading revenue jp morgan advanced to 140 a share in new york financials in wall street gave a boost to the dow jones index bank of america and goldman sachs will post their q4 earnings today in the fx the euro rebounded from 1 1104 against the us dollar ahead of the german annual gdp release expected to have retreated from 1 5 to 0 6 in 2019 the european industrial production on the other hand may have improved to 0 3 month on month in november versus 0 5 posted a month earlier cable advanced above the 1 30 mark it seems that this level is a magnet for the buy side despite soft economic data and a significant dovish shift in the bank of england s boe policy stance due today the inflation data will likely confirm that british consumer prices have stagnated near a three year low of 1 5 in december soft data could give a stronger case for a boe rate cut in the coming months therefore the pound s advance against the us dollar could remain limited following a soft inflation figure speaking of inflation the headline inflation in the us advanced from 2 1 to 2 3 year on year in december versus 2 4 expected by analysts higher gasoline and energy prices were the root cause of faster price inflation last month while the core inflation excluding food and energy prices remained under control at 2 3 not low enough to give the fed a blank check to pull its rates lower yet not alarmingly high to call for a tighter monetary policy either

by vildana hajric claire ballentine and sarah ponczek the u s and china signed a partial trade deal that confirms a cease fire in the spat that has roiled financial markets for three years while the broad terms of the 94 page agreement have been known since last year s handshake deal the text brought some clarity to markets that remained on edge credit card stocks for example were among the biggest gainers after the likes of visa and mastercard moved a step closer to gaining access to china s 27 trillion payments market commodity markets got some numbers on china s commitments to buy

substance to this deal it isn t in the text but rather an informal commitment by china not to guide the yuan down from its already depreciated levels versus the dollar so long as the truce holds semiconductors chipmakers fell wednesday the group had been among the most sensitive to any trade related headlines from tariffs to steps to thwart china s huawei technologies co the u s signaled on tuesday that huawei remains in its sights tech remains an issue dave lutz managing director of jonestrading said semiconductors are at ground zero for that huawei looms we act against huawei and that s probably not going to help sentiment in semis soybean futures tumble u s farmers bore the brunt of china s retaliation during the three year spat and trump sought to secure increased levels of purchase commitments from china the deal indicated china will step up purchases of agricultural goods but the nation said it would do so according to demand soybean prices slumped the chinese will buy according to their need but they ll need a lot make no mistake about it said sal gilbertie president and co founder of teucrium trading the markets may have been anticipating an immediate burst of buying but this is more of a buy the rumor sell the fact emerging markets the deal did little to alter views on emerging market assets which have been rallying since last year s detente in the trade war amid expectations for a pickup in global demand it s all baked in the cake sacha tihanyi deputy head of emerging markets strategy at td securities in new york said with continued tariffs and little urgency for a phase two deal there s probably more risk of downside surprises on the trade front with china than upside it puts a stamp on what the markets moved on already looking ahead to phase two trump said negotiations of the next phase will begin immediately and investors remained on edge over whether that could entail fresh tariffs or raise other uncertainties for businesses and investors for now those talks look set to start on a good footing the implication is that at least it sets a better mood whether it gets done donald selkin chief market strategist at newbridge securities corp said at least it sets a framework perhaps for a better tone going into stage two but there s a lot of uncertainty there s a lot in phase one that is not as clear as it s supposed to be it s a real positive said matt forester chief investment officer at bny mellon lockwood advisors there are pieces to the agreement that maybe were not expected in the markets especially around intellectual property and technology transfer now the question is going to be whether they will actually be able to reach purchase commitments but that there is an agreement to try reach those is a

after experiencing a whole year with a far right president as head of state in brazil namely jair bolsonaro we have to try and understand the steps that led to this situation summary changes in the pt and the cut why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 i arrived in sao paulo the financial and economic capital of brazil on the night of 14 november 2019 the city has over 12 million inhabitants in all the districts i visited poverty is flagrant you see homeless people living on the street with no access to sanitation of any kind and prey to the most extreme poverty a significant number of people are undernourished reliable sources mention about 100 000 people who live on the streets of sao paulo 25 000 of them permanently and 75 000 on a temporary basis i first came to sao paulo in december 1991 to participate in the first congress of the workers party partido dos trabalhadores or pt led by the former metal worker lula at that time lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt see the interview i had with him in managua in july 1991 he said among other things any third world government that decides to further repay the external debt chooses to lead his people into the abyss lula had led workers strikes against the dictatorship in the 1980s and in 1988 a democratic regime replaced the dictatorship after a transitional stage the bases of the main trade union federation cut central única de trabalhadores or unified workers central and of the new party the pt had been brought together during the valiant struggle against the dictatorship the pt had been built from the bottom by activists in social movements and small very active politically radical organizations the cut and the pt were against repaying debt and wanted a citizens audit part of the debt had been accumulated during the military dictatorship which lasted more than 20 years and afterwards it increased steeply during the debt crisis in the 1980s a crisis that resulted from commodity prices plummeting while washington had decided on a sharp increase in interest rates more generally the pt clearly stated that radical anti capitalist policies had to be implemented which were to lead to the construction of a democratic socialist self managed and anti bureaucratic society this outcome stirred genuine enthusiasm in brazil and beyond i went to sao paulo in 1991 in order to prepare lula s and another pt leader marco aurelio garcia s visit to belgium at the invitation of the cadtm the talks were to take place some ten days before christmas 1991 eventually for health reasons lula couldn t come over and was replaced by marco aurelio garcia who became president of the pt in 2006 and was lula s main adviser on foreign policy while lula was president from 2003 to 2011 i met lula four or five times from 1991 to 2003 i can remember a long discussion we had in havana in 1993 it followed upon a meeting lula had had with fidel castro and daniel ortega lula explained that in order to become president of brazil he had to neutralize us imperialism the army and the brazilian bourgeoisie i understood that he meant not to thwart us strategic interests and to promise the army leadership and big capital that he would implement no measures that went against their interests lula told me that he would be the president of all brazilians as was all too often said what i understood was that he would use his experience as a trade unionist to seal a pact between those at the bottom and those at the top asking those at the top to concede some improvements in purchasing power i e allowing the state to increase social aid with public money while those at the bottom would accept that nothing would really change at the structural level this is indeed what he attempted to do when he was president ten years later i saw him for the last time in june 2003 and stated how much i disapproved of the neoliberal reform he had introduced into the civil service pension system the meeting occurred on the occasion of the g8 annual summit united states canada japan germany united kingdom france italy russia in evian on 1 and 2 june 2003 several heads of states that did not belong to the g8 had been invited by the french president jacques chirac who wished to show that the g8 and france in particular were open to dialogue with the rest of the world among those who had responded positively were president lula of brazil and the heads of states or governments of china india nigeria senegal south africa egypt and mexico chirac was trying to give legitimacy to the g8 an informal club of major global powers at a time when its credibility was in question particularly after the brutal repression of the counter g8 protest in genoa in 2001 president chirac s guests met in evian before the actual g8 summit meeting while over 100 000 marched through the streets of geneva switzerland and annemasse france shouting g8 is illegal luis inacio lula da silva wanted to meet leaders of the european anti globalization movements there were four delegates the president of attac france a woman representative of the italian social forum a swedish woman representative of the campaign against the wto and myself for the cadtm the meeting occurred in geneva in the residence of the brazilian ambassador and it highlighted the gap between lula and the international anti globalization movements see my interview president lula s realpolitik and the alterglobalisation movement changes in the pt and the cut it should be pointed out that during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down the pt won many elected officials in large cities as well as in small and medium sized towns in particular the pt had mayors elected in sao paulo and porto alegre where it gradually adopted a managerial orientation and lost its role as a spur to radical anti capitalist changes i followed this process of adaptation to the institutions of the capitalist state with great disappointment when lula was elected president of brazil at the end of 2002 with a landslide 65 of the votes he and the pt had fundamentally changed they no longer really questioned the capitalist system and lula signed a letter of submission to the imf in the middle of the election campaign in august 2002 in this letter he solemnly declared that if elected president he would abide strictly by the previous government s agreements with the imf only a couple of months after his election he introduced a neoliberal reform of retirement pensions lula also appointed as president of the central bank one of the big bosses henrique meirelles former president of one of the major us banks in brazil the fleet boston the message was clear a representative of the capitalist class was at the head of the central bank lula did not interfere with the army and did not suspend the amnesty extended to those officers of the dictatorship responsible for crimes against humanity this is a major difference with argentina where the 1986 amnesty was cancelled in 2005 which made it possible to condemn and incarcerate several military leaders including the major figures of the military dictatorship enforced in 1976 under the lula presidency the brazilian army participated in the occupation of haiti which was denounced by haitian social movements the top brazilian military leader during the occupation of haiti became a member of bolsonaro s government in 2019 under lula s presidency not a single private corporation was brought back into the public sector on the contrary he supported the interests of private corporations that did not hesitate to bribe civil servants in order to secure procurements as was the case for the emblematic construction company odebrecht see euronews what is the odebrecht corruption scandal in latin america and who is implicated the lula government scrupulously repaid its debts without carrying out the audit he had called for when he was in the opposition to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia family grant this programme improved the income of more than 12 million families i e about 20 of brazil s poorest families please note that the amount of aid was limited at the time of the pt government a family of three could receive a maximum of 50 euros it should be noted that bolsonaro has not stopped this programme which in 2019 benefited 13 5 million families i e one fifth of brazilian families in 2019 a poor family could receive a maximum of 200 reales per month at the exchange rate of november 2019 that is around 40 euros to be entitled to this grant the family must show that its monthly income is below 89 reales that is 20 euros or less than one euro a day per family why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment as a government would have meant conflict with brazilian big capital which benefits largely from the debt buying brazil s internal and external public debt securities these insure a high return since interest rates are very high questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf lula and the pt leadership wanted to avoid such conflicts as they gave legitimacy to the debt continued paying it and went even further calling on big capital to contract new public loans the lula government was tolerated or even appreciated by the bourgeoisie all the more so as social measures that benefited people with the lowest income increased the purchasing power of the poor which was good for capitalists business lula s neoliberal policies resulted in a split within the pt with a new party emerging to its left in 2004 that party is the psol party for socialism and freedom since 2001 i often went back to brazil for the large gatherings of the world social forums around 100 000 people participated each time for meetings of the wsf s international council of which i had been a member from the start and for meetings of social movements there were meetings organized by the brazilian citizens debt audit a member of the cadtm s international network the cadtm s international network repeatedly sent significant delegations to brazil for wsf activities particularly in porto alegre in 2005 and in belem in 2009 when one of the cadtm s world assemblies was held the political situation has changed a lot as pointed out above from 2003 onward the pt clearly turned away from its revolutionary past to become a manager of the system this eventually resulted in deep disappointment not to say distrust especially since several of its leaders were actively involved in major corruption cases including lula himself eventually when the bourgeoisie felt it could manage the country without the pt s collaboration it exposed the party as corrupt this while all other traditional parties are just as deeply corrupt or much more dilma rousseff the pt leader who won the 2010 presidential elections and became president of brazil in 2011 was impeached by the senate in 2016 in what was actually an institutional coup d etat see in french spanish or portuguese but disappointment towards the pt was so deep that the brazilian people hardly mobilized to defend the pt and its leaders in 2016 and the right wing vice president michel temer appointed by the pt in 2011 replaced dilma rousseff pt as president after masterminding the institutional coup later the antisocial policies implemented by president temer a corrupt right wing leader eventually stirred some popular support for lula as a credible candidate to be reelected president in 2018 so the judiciary system largely controlled by big capital was relentless in its efforts to prevent lula from running for president despite his imprisonment lula was the most likely to win and his supporters hoped that he would be able to participate in the elections this is why the judiciary prohibited him from running and jair bolsonaro was elected president end of 2018 and started his mandate in early 2019 bolsonaro is a far right politician yearning for dictatorship see a racist sexist homophobic climate change negationist he is similar to trump while possibly even further to the right his deeply reactionary and antipopular nature is beyond doubt see in french or spanish on 21 october 2018 at the end of the election campaign he stated that if he was elected president he would conduct a purge such as brazil has never known he affirmed that the leaders of the workers party must all rot in prison and said of the leftist movements they will have to submit to the law like everyone else either they leave or they go to jail shortly after starting his mandate he promised to remove civil servants with communist ideas his election is a real tragedy for the brazilian people and for the international left after bolsonaro s victory a large part of the left fortunately formed a united front and demanded lula s liberation they got it in early november 2019 and lula immediately started a political campaign to win the presidential elections in 2022 this being said we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 but he might get elected in 2022 since it is clear that bolsonaro if he completes his mandate will have implemented antisocial policies that increase poverty and deepen the gap between a handful of very rich and the overwhelming majority of brazil s population obviously we need to mobilize widely against the bolsonaro government and in spite of disagreements with the pt we need a broad left wing front within which the pt will play an active part auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 the brazilian citizens debt audit is an organization founded in the early 2000s in 2000 a referendum was organized on popular initiative by the mst landless workers movement the cut brazil s jubilee south campaign the national conference of bishops which has been positioned on the left since the years 1980 1990 with the support of the pt and more than 90 of the 6 million brazilians who voted were in favour of suspending debt payments for the time it took to carry out an audit to determine how much of it was illegitimate see in portuguese folha online brasil 90 dos votantes de plebiscito da cnbb pedem auditoria da dívida 14 09 2000 there was acute awareness of the illegitimate character of brazil s debt in a large part of the left and the brazilian population although the audit was provided for in the 1988 constitution the government had never carried it through after the popular referendum of september 2000 parliamentary representatives from the pt brought a draft bill to get it done it was in the aftermath of the referendum that the brazilian citizens debt audit was set up it subsequently joined the cadtm see the brazilian citizens debt audit website in portuguese see also maria lucia fattorelli s interview where she explains how the collaboration between her organization and the cadtm developed in french spanish and portuguese in 2005 during the 5th wsf the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent as pointed out above as soon as lula became president of brazil in 2003 he forgot his commitment to set up an audit of the debt in 2005 during the 5th world social forum the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst landless workers movement organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent next in brazil support for the struggle against illegitimate debt faded mainly because the mst considered that they should rack up their critical support of president lula s government as for the leadership of the cut they had deserted the fight against debt as soon as lula came to office as president nevertheless that did not prevent the brazilian citizens debt audit from battling on through thick and thin to denounce repayment of mainly illegitimate debt the cadtm international gave its constant support to this fight in 2007 at the behest of militants combating illegitimate debt in ecuador maria lucia fattorelli the coordinator of the brazilian citizens debt audit and myself for the cadtm became members of the committee for integral debt audit caic established by the new president of ecuador rafael correa the caic s task was to identify illegitimate debts contracted during the period of 1976 2006 our work reported to the government in september 2008 and made public in november of the same year resulted in the suspension of payments on a significant part of debt demanded from ecuador in the form of sovereign bonds mainly held by banks of the usa the unilateral suspension of payment brought about a resounding victory see eric toussaint hugo arias palacios aris chatzistefanou video the ecuador debt audit a seven minute summary ecuador imposed on its creditors a reduction of 70 of the debts concerned this enabled a significant increase in social spending from 2009 2010 it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative this is proved by what happened in the case of the brazilian firm odebrecht which i mentioned earlier the firm built a hydro electric power plant of very poor quality in ecuador odebrecht had overcharged for the work and had not complied with the technical specifications the plant was so badly built that it broke down the audit committee had identified the debt brazil was demanding of ecuador for the plant s construction as illegal and illegitimate despite the fact that it was obviously in the wrong the firm of odebrecht refused to indemnify the state of ecuador in september 2008 to force odebrecht to fulfil its obligations towards the government of ecuador president rafael correa sent the army to occupy the installations of the hydroelectric plant instead of backing up the progressive government of ecuador in face of odebrecht lula protested against ecuador s intervention and recalled his ambassador he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court correa accepted though knowing only too well that the arbitration would favour odebrecht indeed ecuador lost partially the government of brazil and odebrecht came out on top president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt called for by brazilian companies in paraguay now let us look at the case of paraguay an enclave country surrounded by brazil argentina and bolivia in december 2008 the progressive president fernando lugo who had been in office for six months invited me to help him create an audit committee of paraguayan debt i went to asunción for a personal interview with the president followed by a meeting with the paraguayan government see paraguay the belgian who met with the president is an adviser to correa and works with chavez see also interview with the economic and political analyst eric toussaint the itaipu treaty signed in 1973 could be declared void and it was clear that most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is always the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships the brazilian military junta and the paraguayan dictatorship of general stroessner the offending treaty dealt with the construction running and maintenance of what was at the time the biggest dam in the world the itaipu dam i had studied the matter in depth using the excellent documentation elaborated by paraguyan experts moreover a former member of staff of the cadtm in belgium the paraguayan jurist hugo ruiz diaz balbuena had become an adviser to president lugo which made contacts easier the international audit initiative with citizen participation had withered under pressure from the brazilian government during lula s presidency note that big brazilian companies are the main creditors of paraguay which they exploit although he had intended to sign a presidential decree creating the debt audit committee fernando lugo finally gave in to pressure from lula and his government who were protecting the interests of the brazilian firms who were creditors to persuade the paraguayan government to drop the idea of an international audit and of questioning the debt claimed by brazilian firms lula made a few marginal concessions and increased the amount brazil paid paraguay every year for electricity provided by the itaipu dam see a commentary in french of the agreement signed between paraguay and brazil in july 2009 that said despite the pressure from brazil an audit was carried out by the court of auditors in 2010 and 2011 see in french and spanish french only at the time i went back to paraguay at president fernando lugo s invitation in june 2012 he was eventually overthrown by a parliamentary coup to use a phrase that had been used in honduras in 2009 and was applied in brazil when dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula as president of brazil from 2011 was overthrown see eric toussaint paraguay juin 2012 honduras juin 2009 d un coup d etat à l autre in french or spanish the fact that the right was able to use this form of institutional coup d etat whether in brazil or in paraguay is partly due to the inability of those two left wing governments to affront creditors forcefully and carry out structural reform at the beginning of their mandates they enjoyed enormous popular support but this was deeply eroded by the disappointment engendered by conciliatory policies towards big capital both local and international by the time the right decided to take action people on the left were too disillusioned and disorientated to mobilize in defence of those in power the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 in 2009 the brazilian citizens debt audit managed to set up a parliamentary committee thanks particularly to active support from the psol socialism and freedom party yet pt mps joined conservative mps to prevent the committee from questioning the legitimacy of brazil s debt then president dilma rousseff 2011 2016 vetoed the organization of such an audit here is an assessment by maria lucia fattorelli in french the brazilian citizens debt audit conducted a tireless campaign of consciousness raising in brazil the group trained numerous local sections in brazil and organized correspondence courses to train activists who wanted to audit debt they organized several international rallies the coordinator maria lucia fattorelli also participated in the greek public debt truth committee in greece in 2015 before that she had coordinated the publication of a debt auditing handbook that was translated into french spanish and english maria lucia fattorelli citizen public debt audit experiences and methods in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos with the agreement of the majority of the psol leadership bolos set aside the issue of questioning debt payment he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem this caused a profound malaise within the psol to put it mildly indeed g bolos s electoral score as the psol candidate for the presidency fell far below the one the party had obtained in the previous presidential campaign in 2014 in 2014 the psol candidate luciana genro had vigorously defended the debt audit and the idea of suspending payments on debt identified as illegitimate g bolos only won a third of the votes luciana genro had won even though for the first time the psol had benefited from a considerable government subsidy for the electoral campaign it only goes to show that by watering down his positions the psol candidate lost part of the radical electorate that had previously supported the psol will this be a lasting development of the ten psol representatives in the brazilian parliament at present several maintain a clear position on debt but what is the true position of the party s leadership at the next psol congress to be held in may 2020 we shall see whether its militants will push for a return to policies more in line with the party s origins within the pt workers party which has 53 members of parliament acceptance of the debt system is deeply anchored in the party s official line and unfortunately we must not nourish any illusions to the contrary despite the criticisms aired above it is obvious that to counter bolsonaro left wing parties and social movements must unite in the broadest possible front only the future will tell whether the huge social mobilizations that have taken or are taking place in countries such as chile ecuador colombia haiti puerto rico and bolivia will find an echo in brazil

smartest advice for losers but in this case i am sure that the force is with me and the company babcock international lse bab a truly global defence group with 70 of sales from overseas it builds or participates in almost everything from nuclear plants to frigates submarines aviation and systems management profits are evenly spread across its land sea air and nuclear operations the compelling numbers include a forward multiple for 2020 of a mere nine times and a 5 dividend yield debt is low and it trades at a smidgeon above its book value the order book is a robust 18bn and the relatively new chair ceo and other key appointees seem sensible there are actually four forces western governments have woken up to the often lamentable state of their armed forces so defence budgets are rising the ever nihilistic and opportunist russian government is a clear threat and china s remorseless expansion of its armed forces is another while the reliability of america as an ally is in doubt in 2019 takeover approaches were made by a private equity firm and the outsourcing group serco with a market capitalisation of only 3bn it is vulnerable if it stumbles again it will be gobbled up what s not to like stephen connolly think technology and the companies that spring most to mind are the likes of facebook amazon and google their success has attracted so many investors that they re what market commentators sometimes call crowded trades but while everyone is focused on the leaders other stocks in a sector can be overlooked if not ignored altogether and this is where opportunities can lie one area is legacy tech these are the big names of yesteryear unloved today because they have been dismissed rightly or wrongly as ex growth think intel cisco oracle and sap for example one to watch in 2020 is ibm nyse ibm it s slowly declining as companies switch to the cloud and other new technologies and it hasn t kept up but it s making up for lost ground to get back on a growth track this year to turbo charge its cloud computing presence it paid 34bn for red hat a well regarded specialist that has been growing earnings at 25 annually it s already adding profit to ibm s bottom line and it s hoped this will accelerate next year as it sells into ibm s considerable network of existing relationships in the us and internationally alongside rationalising operations and selling off non core businesses ibm is likely to appoint a new chief executive in 2020 choosing red hat s jim whitehead which would underline the group s new direction would be well received and help further revitalise investor interest it s early days but the current price earnings ratio of just ten for an established highly cash generative global tech company making a push into one of the sector s fastest growing segments is far from expensive from these levels it won t take much in the way of positive news to give the shares a significant boost as the year progresses meantime unlike most tech stocks the downside looks limited given the big dividend yield of nearly 5 providing support dominic frisby i m so convinced this is going to be a big theme not so much next year as over the next decade that i ve actually set up a holding company to invest in it cypherpunk holdings cse hodl that theme is privacy you might tell your lover something you wouldn t tell your lawyer or your doctor something you wouldn t tell your mate yet information about what we read watch say buy or sell online gets used for purposes beyond the original one as the saying goes when the internet is free you are the product that information is then used to shape behaviour and influence your decisions to determine the content you receive what you do see read or watch to sell things to you and to make decisions about you the loan the insurance or the job you are offered in the wrong hands it could be used against you in some way perhaps even to spy on you your data could be stolen only now are people starting to wake up and think about this regulators have taken steps but technology is so advanced it has often moved on before any new rules are emerge we have little idea what is being used how or by whom we have little say in how it is used we have no power to object nor any ability to amend our data we have very little control over it the default setting of the internet is zero privacy the solution is privacy technology protecting our privacy limits the scope others have to use our information beyond the purpose for which it was supplied it allows greater control over our online

the crisis in hong kong over the last nine months has caused long term damage to the territory s reputation its status as asia s financial capital is no longer so secure companies will consider other locations for their regional headquarters and wealthy individuals will think about stashing their assets elsewhere singapore has the most to gain from this it s a major financial centre that offers the stability its larger rival conspicuously now lacks any medium term shift out of hong kong will benefit the singapore office market where rents are already recovering from a glut of new supply in 2016 2017 so this seems a good time to look at the local commercial property real estate investment trusts reits these offer a decent long term income at a time when global interest rates are set to fall again another factor likely to help buoy their share prices over the next year i hold capitaland commercial trust singapore cct which yields around 4 5 at a price of s 1 97 this conservatively run reit is the largest in its sector with around s 11bn in assets and reasonably low gearing 35 the portfolio is mostly good quality offices in singapore with around 22 in singapore retail and hotels and 8 in germany that should deliver a steadily growing income as rents rise my suggestion last year was tkh group a dutch industrial technology firm when i picked this the price was around 41 70 and at time of writing it is 48 6 including the dividend that s a return of around 19 before costs i still like tkh s mix of businesses but half year results were soft and guidance for full year results was trimmed in november a forecast price earnings ratio for 2019 of just under 19 would be okay if all was going well but looks vulnerable to disappointment now take profits max king the uk small cap trusts i recommended for 2019 struggled for most of the year but are enjoying a year end rally they should do well in 2020 but so should equities in general leaving investors spoilt for choice after minimal progress in 2019 earnings growth should accelerate in 2020 though this is largely discounted in us valuations it may be time for the rest of the world to catch up after the persistent outperformance of growth over value value investing has made a modest comeback in recent months it s tempting to back the new trend but it has quickly turned from a contrarian to a fashionable call as dudley moore s character said to the raf recruiter in the aftermyth of war sketch in beyond the fringe please sir i would like to join the few i m sorry came the reply there are far too many the high growth us technology giants may be due a pause but that doesn t mean that more moderate growth stocks won t continue to perform well two global trusts fit the bill well they are both growth orientated but have their feet firmly on the ground the monks investment trust lse mnks and the mid wynd international investment trust lse mwy the former is the stable mate of scottish mortgage at baillie gifford the latter a former baillie gifford trust now managed by artemis performance over one three and five years is similar and excellent but mid wynd with a market value of 250m is much smaller this may enable it to be nimbler in the stockmarket should there be a need to rotate the portfolio the shares of both trade at premiums to net asset value you get what you pay for and both have low dividend yields neither will shoot the lights out but nor will they give you sleepless nights given my record in 2019 you may not need to jump in now james mckeigue think of some of the great investors calls soros shorting the pound perhaps or the hedge funds that spotted flaws in subprime they all involve identifying a market anomaly something that looks unsustainable over the long term and then betting against it continuing at present there is a 700 mile long anomaly in the andes mountain range ecuadorian mining as francisco pizarro and his fellow conquistadores could have told you almost 500 years ago the andes is crammed full of gold silver and copper that s why we ve seen large mining industries develop in chile peru bolivia and colombia but not in ecuador that wasn t because of a lack of mineral resources despite the limited exploration more gold and copper has been found in ecuador than anywhere else in the world over the last 15 years instead a combination of social and economic factors an abundance of oil poor infrastructure and political instability all played a part meant ecuador never developed a large scale modern mining industry that anomaly clearly couldn t last forever in recent years successive governments have improved conditions for international miners and in 2019 ecuador s first ever world class mine began operation but this is just the beginning of the ecuadorian mining boom twelve of the world s major mining companies have already set up offices in ecuador and several more large projects will come onstream over the next few years of course there will be hiccups on the way ecuador remains a politically volatile country prone to protests yet over the long run mining is bound to grow in ecuador it has the mineral resources and as the country s politicians slowly get used to the extra tax dollars generated by mining while increasing numbers of ecuadorians find work in the labour intensive industry it will follow its andean cousins in developing a serious mining industry in peru and chile mining accounts for between 15 to 20 of gdp if ecuadorian mining grows to even half that size it will create huge wealth for investors fortunately for us there are two companies that give us a direct way to get in early on the story one is lundin gold toronto lug which built and operates ecuador s first large goldmine while the second is london listed explorer solgold lse solg which has the country s most exciting portfolio of projects to develop john stepek this time last year i tipped what i thought was a very dull stock indeed high street clothing retailer next lse nxt i saw it as a potential recovery play amid panic over both brexit and the annual high street bloodbath headline frenzy i don t expect it to shoot the lights out i said i was wrong it s up by about 75 since the tip on 28 december i can t claim that all of my tips do that well no please don t write in to remind me of just how true that statement is but i hope you acted on this one if you did then i don t expect it to repeat the feat this year but i d hang on to it it s a retail survivor and a quality stock so what about this year sticking with retail i m tempted to take a punt on a turnaround at marks spencer lse mks unlike next m s has had a terrible year because unlike next m s is not a terribly good company the share price is down by about 7 in the past 12 months while the wider market is up about 11 m s is a perennial turnaround stock with a long history of disappointing but even if current chairman archie norman can t salvage it the fact that the political uncertainty is now lifting in the uk see page 8 makes me think that even a duffer like m s will be lifted in the rush for exposure to uk plc and in this age of activist investing there s surely a price at which a professional troublemaker decides it s time to take a pop at the venerable brand the other area where i think we ll see surprises next year is the oil sector the oil price has been noticeably subdued this year caught between the narrative of over supply too much fracking and weak demand recession scares if global demand is better than expected next year and oil cartel opec sticks to its production cuts partly with the aim of propping up the valuation of state owned oil giant saudi aramco then oil could spring a nasty surprise on markets by heading higher that in turn could be good news for energy companies which have struggled this year so on that front i m going to go for another very boring stock oil major bp lse bp which is down about 6 over the past year so roughly flat after the dividend it s currently yielding around 6 5 david stevenson many of the funds i closely follow had a good last year but two stand out as relative laggards and might therefore present some opportunity over the long term one is phoenix spree deutschland a specialist london listed residential property company focused on the problematic berlin market i will take a closer look at it early next year the idea you should concentrate on now is an unashamedly long term play for the patient growth investor its a trust called syncona lse sync which is the uk s premier quoted life sciences venture capital vc investor this is a world class outfit with an excellent track record of realisations in businesses involved in the front line of biomedical research biotech stocks have slipped over the past few months and that has been a reason why the share price of this vc fund has weakened considerably at various points its looked like it might breach the 200p level looking at the most recent results the net asset value of the fund was just under 200p a share so at the current price you re not paying too much of a premium that reasonable pricing is because recent results showed that the portfolio had lost just under 12 largely because of the share price decline of quoted companies syncona holds nasdaq listed autolus for instance many biotech and genomics businesses have seen significant deratings in the last few months that said some of the businesses in the portfolio showed significant uplifts on valuations notably blue earth diagnostics and achilles therapeutics over the next ten years syncona aims to build a portfolio of 15 20 companies the idea is to add two or three every year in its strategic areas of focus including cell and gene therapy i am sure the share price will be volatile on that ten year journey but for growth investors who aren t in a rush there is no better way of buying into private lifesciences vc mike tubbs biotechnology is a major growth area of the 21st century it is driving revolutions in new biologic drugs diagnostics crops and farm animal genetics that is why i recommended a drug discovery biotech vertex pharmaceuticals for 2018 and a picks shovels antibody company abcam for 2019 vertex is up 41 2 since my recommendation in early january 2018 while the ftse 100 has lost 5 5 abcam is up 30 3 from december 2018 compared with a 9 2 increase in the ftse 100 i am staying with biotech for my 2020 recommendation and selecting a biotech with the world s largest antibody library which it is using to generate new antibody drugs those that stimulate the immune system some are developed in partnership with big pharmaceutical companies with a royalty taken on sales while others are developed internally to retain more of the profits the company is morphosys xetra mor and it has a well stocked pipeline with over 100 distinct drugs in r d and over 70 clinical trials in progress it has 12 big pharma partners including gsk johnson johnson novartis pfizer and roche morphosys has just one drug on the market tremfya for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis it has partnered with johnson johnson in this case tremfya is in ten late stage trials for related conditions meanwhile morphosys is preparing to seek regulatory approval for its most advanced proprietary drug tafasitamab for blood cancers excluding these two drugs there are another 34 late stage clinical trials in progress including tests of an alzheimer s drug morphosys is still loss making with a net loss of 52 7m for the first nine months of 2019 on sales of 61m but its healthy cash pile of 412 4m should see it through to profit the main risk is of late stage clinical trial failures which delay profitability and require the raising of extra funds the share price is around 127 up 43 from 90 50 at the start of this year buy andrew van sickle people always vote with their feet so i was struck by last week s news that the 2 5 million strong polish diaspora is beginning to return home the number of poles based abroad dropped by 85 000 last year you can see why last year poland became the first country from the region to be ranked a developed market by index provider ftse russell a testament to its progress since the collapse of the soviet bloc it has been growing non stop for over a quarter of a century and over the past few years gdp has expanded by 3 6 a year but there should be plenty more to come like the rest of the region poland is still converging with the wealthier part of the continent its gdp per capita is still around 15 500 compared with germany s 40 000 eastern europe is dependent on the eurozone s business cycle but poland is less so than most exports comprise just 50 of gdp compared with 78 for the czech republic its large domestic market tempers the impact of a continental or global downturn poland was the only eu country to avoid a recession in 2008 2009 with unemployment at just 3 2 and household debt a mere 35 of gdp britain s is 84 there is ample scope for consumption to grow for years to come one potential problem to keep an eye on is the country s government whose authoritarian and statist instincts have unnerved investors so far however the ruling law and justice party seems to have had little impact on the population s dynamism and entrepreneurial instincts in any case the danger is arguably priced in poland is on a cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio cape of just 11 making it one of the world s cheapest stockmarkets by this measure it doesn t deserve to be that makes the msci poland ucits etf lse ipol worth tucking away

after the 2007 8 financial crisis hit the world harvard s professor of economics n gregory mankiw wrote in the new york times in 2008 on how john maynard keynes s diagnosis of recessions and depressions would explain the challenges confronting the world then according to keynes the root cause of economic downturns is insufficient aggregate demand when the total demand for goods and services declines businesses throughout the economy see their sales fall off lower sales induce firms to cut back production and to lay off workers rising unemployment and declining profits further depress demand leading to a feedback loop with a very unhappy ending the situation reverses keynesian theory says only when some event or policy increases aggregate demand this description and prescription fit the current indian economic situation to the t also read budget 2020 individual centric tax policies are need of the hour here is how a none disputes that indian economy is facing demand depression the first concrete indication of this came when the nso s consumer expenditure survey of 2017 18 leaked out in november 2019 it showed that the real per capita household expenditure had fallen for the first time in more than 40 years from rs 1 501 in 2011 12 to rs 1 446 in 2017 18 the government of india promptly junked it on flimsy grounds but the truth was out there are a few other indicators too private consumption dipped in recent months it wasn t until the growth in the private final consumption expenditure pfce which contributes 56 57 to the gdp started slowing down it was then that the finance ministry red flagged slowdown in the economy in may 2019 now the latest data from the national statistical office nso the first advance estimate of national income released on january 7 2020 projects the pfce growth to hit a low of 5 8 in fy20 from 8 1 in fy19 the graph below shows quarterly growth in pfce growth slowing down since q2 of fy19 an uptick in q2 of fy20 consumer confidence at several years low consumer confidence is also a good indicator the rbi s latest survey released in december 2019 shows that the consumer sentiment is at several years low both the sentiment on the current situation and future expectations have plummeted in november 2019 as presented below also read budget 2020 niti aayog shocker poverty hunger and income inequality up in 22 to 25 states and uts rbi s latest consumer confidence survey released on dec 5 2019 b nobody doubts that unemployment is rising the mumbai based business information company centre for monitoring indian economy s cmie monthly survey of employment with a sample size of over 1 5 lakh households which is bigger than that of the nso s shows that the unemployment is rising steadily from 5 49 in q1 of fy19 to 7 64 in q3 of fy20 monthly data plotted for quarterly movement using simple moving average for a quarter steadily rising unemployment rate as for the official data the last periodic labour force survey plfs of 2017 18 showed a 45 year high unemployment rate at 6 1 this report was delayed by six months and was released only after the 2019 general elections concluded this report also showed that the labour force participation rate lfpr fell from 55 9 in 2011 12 to 49 8 in 2017 18 this means that more than 50 of the working age population had dropped out of the job market presumably because there weren t enough jobs to look for an analysis of the plfs unit level data of 2017 18 and 2011 12 by the azim premji university later revealed that for the first time in india s history 9 million jobs were lost in those six years c nobody doubts corporate profits are declining the rbi in its assessment of private corporate businesses for q2 of fy20 found that growth in net profits of corporate entities had fallen to 54 3 from 41 7 in q2 of fy19 because industrial demand had weakened and that this weakening in demand was broad based across industries this was based on a survey of 2 696 companies rbi data showing fall in corporate net profit now that the diagnosis of the state of india s economy fits prof mankiw s observations it wouldn t be farfetched to imagine a very unhappy ending unless prompt corrective actions are not taken what keynes would have prescribed the keynesian prescriptions are well known more so after the 2007 08 financial crisis deficit spending government spending more than its revenue to make up for declining investment and raise aggregate demand it focuses on demand side measures for boosting the economy in the short run that deficit spending in a demand depression situation a would not lead to inflation because of high unemployment and low industrial production as is the case in india or b crowd out private investment which is depressed in spite of lowering of interest rate and corporate tax cut are something economists don t disagree with and hence needs no elaboration as for the rising fiscal deficit nobel laureate abhijit banerjee keeps repeating that fiscal tightening is not what india needs in the current situation another nobel laureate paul krugman too supported the idea of fiscal expansion in the context of the 2007 08 financial crisis when lower interest rates failed to boost investment though he mentions when even zero interest rate fails to boost investment rather than fiscal austerity which makes a bad situation worse not just that even the champions of neo liberal policies such as the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have changed their stand on fiscal austerity post structural adjustment programme sap proposed and pursued vigorously for years by them and the 2007 8 global financial crisis also read budget 2020 taxation of dividends the next reform in a 2016 study provocatively titled neo liberalism oversold three leading imf economists batted for fiscal expansion particularly for economies with a strong track record of being fiscally responsible saying austerity policies not only generate substantial welfare costs due to supply side channels bottlenecks they also hurt demand and thus worsen employment and unemployment they also refuted the notion that fiscal consolidation can be expansionary that is raise output and employment by observing however in practice episodes of fiscal consolidation have been followed on average by drops rather than by expansion in output on average a consolidation of 1 per cent of gdp increases the long term unemployment rate by 0 6 percentage point and raises by 1 5 per cent within five years the gini measure of income inequality government of india s diagnosis downturn cyclical not structural the current slowdown is treated as a cyclical one rather than a structural one by the government of india the last such assertion was made by none other than the chief economic advisor cea krishnamurthy subramanian who said on december 9 2019 the current slowdown is a lot more on the cyclical side this cyclical approach does not in any way invalidate the keynesian prescriptions deficit spending can also be a countercyclical fiscal policy measure to address depressed economic activity and unemployment investment led approach a supply side solution to a demand side problem ever since the new economic survey of 2018 19 was unveiled in july 2019 advocating an investment led growth model the central government s response to the deepening economic crisis has primarily been to boost investment especially the private sector investment cut in corporate tax bank mergers recapitalisation of banks cut in gst rates cut in benchmark repo rate and higher depreciation on vehicles etc this is a supply side solution boosting private investment to drive growth to what is clearly a demand side problem demand depression the other issue with this approach is that it takes a longer time to bear fruit while the keynesian approach demand side policy boosts the economy in the short run in fact a 2014 imf paper states what the keynesian solution would be to break a cyclical slowdown keynesian economists would advocate deficit spending on labour intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilise wages during economic downturns part ii of this article would look at where the government could spend more to revive consumption demand as a step to revive the economy

january it s a good time for swims bbqs and sorry to ruin the fun financial health check ups while borrowers and investors in share markets have had reason to pop champagne over the festive season savers have had to opt for the cheap bubbly last year saw central banks around the world including the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz cut interest rates to encourage people to borrow and spend to stimulate the economy and boost inflation this saw the otherwise slowing new zealand housing market reignited and investors being offered peanuts for putting their money in term deposits chase yields in commercial property and shares looking to 2020 the fund managers interest co nz spoke to predict we re in for a smoother ride jitters over brexit and the us china trade war have to some extent been allayed locally the coalition government isn t changing the tax system and banks aren t being made to hold as much additional capital as initially proposed uncertainty still exists australia is on fire there are tensions in the middle east a number of trade agreements need to be negotiated donald trump s still on twitter and economic growth isn t amazing around the world accordingly monetary policy will almost certainly remain expansionary the rbnz is expected to cut the official cash rate ocr one more time by 25 basis points if not keep it where it is at a record low 1 borrowing will continue to be cheap pushing people towards the property market meanwhile returns from shares are expected to keep looking relatively attractive however without sugar hits from the federal reserve changing tack and cutting interest rates and the rbnz cutting the ocr by twice as much as expected in one go share values aren t expected to increase as much as they did in 2019 focus to shift to companies earnings pie funds chief investment officer mark devcich maintains companies will have to deliver strong earnings to justify higher share valuations if they don t prices will fall in other words while equity market growth was largely driven by interest rate cuts in 2019 he sees investors looking more towards earnings growth in 2020 devcich says provided there are no signs of recession particularly in the us equity markets are an attractive place to invest bull markets don t die of old age but isn t it a bad idea investing in potentially over valued stocks not if the only alternatives are investing in bonds or cash which are widely expected to continue being low yielding while interest rates remain low devcich says milford asset management portfolio manager mark riggall agrees saying high share valuations aren t a hurdle at the moment summer kiwisaver s investment committee chair martin hawes says bull markets don t die because they re old they die because of a specific event the equity market won t crash solely because it s been growing for several years now bulls and bears in balance while the contents of this article shouldn t be considered financial advice the general rule is that an investor should identify their risk appetite and stick to the corresponding type of asset allocation through the good times and bad so if you d like to cash in on your investment in the next few years you should invest conservatively by having more cash and bonds in your portfolio than equities for example whereas if you have several years to recoup any losses you can afford to invest proportionately more in high risk high reward shares and less in bonds and cash while fund managers will deviate slightly from target asset allocations depending on market conditions hawes maintains the market is currently well balanced so there s no real need for this share prices are pretty high so he wouldn t suggest investors rush out to buy more shares than they had otherwise planned conversely there s no financial incentive to put more money in the bank than an investor s target asset allocation suggests nz vs overseas looking at equity markets there are of course a number of approaches one can take to investing within this asset class providers of low cost index trackers will tell investors that in the long run the market always beats people trying to pick stocks however active managers say they can soften blows during downturns and enhance gains during upswings as someone who picks stocks hawes prefers being weighted towards new zealand shares versus overseas ones because he has good networks here making him better equipped to beat the market it can be difficult for a fund manager sitting in wellington to beat a fund manager sitting in new york when it comes to investing in us companies in saying so hawes is concerned that because most of the new zealand market is owned by overseas investors the nzx will be hit hard in the event of a downturn sure there are kiwisaver funds invested locally but if overseas investors retreat we ll certainly feel it riggall of milford says over the past couple of years he s been more weighted internationally he sees better opportunities overseas noting the limited nature of companies in the new zealand market bond markets and the fiscal stimulus trend turning to the bond market the consensus is that yields will remain low as interest rates aren t expected to rise significantly anytime soon differences in returns in the bond market will stem from the duration of bonds as well as their risk profiles ie whether they re typically lower risk government bonds or higher risk corporate bonds kiwi invest s head of fixed interest diana gordon is wary of the uptick in issuance of longer term bonds as there s a trend for governments around the world to turn to fiscal policy to stimulate economies monetary policy or cutting interest rates has done much of the heavy lifting since the 2008 global financial crisis getting people to spend so governments are under pressure to open their wallets to spur growth by investing in infrastructure cutting taxes increasing benefits etc governments will accordingly look to issue bonds to raise money and because much of this debt may be longer term gordon is mindful greater supply of these sorts of bonds could lower prices she therefore believes it s prudent to invest in bonds with shorter 4 8 year maturities also bonds with longer maturities are more sensitive to market changes

after experiencing a whole year with a far right president as head of state in brazil namely jair bolsonaro we have to try and understand the steps that led to this situation summary changes in the pt and the cut why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 i arrived in sao paulo the financial and economic capital of brazil on the night of 14 november 2019 the city has over 12 million inhabitants in all the districts i visited poverty is flagrant you see homeless people living on the street with no access to sanitation of any kind and prey to the most extreme poverty a significant number of people are undernourished reliable sources mention about 100 000 people who live on the streets of sao paulo 25 000 of them permanently and 75 000 on a temporary basis i first came to sao paulo in december 1991 to participate in the first congress of the workers party partido dos trabalhadores or pt led by the former metal worker lula at that time lula and the pt stood for the struggle against odious and illegitimate debt see the interview i had with him in managua in july 1991 he said among other things any third world government that decides to further repay the external debt chooses to lead his people into the abyss lula had led workers strikes against the dictatorship in the 1980s and in 1988 a democratic regime replaced the dictatorship after a transitional stage the bases of the main trade union federation cut central única de trabalhadores or unified workers central and of the new party the pt had been brought together during the valiant struggle against the dictatorship the pt had been built from the bottom by activists in social movements and small very active politically radical organizations the cut and the pt were against repaying debt and wanted a citizens audit part of the debt had been accumulated during the military dictatorship which lasted more than 20 years and afterwards it increased steeply during the debt crisis in the 1980s a crisis that resulted from commodity prices plummeting while washington had decided on a sharp increase in interest rates more generally the pt clearly stated that radical anti capitalist policies had to be implemented which were to lead to the construction of a democratic socialist self managed and anti bureaucratic society this outcome stirred genuine enthusiasm in brazil and beyond i went to sao paulo in 1991 in order to prepare lula s and another pt leader marco aurelio garcia s visit to belgium at the invitation of the cadtm the talks were to take place some ten days before christmas 1991 eventually for health reasons lula couldn t come over and was replaced by marco aurelio garcia who became president of the pt in 2006 and was lula s main adviser on foreign policy while lula was president from 2003 to 2011 i met lula four or five times from 1991 to 2003 i can remember a long discussion we had in havana in 1993 it followed upon a meeting lula had had with fidel castro and daniel ortega lula explained that in order to become president of brazil he had to neutralize us imperialism the army and the brazilian bourgeoisie i understood that he meant not to thwart us strategic interests and to promise the army leadership and big capital that he would implement no measures that went against their interests lula told me that he would be the president of all brazilians as was all too often said what i understood was that he would use his experience as a trade unionist to seal a pact between those at the bottom and those at the top asking those at the top to concede some improvements in purchasing power i e allowing the state to increase social aid with public money while those at the bottom would accept that nothing would really change at the structural level this is indeed what he attempted to do when he was president ten years later i saw him for the last time in june 2003 and stated how much i disapproved of the neoliberal reform he had introduced into the civil service pension system the meeting occurred on the occasion of the g8 annual summit united states canada japan germany united kingdom france italy russia in evian on 1 and 2 june 2003 several heads of states that did not belong to the g8 had been invited by the french president jacques chirac who wished to show that the g8 and france in particular were open to dialogue with the rest of the world among those who had responded positively were president lula of brazil and the heads of states or governments of china india nigeria senegal south africa egypt and mexico chirac was trying to give legitimacy to the g8 an informal club of major global powers at a time when its credibility was in question particularly after the brutal repression of the counter g8 protest in genoa in 2001 president chirac s guests met in evian before the actual g8 summit meeting while over 100 000 marched through the streets of geneva switzerland and annemasse france shouting g8 is illegal luis inacio lula da silva wanted to meet leaders of the european anti globalization movements there were four delegates the president of attac france a woman representative of the italian social forum a swedish woman representative of the campaign against the wto and myself for the cadtm the meeting occurred in geneva in the residence of the brazilian ambassador and it highlighted the gap between lula and the international anti globalization movements see my interview president lula s realpolitik and the alterglobalisation movement changes in the pt and the cut it should be pointed out that during the 1990s the position of the pt and the cut was gradually watered down the pt won many elected officials in large cities as well as in small and medium sized towns in particular the pt had mayors elected in sao paulo and porto alegre where it gradually adopted a managerial orientation and lost its role as a spur to radical anti capitalist changes i followed this process of adaptation to the institutions of the capitalist state with great disappointment when lula was elected president of brazil at the end of 2002 with a landslide 65 of the votes he and the pt had fundamentally changed they no longer really questioned the capitalist system and lula signed a letter of submission to the imf in the middle of the election campaign in august 2002 in this letter he solemnly declared that if elected president he would abide strictly by the previous government s agreements with the imf only a couple of months after his election he introduced a neoliberal reform of retirement pensions lula also appointed as president of the central bank one of the big bosses henrique meirelles former president of one of the major us banks in brazil the fleet boston the message was clear a representative of the capitalist class was at the head of the central bank lula did not interfere with the army and did not suspend the amnesty extended to those officers of the dictatorship responsible for crimes against humanity this is a major difference with argentina where the 1986 amnesty was cancelled in 2005 which made it possible to condemn and incarcerate several military leaders including the major figures of the military dictatorship enforced in 1976 under the lula presidency the brazilian army participated in the occupation of haiti which was denounced by haitian social movements the top brazilian military leader during the occupation of haiti became a member of bolsonaro s government in 2019 under lula s presidency not a single private corporation was brought back into the public sector on the contrary he supported the interests of private corporations that did not hesitate to bribe civil servants in order to secure procurements as was the case for the emblematic construction company odebrecht see euronews what is the odebrecht corruption scandal in latin america and who is implicated the lula government scrupulously repaid its debts without carrying out the audit he had called for when he was in the opposition to qualify this highly critical assessment it should be mentioned that the lula government developed a policy of public aid to the poorest through the distribution of social benefits under the programme entitled bolsa familia family grant this programme improved the income of more than 12 million families i e about 20 of brazil s poorest families please note that the amount of aid was limited at the time of the pt government a family of three could receive a maximum of 50 euros it should be noted that bolsonaro has not stopped this programme which in 2019 benefited 13 5 million families i e one fifth of brazilian families in 2019 a poor family could receive a maximum of 200 reales per month at the exchange rate of november 2019 that is around 40 euros to be entitled to this grant the family must show that its monthly income is below 89 reales that is 20 euros or less than one euro a day per family why did the lula government not combat illegitimate public debt the lula government did not combat illegitimate public debt because they did not want to antagonize brazilian big capital questioning debt repayment as a government would have meant conflict with brazilian big capital which benefits largely from the debt buying brazil s internal and external public debt securities these insure a high return since interest rates are very high questioning debt repayment would also involve conflict with major private banks and foreign investment funds as well as with the imf lula and the pt leadership wanted to avoid such conflicts as they gave legitimacy to the debt continued paying it and went even further calling on big capital to contract new public loans the lula government was tolerated or even appreciated by the bourgeoisie all the more so as social measures that benefited people with the lowest income increased the purchasing power of the poor which was good for capitalists business lula s neoliberal policies resulted in a split within the pt with a new party emerging to its left in 2004 that party is the psol party for socialism and freedom since 2001 i often went back to brazil for the large gatherings of the world social forums around 100 000 people participated each time for meetings of the wsf s international council of which i had been a member from the start and for meetings of social movements there were meetings organized by the brazilian citizens debt audit a member of the cadtm s international network the cadtm s international network repeatedly sent significant delegations to brazil for wsf activities particularly in porto alegre in 2005 and in belem in 2009 when one of the cadtm s world assemblies was held the political situation has changed a lot as pointed out above from 2003 onward the pt clearly turned away from its revolutionary past to become a manager of the system this eventually resulted in deep disappointment not to say distrust especially since several of its leaders were actively involved in major corruption cases including lula himself eventually when the bourgeoisie felt it could manage the country without the pt s collaboration it exposed the party as corrupt this while all other traditional parties are just as deeply corrupt or much more dilma rousseff the pt leader who won the 2010 presidential elections and became president of brazil in 2011 was impeached by the senate in 2016 in what was actually an institutional coup d etat see in french spanish or portuguese but disappointment towards the pt was so deep that the brazilian people hardly mobilized to defend the pt and its leaders in 2016 and the right wing vice president michel temer appointed by the pt in 2011 replaced dilma rousseff pt as president after masterminding the institutional coup later the antisocial policies implemented by president temer a corrupt right wing leader eventually stirred some popular support for lula as a credible candidate to be reelected president in 2018 so the judiciary system largely controlled by big capital was relentless in its efforts to prevent lula from running for president despite his imprisonment lula was the most likely to win and his supporters hoped that he would be able to participate in the elections this is why the judiciary prohibited him from running and jair bolsonaro was elected president end of 2018 and started his mandate in early 2019 bolsonaro is a far right politician yearning for dictatorship see a racist sexist homophobic climate change negationist he is similar to trump while possibly even further to the right his deeply reactionary and antipopular nature is beyond doubt see in french or spanish on 21 october 2018 at the end of the election campaign he stated that if he was elected president he would conduct a purge such as brazil has never known he affirmed that the leaders of the workers party must all rot in prison and said of the leftist movements they will have to submit to the law like everyone else either they leave or they go to jail shortly after starting his mandate he promised to remove civil servants with communist ideas his election is a real tragedy for the brazilian people and for the international left after bolsonaro s victory a large part of the left fortunately formed a united front and demanded lula s liberation they got it in early november 2019 and lula immediately started a political campaign to win the presidential elections in 2022 this being said we should not expect lula to go back to the sources of the pt his orientation remains the one that prevailed from 2003 to 2016 but he might get elected in 2022 since it is clear that bolsonaro if he completes his mandate will have implemented antisocial policies that increase poverty and deepen the gap between a handful of very rich and the overwhelming majority of brazil s population obviously we need to mobilize widely against the bolsonaro government and in spite of disagreements with the pt we need a broad left wing front within which the pt will play an active part auditing brazil s debt from 2000 and ecuador s in 2007 2008 the brazilian citizens debt audit is an organization founded in the early 2000s in 2000 a referendum was organized on popular initiative by the mst landless workers movement the cut brazil s jubilee south campaign the national conference of bishops which has been positioned on the left since the years 1980 1990 with the support of the pt and more than 90 of the 6 million brazilians who voted were in favour of suspending debt payments for the time it took to carry out an audit to determine how much of it was illegitimate see in portuguese folha online brasil 90 dos votantes de plebiscito da cnbb pedem auditoria da dívida 14 09 2000 there was acute awareness of the illegitimate character of brazil s debt in a large part of the left and the brazilian population although the audit was provided for in the 1988 constitution the government had never carried it through after the popular referendum of september 2000 parliamentary representatives from the pt brought a draft bill to get it done it was in the aftermath of the referendum that the brazilian citizens debt audit was set up it subsequently joined the cadtm see the brazilian citizens debt audit website in portuguese see also maria lucia fattorelli s interview where she explains how the collaboration between her organization and the cadtm developed in french spanish and portuguese in 2005 during the 5th wsf the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent as pointed out above as soon as lula became president of brazil in 2003 he forgot his commitment to set up an audit of the debt in 2005 during the 5th world social forum the brazilian citizens debt audit the cadtm and jubilee south with the support of the mst landless workers movement organized a three day long tribunal against debt in porto alegre which brought together 1000 participants from every continent next in brazil support for the struggle against illegitimate debt faded mainly because the mst considered that they should rack up their critical support of president lula s government as for the leadership of the cut they had deserted the fight against debt as soon as lula came to office as president nevertheless that did not prevent the brazilian citizens debt audit from battling on through thick and thin to denounce repayment of mainly illegitimate debt the cadtm international gave its constant support to this fight in 2007 at the behest of militants combating illegitimate debt in ecuador maria lucia fattorelli the coordinator of the brazilian citizens debt audit and myself for the cadtm became members of the committee for integral debt audit caic established by the new president of ecuador rafael correa the caic s task was to identify illegitimate debts contracted during the period of 1976 2006 our work reported to the government in september 2008 and made public in november of the same year resulted in the suspension of payments on a significant part of debt demanded from ecuador in the form of sovereign bonds mainly held by banks of the usa the unilateral suspension of payment brought about a resounding victory see eric toussaint hugo arias palacios aris chatzistefanou video the ecuador debt audit a seven minute summary ecuador imposed on its creditors a reduction of 70 of the debts concerned this enabled a significant increase in social spending from 2009 2010 it is important to note that president lula did not help ecuador with its debt auditing initiative this is proved by what happened in the case of the brazilian firm odebrecht which i mentioned earlier the firm built a hydro electric power plant of very poor quality in ecuador odebrecht had overcharged for the work and had not complied with the technical specifications the plant was so badly built that it broke down the audit committee had identified the debt brazil was demanding of ecuador for the plant s construction as illegal and illegitimate despite the fact that it was obviously in the wrong the firm of odebrecht refused to indemnify the state of ecuador in september 2008 to force odebrecht to fulfil its obligations towards the government of ecuador president rafael correa sent the army to occupy the installations of the hydroelectric plant instead of backing up the progressive government of ecuador in face of odebrecht lula protested against ecuador s intervention and recalled his ambassador he demanded that rafael correa cease applying pressure on odebrecht and persuaded him to take it to arbitration in a paris court correa accepted though knowing only too well that the arbitration would favour odebrecht indeed ecuador lost partially the government of brazil and odebrecht came out on top president lula s intervention in 2009 to prevent the launch of a committee to audit odious debt called for by brazilian companies in paraguay now let us look at the case of paraguay an enclave country surrounded by brazil argentina and bolivia in december 2008 the progressive president fernando lugo who had been in office for six months invited me to help him create an audit committee of paraguayan debt i went to asunción for a personal interview with the president followed by a meeting with the paraguayan government see paraguay the belgian who met with the president is an adviser to correa and works with chavez see also interview with the economic and political analyst eric toussaint the itaipu treaty signed in 1973 could be declared void and it was clear that most of paraguay s debt could be qualified as odious as it resulted as is always the case from a major agreement made in the 1970s between two military dictatorships the brazilian military junta and the paraguayan dictatorship of general stroessner the offending treaty dealt with the construction running and maintenance of what was at the time the biggest dam in the world the itaipu dam i had studied the matter in depth using the excellent documentation elaborated by paraguyan experts moreover a former member of staff of the cadtm in belgium the paraguayan jurist hugo ruiz diaz balbuena had become an adviser to president lugo which made contacts easier the international audit initiative with citizen participation had withered under pressure from the brazilian government during lula s presidency note that big brazilian companies are the main creditors of paraguay which they exploit although he had intended to sign a presidential decree creating the debt audit committee fernando lugo finally gave in to pressure from lula and his government who were protecting the interests of the brazilian firms who were creditors to persuade the paraguayan government to drop the idea of an international audit and of questioning the debt claimed by brazilian firms lula made a few marginal concessions and increased the amount brazil paid paraguay every year for electricity provided by the itaipu dam see a commentary in french of the agreement signed between paraguay and brazil in july 2009 that said despite the pressure from brazil an audit was carried out by the court of auditors in 2010 and 2011 see in french and spanish french only at the time i went back to paraguay at president fernando lugo s invitation in june 2012 he was eventually overthrown by a parliamentary coup to use a phrase that had been used in honduras in 2009 and was applied in brazil when dilma rousseff who had succeeded lula as president of brazil from 2011 was overthrown see eric toussaint paraguay juin 2012 honduras juin 2009 d un coup d etat à l autre in french or spanish the fact that the right was able to use this form of institutional coup d etat whether in brazil or in paraguay is partly due to the inability of those two left wing governments to affront creditors forcefully and carry out structural reform at the beginning of their mandates they enjoyed enormous popular support but this was deeply eroded by the disappointment engendered by conciliatory policies towards big capital both local and international by the time the right decided to take action people on the left were too disillusioned and disorientated to mobilize in defence of those in power the brazilian citizens debt audit from 2009 to 2019 in 2009 the brazilian citizens debt audit managed to set up a parliamentary committee thanks particularly to active support from the psol socialism and freedom party yet pt mps joined conservative mps to prevent the committee from questioning the legitimacy of brazil s debt then president dilma rousseff 2011 2016 vetoed the organization of such an audit here is an assessment by maria lucia fattorelli in french the brazilian citizens debt audit conducted a tireless campaign of consciousness raising in brazil the group trained numerous local sections in brazil and organized correspondence courses to train activists who wanted to audit debt they organized several international rallies the coordinator maria lucia fattorelli also participated in the greek public debt truth committee in greece in 2015 before that she had coordinated the publication of a debt auditing handbook that was translated into french spanish and english maria lucia fattorelli citizen public debt audit experiences and methods in 2018 during the electoral campaign the brazilian citizens debt audit was bitterly disappointed by the presidential campaign of the psol candidate guilherme bolos with the agreement of the majority of the psol leadership bolos set aside the issue of questioning debt payment he considered that continuing debt repayments was not really a problem this caused a profound malaise within the psol to put it mildly indeed g bolos s electoral score as the psol candidate for the presidency fell far below the one the party had obtained in the previous presidential campaign in 2014 in 2014 the psol candidate luciana genro had vigorously defended the debt audit and the idea of suspending payments on debt identified as illegitimate g bolos only won a third of the votes luciana genro had won even though for the first time the psol had benefited from a considerable government subsidy for the electoral campaign it only goes to show that by watering down his positions the psol candidate lost part of the radical electorate that had previously supported the psol will this be a lasting development of the ten psol representatives in the brazilian parliament at present several maintain a clear position on debt but what is the true position of the party s leadership at the next psol congress to be held in may 2020 we shall see whether its militants will push for a return to policies more in line with the party s origins within the pt workers party which has 53 members of parliament acceptance of the debt system is deeply anchored in the party s official line and unfortunately we must not nourish any illusions to the contrary despite the criticisms aired above it is obvious that to counter bolsonaro left wing parties and social movements must unite in the broadest possible front only the future will tell whether the huge social mobilizations that have taken or are taking place in countries such as chile ecuador colombia haiti puerto rico and bolivia will find an echo in brazil

christopher cai jackson runte isabel ostrer kacey berry ninez ponce michael rodriguez stefano bertozzi justin s white james g kahn abstract background the united states is the only high income nation without universal government funded or mandated health insurance employing a unified payment system the us multi payer system leaves residents uninsured or underinsured despite overall healthcare costs far above other nations single payer often referred to as medicare for all a proposed policy solution since 1990 is receiving renewed press attention and popular support our review seeks to assess the projected cost impact of a single payer approach methods and findings we conducted our literature search between june 1 and december 31 2018 without start date restriction for included studies we surveyed an expert panel and searched pubmed google google scholar and preexisting lists for formal economic studies of the projected costs of single payer plans for the us or for individual states reviewer pairs extracted data on methods and findings using a template we quantified changes in total costs standardized to percentage of contemporaneous healthcare spending additionally we quantified cost changes by subtype such as costs due to increased healthcare utilization and savings due to simplified payment administration lower drug costs and other factors we further examined how modeling assumptions affected results our search yielded economic analyses of the cost of 22 single payer plans over the past 30 years exclusions were due to inadequate technical data or assuming a substantial ongoing role for private insurers we found that 19 86 of the analyses predicted net savings median net result was a savings of 3 46 of total costs in the first year of program operation and 20 91 predicted savings over several years anticipated growth rates would result in long term net savings for all plans the largest source of savings was simplified payment administration median 8 8 and the best predictors of net savings were the magnitude of utilization increase and savings on administration and drug costs r2 of 0 035 0 43 and 0 62 respectively only drug cost savings remained significant in multivariate analysis included studies were heterogeneous in methods which precluded us from conducting a formal meta analysis conclusions in this systematic review we found a high degree of analytic consensus for the fiscal feasibility of a single payer approach in the us actual costs will depend on plan features and implementation future research should refine estimates of the effects of coverage expansion on utilization evaluate provider administrative costs in varied existing single payer systems analyze implementation options and evaluate us based single payer programs as available author summary why was this study done as the us healthcare debate continues there is growing interest in single payer also known as medicare for all single payer uses a simplified public funding approach to provide everyone with high quality health insurance public support for provision of universal health coverage through a plan like medicare for all is as high as 70 but falls when costs are emphasized economic models help assess the financial viability of single payer yet models vary widely in their assumptions and methods and can be hard to compare what did the researchers do and find we found and compared cost analyses of 22 single payer plans for the us or individual states nineteen 86 of the analyses estimated that health expenditures would fall in the first year and all suggested the potential for long term cost savings the largest savings were predicted to come from simplified billing and lower drug costs studies funded by organizations across the political spectrum estimated savings for single payer what do these findings mean there is near consensus in these analyses that single payer would reduce health expenditures while providing high quality insurance to all us residents to achieve net savings single payer plans rely on simplified billing and negotiated drug price reductions as well as global budgets to control spending growth over time replacing private insurers with a public system is expected to achieve lower net healthcare costs citation cai c runte j ostrer i berry k ponce n rodriguez m et al

veterans administration introduction nine years after passage of the affordable care act 10 4 27 9 million of the nonelderly us population remains uninsured lack of insurance is associated with worse health outcomes including death due to decreased access to healthcare and preventive services underinsurance defined as cost sharing that represents significant financial barriers to care or risk of catastrophic medical expenditures is rising and is associated with a 25 or greater likelihood of omitted or delayed care low income adults with public insurance have improved access and quality of care compared to uninsured adults meanwhile healthcare costs continue to rise approaching one fifth of the economy in 2018 national health expenditures reached 3 6 trillion equivalent to 17 7 of gdp government funding including public programs private insurance for government employees and tax subsidies for private insurance represented 64 of national health expenditures in 2013 or 11 of gdp more than total health expenditures in almost any other nation higher costs in the us are due primarily to higher prices and administrative inefficiency not higher utilization an oft proposed alternative to the contemporary multi payer system is single payer also referred to as medicare for all key elements of single payer include unified government or quasi government financing universal coverage with a single comprehensive benefit package elimination of private insurers and universal negotiation of provider reimbursement and drug prices single payer as it has been proposed in the us has no or minimal cost sharing polled support for single payer is near an all time high as high as two thirds of americans and 55 of physicians two thirds of americans support providing universal health coverage through a national plan like medicare for all as an extremely high priority for the incoming congress however support varies substantially according to how single payer is described as of november 2019 there are 2 medicare for all act of 2019 legislative proposals in the us congress senate bill 1129 and house of representatives bill 1384 economic analyses are crucial for formally estimating the net cost of single payer proposals these models estimate how potential added costs of single payer due to increased utilization of services compare with the savings induced by simplified payment administration lower drug prices and other factors such economic projections can shape plan design contribute to policy discourse and affect the viability of legislation as single payer proposals gain legislative traction the importance of economic models rises however these analyses are complex and heterogeneous making generalizations difficult findings vary across studies from large net savings to net costs as do modeling assumptions such as the extent of administrative savings and presence or absence of drug price negotiations the diversity of findings contributes to political spin and fuels popular uncertainty over the anticipated costs of a single payer healthcare system for example a 2018 study by pollin et al political economy research institute estimated that a national medicare for all system would save 313 million in the first year of implementation while a 2018 study by blahous mercatus center found that the same system would save 93 million in the first year and a 2016 report from holahan et al urban institute suggested that a modified form of this proposal e g relying on private insurers would increase costs variation in single payer proposals and analytic approaches likely explains many of the differences in outcomes across studies but no comparative review has been undertaken to our knowledge the goal of this study is to systematically review economic analyses of the cost of single payer proposals in the us both national and state level summarize results in a logical but accessible manner examine the association of findings with plan features and with analytic methods and finally examine the empirical evidence regarding key study assumptions methods overview we specified in advance that we would extract and quantitatively compare increased costs due to utilization rises and savings due to administrative simplification drug savings and other factors we searched for studies by examining existing lists querying experts and searching online ethics approval was not deemed to be necessary since all data were publicly available all data are available in the original studies which are listed in s1 appendix we included studies that examined insurance plans with essential single payer features and that provided adequate technical detail on inputs and results for these studies we extracted information about plan features analytic assumptions and findings costs due to higher utilization savings of all types and net costs see table a in s1 appendix for definitions of terms we expressed all estimates as a percentage of contemporaneous healthcare spending to facilitate comparison across settings and time periods we summarized study methods and findings graphically and analyzed associations between studies and spending estimates search we adopted a broad search strategy reflecting our initial assessment subsequently confirmed that economic models of the cost of single payer plans are not published in academic journals we conducted all components of our search from june 1 to december 31 of 2018 we searched in pubmed google scholar and google using combinations of single payer or single payer and cost or model or economic or cost benefit we limited our google search to 10 pages of results we consulted existing lists maintained by physicians for a national health program and healthcare now we asked a convenience sample of 10 single payer experts we also searched the websites of leading advocacy and industry sponsored groups in favor of single payer reform physicians for a national health plan and healthcare now and in opposition to single payer reform partnership for america s health care future additional search details are provided in table b in s1 appendix a prisma flow diagram is provided in fig 1 a prisma checklist can be found in table g in s1 appendix expand fig 1 prisma flow diagram doi 10 1371 journal pmed 1003013 g001 more inclusion and exclusion single payer has a wide range of definitions both in the us and internationally we chose inclusion and exclusion criteria that were most consistent with single payer plans that have been proposed in the us for example while some single payer plans internationally have included private intermediaries within a unified payment system us proposals have omitted a role for private insurers thus we use private intermediaries as an exclusion criterion notably recent healthcare proposals such as medicare extra for all would not meet our inclusion criteria study inclusion required appropriateness of both the plan and the analysis specific inclusion criteria for the plan were that 1 all legal residents are permanently covered for a standard comprehensive set of medically appropriate outpatient and inpatient medical services under one payer and 2 the payer is a not for profit government or quasi government agency other central single payer features such as providers being entirely in or out uniform payments with no balance billing and use of a drug formulary are often unspecified and thus were assumed present and thus not a basis for exclusion unless explicitly omitted some plans include undocumented immigrants and some exclude them exclusion criteria were 1 use of large cost sharing measures such as deductibles some us single payer plans include small copays e g 5 10 for an outpatient visit which was not considered grounds for exclusion and 2 an explicit role for non uniform payment levels i e payments differing by patient balance billing multiple payment systems multiple drug formularies or private insurers or intermediaries importantly we applied these criteria to the modeled plan so models incorporating any of these features when analyzing an otherwise qualifying single payer plan would be excluded these excluded studies are listed in table c in s1 appendix finally we excluded 12 plans from 11 studies that met inclusion criteria but were redundant to newer studies of similar single payer plans by the same analysis teams already included table d in s1 appendix net savings from these excluded studies were similar to those from the included studies table e in s1 appendix for the analysis all studies were required 1 to specify input assumptions and values based on transparent review of empirical evidence and 2 to report a increases in utilization and costs due to improved insurance access b savings due to simplified payment administration a single payment process using one set of coverage and reimbursement rules lower drug prices and other specified reasons and c total system costs and net costs of the single payer plan for this report we did not require or consider financing revenue plans which turn on an entirely different set of technical issues we also did not seek analyses of broader economic effects such as de investing in the private insurance market or facilitation of labor mobility and start ups through delinking of insurance and employment our analysis also omits long term effects on medical innovation studies were reviewed by at least 2 team members before finalizing inclusion or exclusion uncertain decisions e g regarding adequacy of technical information or severity of deviation from the study definition of single payer were discussed with the entire team extraction we extracted the following information from each study annual healthcare costs without single payer specified for the year and setting at the national or state level initial year annual cost under single payer cost increase due to utilization growth and savings from all sources and 4 specific categories simplified payment administration lowered costs for medications reduced clinical inefficiency and fraud and a switch to medicare payment rates which are lower than private insurance rates we did not report transition costs such as purchases of for profit businesses and training which were in any case rarely assessed and no study quantified the costs of potential first year implementation challenges if available we extracted longer term costs and savings defined as costs or savings accumulated subsequent to the first year of implementation we also extracted or calculated the utilization increase assumed for newly insured individuals each study was reviewed by 2 team members and all study extractions were reviewed by the senior investigator jgk who requested refinements and further documentation for unclear or unexpected values when we had questions due to omissions or ambiguity in the report we attempted to contact study authors we also sent them when successfully located a report draft for review analysis we standardized all cost numbers to percentage of contemporaneous total health system costs to allow for direct comparison across times and locations this approach obviated the need for inflation adjustments we standardized costs due to increased utilization as the increase in annual cost for the newly insured divided by the mean cost for the already insured we examined results visually ordered by year and by net cost highest net cost to highest net savings to assess the association of net cost with plan and analysis features e g whether drug price reductions were considered we used a visual method color coding analysis features we also conducted univariate and multivariate linear regressions with net savings or cost as the outcome and with the following predictors utilization increase specific savings categories type of funder organization and type of analyst organization in the multivariate analysis we assigned dummy variables for missingness of the utilization predictor results studies identified we reviewed 90 studies and included primary

savings of 3 5 of system costs and analyses of 19 of 22 plans found net savings net costs reflect the balance of added costs due to higher utilization by eliminating uninsurance and in some studies

system costs and analyses of 19 of 22 plans found net savings doi 10 1371 journal pmed 1003013 g002 more the cost increase due to expansion of insurance coverage varies due to the number of newly covered individuals and generosity of coverage benefits but also reflects policy components and expert assessment for example study estimates of increased utilization by newly covered individuals range from 25 to 80 of the costs for those already insured reflecting varied assessments of uninsured individuals healthcare access and health status additionally cost control choices such as copays vary across plans the mix of projected savings from single payer shows both consistent and variable elements across studies fig 3 all studies estimate lower costs due to simplified payment administration but vary in the size of these savings and in the inclusion and magnitude of other savings administrative savings vary from 1 2 to 16 4 median 8 8 of healthcare spending savings from

perhaps due to reduced precision due to the sample size tables h and i in s1 appendix report the multivariate regression details discussion we identified 22 credible economic models of the cost of single payer financing in the us from a variety of government business consultant and academic organizations we found that 19 86 predict net savings in the first year of operations with a range from 7 higher net cost to 15 lower net cost increases in cost due to improved insurance coverage and thus higher utilization were 2 to 19 savings from simplified payment administration at insurers and providers drug cost reductions and other mechanisms ranged from 3 to 27 the largest net savings were for plans with reductions in drug costs net savings accumulate over time at an estimated 1 4 per year of note we excluded 2 widely publicized studies both of which found net costs on the grounds that these studies made assumptions that included private insurance intermediaries i e not a single payer or lacked technical detail for evaluation these analyses suggest that single payer can save money even in year 1 incorporating a wide range of assumptions about potential savings more aggressive measures to realize cost reductions are projected to yield greater net savings this implies that concerns about health system cost growth with single payer may be misplaced though costs to government are likely to grow as tax based financing replaces private insurance premiums and out of pocket spending empirical evidence for model assumptions the results of these economic models depend on input assumptions regarding the effect of single payer provisions in particular the magnitude of net savings reflects the quantitative effects of utilization rises due to increased insurance and savings strategies reasonable analysts may differ on these assumptions based on plan features setting and evidence available at the time of modeling there is growing empirical evidence for each provision which we review below utilization increases due to new and improved insurance drive the cost growth effects of single payer there is strong evidence over decades that the newly insured roughly double their healthcare utilization medicaid expansion under the affordable care act appears to demonstrate a mix of utilization effects moreover in a single payer system the newly insured may be younger and healthier than the already insured meaning that utilization may not increase to the levels of the already insured evidence on utilization increases for the underinsured are mixed importantly there is evidence that when uninsured individuals gain insurance increases in utilization for the newly insured are balanced by slightly lower utilization for the already insured due to supply side constraints however with a decrease in billing related administrative burden for clinicians a 10 or greater rise in physician clinical capacity may occur which would accommodate additional care utilization finally increases in utilization for the uninsured and underinsured are likely to result in increased use of preventive services which should lead to some future cost saving simplified payment administration represents the largest type of savings from single payer there is very strong evidence that billing and insurance related administrative burden is higher in the us than in canada which has single payer by 12 15 of total healthcare costs the excess administrative costs are split roughly 50 at insurers and 50 at providers studies of hospitals find consistent large differences in administrative costs between the us and single payer systems in europe there is no direct evidence of ability to capture all of this excess but solid empirical data from canada and other organisation for economic co operation and development oecd countries support the intuition that administrative costs would sharply decrease with elimination or streamlining of existing onerous payment processes lower drug spending is typically the second largest source of savings with single payer and predicts large net savings the us veterans administration va gets a 30 discount on prescription medications compared to private medicare advantage plans us per capita drug spending exceeds that of any other country drug prices are the primary driver of higher cost with the us spending 1 011 annually per capita on prescription drugs compared to the oecd average of 422 research estimates savings of 30 for diabetes drugs through use of drug formularies due to medication choice and prices drug companies argue that reducing prices will reduce research and innovation however many more expensive drugs offer limited medical benefits further drug firms often raise prices after recovering development costs research and development costs for 10 companies that launched new cancer agents were 9 billion while revenue exceeded 67 billion perhaps most tellingly fortune 500 drug companies had a mean profit reported in 2019 of 24 compared to 9 for all corporations drug companies claim that if the entire health system gets the same discount as the va the discount levels will substantially decrease however if medicare adopted the va s tighter drug formulary the savings would be roughly 505 per capita annually overall there is strong evidence of the potential for a substantial reduction in drug costs with magnitude likely a function of political choices and dynamics a portion of these savings could also be realized if the government negotiated for lower drug prices in the existing medicare program reports estimate that up to 20 40 of us healthcare spending is fraudulent or wasteful however there is little evidence on how to avoid this spending the affordable care act set up accountable care organizations acos groups of healthcare providers responsible for a defined set of patients and contracting with a payer usually medicare for a payment structure tied to performance metrics in an effort to reduce costs recent aco demonstration projects found minimal savings potentially less than the cost of administering programs leading to overall net 0 savings acos that are two sided using both penalties and shared savings reduce service costs by a mean of 0 7 yet require on average about 2 costs to administer overall between 2013 and 2017 acos increased total costs to medicare by 70 billion when bonuses were taken into account recent analysis suggests modestly growing savings in physician if not hospital groups potentially more than administration costs single payer may facilitate efforts to reduce fraud and waste by providing comprehensive and consistent clinical encounter data within the single billing system including diagnoses and services as well as clinical outcomes thus single payer might bolster the marginally effective efforts in this area still the evidence to support large reductions in waste and fraud is tenuous furthermore a reliance on aco incentive approaches which require large patient panels and specific payment structures could undermine desired features of a single payer program such as free choice of provider substantial use of fee for service billing in some plans and hospital global budgeting in light of these uncertainties most economic models do not anticipate reductions in fraud or waste and those that do generally assume only a modest reduction limitations our analysis has several important limitations first the included economic studies varied in methodological rigor and quality of reporting funding sources political motivations and amount of evidence cited to support claims although we tried to classify studies by major single payer and analysis characteristics uncaptured variations may have added noise in the comparison relatedly the diversity of plans under study did not allow for a formal meta analysis which is designed to integrate empirical evaluations of standardized interventions especially using measures of association such as odds ratios second we did not apply quality rating scores for the included economic studies we found no quality rating scores for health system modeling as existing scores are intended for evaluation studies empirical measurements of costs and effects or decision analyses a quality rating system could be useful included studies all lacked sensitivity analyses and the selection of the most appropriate data source for input values could be subjective for example studies varied in what percentage of savings could be achieved through simplification of payment administration we are unaware of studies analyzing the effects of other key inputs such as reductions in reimbursement rate future research is needed to assess the quality of single payer studies analyze key model inputs and analyze proposed ranges for sensitivity analyses in terms of the potential for financial conflict of interest bias we were reassured that a prominent health business consultant lewin group with several included analyses presumably with clients that stand to lose money with single payer nonetheless found net savings third no single payer system has been implemented in the us due to lack of government approval even for demonstration projects thus there is no domestic large scale empirical example to properly test the economic models much of the research on single payer is based on evidence from single payer nations such as canada australia and taiwan as reviewed above us health systems that approximate single payer such as the va and other empirical studies provide support for model assumptions ultimately our goal was not to compare cost models with nonexistent empirical benchmarks but to assess the consistency of inputs across models and with empirical evidence and to characterize patterns in model findings assuming that us single payer demonstrations are coming economic models can be tested and refined until then the relative consistency of existing models is the best evidence available fourth our study was limited to proposals of single payer as defined in the us with a single government payer and meeting specified criteria our results are not generalizable to multi payer universal coverage reforms which would likely show substantially smaller savings and thus increases in net cost the maryland all payer model for example showed 2 7 savings after 3 years a figure that is significantly lower than the average savings from single payer systems we found in our review multi payer systems have higher costs in part due to increased cost shifting our analysis is not able to quantify precisely the effects of reduced cost sharing a unified provider payment system as opposed to a single payer system may accomplish substantial cost savings but our analysis only considered the latter indeed many oecd countries have a unified payment system with a standard benefits package a single payment process a single formulary and not for profit insurers which shares many features with single payer finally despite the drawbacks of our narrow inclusion criteria a benefit is that our results provide a clearer and more relevant assessment of the economic impact of a single payer system in the us fifth in addition to saving costs unified payment models such as single payer have the potential to foster quality and efficient care through payment signals as well as to monitor trends in care patterns via rapid access to highly standardized claims data for example in japan s unified payment system price incentives are used to promote public health goals such as increasing preventive care the use of price incentives to drive performance is common in high income countries however studies did not include this in their analysis so we deemed it outside the scope of our study sixth as with any review our search period is time limited ending in december 2018 we are aware of 1 study in 2019 but did not systematically search for other studies we limited our google searches to 10 pages however we never found a relevant study after page 2 of search results increasing our confidence that a 10 page review was adequate we will update this analysis in coming years finally we examined only economic studies of system operating costs in the first year and over time we ignored one time transition costs in particular purchase of for profit entities unemployment and pension benefits and retraining of displaced workers informal review of existing evidence suggests that these costs are small in comparison to health system spending which is 18 of the economy we also did not examine financing e g taxation strategies these are important next steps policy implications this review highlights a high degree of analytic consensus that single payer financing would result in a favorable outcome for system financial burden efficiency savings exceed added costs a net cost reduction of 3 4 is likely initially growing over time net savings would be expected to occur if not immediately certainly within a few years however maximizing performance and savings will require optimized implementation payment procedures must be as simple as in other countries drug prices a substantial reduction from contemporary levels and comprehensive clinical data used in sophisticated ways to identify and reduce inappropriate care the logical next step is real world experimentation including evaluation and refinement to minimize transition costs and achieve modeled performance in reality

manila philippines 15 january 2020 sound economic policies and strong institutions have transformed asia and the pacific over the past five decades into a center of global dynamism according to a new book from the asian development bank adb the book asia s journey to prosperity policy market and technology over 50 years explains the reasons for asia s economic success while cautioning against complacency developing asia s share of global gross domestic product gdp rose from 4 in 1960 to 24 in 2018 including australia japan and new zealand the share increased from 13 to 34 during the same period developing asia s per capita gdp grew 15 fold in constant 2010 united states dollars from 330 to 4 903 boosting incomes and lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty in 1966 when adb was established developing economies in the asia and pacific region were very poor there was pessimism about prospects for industrialization and broad development but the region s performance over the past 50 years has surpassed expectations by any measure be it economic growth structural transformation poverty reduction or improvement in health and education said adb president mr takehiko nakao the book emphasizes that there is no such thing as a unique asian consensus in the region s journey to prosperity rather the policies pursued in asia can be explained by standard economic theories not so different from those prescribed by the washington consensus set of policies economic transformation in the region came about in much the same ways as in many developed economies what was important was that many asian countries took a pragmatic approach they implemented import liberalization opening up of foreign direct investment financial sector deregulation and capital account liberalization in a sequential way and based on meeting certain conditions in the past half century many asian countries enjoyed a demographic dividend and benefited from rapid technological progress globalization and the generally open trade and investment regimes of developed countries however even with favorable demographic and external conditions the process of economic growth is not automatic asia s postwar economic success owed much to creating effective policies and strong institutions it was supported by governments pragmatism in making policy choices decisiveness in introducing reforms and an ability to learn from their own and other s achievements and mistakes in many countries a clear vision for the future which is often championed by forward looking leaders and shared across a wide spectrum of social groups contributed to broad based growth and made a difference especially when backed by a competent bureaucracy over time asian economies adopted open trade and investment policies facilitated agricultural modernization and industrial transformation supported technological progress invested in education and health mobilized the high level of domestic savings for productive investments promoted infrastructure development pursued sound macroeconomic policies and implemented policies for poverty reduction and inclusiveness the book notes that asia should not be complacent and that it is too early to describe the 21st century as the asian century developing asia still faces pockets of persistent poverty increasing income inequality large gender gaps environmental degradation and climate change millions still lack adequate access to health education electricity and safe drinking water mr nakao also pointed out that it will take more time for asia to become as influential as the west has been over the last five centuries asia must continue to make efforts to strengthen its institutions contribute to the development of science and technology assume more responsibilities in tackling global issues and articulate its own ideas the book was produced by a diverse adb team led by the management group of the economic research and regional cooperation department and the president himself over 3 years it provides a broad historical overview of rapid transformation in all adb s 46 developing economies beyond the newly industrialized economies and several southeast asian countries discussed by the well known 1993 world bank publication the east asian miracle it considers a longer time horizon from the immediate postwar period to the present capturing the transition from centrally planned systems to market oriented economies in writing the team tried to make the book as interesting as possible by including anecdotes data and country examples the book consists of 15 chapters i an overview of 50 years of development ii the roles of markets and the state iii industrial transformation iv land reform and green revolution v technological progress vi education health and demographics vii investment and saving viii infrastructure energy transport water and telecommunication ix trade and foreign direct investment x macroeconomic policies xi poverty reduction and income equality xii gender and development xiii environmental sustainability and climate change xiv multilateral and bilateral development finance and xv regional cooperation several chapters benefit from contributions by staff engaged in adb operations adb is committed to achieving a prosperous inclusive resilient and sustainable asia and the pacific while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty established in 1966 it is owned by 68 members 49 from the region

off to a strong start in medicare advantage this year i d like to quickly share how we are helping to build a better health system first improving affordability second engaging and serving people third advancing product innovation and fourth sorting through hands on data driven clinical care let s start with affordability because that is the gating factor for greater access to care and improving the consumer experience one of our goals is to engage more deeply with the highest performing physicians and other clinicians to advance both quality and affordability we know these high performing providers achieve considerably better health outcomes while lowering the total cost of care our medical cost trend over the last five years has strongly outperformed the national average we are committed to driving significantly lower rates of healthcare spending growth than the industry we see billions of additional dollars in potential savings for consumers and customers from areas such as our site of service initiatives and more deeply embedding digital tools to reduce the administrative burden for physicians we are also using digital and physical strategies to engage consumers in new ways to simplify their experience reduce their financial burden and lower the total cost of care for example for the nearly 0 5 million people enrolled in our motion program we offer incentives for increased individual mobility people can earn more than 1000 a year when they achieve defined walking frequency and intensity targets people enrolled in motion are achieving better health at a meaningfully lower costs that is why we re expanding this program and extending product designs that reward stronger consumer engagement and align incentives with their doctor a third area is product innovation we are seeing early signs of customer interest in our innovative new offerings and consumer centric products that better align to the unique needs and financial means of people while engaging them in managing their health some examples are harmony a new collaboration with optumcare providers unites high quality care and coverage creating a more integrative and effective consumer experience with as much as 20 savings for our fully insured customers all savers offer small employers with highly flexible affordable health plans and reduces employee out of pocket costs with low or no preventative and primary care coverage nexusaco enables large employers to offer a single aco aco based plan nationwide incentivizing employees to choose high performing providers and driving better outcomes through care coordination bind provides first dollar coverage and allows people to add coverage on demand for planned procedures offered by high value providers following rigorous care pathways based on best known science while costing approximately 15 less than comparable plans and finally our virtual first product is attractive to the digital first generation this new product offers zero dollar copay 24 by 7 virtual care support at a lower price than traditional products these are some examples of our innovation focus and health benefits and you should expect more as we redouble our efforts to engage consumers in more impactful ways and accelerate our growth in this category lastly we are deploying relevant information at the point of care to improve the way care is received and managed point of care assist is a tool that puts real time patient information at the fingertips of doctors and their emrs providing a seamless clinical workflow experience this improves adherence to clinical protocols facilitates real time authorization approvals and helps refer the patient to premium designated specialists utility of this tool is significant for all as doctors save time and money consumers avoid cost surprises and most importantly health outcomes are improved as we look to 2020 and beyond there is a 900 billion untapped managed care market opportunity and health benefits much of it in government programs where we have grown strongly and we look to serve more people more deeply across the system now i ll turn it over to john rex cfo of unitedhealth group john rex vice president and chief financial officer thank you dirk this morning we reported full year revenues of 242 billion up 15 9 billion or 7 year over year driven by double digit revenue growth in medicare and across optum fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of 3 90 per share grew 19 and brought full year earnings to 15 11 growth of 17 cash flows from operations of 18 5 billion grew 18 over 2018 to 1 3 times net income better than anticipated partly due to timing factors our balance sheet and return metrics remain strong with return on equity of almost 26 we ended the year with a debt to capital ratio of around 40 even with over 10 billion of deployment for business combinations and capex 5 5 billion in share repurchases and a 20 dividend increase medical reserves developed favorably in the fourth quarter by 270 million including 150 million from 2019 overall medical costs were well managed resulting in an 82 5 medical care ratio for full year 2019 we continue to be highly attentive to operating costs as part of our overall affordability agenda in 2019 our operating cost ratio of 14 5 improved 50 basis points reflecting 60 basis points of operating cost productivity and the deferral of the health insurance tax partially offset by the effect of business mix changes and continued investments in innovation service and growth we enter 2020 with diversified growth momentum balance sheet strength and financial flexibility on earnings progression we continue to expect 47 to 48 of full year earnings per share to be realized in the first half of the year a point to keep in mind on the quarterly progression 2019 first quarter has one fewer workday than 2018 resulting in a higher earnings level this year the first quarter has a more normal mix but then adds an extra day due to leap year taken together the day count shifting has a year over year impact on the medical care ratio of about 80 basis points this will result in the first quarter 2020 mcr running higher than the second quarter and earnings per share progressing accordingly with just under 55 of the first half earnings expected to be realized in the second quarter these impacts of course were fully contemplated in the 2020 outlook we provided at the beginning of december for full year 2020 we continue to expect revenues to approach 262 billion and adjusted net earnings per share in a range of 16 25 to 16 55 consistent with our prior practices we will more formally address these and other expectations after the first quarter with that i ll turn it back to dave david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you john as you can tell we are confident in the outlook for our diversified and growing enterprise for 2020 and beyond our businesses remain strong and well positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value we remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value more affordable better outcomes and improved experiences while generating strong returns for you our shareholders operator let s open it up for questions one per caller please questions and answers operator we ll take our first question from justin lake with wolfe research please go ahead justin lake wolfe research analyst thanks good morning wanted to ask about the quarter in terms of medical cost looks like it came in better than you expected versus the update at the investor day any color there specifically if you can expand on what s how you re seeing kind of medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into 2020 that would be really helpful as well thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer john rex john rex vice president and chief financial officer hey justin good morning yeah i think i d point out a few things here you re correct we did come in just a little bit better than our guidance at the investor conference and if you think that first i d call it broadly across the businesses as we continue to see the impact of the affordability initiatives that we ve been very focused on having traction and having impact so broadly across that i think it s fair to say also that we certainly did see some continued improvement in our medicaid businesses it s a place that we ve been that we ve been focused on for a while here and that was also contributor but broadly i d say across our businesses as we saw those affordability initiatives having traction david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you justin next question please operator our next question from a j rice with credit suisse please go ahead a j rice credit suisse analyst yeah it s just it sounds like on the call today you are reaffirming your expectations around medicare advantage enrollment obviously cms has come out with their january numbers it looks like in terms of the percentage enrolled in january you re little bit lighter than you were a year ago i don t know if that s a fair comparison but i wondered is there anything in the data that s i don t know if you have looked at what they put out that is missing from your perspective i know it shows you down in group ma and maybe you re going to pick up and group ma but just flesh out a little further what group ma over the course of the year would anything to reassure us about your expectations around ma for this year david s wichmann chief executive officer thanks a j you know we re very pleased with our aep results and i d say is by far it s our strongest year ever in individual medicare we did reaffirm the guidance but near to the upper end of that guidance today so we feel pretty strongly on with respect to our overall performance tim noel can you add some color on some of the other questions tim noel chief executive officer unitedhealthcare medicare retirement yeah good morning a j thanks for the question in first half some of that cms partial aep reporting can be a little bit misleading and dave said you know first and foremost want to reiterate the confidence in our full year enrollment growth that we shared at investor conference for ma and just to revisit that briefly we said 500 to 550 000 in medicare advantage growth in the m r business which includes both group and individual ma and we also said that it d be up to 700 000 in ma growth including duals within our community and state business so when aep completes we ll have grown by 370 000 in individual ma including the duals better in cms and that s up 140 over last year s aep and is our strongest performance ever in the annual enrollment period we expect this to drive full year results about 700 000 member growth in individual ma and that split on january net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50 50 and that s consistent with historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we ve seen in aep with respect to group you re right group ma contracted modestly in the cms reporting when january all settles out we expect that to be down about 65 but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year closes out and finally all told really great start to the year strong signal of confidence for the full year in our growth guidance shared at investor conference david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you a j next question next question please operator we ll go next to scott fidel with stephens please go ahead your line is open scott fidel stephens analyst thanks just sticking on the membership updates for 2020 and obviously you just gave some good detail on medicare just interested if there is anything to call out in terms of either the commercial business or the medicaid business in terms of expectations on membership relative to the ranges that you had provided at investor day then also just specifically within that just interested in how you are sort of approaching the north carolina medicaid situation just given the budget situation there in terms of what you re assuming for timing implementation of that and how many lives you have factored in around north carolina thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer good question scott thank you dirk mcmahon will start and then heather cianfrocco can discuss medicaid dirk mcmahon chief executive officer unitedhealthcare yeah on the thanks thanks for the question scott so we ll be down a little bit in enrollment for 01 01 20 in both the fully insured and aso areas but as the throughout the course of the year we expect to gain membership in both areas as we previously guided in december as we look at 2020 we re going to continue with the pricing discipline that i previously talked about as we balance enrollment growth with our margin expectations we remain we remain focused on delivering a unique value proposition for our customers and consumers hard to tell you where i m optimistic for next year in fully insured expect strength in individual products and their middle market as i look at our aso block i look at our all favors and i look at our middle market as well with that turn over to heather heather cianfrocco chief executive officer unitedhealthcare community state thanks yeah so good question with respect to start with membership and talk a little bit about north carolina so in our membership for this year we do we do expect growth in medicaid this year and that s coming from a couple of places north carolina is in our 2020 guidance right now we ve got some other things in there we ve got some increases from to markets like our washington win last year texas win recent texas win we are going to see some nebraska expansion and then we see another strong year of as tim just talked about for 2020 we can really well positioned there with new county expansion service their expansion and our aep is off to a really really strong start so really excited about that pressure is obviously north carolina so it s in our 2020 membership outlook and our revenue outlook and we assume it right now to come in about mid year we re really honored we were selected we re ready for implementation and we re eager to start serving north carolinians despite the budget situation there there is strong support for the program and for managed care there so we re continuing to monitor the implementation date we ll keep you posted on that and you all watch that as well in the meantime we ve got we re excited about the opportunity it s in our outlook and we look forward to hopefully getting that on track here as close to mid year as possible david s wichmann chief executive officer and just to add on to that a little bit scott we won also in kentucky we were pleased to win obviously that s being rebid now but we ll hopefully prevail in the end there as well and it s a strong rfp season for medicaid broadly and i see the business having come around to being positioned with its turnaround just in time to compete ferociously for that business so we re pretty bullish about the opportunity that exists in medicaid and i think we re well positioned to grow thanks for the question scott next question please operator and we ll go next to peter costa with wells fargo securities please go ahead peter costa wells fargo securities analyst good morning everyone nice quarter i d like to take it up a little bit in terms of looking at sort of the longer term picture for medicare couple of changes in the medicare program i m curious what you think of as being the biggest risks to you in terms of your business and those are paying for social determinants of health which is something new for this year allowing esrd patients to join next year and medicare fee for service direct contracting by providers is starting can you talk about those three items and if they are risks to you david s wichmann chief executive officer sure we d be happy to discuss all three of those tim tim noel chief executive officer unitedhealthcare medicare retirement yeah thanks peter so i think i ll take esrd first but also want to caution you know the long term outlook especially with respect to 2021 and really any year it s a little bit premature to get into some of the nuts and bolts of how we see the landscape shaping out but on esrd we re very supportive of the change that goes into effect on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people we re not concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement in payment models we ll learn those details very soon we remain confident expecting that those models will be fair adequate and importantly we believe that these people will be better served in medicare advantage also important to keep in mind we serve 40 000 medicare advantage enrollees with esrd today adults develop the disease post enrollment and our focus that these members is both on prevention and also on treatment so we re pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that have the disease at the timing of enrollment with respect to source of determinants we continue to have a key focus of our business consistently referring folks inside of programs where appropriate and some of the additional flexibility to apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we re leveraging in some of our demonstration projects in 2020 we re excited to learn a little bit more about this soon as the year progresses and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021 david s wichmann chief executive officer pardon me peter costa wells fargo securities analyst the last one was physician direct contracting fee for service medicare brian thompson chief executive officer unitedhealthcare government programs hey peter brian thompson here we re encouraged by that as well i think similar to what we ve done with the bundled payment program it s a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional medicare and we re encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participate david s wichmann chief executive officer and i might add overall peter that we re bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both medicare advantage but also the dual special needs marketplace as well they re both very large today and growing end markets ma is clearly outperforming fee for service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction and so no surprise that it is performing as well and it seems to be gaining some momentum so we look forward to continuing to compete hopefully growing at these levels if not higher going forward next question please operator and we ll take our next question from josh raskin with nephron research please go ahead josh raskin nephron research analyst thanks good morning question around the sort of broad space that s growing around physician enablement and i m curious it seems like there s been a lot of interest a lot of new competitors that are kind of focused on that i know optum has been very early do you think of optum as sort of the market leader and it s just broad movement of physicians taking more risk is this positive for unitedhealth group andrew witty chief executive officer optum josh thanks so much for the questions it is andrew yeah we absolutely see physicians very much as a central element of improving care delivery quality and cost it is what really driving optumcare which is clearly the central part of optumhealth as we see physicians move toward taking more risk we see improvements across the board in terms of resource allocation prevention focus ensuring clinical outcome is maximized we re very encouraged by that trend this year alone we d expect about 150 000 more patients to go into our physician risk managed programs across optumcare we continue to see that trend accelerate it s very much something that we then anchor the build out of the rest of our optumhealth portfolio around so in a sense is that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services insight data analytics which help the physician make the best possible judgment to manage that overall risk profile of the patient you see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across optumhealth that s really been driven by this shift and so you re absolutely right very important element for us and it essentially becomes the core around which we then envision and build our support services our interventions and our analytics to empower the physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patient thank you david s wichmann chief executive officer i just add to that just slightly josh that unitedhealthcare is working on physician enablement as well this is what the core of dirk s commentary this morning was around point of care assist this is why we built and deploy the ihr and this is why we focus essentially in our investor conference around the way in which we engage both the digital and physical rounds to ai enable people to be able to operate much more effectively and serve their patients so thanks for the question next question please operator and we ll go next to kevin fischbeck with bank of america please go ahead kevin fischbeck bank of america analyst great thanks just want to go back to medicaid for a minute can you talk a little bit about i think you mentioned that in q4 maybe you saw some improvement on medicaid but can you talk about the expectation for the year i guess in particular i guess two things one is the implication of redeterminations and the rate updates you will get relative to that how are the rate updates going and do you are you modeling additional redeterminations as the year goes on and the second just quickly going back north carolina if north carolina got delayed into 2021 would that impact your eps guidance or is it more of a revenue number at this point thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer i say we re making progress on across all dimensions of medicaid right now on rate cost and quality heather do you want to take those questions heather cianfrocco chief executive officer unitedhealthcare community state sure so maybe i ll start with the medicaid performance so we were pleased with the q4 results and when i say that i really mean there it s marching along right within expectations was what we really executed on our affordability agenda we see strong partnerships with our states to address what was for a period of time due to redeterminations or other underfunding issues just acuity related underfunding so as we look into 2020 i feel good about the progress made through all of 19 in particularly in the second half of 19 with respect to rates and with respect to affordability and so as we come into 2020 we ve got a view into our q1 rate renewals they re right in line with our expectations they are top above what they were at the same time in 19 we ve got a we ve delivered on our clinical programs we re seeing strong nps customer service scores and quality so i feel good about that as i say that you still expect us to hit our target margin by the end of the year so that just gives us renewed confidence in what was committed to you already so expect our medicaid business to continue to perform along that track and we ll be hard at work on it with respect to north carolina yeah i guess i ll just say again we re monitoring it every day right now i was going to say that we re continuing to push and it is a big component of our opportunity in 2020 from revenue and a membership perspective but that being said there is a lot of other growth opportunities that we re measuring to we didn t have kentucky in our guidance but we also didn t and that got pushed but we also didn t have the bid that we just won so we re going to be monitoring all those things and right now we re going to kind of work for a mid year or close there too implementation and we ll keep you posted david s wichmann chief executive officer kevin dave again if i could just add so if north carolina where to get pushed to 2021 it would not affect our expectations for the year our guidance would stay the same it is as it comes out of the chute it s a relatively modest margin product our market as is often the case so we wouldn t expect any material impact on our expectations for the year thank you next question please operator and we ll go next to lance wilkes with bernstein please go ahead lance wilkes bernstein analyst yeah could you talk a little bit about pbm margin for the for the quarter interested in i mean the improvement there how much of that is driven by just the mix shift from the transition of large client and how much is other initiatives like cross sales or sourcing initiatives david s wichmann chief executive officer prince john prince chief executive officer optumrx hi lance john prince thanks for the question as you looked at the fourth quarter the margin was elevated as expected so when we gave our guidance at investor day we were expecting the operating earnings margin around 6 3 6 4 so it is exactly what we expected why it was elevated it is exactly what you mentioned was the loss of the large client where we lost the revenue but it didn t really impact our operating earnings the second driver was the supply chain strength in terms of our continuing to negotiate with pharma manufacturers as well as the supply chain to get value to pass on to our clients and so that was the other key driver as we look to 2020 guidance you should expect our operating margin to fall back to where we have guided at investor day with 5 1 to 5 2 so that should be your expectation it was more of an anomaly what happened in q4 as expected david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you lance next question please operator we will go next to ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley please go ahead ricky goldwasser morgan stanley analyst yeah hi good morning so you reiterated guidance this morning for 2020 just wanted to clarify if the guidance already includes any impact from retail and mid year renewals and also the benefit from the diplomat acquisition and then follow up on the on the dual growth i mean obviously 15 to 20 is what is the implied growth which is strong and above market but when we think about that can you just kind of like help us think through the part d dynamics and how that would flow through the p l if it s going to have any impact on optumrx throughout the year david s wichmann chief executive officer we ll have john rex start and then shift to tim wicks or john prince john rex vice president and chief financial officer hey ricky john rex here so in terms of those elements you mentioned i say both immaterial in the scope of our company you re correct when we guided to 2020 initially the repeal of the hit was the health insurance tax have not yet occurred but i would call that immaterial to us yes there is some impact but not material in terms of modest headwind in the scheme of our company not not something that we would we would call out also in terms of the diplomat the pending diplomat acquisition also i d call that immaterial really no impact it will be neutral in terms of our 2020 outlook john prince john prince chief executive officer optumrx thanks ricky john prince in terms of the other pieces on part d component that is expected so i think we re not changing our guidance for 2020 what we expect in terms of part d and diplomat is built into our guidance and so we re comfortable with our expectations david s wichmann chief executive officer great thank you ricky next question please operator we ll go next to stephen tanal with goldman sachs please go ahead stephen tanal goldman sachs analyst good morning guys thanks for the question i guess at this stage i was just wondering if you could kindly give us a sense of what hit repeal how we should be start to be thinking about modeling that in whether you commit the sort of at least the non tax deductibility of it going away kind of flowing to the bottom line or if it s still too early and then maybe just could you comment on optumhealth just given the risk taking nature of what you guys are doing i thought it d be interesting to hear from you all how the flu impacted the economics of that business in q4 again sort of revenue earnings margin thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer great i ll touch on the hit and then wyatt decker will comment on optumhealth so overall the hit we are as i said in the prepared remarks we are pleased as if this would weigh obviously it s great for seniors families of small businesses and individual insurers as well on average for couple senior couples it is 500 to 600 it pretty much carries out the same for a family of four that s sponsored by a small business and so obviously this has a strong economic impact on these families and individuals so it s terrific to see it get repealed the other thing about it is it removes the excessive volatility i m sure you re fatigued with it as we are it s in it s out and but more importantly in all of that is is that it affects the volatility of pricing in the marketplace as well so hopefully you will see that stabilize as we get through 2020 and into 2021 as well this we re not going to discuss 2021 and what our strategies may be with respect to how we handle this obviously it s important that the tax value gets back into the hands of people that s what it was intended to do and that s what we intend to accomplish overall and as john already indicated while it has a drag on earnings for 2020 we re not changing our outlook as a result of that that is small item in the broad scheme of themes and wyatt decker to discuss flu at optumhealth wyatt w decker chief executive officer optumhealth stephen thank you for the question at optumhealth and optumcare we follow the usual flu modeling and we have not seen a material impact deviating from that in q4 and we do not anticipate significant impact in q1 as you may know it s been a reasonably robust flu season but it s mostly the b strain which is not as severe so we also have a fee for service medexpress practice which tends to offset any hit we might take on the risk side thank you david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you wyatt just i want to clarify one thing that ricky asked and i m not so sure we answered it correctly it is really about whether not diplomat the proposed transaction is in our numbers for 2021 and our 2020 and the answer to that s no it would not be in there we don t include transactions in our forecasts until they close so that is not included in there and as soon as it does close quarter following we ll update our forecast accordingly this is one of the reasons why we talked about the impact of capital deployment on our growth rate and how it can advance during the year because of transactions in this case it will be very very modest but nonetheless i just wanted to make sure we have that clarification thank you next question please operator we ll go next to steven valiquette with barclays please go ahead steven valiquette barclays analyst thanks good morning everybody actually not to beat the diplomat pharmacy acquisition topic to death but i know it s not a huge acquisition for you financially but despite that i do have to believe they were just almost immediately be a ton of operational synergies when folding that book of business into your existing pbm and specialty pharmacy operations probably in reimbursement and also in pharmacy network contracts so i guess i was hoping to hear more color around what you see is the biggest area of synergy at this stage and then just conceptually could this deal move the needle for unh overall in 2021 obviously you can make it a sound probably in 2020 not much but could it move the needle for the company overall in 2021 thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer it ll be nicely accretive to us unfortunately it also comes with a great deal of integration costs most of which will hit 2020 as well would you touch on that john john prince chief executive officer optumrx sure steven it s john prince just maybe talk a little more why we re doing the deal because i think that s really at the core of it which is to better serve individuals that have complex diseases like oncology immunology and specialized infusion therapy when you look at the capabilities of diplomat around specialty pharmacy and infusion it fits well with the strategy of optumrx focused on these unique populations that need better volume helping improve their drug costs improving health outcomes and overall value of care and doing it in a compassionate way so we think it is a good fit of our two businesses that come together to better serve the key needs in the market and so as we ve talked about before strategically especially drug cost is a key focus for the future is polyclinics i think that strategically fit very well we re obviously still away from closing the transaction we are actively doing our planning for that and we ll be ready to start that as we conclude the transaction in the first quarter steven valiquette barclays analyst i appreciate the color thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer yeah no problem next question please operator and we ll go next to michael newshel with evercore isi please go ahead michael newshel evercore isi analyst thanks maybe just going back to the flu i just wanted to confirm that those earlier comments also apply to the unitedhealthcare side as well you ve seen high outpatient activity but severity in hospitalizations just don t appear to be that high at least to published yet david s wichmann chief executive officer jeff putnam jeff putnam chief financial officer unitedhealthcare yeah thanks for the question yeah on the unitedhealthcare side similar dynamics the flu season as you see in the cdc data started early and we are having elevated incident levels on the outpatient side but overall severity as was mentioned is lower there and in patient admits have been close to normal so very modest impact in the fourth quarter david s wichmann chief executive officer thank you michael next question please operator we ll go next to ralph giacobbe with citi please go ahead ralph giacobbe citi analyst thanks good morning you rolling out certain initiatives and benefit design changes to your fully insured book around site of service initiatives and prior off along with preferred lab network etc and it sounded like that actually benefited some to some degree in the fourth quarter can you give us maybe a little bit of a sense of what proportion of the aso book has adopted these initiatives may be for 2020 and or how we should think about sort of the uptake over time thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer i don t think we ll talk about adoption rates in the large national accounts business but dirk you want to talk a little bit about your overall efforts around containing medical costs dirk mcmahon chief executive officer unitedhealthcare yeah as we think about medical costs you mentioned very effectively site of service being rolled that out to a lot more codes in november knees and procedures like that we re also very focused on our network negotiations to try to drive unit costs lower in many areas i look at our trend two thirds of unit costs the network is at the start of that we re doing a lot of work in terms of increasing consumer engagement providing them with effective decision tools to rally in our other apps portal to other digital property to drive the right movements and also got to thank optum a lot of work with our clinical models driving savings as well as payment integrity as andrew mentioned in his remarks so we really have a full forward press on affordability we think that is a primary driver of our ability to price effectively in the market and actually provide access for consumers and employers and everyone so a lot of work on the affordability front david s wichmann chief executive officer dirk and team at unitedhealthcare doing a wonderful job on affordability broadly in medical cost obviously they re interested in getting healthcare to be much more affordable and the collaboration between optum unitedhealthcare has never been stronger in that front optum has really stepped in as they do with all the third party health plans as well it s really assist in driving this broad based agenda across the company we have time for two more questions next question please operator and we will go next to gary taylor with jp morgan please go ahead gary taylor jp morgan analyst great does that mean to ask two questions no david s wichmann chief executive officer pardon me gary taylor jp morgan analyst i was going to say great does that mean i get to ask two questions david s wichmann chief executive officer you can we ll answer the first one gary taylor jp morgan analyst i will ask just my question my one question is i do appreciate the earnings cadence commentary given the leap year but thinking since reported mlr such an outsized impact on the near term stock volatility wondering if you d be willing to give us first quarter mlr range i mean there are a few other moving parts in the quarter besides leap year that was pretty high march seasonality with extra monday tuesday and then obviously with dilutive impact of the hit reinstatement david s wichmann chief executive officer john rex you maybe just i know that was pretty complex in terms of the quarterly progression and we expected that john you just want to make sure that everybody understands that well john rex vice president and chief financial officer sure gary good morning let me give you a little more color in terms of the impact that occurs as we go into that i described kind of some of the impact with workdays content and how that flows and just in terms of thinking about that so when value different days with different medical costs weekend versus weekdays even versus different days of the week in terms of what i was describing there it actually comes out it s a little it s not two days it is more than one day it is 1 3 days of impact in terms of the workday content is where it fall then to when you flow into a leap year like that and that pattern typically of course repeats so that s kind of the element that flows into that then if you consider the other elements we talked about at when we talk to our full year mcr progression and year over year progression we talked about the impact of the health insurance tax the 140 basis points and that impact and then we talked about mix impacts also that occur over the course of the year so those are really kind of the core that are as we consider as we consider where we d expect the medical care ratio to be lining up here as we you look at the first half of the year i hope that gives you a little extra color gary taylor jp morgan analyst so you don t want to give us a 1q range today john rex vice president and chief financial officer sorry what s that gary gary taylor jp morgan analyst you don t you don t want to give us the first quarter john rex vice president and chief financial officer first quarter pick i think i kind of just described it actually pretty pretty hopefully fairly clearly there in terms of the roll forward and how you would approach that so if you take the components of the math that i just gave you i think that should get you to a first quarter pick david s wichmann chief executive officer so there is no change to full year guidance john tried to lay out for you our first half last half would be and then within the first half what the proportions would be as well so you should be able to get a pretty good sense of things from all of that recognizing often times things don t shoot quite that straight so plus or minus would probably be a worthwhile range to put around whatever point estimate you come up with thank you very much gary next question please operator and we ll go next to sarah james with piper sandler please go ahead sarah james piper sandler analyst thanks for squeezing me in now that there is some bipartisan support for spread pricing though can you talk about the exposure in 19 you said it was about 25 of the book so did that needle mover for 20 what is the mix look like in your commercial book of spread versus pass through and does this bill impact the value proposition that you see for optumrx at all thanks david s wichmann chief executive officer john john rex vice president and chief financial officer sarah thanks for the question as you know we are committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from administrative fees and value based arrangements our clients decide how they want to pay for our services so when we bid on a deal and for our client we give them an opportunity either to pay through administrative fee or with spread or traditional so it s the client choice so as you look at it we don t have a preference about where we want to go up in business model we re in different on how a client wanted to choose it in terms of the commercial market the trend in the market hasn t changed in the last several years so actually the client is not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus administrative fee as you look at the medicaid market there has been a trend over the last three years where more and more of the state organizations and have been moving to administrative fees so if you looked at our client base three years ago majority would have been spread if you look at it today less than a quarter is in spread and actually we expect that to almost disappear as you look out to next year or two years so from us when they actually impact our financials i won t speculate about what will happen in washington but we re well positioned from a business standpoint david s wichmann chief executive officer great question sarah thank you so much i ll go ahead and close now thank you all for your questions sorry we can t get to everyone today as you heard this morning we remain confident in our outlook for 2020 and beyond our diversified in complementary businesses are strong and well positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value while generating strong returns for you our shareholders thank you and this

briefing highlights u s china deal to hit canada what analysts say about the deal stocks canadian dollar oil at a glance home sales surge from year earlier bank of america profit slips german economic growth slows required reading deal to hit canada a citigroup economist has studied what the proposed u s china trade deal could mean from various angles and determined that canada and mexico will be hurt under most of them citigroup global economist dana peterson said in her report that the two countries part of the u s mexico canada trade pact might experience reduced bilateral trade value with the u s under most scenarios the so called phase one trade deal is scheduled to be signed in washington today among the details that are known the united states will stop calling beijing a currency manipulator while china buys us 50 billion more in american energy products and at the same time spends us 32 billion more on agriculture over a two year period there are also pledges for tens of billions on manufactured products there are questions surrounding the deal though specifically where it concerns the timing of reductions to u s tariffs the purchases represent a direct increase in economic activity and a thawing of the u s china tensions which it is hoped will open up international trade more generally said jasper lawler head of research and education at london capital group citigroup s ms peterson looked at this through an american lens but of course trade both ways would be affected the u s s two largest export markets canada and mexico might experience reduced bilateral trade value with the u s under most strategies ms peterson said if the u s were to reduce exports with third party trading partners in order to satisfy the terms of the u s china trade deal according to the proposed shopping list then mexico and canada might be the most affected in nominal trade value she added hong kong south korea taiwan malaysia japan australia and several eu member states follow scenarios vary under two of them canada could see a drop in imports of u s goods to the tune of an average 1 19 per cent or 0 65 per cent of our gross domestic product ms peterson calculated the corresponding numbers for mexico are 1 73 and 0 93 per cent canada of course already has a fractured relationship with china since our detention of huawei technologies executive meng wanzhou who faces extradition to the u s among other things there are now restrictions on certain canadian agricultural exports and as columnist barrie mckenna writes the u s china deal could hit canadian exports of soybeans canola oil frozen pork lentils beans wheat coal and seafood read more what analysts say about the deal just getting to this stage is a huge relief jennifer lee bank of montreal yes the media will be trying to capture that kodak moment at 11 30 am et when both leaders finally put phase one of the u s china trade deal to bed though there is plenty of hard work ahead phase two and certainly other trading partners will suffer from this new effort just getting to this stage is a huge relief broadly speaking jennifer lee senior economist bank of montreal while on the one hand the risk of further escalations has now gone and is to be welcomed tariffs are still higher now than they were two years ago and in the short term are unlikely to come down meaning that as far as china and the u s are concerned this is as good as it gets until well into 2021 this realization on the part of u s investors that any further progress on trade was unlikely until well into next year sent u s markets into retreat after another day of record highs to close more or less flat on the day michael hewson chief analyst cmc markets this is a fairly one sided result for the u s administration and hence is a clear sign of the extent of the slowdown in the chinese economy is now likely to stay in a range until the chinese economy rebounds next year the deal is good till the u s election beyond this actual delivery likely depends on whether we have a democratic or republican administration all of the deal rests on chinese goodwill which is likely to come in short supply once its economy rebounds we expect the impact on the equity markets to be very muted as it digests the deal sébastien galy senior macro strategist nordea asset management there have been conflicting reports recently but it seems quite likely that the full details of the deal particularly china s commitments on additional agricultural product purchases will not be made public reports have suggested that the us 200 billion of total additional purchases that china will commit to would be spread fairly evenly across manufacturing energy agriculture and services the 86 page document also contains guarantees on technology transfer policies and conditions under which the u s could re impose tariffs that were dropped as part of the deal though again little is known on the detail adam cole chief currency strategist royal bank of canada the u s and china are expected to sign an interim trade deal today and it appears that traders are content to sit to on the fence until the agreement is made official the finer details of the deal are expected to be made public later so in the meantime volatility is expected to be low a huge amount of good news has already been factored into the equity markets so it is understandable that things are quiet ahead of the agreement being made official it was reported yesterday the tariffs will remain in place for at least 10 months after the signing of the deal so u s china relations might settle down david madden analyst cmc markets markets at a glance read more home sales climb from year ago home sales across canada dipped in

the treasury department released its semiannual report to congress on macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major trading partners of the united states the report which notionally is due to congress each april and october was the first issued since treasury designated china a currency manipulator in august 2019 the treasury department held back the october 2019 report as trade negotiations between china and the united states were ongoing it removed the designation and released the full report on monday two days ahead of an anticipated signing of a phase one deal which will include an agreement on currency the treasury department s august announcement designating china a currency manipulator charged china with devaluing its currency to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade the august designation was roundly criticized and ran counter to treasury s own analysis from the may 2019 report which estimated china had on net intervened to support the renminbi rmb yesterday s report notes treasury s close engagement with china over currency developments since the designation in a preview of what we can expect to see in the phase one agreement treasury claims china has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation and not target its exchange rate for competitive purposes such commitments would be consistent with earlier commitments made by china in the context of the communique released by g20 finance ministers and central bank governors as well as fact sheets issued after past bilateral u s china dialogues depending on the exact commitment agreement by china to publish information related to exchange rates and external balances as mentioned in the report could improve the transparency of chinese economic data the treasury department also notes the recent appreciation of the rmb which coincided with the announcement of a phase one agreement as a factor in removing the designation and just as the august announcement specified that the currency manipulator designation came under the auspices of president trump it s safe to assume the designation s removal also came with a presidential seal of approval in recent years the treasury department has sought to boost transparency of other countries economic data including currency related data treasury s report touts commitments in the united states mexico canada agreement usmca to avoid unfair currency practices and publish economic information it welcomes south korea s publication of foreign exchange intervention data the central bank s buying and selling of foreign currency for the first time starting last march the report also welcomes the commitment by singapore an economy with one of the world s largest current account surpluses at nearly 18 percent of gdp to begin publishing intervention data starting this year at present the strong dollar arguably masks the importance of such commitments countries that historically have intervened to weaken their currencies have had less need to do so because of the relatively stronger growth outlook in the united states and financial markets seemingly insatiable demand for dollar assets however treasury s report cautions that continued dollar strength is concerning while a weaker dollar might tempt u s trading partners to intervene in exchange markets to keep their currencies down making reporting of intervention data more critical in addition this report indicates that the treasury department is looking beyond traditional central bank intervention to understand how country authorities may seek to influence the exchange rate new since the may report treasury calls on china to increase public understanding of the relationship between the pboc china s central bank and the foreign exchange activities of the state owned banks including in the off shore rmb market this statement makes clear that exchange rates are impacted by more than direct central bank interventions in foreign exchange markets and suggests that transparency needs to extend beyond the publication of such data similarly the report includes a footnote expressing concern that taiwan may have engaged in substantial undisclosed foreign exchange intervention in the swap market as with other foreign exchange reports issued since the passage of the trade facilitation and trade enforcement act of 2015 no major trading partner other than china was found in the latest report to be manipulating its currency the 2015 act requires an assessment of the largest trading partners of the united states against three quantified thresholds trade balance with the united states overall current account deficit and foreign exchange intervention no economy breached the threshold for all three metrics the august 2019 designation of china as a manipulator was based not on the 2015 act but on the more subjective standards in section 3004 of an earlier 1988 act governing currency matters however the treasury department once again put several economies that breached two of the three 2015 thresholds on a monitoring list china japan south korea germany italy ireland singapore malaysia vietnam and switzerland of these economies only switzerland represented a new addition in the january report due to its growing trade surplus with the united states in addition the report singled out germany the netherlands and south korea for providing inadequate policy support for growth and calling on each to provide additional fiscal support finally the report notes that treasury is continuing to track carefully several other economies including taiwan and thailand that are not on the monitoring list but are close to triggering key thresholds while the report focuses on the foreign exchange policies of u s trading partners it also includes data on the u s economy touting strong growth of the u s economy along with healthy wage growth it also highlights the widening fiscal deficit which reached 4 6 percent of gdp for fy2019 versus 3 8 percent of gdp in fy2018 both higher expenditures and lower revenues as a percent of gdp contributed to the fiscal deterioration resulting in continued fiscal stimulus despite a u s economy at full employment with growth above potential fiscal policy matters in the current context as the international monetary fund has shown fiscal policy to be a key driver of current account balances stephanie segal is a senior fellow with the simon chair in political economy at the center for strategic and international studies in washington d c
washington the united states removed the currency manipulator label it imposed on china last summer in a sign of easing tensions between the economic powers after nearly two years of conflict just two days before president donald trump is set to sign a phase one trade agreement with china the us treasury said in its semi annual report to congress that the yuan has strengthened and beijing is no longer considered a currency manipulator although treasury refrained from slapping the label on china in its report last may trump in august angrily accused beijing of weakening its currency to steal our business and factories re stating a long standing grievance chinese authorities in august allowed the yuan to fall below 7 to the dollar sending shudders through stock markets at the time and stoking trump s ire over the summer china took concrete steps to devalue its currency also known as the renminbi rmb and those moves left the rmb at its weakest level against the dollar in over 11 years treasury said however more recently it strengthened to 6 93 to the dollar treasury said the new trade pact addresses currency issues in this agreement china has made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation and not target its exchange rate for competitive purposes treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement however that commitment is identical to the one beijing has long made as part of the group of 20 major global economies china s foreign ministry on tuesday said it had never been a currency manipulator and that the united states decision was in line with the facts we have not and never will use currency exchange rate as a tool to address trade conflict foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said at a regular press briefing adding that the international monetary fund had found the yuan s exchange rate in line with the economy s fundamentals though the semi annual currency report always gains attention as a key sign of relations between the powers the currency manipulator designation was largely symbolic the label calls for the us treasury committed to work with the imf to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by china s alleged actions and to consult with beijing about the matter as part of the trade deal china has also agreed to publish relevant information related to exchange rates and external balances however many economists questioned the decision to label china a manipulator in the first place china shouldn t have been designated to start with small current account surplus gdp scant intervention mark sobel a former treasury official said on twitter while he acknowledged the large trade surplus he said economists disregard those rmb fell in response to trump s tariffs designation was blatant errant political act sobel tweeted and china expert martin chorzempa said the announcement was getting way more attention than it should because it matters only on the most superficial symbolic level mnuchin said the phase one deal is significant and will lead to greater economic growth and opportunity for american workers and businesses however treasury said beijing still needs to take steps to stimulate domestic demand and reduce the chinese economy s reliance on investment and exports top chinese trade envoy liu he arrived monday in washington on monday ahead of wednesday s expected signing of the agreement after multiple rounds of tariffs the us trade deficit in goods through november 2019 was running at over 320 billion which is about 62 billion below the same period of 2018 chinese customs data showed tuesday that china s surplus had dropped 8 5 percent in 2019 to 296 billion treasury remains disturbed by the persistent and excessive trade and current account imbalances that mark the global economy the report said
ia cement has published its cement 2020 research report a comprehensive document looking at expected trends in 2020 the report takes a detailed outlook at consumption prospects around the world as well as a review of key risks competitive pressures and trading flows it examines the world s cement hotspots and leading producers and analyses the key topics of co 2 emissions and carbon taxes this article presents a summary from the report of 2020 demand prospects by region the global economy has slowed in recent months due to trade tensions as well as a growing number of mass demonstrations interest rate cuts have helped to offset these effects in 2019 the global cement industry is expected to post a demand growth of more than 3 in line with the previous year this growth is almost entirely driven by a surge in chinese consumption outside of china slowing growth in most regions is mainly offset by a sharp decline in middle east demand in 2020 the trends indicate a more balanced growth across regions moderate growth in western europe north america and china with a recovery in asia africa and latin america the middle east is expected to begin to stabilise led by a return to growth in saudi arabia moderate levels of cement demand growth are expected in all regions in 2020 with the exception of the middle east cement makers have achieved significant price increases in western europe to address surging carbon credits and this trend is expected to continue in eastern europe there is slowing demand in the central european countries but russian demand is growing once more due to public works in latin america a turnaround is forecast in mexico in 2020 the supply demand balance is likely to remain tight in china mainly due to capacity closures demand is forecast to improve across the rest of asia and africa driven by rising infrastructure spending seaborne trading markets are supported by a high level of chinese clinker imports export prices in asia are therefore relatively healthy turkish producers have cut prices aggressively in 2019 and have been able to take significant market share particularly in shipments to the us carbon taxes are leading to a reduction in cement exports from europe and south korea higher freight costs will promote more regional trading exports of cementitious products are predicted to decline due to a scarcity of supply western europe further price increases economic growth has slowed in the region with germany narrowly escaping recession in 2019 as a result ia cement predicts a moderate cement demand growth of 1 5 2 in 2020 the key driver is likely to be housing which is supported by very low interest rates and a price bubble in several markets more importantly the strong cement price increases of 2019 will continue into 2020 and beyond as producers look to recover the future costs of buying carbon credits european carbon prices are 24 t at the time of writing in the major markets spain offers the best demand growth prospects with demand predicted to rise 6 in 2020 this is driven by strong demand for housing offset by weak public works due to political instability in germany prospects are for a stable market next year as solid housing demand helps to offset a sharp economic slowdown italian demand is sluggish but the pricing environment is now much stronger following sector consolidation prices rose 10 in 2019 and are likely to rise above inflation again in 2020 the uk construction market is forecast to be flat due to brexit uncertainty eastern europe russia returns to growth a solid year of growth is expected in eastern europe with demand increasing 3 in 2020 this is driven by a reversal of the trend seen in recent years in 2020 strong growth in russia is predicted to offset a slowdown in previously fast growing central european countries subsidies from the european union are likely to fall sharply after 2020 following the loss of uk contributions post brexit and as funds are diverted to southern europe the key russian cement market is predicted to grow by 4 in 2020 as a major new infrastructure programme boosts demand us moderate growth ia cement expects a 2 growth in us cement consumption in 2020 infrastructure spending is increasing at a solid rate in the final year of the fast act the three recent interest rate cuts have significantly improved the outlook for the housing market although high house prices and labour shortages remain a problem commercial construction is forecast to be stable ahead of the presidential elections cement imports are likely to rise by a further 1 1 5 mt in 2020 with imports from turkey increasing further at the expense of lower shipments from europe and china latin america mixed picture in latin america ia cement predicts a turnaround in 2020 with projected cement demand growth of 2 this follows five years of falling demand and is highly contingent on a turnaround in mexico cement demand in mexico is expected to experience a double digit decline in 2019 as the first year of the amlo administration has been faced with multiple challenges there are signs that the market is nearing a trough and the national infrastructure plan is expected to provide stability over the medium term argentina is still in the grip of an economic crisis with a new president and the return of capital controls on a more positive note there is a clear sign of recovery in brazil and colombia and growth in cement consumption of 3 4 is anticipated in both markets in 2020 in colombia the long delayed 4g concession projects have finally started and work on the bogota metro line is due to start soon housing has begun to recover for the first time in three years brazil has finally passed its much needed pension reform a move expected to save the government us 195 million over 10 years the housing market is also growing solidly and will be the key driver of 2020 cement demand growth middle east stabilising cement consumption in the middle east has fallen by 17 since 2014 and a further decline of up to 1 in 2020 is predicted due to weaker markets in iran and turkey iran is struggling under the weight of full sanctions in turkey the economy has recovered well but the construction bubble has burst and will take longer to stabilise the saudi market is recovering well with double digit growth in demand in recent months since the end of ramadan combined with higher selling prices 2020 is shaping up to be a much better year for saudi producers africa recovery in sub saharan markets cement consumption in africa struggled in 2019 as elections and political instability affected a number of countries in 2020 ia cement expects a modest return to cement consumption growth of 2 3 this is driven by solid demand in sub saharan markets an acceleration in nigeria and a recovery in egypt the balance between supply and demand is unfavourable across most of the region squeezing margins and selling prices south africa is expected to struggle in 2020 due to weak economic growth rising cement imports and a new carbon tax china moderating growth the chinese cement market has grown at its best rate in six years during 2019 driven by strong housing demand at the start of the year the authorities are quickly changing policy in response to market growth or contraction however housing growth is expected to moderate in 2020 due to recent cooling measures but these are likely to be quickly lifted if the market enters a serious decline in a similar vein the authorities are increasing infrastructure spending to offset the economic slowdown but are prepared to spend more if needed as a result a relatively stable cement market appears likely in 2020 with a growth of 1 2 production controls and the closure of older plants have maintained a very tight supply demand balance clinker imports are predicted to remain high with a further fall in exports in 2020 chinese companies now have much stronger balance sheets and are well placed to invest overseas india hopes pinned on public works cement consumption in india has slowed sharply since the elections due to reduced infrastructure spending and a significant economic slowdown the central bank has cut interest rates aggressively but banks struggling with non performing loans have been reluctant to pass these on fully urban housing is struggling with excess stock levels in 2020 cement demand is predicted to increase 4 5 with a resumption in public works acting as the main driver asia outlook improving cement demand growth slowed sharply in the rest of asia during 2019 as trade tensions impacted nations that traditionally rely on exports in 2020 a moderate recovery in cement demand is forecast with a growth of 2 5 this is well below the trend of recent years a resumption of infrastructure spending is expected to boost cement demand in the philippines and indonesia a recovery in malaysia is predicted as chinese backed infrastructure projects are restarted japanese demand is expected to remain resilient following the tokyo olympics due to a number of large projects among more challenging markets south korea is struggling due to cooling measures in the property market election uncertainty is expected to hold back growth in myanmar and much weaker demand seems likely in hong kong as the demonstrations take their toll conclusions the global cement industry enters 2020 with a mixed outlook cement demand growth is likely to be stuck at a moderate pace in most regions middle east demand is predicted to fall again due to lower demand in iran and turkey rising selling prices are the main positive industry variable with prices predicted to increase at least in line with inflation shipping costs are expected to increase due to the new imo sulfur regulations corporate m a has slowed decisively due to growing economic uncertainty and access to credit has deteriorated in several markets pressure on the industry

gold has been on a tear lately reaching heights not scaled since 2013 to temporarily breach the 1600 an ounce level however with risk appetite also riding high on the back of easing trade frictions and us and iranian tensions appearing to have been defused for now what is keeping the popular safe haven at such elevated levels and can the rally be sustained in 2020 trade war and central bank easing have been positive for gold the price of gold had been actively supported during 2019 by a number of ongoing uncertainties primarily the trade war and brexit gold tends to benefit from increased geopolitical tensions or economic stress as investors flee into safe assets a fresh round of monetary easing by central banks around the world also contributed to gold s uptrend that picked up speed in late may before entering a consolidation phase in september but towards the end of the year as the global economic outlook started to brighten somewhat it was dollar selling and year end hedging that spurred the precious metal s breakout from its bullish flag gold closed 2019 with gains of 18 and after initially peaking at 1583 oz in early january it received another shot in the arm when tensions flared in the middle east with the united states and iran exchanging hostilities the fear of an all out war in the region drove the yellow metal to an almost 7 year high of 1611 oz on january 8 those tensions have since de escalated and while prices have retreated closer to 1550 oz the medium term outlook for gold remains fairly bullish high demand despite easing tensions so what is keeping gold in demand when the imminent threat of a conflict with iran has receded things are finally looking up on the trade front and there s even positive progress with brexit one answer is none of those risks have completely dissipated iran may have backed away from taking further retaliatory action against the us for the killing of its top military commander but the region remains highly volatile and could easily escalate again geopolitical tensions are not confined to the middle east however the ongoing protests in hong kong and the threat of new missile tests by north korea add to the list of things that can go wrong in 2020 moreover the trade war is far from resolved and with phase one out of the way the most crucial aspects of the trade dispute will be discussed in phase two and could prove even more tumultuous as for brexit the risk of a no deal scenario will once again rear its ugly head at the end of 2020 as britain pushes the eu for a swift trade deal plenty to worry about in 2020 a blow up of one or more of those risks would endanger the fragile recovery of the global economy which if the hit is substantial enough it could force the us federal reserve and other central banks to once again increase monetary stimulus expectations of fed rate cuts triggered the gold s upsurge during the summer and there was a further boost at the end of 2019 when policymakers signalled rates are likely to stay on hold throughout 2020 the fed s neutral stance has put a lid on treasury yields which have not rallied despite the improving prospects for global growth bond yields move negatively with gold prices as investors dump the precious metal in favour of higher yielding sovereign bonds when interest rates are rising and vice versa any deterioration of the growth picture could further increase the attractiveness of gold if investors begin to reassess their expectations of policy easing by the fed in 2020 in the midst of the aforementioned risks there has been another development that s been boosting gold prices de dollarization over the past year central banks have stepped up their diversification of their holdings away from dollar reserves in an effort to weaken the us s political grip on international transactions with gold being the main alternative if that trend continues in 2020 it could provide underlying support for the commodity softening any potential selloffs equities market and us presidential election an upside risk looking further ahead into the year aside from the existing uncertainties there are a couple of new major risks for financial markets that could help extend gold s current uptrend the first is the rally in equity markets which is looking worryingly overstretched in the us even if the american economy was to strengthen in the coming months wall street would still be in danger of a negative correction as it s unlikely that corporate earnings will be able to keep up with the present high valuations although the probability of a big stock market crash is low without any unforeseen shocks especially given the abundance of liquidity in the markets gold still stands to gain substantially from a correction in stock prices the other big risk is the us presidential election in november markets have yet to price in the possibility of a democrat winning the presidential race especially if a left wing liberal such as bernie sanders was to win the party s nomination a democratic win would almost certainly be negative for us stocks and perhaps on the immediate growth outlook as well which in turn would be positive for gold under such scenarios the bulls could push the yellow metal as high as the 1733 level which is the 78 6 fibonacci retracement of the 2011 2015 downtrend in the more near term however the 1630 level is a more realistic target which happens to be the 261 8 fibonacci extension of the november downleg will a growth rebound materialize but while it s easy to remain cautious about the outlook with so many uncertainties lingering in the background those same variables could also have a positive outcome and we may yet see a strong rebound in the global economy by year end improving growth around the world could be the worst thing that could happen to gold prices in 2020 as it would spell the end of the global easing cycle twenty twenty could also be the year that inflation makes a comeback with some early signs of price pressures building in the us economy the services component of the consumer price index rose sharply in the second half of 2019 and commodity prices have also been trending higher the question is if overall inflation does start to pick up will it be persistent the fed is unlikely to raise interest rates if higher inflation is not accompanied by higher growth unless the increase in price pressures proves to be more than a just temporary phase if the outlook for interest rates started to change whether from faster growth or inflation or both gold could initially seek support around 1515 the swing high from november however a bigger test for gold s bullish run would come around 1480 which is the 50 fibonacci of both the 2011 2015 long term down move and the november slide gold vs dollar in general though as some or all of those risks come into play gold s outlook will stay closely tied to the performance of the us dollar and the extent to which the greenback holds onto its appeal versus its rivals the dollar s and gold s inverse relationship broke down around the middle of 2019 as both rallied simultaneously it will be interesting to see whether or not that relationship is restored in 2020
gold and silver offer a great opportunity be ready to buy the dip gold and silver just hit new highs following a multi month correction it is interesting to note that none of the mining etfs have broken their 2016 peaks the only etf to break its september high was silj back to the metals the catalyst for the recent pop forecast in advance by the technicals was on the back of iran s retaliatory strikes against the u s and in my opinion a speech by bernanke calling for more extreme monetary and fiscal policy measures in the united states i e debt monetization including negative interest rates although retrospection is 20 20 it was relatively obvious that this spike higher would be short lived gold and silver were extreme overbought from a technical and positioning perspective sentiment was extremely bullish and news headlines such as the iran strikes seldom have a lasting impact gold rallied 130 or 9 to 1613 from december 23 rd to january 8th just eleven days the daily rsi reached 84 something that has only occurred seven times in the past twenty years and each time led to at least a short term pullback the daily macd histogram was the highest since february 2016 the macd line was clearly negatively divergent to its prior price peak in september more importantly the weekly chart was clearly showing a pullback was overdue as i shared in my article last week we had multiple negative divergences playing out in the weekly rsi and macds simply put we had multiple technical signals across multiple time frames signaling a pop and drop was coming it was also clear in cot positioning data that at least a short term pullback was overdue then there was sentiment back to extremes not seen since the peak in september inter market analysis based on real yields and tips which i reported on back on december 19 also signaled a rally was coming to be followed by a reversal since then 5 year real yields reached their lowest level since february 2017 at 10 basis points and are now rising again 5 year real yield courtesy of quandl com the gold and silver miners failed to break out to new highs too all except silj which is still well below its 2016 peak by itself perhaps immaterial but when taken with all of the other data meaningful i am sharing this for future reference to illustrate the fact that almost every time we get a breakout to the upside people let their emotions take over and ignore all data and facts that suggest any form of reversal traditional tools don t matter in a market like this after a major breakout sometimes they don t but history says that it is far more probable that they do at least in the short term this is especially true in markets like gold and silver where emotions tend to run high sentiment is at its best as a contrarian indicator in this sector when everyone says up we go look south and vice versa when they re throwing in the towel similar signals can be seen in silver so i won t show them in order to avoid repetition i can hear you say that s great david but where do we head next from here the honest answer is i don t know based on extremities in technicals sentiment and positioning it would suggest a sizeable or long pullback assuming the recent negatively divergent peaks were the top of wave 1 of 3 in each of gold and silver the following levels appear reasonable for wave 2 gold 1510 61 8 of 1446 1613 1486 76 4 a break of 1446 would clearly signal a much deeper dive is taking place silver 17 50 61 8 of 16 57 18 89 17 00 76 4 85 4 16 57 is the line in the sand here my final comments are with regard to the bigger picture the tweet below captures it well i would also add that if the fed can t allow u s treasury yields to rise significantly because of the perceived risk of u s insolvency due to the rising cost of interest on the debt they must print dollars to buy the debt and keep yields down this means that real yields can only rise meaningfully if we get deflation deflation now would cause economic and systemic collapse including the solvency of the u s government by contrast if inflation rises as the fed prints dollars to cap nominal bond yields real yields fall which typically means gold and silver prices soar the only situation where i can see real yields rise meaningfully is a 2008 type scenario when real yields spiked for a short period of time due to soaring deflationary fears associated with the crash in the stock market gold and silver dumped temporarily as a result even if this occurs the fed could not allow it to last very long without risking total collapse of the system in summary absent a massive but temporary spike in real yields and dump in precious metals the future looks extremely bright for gold silver and the miners going forward david brady gold and silver remain gold prices which are up more than 35 during the past four years recently eased into a trading range following a double digit price jump during 2019 so far this year silver prices are running just slightly behind long time traders liken silver to gold on steroids because in past rallies it has tended to lag the yellow metal at the start but then vault past as retail buyers flocked in i remember well silver nearly tripling in value to nearly 50 usd an ounce amidst the 2008 financial crisis we are seeing many of the same signs right now silver shipments by the royal canadian mint spiked by 42 during the third quarter and are up 29 year to date wholesalers tell me they can t get enough of the stuff particularly 100 ounce silver bars falling mine supply strong demand gold and silver are alike in many ways both are noble metals which have been recognized as stores of value for millennia however many argue that the long term fundamentals for silver which is seeing strong industrial demand are even better than those for gold for one silver is a thinly traded market silver is expensive to mine and is generally only produced these days as a by product yet while silver has many qualities as a monetary metal more than half of all production is used in industrial applications and a further 20 in jewellery furthermore key fundamentals are out of whack for example as keith neumeyer ceo of first majestic silver points out the current gold to silver mine supply ratio is just 8 1 yet gold prices are 80 times higher than silver prices far above their historical mean demand has also outpaced supply for more than a decade with much of the difference coming from recycling existing stocks but those pools are shrinking neumeyer reckons that silver recycling stocks are at a quarter century low worse according to the silver institute production issues ranging from strikes across south america to lower than expected grades at key mines have hampered output silver supply which has fallen for the past three years is expected to shrink again in 2020 when the final numbers are released a pound of silver or a british one pound note indeed one of silver s most interesting properties has been as a store of wealth the fact that the french use the same word argent for silver and for money illustrates its multi millennia history as money even the british pound one of the world s most stable currencies has its origins in the fact that it was once backed by silver one example illustrates the difference between holding physical silver and government issued paper indeed the british pound got its name because it once represented a pound of silver today a pound of silver is worth well over 200 british paper pounds this suggests that the pound which the bank of england claims is a store of value has lost more than 99 5 of its value that is remarkable only in the sense that the british pound if you can believe it is one of the world s oldest and most stable currencies almost all others have fared much worse an easy way into precious metals silver s properties as jewellery and coins are beyond question you can feel the difference instantly even children who are growing up with iphones and androids instinctively grasp silver s beauty and inherent physical characteristics when you give them a coin or two which i often do for christmas advocates like to say that gold is the currency of kings however silver s reputation as the currency of gentlemen encompasses its historical role as an easy way to sample precious metals fiat money for its part is the currency of politicians it shouldn t be too hard to figure out which to trust indeed precious metals enthusiasts like to point out that all government issued currencies inevitably revert to their intrinsic value which is zero but gold and silver remain larisa sprott please check back for new articles and updates at commoditytrademantra com
president donald trump signed phase one of a u s china trade deal wednesday marking a cooling of the trade war that has roiled markets and upset supply chains around the globe on paper the deal will enhance intellectual property ip protection tackle forced technology transfer and boost market access to key sectors of the chinese economy such as financial services and agriculture an enforcement provision will allow the u s to unilaterally reimpose tariffs if the americans think china has welched on its commitments in exchange the trump administration will drop or reduce many of the tariffs imposed on chinese goods imported to the united states however trickier aspects of the u s china trade dispute like subsidies for china s state owned enterprises haven t been included in phase one and they may never get tackled at all so unyielding is each side s position this makes it all too likely that the two countries will return to trade tensions and new tariffs experts say i expect this agreement will be fairly temporary says james h nolt a senior fellow specializing on asia at the world policy institute in new york they ve kind of papered over some disagreements and made promises that can t be kept what s in the phase one trade deal like most trade deals phase one has a little something for both sides to tout china is promising to buy 200 billion of american goods over the next two years 50 billion worth of energy 40 billion in agriculture 35 40 billion in services and 75 billion of manufactured products sources on both sides told the south china morning post washington has already scrapped extra tariffs that were due to come into force on dec 15 and cut in half a 15 levy on 120 billion worth of chinese goods still 25 tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese goods remain in place on monday night the u s also removed china from a list of currency manipulators in preparation for the deal the enforcement provision is viewed as especially important for washington since china has reneged or slow walked similar structural promises have many times in the past including after it joined the world trade organization in 2001 with a commitment to open its economy along a five year timetable however xu bin professor of economics and finance at the china europe international business school in shanghai believes beijing intends to keep to its side of its bargain with trump mainly because the reforms in the trade deal are not the most painful on the table and in the long term will actually benefit china i think china will keep to but china will do so to the extent that it is benefiting itself says xu if we look at the relative needs of these two countries economically speaking i think china needs the u s market more certain provisions are also likely to benefit both sides for instance protections for intellectual property were long a priority for u s business leaders but china is no longer a technology laggard and may actually be helped by strengthening ip protections as its firms begin to dominate strategic industries such as 5g and artificial intelligence likewise for new market access to u s financial services firms even if some domestic companies lose out in the short term economists have long argued that china as a whole would benefit from western companies being allowed to offer banking insurance and other financial services even if credit cards are largely obsolete due to advanced mobile payment apps what s more 40 billion of agriculture imports over two years is actually less than the 24 billion china purchased annually before the trade conflict began what do trump and xi get out of the deal in the end it might not matter much for trump who has already been touting the deal in his re election campaign some 200 guests have reportedly been invited for the signing ceremony in the east room of the white house where trump is scheduled to sign the document alongside chinese vice premier liu he who has led beijing s negotiating team chinese president xi jinping may not have election rallies to worry about but he is not immune to political pressure between growth at a three decade low international censure at the u n over human rights abuses in restive xinjiang province popular revolt in hong kong and taiwan s voters unequivocally rejecting his pitch for reunification in elections last weekend xi would clearly appreciate clearing one festering crisis from his in tray criticism of his handling of the dispute has continued to rumble amongst china s academic and elite circles even if the state censorship apparatus has kept it largely scrubbed from press and social media key for xi is is ensuring the nation s economy is as healthy as possible despite improved monthly trade figures released tuesday the full year trade story is pretty bad nick marro lead for global trade at the economist intelligence unit writes in a briefing note the chinese don t want the bad news of an ongoing trade war to hang over public opinion and investor confidence says nolt but this won t be the end of trade wars few believe we have seen the end of tariffs wielded as a political cudgel while trump has used import taxes or their threat against countries from india and south korea to canada and mexico he has not been alone in rebooting their use worldwide japan and south korea also recently become embroiled in their own trade wrangle over historical abuses during tokyo s colonial rule of the korean peninsula according to nolt the problem stems from global business coalescing behind a few private monopolies think google facebook amazon and even large pharmaceutical firms that generate huge profits but do little to boost wages or create jobs owing to the fact they are mainly about leveraging the ip of the services they provide rather than the manufacture and trade of goods part of it is that the business system itself has changed and the trading system hasn t adapted to take it into account says nolt the popular benefits of the old trading system are gone but instead of targeting the systemic causes of these problems populists have often picked easier targets whether it is immigrants stealing jobs or chinese factories taking orders away from american ones so you will see more trade protectionism used as a tool by politicians says xu and so while a truce in the trade war suits both sides at the moment it won t be long before that political calculation changes the u s is still demanding that china reforms its state dominated economy despite many of the subsidies beijing provides firms also offered by the u s amazon for example was offered 3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives to relocate to new york city before the deal collapsed it s not just domestic u s firms in 2017 foxconn received 4 billion in state and local tax incentives to build a manufacturing plant in wisconsin that would employ 13 000 people which trump hailed as one of the great deals ever aside from the fact that the cost to the taxpayer amounted to 346 000 per job and the factory remains mothballed foxconn is a taiwanese firm with 90 of employees in mainland china surely if trump is demanding that china stops offering state subsidies beijing might think it deserves reciprocity and that the u s should agree to stop offering billions in tax breaks to american firms as well as using such incentives to lure away established chinese investors like foxconn until recently foxconn was china s single largest private employer with over a million staff china is especially sensitive given its history of being forced into unequal treaties with western powers says nolt of course trump has in fact boosted subsidies for american farmers to the tune of 28 billion more than twice the 12 billion obama controversially used to bail out the u s auto industry and there remain other unequal aspects of the trade relationship like the need for american firms to partner with a chinese firm in the auto industry which is a prime source of forced technology transfer but that is already changing u s automaker tesla just built its new shanghai factory without partnering with a chinese firm for example telsa also receives chinese tax breaks including a government subsidy of 3 560 per vehicle produced and so with negotiations on the subject destined to fail it probably won t be long until trump reaches for tariffs once again as populism takes root across the globe other nations too are likely to take similar measures this is something that all countries need to face up to says xu the professor in shanghai how to alleviate the pain and disadvantage of those people who suffer from not only globalization but also the more technological developed world
bob browne executive vice president and chief investment officer for northern trust introduced the firm s 2020 market outlook during a roundtable discussion with members of the financial services media according to browne northern trust continues to be moderately overweight risk entering 2020 while the global economy stabilizes after an episode of mid year weakness in 2019 we expect markets to focus on tensions between economic growth and political risks such as the u s china trade war brexit and the 2020 u s election browne says echoing its previous projections northern trust anticipates the combination of moderate growth and technological innovation will continue to suppress inflation which in turn will bolster the global central bank easing cycle that is already well underway this leaves us continuing to favor lower risk risk assets such as u s equities and high yield bonds browne explains he suggests that central bankers unable to do anything about inflation are increasingly willing to serve political agendas to support the global economy as a result we are entering 2020 on a new global easing cycle equities and real assets browne observes that equity markets rebounded strongly in 2019 helped by the federal reserve s policy reversal the fed cut rates three times which helped distract investors form the u s china trade dispute and slowing economic growth brown says in 2020 we expect companies to return to earnings growth with more global demand from reduced trade tension and easy monetary policy under this regime northern trust projects the highest returns to be in non u s developed markets particularly in europe though such returns will come with elevated risk for its part the u s is expected to deliver a solid return with less risk in 2019 northern trust s research shows global real estate and listed infrastructure assets performed well driven by falling interest rates natural resources lagged on slower economic growth and stagnant oil prices this year we expect continued low interest rates and attractive income to support global real estate and listed infrastructure brown says like last year we anticipate slow economic growth of approximately 2 5 gdp growth to weigh on natural resources fixed income and interest rates on the fixed income side 2019 bond market returns were strong benefitting from the combination of falling interest rates and tighter credit spreads as browne observes it paid to take on duration and credit risk in 2019 looking forward we expect more moderate but positive bond returns and continued low interest rates which may fall even more browne says investment grade fixed income will provide a return premium over cash northern trust s analysis posits that the u s federal reserve is likely to cut rates twice in 2020 which will potentially restore steepness in the yield curve we recommend taking on duration risk in portfolios where appropriate browne says the investor perspective allianz life insurance company of north america also published a 2020 market outlook this week this one focused more on investors expectations rather than the fund manager outlook the research suggests 43 of americans are worried a recession is right around the corner down from 50 in q3 2019 at the same time 39 of respondents say they are worried about a big market crash on the horizon down from 48 in q3 2019 interestingly despite this current sense of calm the number of people who say now is a good time to invest in the market continues to decrease observes kelly lavigne vice president of consumer insights allianz life this may be because people are anticipating more volatility in 2020 and don t want to take the risks that those major swings can have on their savings and retirement according to the allianz research nearly one third of respondents 31 say putting some money into a financial product that provides a guaranteed stream of income in retirement is the most important step to take to help make sure they have a secure retirement this is up from 26 last quarter perhaps reflecting momentum from the passage of the setting every community up for retirement enhancement act risks from inflation are top of mind the survey shows almost half 49 of americans say the rising cost of living is a big risk to their security in retirement and over one third 34 say that inflation may prevent them from ever being able to retire those with the longest runway toward retirement millennials are most worried about the impact of rising costs both now and in their future the allianz analysis finds they are more likely to say the rising cost of living is preventing them from saving money for retirement as much as they should 62 compared with 56 of gen xers and 42 of baby boomers millennials are also most worried about being able to pay for necessities like housing or medical care in retirement due to the rising cost of living 50 compared with 46 of gen xers and 35 of boomers the rising cost of living is a real threat to hard earned retirement savings particularly as people are spending more time in retirement lavigne says but less than four in 10 38 say they are confident that their financial plan can deal with the rising cost of living the good news is that a majority of people 60 recognize having a financial product that offers the opportunity for increasing income can help reduce that risk boomers are even more likely to agree at 63

you john and good morning everyone it s good to be with you on my first earnings call as i go through my remarks i d ask that you remember that i just joined wells fargo less than three months ago it s been a busy time as i ve been working to get to know the company our opportunities and challenges and i ve learned a lot but as i discussed my observations please recognize that it s still early days i don t have all the answers yet but i will share more as i learn more and as the year progresses john is going to cover the quarter in detail in a few minutes and we ll answer your questions you can see that a series of legacy issues meaningfully impacted our results in the quarter even excluding these significant items our results are not a strong as we aspire too but the strength of the franchise is still evident there are certainly some areas of success but the opportunity to improve our results is significant and attainable let me first share some of my observations and thoughts before turning it over to john first i was honored to be chosen to lead wells fargo because i believe this is an extraordinary company that plays an important role in this country we came out of the financial crisis as the most valuable and most respected bank in the us but as you know we made some terrible mistakes and have not effectively addressed our shortcomings these circumstances have led to financial underperformance but we have one of the most enviable financial services franchises in the world and employees that want to do what s necessary to again be one of the most respected and successful banks in the us to fully capture this opportunity we must have a strong foundation and move with an extreme sense of urgency to remediate our historical issues we still have much more work to do to put these issues behind us and our future depends on us doing this successfully so we can regain trust with all stakeholders including our clients regulators lawmakers as well as the broader american population ultimately our actions will dictate when that trust is completely regained not our words given the importance of these issues i want to say a few more words about our situation particularly about the challenges that stand in the way of our success and importantly the different approach we re taking to address these issues providing an honest assessment and clear priorities is critical and i ve given a clear message inside the company that we have not yet met our own expectations or the expectations of others we must do what s necessary to put these issues behind us our ability to maximize the value of this great franchise is dependent on us running the company with the highest standards of operational excellence and integrity beyond what we ve done to date we are appropriately a highly regulated institution and while we need to fulfill regulatory expectations we recognize that what we want and what regulators want are not different we are responsible for our actions and they re responsible for ensuring our actions are consistent with clearly defined standards it s our job to run the company such that we fulfill their expectations and those of the american public and other countries where we operate respect was earned in the past and we will earn it again as such since joining i ve been spending almost all of my time on these issues i will say this several times but you should note there is still much work to do many have focused on the fed consent order but remember we have 12 public enforcement actions that require significant resource commitment while i certainly wish more of this work was behind us what s required of us is clear and we will get it done it s worked that other banks have done already so there is a clear roadmap for what we need to achieve we are making significant changes to our management structure and processes to accomplish our work changes that will make us more effective like any other problem recognition of the importance in severity is a necessary first step but this by itself is inadequate we will take whatever actions are necessary our future success depends on resolving these issues so we will act accordingly the management team will be judged and held accountable for resolving these issues to set us up for success we will ensure we have the right people in place to both resolve these issues and be the stewards of this great company importantly i want to acknowledge that we have so many wonderful people at wells fargo that have done an amazing jobs serving our clients and customers in the face of adversity for several years now they ve been through so much and have helped us sustain such a great franchise so i do want to say thank you to them for all they ve done the warmth and support i ve been greeted with as i ve discussed our shortcomings and work in front of us tells a great deal about the character of many at the company they understand our lack of progress makes their jobs far more difficult and they re looking to management to do more to move the company forward to get the work done we must ensure that we have the right team to that end we ve made some important changes to the senior team to complement the talent that s here at wells scott powell joined us as chief operating officer when i arrived at the company many on the senior management team made clear to me that they believed we needed stronger execution skills after just several weeks at the company i came to quickly agree scott will lead a transformation across the company where high quality execution clear accountability and operational excellence becomes part of our culture bill daley joined us head of public affairs he has a strong and experienced voice and brings perspectives from the public sector that we in business do not generally have but are critical for us as we make decisions allen parker who served both as general counsel and interim ceo announced he will be leaving wells in march we are well into a search for the new general counsel and excited about the quality of the candidates we ve met avid modjtabai has announced that she will be retiring after 26 years at wells fargo in march we will be announcing a new organizational structure for these activities shortly ray fischer has also joined us to run our card and merchant services businesses our card business is important to our franchise and we have an opportunity to make it even more significant ray has an experienced card and merchant services executive who brings deep knowledge and a fresh perspective to our business these changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles such as heads of risk hr internal audit and technology these new additions complement the strong talent at the company and i will continue to look at the structure and roles to ensure we are best positioned for success we need and will have the best talent and strong leadership at the company we re also introducing a new set of disciplines in how we run the company which i m confident will improve our performance these changes are not only structural and procedural but also cultural to that point parts of our culture are wonderful and will take decades to recreate people who work here love it it really is like a second family we focus on teamwork not on the individual people want to be successful and do what s right though we recognized we fallen short of this call but our lack of progress and underperformance point to shortcomings going forward we will operate as one company not a series of decentralized businesses we will continue to foster a culture of partnership but we will move past the need for consensus and have open and direct fact based discussions where we emerged with decisions we will have a different level of management discipline than we ve had in the past and we will value and expect high quality execution there will be clear responsibility and accountability we will judge ourselves based upon our outcomes not our words and we will ultimately judge ourselves versus the best as we believe that we should be the best as we ve begun to implement this new culture the response has been overwhelmingly supportive but i understand it s different and is a significant change for many we will be respectful of our past and of those who have built this great franchise which includes so many still at the company today but we must move forward i m confident these changes will be highly impactful and though i understand you would like time frames around resolution i cannot provide that today our job is to do the work that s necessary regulators and other stakeholders will determine when it s done to their satisfaction my experience is that our regulators are clear direct tough but fair the work is on us at this point let me now turn to our medium and longer term opportunities our franchises are world class and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies and importantly we play an important role in helping our customers and clients prosper as well as being an important enabler for us economic growth while i ve just spoken at length of our mistakes and our commitments to fix them the underlying franchise itself is as valuable as ever and our opportunities are greater than ever the success of our business model is proven assuming we run the company with the appropriate controls and work as one company with the goal of delivering for all stakeholders all of our business segments community banking wealth and investment management and wholesale have the breadth and scale that gives us significant competitive advantage and allow us to deliver truly differentiated products and experiences for our customers and clients our opportunity to use technology to drive both automation and new solutions will only grow in importance our franchises both individual and collectively are the envy of many so while our resources and attention today are appropriately preoccupied with historical issues as we move forward we will be in a position to leverage our unique franchise and generate stronger financial results and just to be clear we are well aware that our expense levels are significantly too high part of this is driven by significant project expense related to historical issues part is due to the necessary investments in technology part is due to significant inefficiencies that exist across the organization but there is no reason why we shouldn t have best in class efficiency with these businesses at this scale and that ultimately will be our goal and though we ve had pockets of strong performance we re also well aware that our rate of customer and revenue growth is too low given what we ve been though this isn t surprising there is certainly an opportunity cost due to the asset cap management time and resources have not been as focused on growth as they otherwise would have been and we have an opportunity think differently with different level of rigor about how to grow the franchise all of this points to great opportunity so again i know you will want to know time frames and targets but please understand that it s too early after less than three months at the company that said we have just begun the process to rethink our plans for 2020 and beyond in a different level of detail while the opportunities for improvement are clear at the macro level we need business by business plans accordingly we have just begun conducting what are really both budget and broader business reviews where we look in detail at our plans we will be reviewing over 10 businesses in detail as well as all of our enterprise functions as you can imagine technology is an important theme this isn t merely a review of the numbers but one where we use the facts to form a basis to discuss strategy and potential actions we were asking each business leader to show us what best in class efficiency looks like and what our path to achieve it is we re reviewing revenue and return performance as well and what a path to best class looks like here as well we re discussing our competitors large and small and we re thinking through our unique options given our special franchise these are analytical and strategic discussions that i don t think if occurred consistently across the company in some time given what s occurred the output of this work will provide us road maps to not only improve our performance within each business but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly first and foremost this includes clarity around ensuring we re spending appropriately on historical issues it s still very early in our process but i will say that every session thus far has reinforced that our opportunities are meaningful we intend to be detailed thoughtful and complete to do this properly and given our priorities it will take time much of this year to complete our work but in the interim we will devote all necessary resources to risk and control and spend what s necessary we will be as diligent as ever to drive efficiencies and control expenses and we will begin to work through the business opportunities we have in front of us i m confident in our ability to realize our potential one that again puts us at the top of the respected financial institutionalist with the far more efficient organization and higher revenue growth than you see today while there is much to do and i know the path to success will be bumpy i m optimistic about our future and excited to be at a place with so many great people and such strong franchises doing incredibly important work john over to you john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks charlie good morning everyone we had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results which we highlight on page 2 of our supplement we had 1 9 billion of operating losses including 1 5 billion of litigation accruals for a variety of matters including previously disclosed retail sales practice matters the litigation accruals reduced eps by 0 33 and the majority of them were not tax deductible we had a 362 million gain from the sale of our commercial real estate brokerage business eastdil secured we had 166 million of expenses related to the strategic reassessment of technology projects in wealth and investment management we had a 153 million linked quarter decrease in low income housing tax credit investment income reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition we had a 134 million gain on loan sales predominantly junior lien mortgages and we had a 125 million loan loss reserve release while our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items as we show on page 3 we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity which i ll highlight throughout the call on page 4 we summarize the full year results compared with 2018 revenue declined as 4 growth in non interest income was more than offset by a 6 decline in net interest income driven by lower interest rates our expenses remain too high and increased 4 from a year ago driven by higher personnel expense which included 981 million of higher deferred comp expense which is p l neutral and higher operating losses loans grew 1 and deposits increased 3 from a year ago our net charge off rate remain near historic lows and we returned a total of 30 billion to shareholders in 2019 through common stock dividends and net share repurchases reducing common shares outstanding by 10 i ll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page 5 throughout the call but i will note here that we were 20 billion below the asset cap at the end of the fourth quarter turning to page 6 i ll be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call but i want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19 1 in the fourth quarter which included a net discrete income tax expense of 303 million predominantly related to the non tax deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals turning to page 7 average loans increased linked quarter and year over year with growth in both consumer and commercial loans period end loans increased 9 2 billion from a year ago even as we sold or moved to held for sale a total of 5 8 billion of consumer loans over the past year i ll highlight the drivers of the linked quarter growth in loans starting on page 9 commercial loans increased 3 4 billion from the third quarter driven by broad based c i growth in corporate investment banking as we show on page 10 consumer loans grew 4 billion from the third quarter the first mortgage loan portfolio increased 3 2 billion from the prior quarter driven by 17 8 billion of held for investment mortgage loan originations and the purchase of 2 3 billion of loans as a result of exercising servicer cleanup calls we re now substantially done with our cleanup call program for pre 2008 securitizations junior lien mortgage loans were down 1 3 billion from the third quarter as paydowns continued to outpace new originations credit card loans increased 1 4 billion primarily due to seasonality our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up 1 1 billion from the third quarter originations were down 1 linked quarter on seasonality but increased 45 from a year ago reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business turning to deposits on page 11 average deposit costs increased 2 from the third quarter and 4 from a year ago our average deposit cost of 62 basis points increased 7 basis points from a year ago reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher cost deposit higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses our average deposit cost declined 9 basis points from the third quarter reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and wim we did not run any broad based retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter however retail banking deposits increased 2 basis points due to continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher while we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and cd rates within our branches retail banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire on page 12 we provide details on period end deposits which grew 3 from a year ago and 1 from the third quarter wholesale banking deposits were up 15 9 billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances consumer and small business banking deposits increased 16 billion from the third quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth and high yield savings and interest bearing checking wealth and investment management deposits grew as brokerage clients reallocation of cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives moderated during the quarter these increases were partially offset by lower corporate treasury and mortgage escrow deposits net interest income declined 425 million from the third quarter primarily due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment 104 million of lower hedge ineffectiveness accounting results as well as 74 million of higher mbs premium amortization costs due to higher prepayment rates we had 445 million of mbs premium amortization in the fourth quarter and based on the current interest rate environment we expect mbs premium amortization to be relatively stable in the first quarter and then start to decline although we expect it to be higher in full year 2020 compared with full year 2019 as expected net interest income was down 6 in 2019 compared with 2018 now we continue to expect net interest income to decline in the low to mid single digits in 2020 however as always net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan and deposit growth rates pricing spreads the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve turning to page 14 non interest income declined 1 7 billion from the third quarter which included a 1 1 billion gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends we completed the sale eastdil secured on october 1 resulting in a 362 million gain that was reflected in other non interest income this sale reduced commercial real estate brokerage commissions by 168 million from the third quarter we provide a breakout of the revenue and direct expense related to this business on page 27 in the appendix we re assessing all of our businesses as part of the reviews we re having since charlie joined wells fargo and there may be additional pruning going forward as we assess our strategic priorities mortgage banking revenue increased 317 million from the third quarter servicing income was up 165 million due to a negative msr valuation adjustment in the third quarter reflecting higher prepayment rates net gains on mortgage originations increased 152 million due to a 4 billion increase in residential held for sale mortgage loan originations while the production margin was flat at 121 basis points net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising servicer cleanup calls in the fourth quarter we expect mortgage originations to be lower in the first quarter due to normal seasonality net gains from equity securities were down 505 million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by a 240 million increase in deferred comp plan investment results which again are largely p l neutral turning to expenses on page 15 our expenses were too high and becoming more efficient remains a top priority i will explain the drivers of the linked quarter and year over year increases in more detail starting on page 16 expenses increased 415 million from the third quarter driven by higher personnel and equipment expense the 320 million increase in compensation and benefits was driven by 258 million of higher deferred comp plan expense we also had higher salaries expense primarily due to changes in staffing mix which was partially offset by lower fte as a reminder we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense driven by the strategic reassessment of technology projects and wim our operating losses remained elevated but we re stable linked quarter as we show on page 17 expenses increased 2 3 billion from a year ago driven by higher personnel expense and operating losses comp and benefits expense increased 1 1 billion which included 691 million of higher deferred comp expense as well as higher salaries expense primarily due to staffing mix changes and annual salary increase running the business non discretionary expense increased by 1 5 billion of higher operating losses partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense on the earnings call last quarter we said we expected our 2019 expenses to be approximately 53 billion which was at the high end of our 52 billion to 53 billion target range as we showed on page 18 we came in above that as fourth quarter expenses were higher than expected primarily in three areas first we had higher than forecasted outside professional services expense these expenses were primarily related to legal technology and risk management second we had higher impairments and other writedowns including the strategic reassessment of technology projects in wim that i previously mentioned as well as impairments on railcars finally we had higher personnel related accruals including severance turning to our business segments starting on page 19 community banking earnings declined 570 million from the third quarter primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities on page 20 we provide our community banking metrics we had 30 3 million digital active customers in the fourth quarter up 4 from a year ago including 7 growth in mobile active customers from a year ago primary consuming checking customers consumer checking customers grew 2 from a year ago the nineth consecutive quarter of year over year growth branch customer experience survey scores in december increased from a year ago reflecting the fundamental changes we ve made to improve the customer experience the decline in branch customer experience survey scores from the third quarter was most likely due to changes in branch staffing levels we re pleased with the progress we ve been making to improve customer satisfaction was reflected in the j d power 2019 national banking satisfaction study released in december our customer satisfaction scores improved by 9 points from last year study the largest increase among our large bank peers improving the customer experience across wells fargo remains a priority and as part of this focus we are implementing the net promoter system to allow even more dynamic customer feedback and benchmarking as a result of this implementation we ll no longer be reporting branch customer experience survey scores however we will continue to share key business drivers that reflect the progress we re making to improve the customer experience and to drive loyalty turning to page 21 teller and atm transactions declined 6 from a year ago as a result of our customers continuing to migrate to digital channels we consolidated 174 branches in 2019 we had 5 352 branches at the end of 2019 down 12 over the past three years we also continue to have strong card usage with linked quarter and year over year growth in both credit and debit card purchase volume turning to page 22 wholesale banking earnings declined 151 million from the third quarter driven by lower revenue we are an industry leader in businesses that support low income housing and renewable energy investments with which both generate income tax credits these income tax benefits do not get included in revenue so as you can see in the table on this page we re reporting both our consistent wholesale efficiency ratio and we re also providing our efficiency ratio adjusted for income tax credits in order to make this ratio more reflective of how we evaluate the business wealth and investment management earnings declined 1 billion from the third quarter which included a 1 1 billion pre tax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business for the first time since the first quarter of 2017 wim had linked quarter growth in average deposits up 2 from the third quarter and total client assets increased 10 from a year ago on higher market valuations including 18 growth in retail brokerage advisory assets closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between wim and community banking were up 18 in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago with december having over 1 billion in closed referrals our strongest month since june of 2017 turning to page 24 we continue to have strong credit results with 32 basis points of net charge offs in the fourth quarter commercial losses were 16 basis points up 5 basis points from the third quarter driven by lower recoveries and higher losses in lease financing primarily related to railcars overall credit quality indicators in our commercial portfolio remains strong with our fourth quarter internal credit grades at their strongest levels in two years consumer losses were 51 basis points also up 5 basis points from the third quarter both of our consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the fourth quarter our other consumer portfolios had slight increases in losses from the third quarter primarily driven by seasonality both our credit card and auto portfolios had lower loss rates than a year ago non accrual loans declined 199 million from the third quarter with lower non accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios non accrual loans were 56 basis points of total loans in the fourth quarter their lowest level in over 10 years we adopted cecl on january 1 of this year and expect to recognize a 1 3 billion reduction in our allowance and a corresponding increase in retained earnings this reduction predominantly reflects an expected 2 9 billion reduction in the allowance for commercial credit losses under cecl reflecting shorter contractual maturities and the benign credit environment while the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be 1 5 billion higher under cecl reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities that is recoveries in collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans which had been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle as we ve noted in prior quarters we anticipate more volatility under cecl due to economically sensitive forecast and the impact of changes in the credit cycle turning to capital on page 25 our cet1 ratio decreased to 11 1 driven by returning 9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the fourth quarter our ratio was still well above both the regulatory minimum of 9 in our current internal target of 10 as a reminder we used approximately 65 of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second half of 2019 so repurchases will be lower during the first two quarters of 2020 in summary while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remained too high we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals including growth in loans and deposits increased customer activity and strong credit performance we also had high capital returns i m excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to do the work necessary to transform wells fargo and charlie and i will now take your questions questions and answers operator our first question will come from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john mcdonald autonomous research analyst hi good morning charles w scharf chief executive officer and president good morning john john mcdonald autonomous research analyst charlie i wanted to ask you maybe for some high level takeaways on wells fargo s technology where do you see it being up to par invest in class and what areas do you see the technology is behind and needing more investment charles w scharf chief executive officer and president thanks john it s a great question again i i m certainly not in a position to be definitive across the board given how we ve been spending my time i will say that in the time that i spent with saul van beurden who is our head of technology at the company we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution which will benefit our ability to grow at some point because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments as well as we possibly can and so it s a robust list there is a lot to do on it and saul clearly is working through with his team all the right prioritization and putting time frames around it at the same time it s clear when i spend time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that we ve done in the digital space on the consumer side and so again i m not i m not in a position to be extremely specific business by business of exactly where we re positioned and how we think about it other than it s really clear that it s a that it has been a top priority inside the company and certainly all of the business leaders understand the importance that technology will play going forward hope it s helpful john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and then wanted to ask john shrewsberry in terms of expenses totally getting charlie s point about being too early to talk about expense improvement but when we think about the jumping off point as we put our models for 2020 expenses john should we think about this 53 7 billion adjusted expenses that you did for 19 is that a good starting point to think about 2020 expenses the last you kind of said you d try to be flat in 2020 is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about for the adjusted number john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so early on here while we re still going through this planning process i wouldn t expect that much to change other than the some of the adjustments that we all make for deferred comp for excess operating losses etc and then we will as this process ensues we will come back with some more detail john mcdonald autonomous research analyst for now we re kind of thinking flattish to that number or that s the right ballpark to start off with charles w scharf chief executive officer and president i would just take it period by period not that much is going to change between q4 and q1 the same because of the shortness of the time frame and as we get more clarity as a result of our process we will provide more clarity john mcdonald autonomous research analyst okay and just one just quick follow up on that in terms of the 600 million of operating losses that you talked about it really hasn t been that in many years it s really average it seems like more like 2 billion a year i know it s hard to predict but i do worry about as anchoring too low on that 600 million should we kind of budget something higher than that just as a go forward charles w scharf chief executive officer and president that s a good point so that we originally talked about the 600 million it reflected the 150 million per quarter of fraud related losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for what s been elevated over the last couple of years i do think the 600 million has probably grown to be something a little bit more like it could be 700 million or 800 million probably we ll try and give better guidance to that but the higher run rate or the higher realized rate that we ve had over the last two years reflects more of a combination of episodic things that are anticipated to be to recur at the same level and let me give you just on your first question a little bit more clarity because i reminded that the first quarter is the first quarter i said this in my remarks but there are seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter that caused that stand out year after year as fico resets as retirement eligibility sets and a few other things that will cause that to stand out in any year john mcdonald autonomous research analyst got you okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin jefferies analyst hi thanks good morning thanks for taking the question charlie on your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward how do we how do you start to assess just if the right things are happening underneath and coming back to the point just on related expenses you ve obviously had this build over time of compliance and risk and those functions are we even at the point yet where the hiring is done in that regard but where you re actually just you ve got the people in place and it s more just about execution how do you give us a sense of just kind of where you think you are on that story arc thanks charles w scharf chief executive officer and president sure so on the first question listen i think when you re on the inside of the company and we re managing the work that has to get done the way that we are we have clear reporting we have clear goals item by item by item and so it s very very easy for us to understand whether we re tracking to milestones and having reviewed the entire plan believe that those milestones will get us to eventual closure on issues quite honestly from the outside you obviously don t have the ability to do that that s not something that we can provide to you so ultimately what you re going to have to look for are closure of these issues and you know as time goes on that is what we hope to accomplish and that ultimately will be success as well on your second question about where are we i guess in terms of the build of expenses necessary to accomplish the work again i would say on that one where it s we can t sit here today and say i can t sit here today and say that the amount that we re spending and the people that we have is totally appropriate and by the way don t take that to mean it s too high it s area by area we ve added a lot of resources we need to understand whether we ve added the right resources whether we have people working together as well as we possibly can understanding things that we ve built manually to understand where we can go to automate those items which will make us not only just far more efficient but far more effective and so again when i say it s really too early to be definitive about where we think about the level of expenses and what s appropriate i put this into the same bucket but again i just want to be really clear about this we don t sit here and believe that we have card launched to spend whatever we possibly want on any issue we are going to spend what s necessary on these historical issues and you should assume that we will be extremely vigilant about ensuring that we re not only thinking about our future but thinking about our shareholders in terms of where it all nets out ultimately ken usdin jefferies analyst understood charlie and just one follow up on your point that couple of months in you said you got to look at like 10 business lines and just see where you should think about things from a bottom up from what you at least see now is the company what it needs to look like going forward the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time do you think that all the businesses the company has today deserve to be inside the company from a go forward basis thanks charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah sure i would say as far as the big pieces of the company absolutely when we look at the benefits that our clients get from having the combination of consumer businesses wealth businesses and wholesale businesses under one roof are significant today and as we look to the future we believe they should be even more significant and so at that level i would say absolutely as john did mention in his remarks we have been pruning and as we go through these reviews and talk about some of the smaller things that we do it is a good opportunity to ask do we need to continue to do all of these things will they make a difference first to our clients and ultimately to us and so i would expect to have some things come out of that but i put them in the category of pruning at this point ken usdin jefferies analyst got it thanks charlie charles w scharf chief executive officer and president sure operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian bank of america analyst good morning i wanted to follow up on the line of questioning that ken just had charlie so it sounds like as we think about what you mentioned during your prepared remarks as you focus on remediation and investment it sounds like you re also there is also room to focus on inefficiencies at the same time in particular a lot of your investors have pointed out that your headcount hasn t moved much over the past 10 years and your headcount is similar to another peer that is producing about 40 billion more in revenue than you so i just wanted i know that sounded more like a statement but the question really is there s a room to also address some of the efficiencies as you think about remediation and investment charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah i think again what i want to make sure that i m at least being clear about is that i think that we have we want to be able to think with this clean sheet as possible about how we should be spending our money and so that goes to asking the question are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be absolutely we will focus on efficiency and i want to give just i haven t said this in my remarks but it is important it s not as if it s not something the company is focused on and so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities it s very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadn t been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over the last several years but having said that with fresh eyes i got to show up and take a look and ask a whole series of questions as do some of the other new folks that have come in and there are still big parts of the company where we are extraordinarily inefficient and to be fair it s not just my eyes and the new folks eyes but it s what the existing management team talked about as well so we do believe there s significant opportunities and while the first priority is fixing the issues of the past we should be able to continue to work toward both and i do want to throw on the last category which is important which is we are thinking about the future and while time and conscious are weighted more times the past are weighted more toward the past we re not ignoring the future and so if we do see there are opportunities which are meaningful we want to have the latitude to think about how we can spend wisely on that and so that s why we re just being very very careful about leading you to a specific number because we re not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right long term thing for the company again very conscious of the fact that we re stewards of the company and their owners out there and other stakeholders that we have to answer to erika najarian bank of america analyst understood and my second question as you mentioned that you will be announcing a new org structure shortly does that include the hires that you highlighted during your prepared remarks or could we anticipate more changes to the operating committee from here charles w scharf chief executive officer and president i think what i said is what i said which is avid s retiring she is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services to card to innovation digital marketing a very very wide range of things and we re actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement and when we ve completed that we will certainly make sure that you all know about what it looks like erika najarian bank of america analyst got it and just if i could squeeze in a third question i hear you loud and clear that the closure of the issues is one way your investors and other stakeholders could measure progress at the company as we think about the end of the year what other measures of progress would you suggest your current and prospective shareholders could use to measure progress or is one year simply too short of a time given the transformation that you believe the company will go through charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah i guess let me say a couple of words and john could add anything that he d like again i think it s important we have a lot going on and i ve been here for a short time and so we feel extremely optimistic about that medium and long term but we have a lot to figure out and as i pointed out some of it takes months and some of it will take a little bit longer than that so i think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature but just know that we re focused on outcomes here john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer great i think we ll be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year including closure of issues to the extent that those are those are public items and then how we set ourselves up in our stakeholders up for what comes next so as this process goes on and concludes and we have a better line of sight on what happens end of the year next year etc then we ll begin to share that that will be progress charles w scharf chief executive officer and president and i just i don t want to dwell on it i just want to be clear i m not suggesting here that any of these public issues will be closed this year what i m suggesting is that we re going to do all the work that s required the time frames will be driven by when we accomplish that work and when the regulators are satisfied or satisfied by it there is as i said there s a great deal of it some have a certain level of complexity to them and we re focused on the work at this point erika najarian bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst hi good morning still another question on the regulatory side i think one of the things regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as a sign that things are improving i mean is that still an outstanding item that needs to be addressed or have been addressed already charles w scharf chief executive officer and president well listen i think i addressed some of this in my remarks that we re prepared and i think again as the as an outsider coming in i do have the opportunity to just make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that i ve seen that could help make a company successful going through issues that are somewhat like this and so i do think that these changes that i spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has alluded us to at this point brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay and then the second question is on the numbers themselves i mean if you look at john maybe on the commercial loans you ve seen decent growth now or see some growth year over year and that portfolio looks like but pieces of it are coming from the non us also coming from this credit investment portfolio can you guys give us an update on the c i lending side of it what s this growth in the non us where is that coming from and then how do you see these loan clos is that and what s the total clo exposure at this time john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sure so on the second part first the total clo exposure is about 38 billion i think at this point which hasn t changed much this approach of investing in them in loan form is really just some more accounting friendly approach it s the same risk reward otherwise and so we ve made the shift for part of our incremental investment still an asset class that we feel comfortable with the risk reward and in spite of where we are in the cycle and for other reasons the bulk of the c i loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment banking related activity so some of it s in the asset backed finance area things like clo s and then also with major corporate customers but on probably not permanent funding things will funded activity strategic activity that ultimately would likely taken out in the capital markets subsequently so it s not so much coming from the funded term loan segment of commercial banking for example and i wouldn t agree too much of the growth in non us loans that s that will ebb and flow a little bit but it s not likely to be a big driver of loan growth one way or the other in the foreseeable future brian kleinhanzl kbw analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby with vining sparks marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks john i wanted to ask you first this 1 5 billion is a big number for this particular quarter you ve been addressing these issues you can t talk specifically but generic generally was there some event what was the catalyst for all of sudden recognizing another significant or meaningful slug of one time extraordinary costs john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i mean i can t talk too much about specific active litigation but in general these amounts get recorded when the items become both probable and estimable so we had elevated cost in this area for the last two quarters with as a result of greater estimability of what the outcomes might be marty mosby vining sparks analyst and then charlie when you re coming over now and your statement that you went through initially kind of affordably said we haven t addressed or wells fargo hasn t addressed these issues at the pace or in the way that they should have in order to make the progress kind of how do you look at assessing where some of these things went wrong i mean again just generally and maybe not specifically but you got a thought over these years there would have been a lot of attention and a lot of progress and it just doesn t seem like that s been the case so your assessment of it seems pretty critical so i was just trying to figure out how to put some context around that charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah i guess it s in the way i would and the way i would the way i think about it is that i ve when i have the opportunity to come in and look at where we are my judgments are based upon where we actually are i haven t i don t think there is a whole lot of value in terms of when i have to figure out how to spend my time in going back and figuring out if i was here what i might have done differently i m not sure i would have done anything necessarily differently i wasn t in the seat i don t know what the priorities were i don t know what else was going on that is a very very difficult thing to do and generally something that s very very unfair to do so again i think what s relevant is that i ve been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes some different people and a great deal of my time and attention as well as the rest of the senior management team and based upon the experience that i ve had and executing operational things as well as the other members of the team that we have in place now and understanding that the work that we have to do i do feel confident that we can get it done and that s been my focus marty mosby vining sparks analyst i guess maybe a different way to think about it is we ve seen these things happen in the past would you couch it as that maybe there is a new standard in which wells fargo is going to be held accountable to kind of develop toward in order to set the new standard for the industry so in other words when the regulators get in on a bank they then really begin to kind of figure out where they want everybody else to kind of hit too so it s not like you just catching up with everybody else maybe there is surpassing and creating a more forward kind of model that they are wanting to get to so i didn t know was there that part of it as well or is this just still catching up with everybody else charles w scharf chief executive officer and president listen i think i ve got a lot to do to speak on behalf of wells fargo and so it certainly wouldn t be right of me to speak for regulators but i do think that we have the opportunity to raise the standard by which we view the importance of the work the manner in which we go about doing it and the way we hold each other accountable for getting it done and so again that is my focus marty mosby vining sparks analyst thanks operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez ubs analyst hey good morning guys speaking of things you need to do to get closure on some of these issues i think in the past you ve talked about close to 10 000 processes i think john you mentioned high single digit thousands of processes where you re identifying individual risk controls and where needed remediating those risk and control functions can you just give us a sense of where you are in that process what kind of progress you ve made more recently and i guess importantly how is your relationship with your regulators evolving as you kind of go through this and work through a lot of these individual processes charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah on the first part so not all 9 000 plus processes are created equally their risk score and the importance of score for their impact and we re ahead of where we anticipated being by the end of the year i don t have the exact number in front of me but the of those that are most impactful they will have been as we ve described mapped risk id control id controls developed where controls didn t previously exist testing over those controls put in place in the first half by the end of the first half of this year that s how that works right now and i think it s to the satisfaction of people who are watching us do it saul martinez ubs analyst okay so ok that s helpful so it feels like you re making good progress on the major on the more significant processes so just changing gears a little bit you took i think 166 million charge for reassessing technology projects in wealth and investment management can you just give a sense of what drove that decision and whether we should be thinking that there could be other it projects with that you re looking at reassessing and cutting going forward charles w scharf chief executive officer and president sure so jon weiss has substantially reconstituted the leadership team in wim and they ve set their strategic priorities and direction and they are different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the past few years which is what resulted in the impairment to the capitalize software development costs i wouldn t anticipate seeing a lot more of that and to be honest we don t have an extraordinary amount of capitalized software development costs so that the risk isn t that great from an accounting perspective saul martinez ubs analyst okay got it i could just squeeze one more quick one in john just on fees the core fee lines time deposit trust card mortgages in general it seems like the momentum has improved a bit in recent quarters and but can you just give us a sense of and i m not asking for specific guidance but can you just talk directionally about whether there is any reason to think you can t grow from fourth quarter levels obviously recognizing there seasonality in a lot of these businesses but is this are these like good core run rates to use and do you feel good about your ability to grow some of these line items john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer the trust and investment fees should step off at a high level because they price off of the opening deck which for the s p it looks good for the coming quarter that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us mortgage as we said is probably going to be a lighter quarter in the first quarter just because of seasonality it was stronger in the fourth quarter than it would have seasonally been expect it to be but the pipeline suggest that it will be somewhat smaller on the origination side in the first quarter card fees tick up because there s more consumer spending going on in the fourth quarter so i d expect that to be more seasonally appropriate in the first quarter and then it s hard to forecast trading activity it certainly was stronger year over year in the fourth quarter because of the blood bath in the fourth quarter of 2018 but it was weaker third quarter to fourth quarter in 2019 and historically the first quarter is a stronger quarter as a result of asset managers reallocating and people getting invested in the first quarter so we ll see what happens there and that is tougher to predict but those are the types of things that are likely to implement things that are a little bit more ratable like deposit service charges or loan fees etc i don t think it would be much change from quarter to quarter saul martinez ubs analyst got it okay that s helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy rbc analyst thank you and good morning john can you share with us i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid single digits for 2020 over 2019 can you compare for us what s the driver of that vis a vis what drove the decline in 2019 is it more having less higher yielding assets like to pick a pay loans on the books in 2020 or is it a margin compression issue can you give us some color there charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah so it s a handful of things there was a bigger drop in 2019 because of i would say that the original uptick in the premium amortization on the mbs portfolio that in i m not giving this to you in order of priority but just in terms of inputs the big leg down in libor obviously had a big impact in 2019 that s expected to be a little flatter at this point as we re looking into 2020 we talked about retail deposits pardon me retail deposit pricing and how as rates were increasing we had put in place some promotions that have a little bit of a tail to them that tail was fully in place during 2019 and will abate during 2020 all of those things and it s but it s rates right it s they dropped in 2019 at least at the front end expect it to be relatively flattish in 2020 gerard cassidy rbc analyst i see and i think charles w scharf chief executive officer and president just one quick the number of variables and the range of potential outcomes around those variables that goes into giving the low to mid single digits is a lot can move as we ve talked about we were i think we were quite close on our estimation for 2019 but we ll keep you updated as we roll along in 2020 what is looking like based on what changes you mentioned pick a pay i guess i should also point out that that was on a full year basis it s probably 400 million worth of interest income coming off of the sold pick a pay loans that s worthy of mentioned that we don t have this year gerard cassidy rbc analyst great could you also share with us you pointed out that you grew the primary consumer checking account deposits 2 year over year what s what are you using as the hook to get customers to come in is there some incentives whether it s a higher upfront cash deposit or that you give them or is there gifts or how are you guys driving that growth john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so that metric is the number of accounts not the deposits associated with the accounts which we ve talked about separately gerard cassidy rbc analyst yes john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer it s the branch network it s the digital acquisition the combination of those two things i wouldn t say that it s specifically there s nothing that s compelling people the offers that we use are more around dollars for additional capturing additional deposits from customers but these account openings reflect the sort of everyday business model of community banking both in the branches and through digital activity gerard cassidy rbc analyst okay and then just real quickly you mentioned lower gains in the quarter from your venture capital private equity area what s left in unrealized gains in those two categories for you folks john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so unrealized gains are harder to come by these days because we tend to realize them on a faster basis since the accounting change i guess now a year and a half ago but it used to be the case that we d have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises if i set a higher level of valuation we recognize the gain from that as it goes along and so when the ultimate realization occurs that there is less of a pop because we ve ratcheted up we ve taken gains along the way so that s led to more of a call it front end loading over the last several quarters of benefit from that portfolio and it will increase the volatility if people have down capital raise rounds or things don t go as well when companies are actually sold or taken public so it s been a great business the returns are solid but the accounting change has caused being revenue recognition to be a little bit more choppy although in the early quarters it s actually been very strong gerard cassidy rbc analyst thank you i appreciate the insights operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott siefers piper sandler analyst good morning guys thanks for taking the question i was hoping to try to drill down into the cost side once again i guess if you re looking at an uptick in core expenses in the first quarter it implies a pretty substantial downdraft through the remainder of the year just to keep us in the ballpark of this year s adjusted 53 7 billion i mean did the plan indeed call for such an absolute improvement in costs and what sort of the path to get there especially at a time when there is so much discussion on investments just curious to your thoughts there john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer all right so we re not going to be that specific about the year as a whole my comment earlier about the first quarter is like every first quarter it tends to be the high tech for expenses because of the way of personnel costs have a first quarter uptick and so like any other year on an adjusted basis you d expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year but we re as charlie mentioned we re going through a second look at our planning process for the year and so there is no fixed number at this point to point to since we are in the first quarter it s since this happens every first quarter i m calling out the fact that those personnel costs will be higher but we there won t be much more specificity around that until we ve completed this process and made some conclusions made some choices and come back and update people later in the year scott siefers piper sandler analyst okay all right so then rather than so even though the i guess the 53 7 billion is a sort of place to start it s not we shouldn t anticipate any sort of a flat trend or anything it s basically tbd completely on what the expectations for the full year is that correct john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer i think that s appropriate so that we don t mislead you yes scott siefers piper sandler analyst yeah okay all right perfect thank you very much you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst betsy hi good morning just wanted to understand on the planning process that charlie announced at the beginning i know charlie you re not talking about time frames but you ve seen a lot of different types of institutions and a lot of different types of scenarios and i m wondering is this something that we should consider is i get to best in class on a three to five year time frame or is this more of a one to three just trying to understand broad strokes your thought process there charles w scharf chief executive officer and president listen i wish i could answer the question at this point but for all the reasons that i ve spoken about i just i m not in a position to do that i think we i don t want to be repetitive so i apologize but we ve got to do the work to understand whether we re appropriately resourced against the historical activities and then honestly as we go through these discussions in terms of how you get to best in class i m sure business by business will be very very different in terms of what the time frame is some of them will be structural some of them will require some significant technology investment others could be burdened by just inefficiencies that we can get to quicker so i m not trying to be evasive i just i can see there being several different answers when we look at different parts of the company it s what it will actually look like when we re done with the work betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst and does the work potentially have a result of exiting some of the businesses or do you think that that s really not on the table at this stage charles w scharf chief executive officer and president well i think i ll repeat what i said before betsy i think that from when you look at our big business segments there is tremendous sense because of the benefits our customers and clients get from them being under one roof but like any other company we should sit and ask the question do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way and there s probably still some more pruning that we should probably do betsy graseck morgan stanley analyst okay all right now thank you very much charles w scharf chief executive officer and president sure thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak wolfe research analyst hi good morning charles w scharf chief executive officer and president good morning steven chubak wolfe research analyst so john i was hoping to drill into some of the fee trends that you had spoken to in response to an earlier question certainly appreciate the detail you guys gave in slide 27 helping us isolate some of the impacts from gains and other related sale impacts as we think about trying to evaluate the core fee income generation power just of the franchise today after adjusting for some of these sales if i look at that 8 7 billion you guys produced this quarter i adjust for about 600 million that you guys cited in the slide and then on top of that adjust for deferred comp other investment income adjustments we get to a run rate of roughly 8 billion a quarter in core fee income generation i know you re going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in 2020 but i m just hoping if you could frame whether that 32 billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer well so it s not unreasonable in the sense that it captures the seasonal volatility of some of these things that tend to ebb and flow throughout the course of the year and we ve if we ve adjusted out things that we ve sold in both from a gain perspective as well as the run rate perspective and it captures that where we do have elements as you ll note that ebb and flow relatively meaningfully from not just from quarter to quarter but from year to year and so we have had equity market tailwinds as you mentioned that we might continue to but that will come and go i think sort of tend to look at a slightly longer time horizon on some of those line items and think about what the average has been over five quarters or so since we reported in five quarters it s easy enough to there s nothing unreasonable about that approach there are some of these that we believe that even while we re doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we re in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that steven chubak wolfe research analyst gotcha no thanks for that color john and just one more follow up for me i just wanted to clarify some of your capital guidance so i know that the last update that i can recall and i m sorry if this is wrong or misguided you alluded to attending 10 25 to 10 5 cet1 target that you guys were managing to that always felt quite conservative and in the earnings release you actually referred to an internal target of 10 i m just wondering as we think about future buybacks in capital return plans has there been any change in the firm s internal capital targets that you guys are ultimately managing to or how are you guys trying to think about that as you start to implement some of these changes that charlie was speaking to earlier john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s a good question we re what we ve been waiting for specifically our internal guideline is 10 and that includes the buffer on top of the 9 regulatory requirement we ve been talking about something that could be 10 25 to 10 5 waiting for what to know what cecl looks like in stress and what the stress capital buffer guidelines actually look like once they are implemented and it s a belief certainly because we are getting more ccar clarity over the coming weeks that will start to know whether we re going to know the hit through to that this year and then it s likely that the combination of those two things leads us to a slightly higher level could be conservative but we ll know for sure once we are operating in the stress capital buffer world steven chubak wolfe research analyst great helpful color john thanks for taking my questions john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you bet operator your next question comes from the line of matt o connor with deutsche bank matt o connor deutsche bank analyst good morning i m sure you re a little tired of all the expense question kind of near term i do want to ask though longer term on costs charlie you said about being best in class efficiency and i guess just how do you define that and i think a lot of investors and analysts think of your direct peers is being like bank of america jpmorgan maybe u s bank as well but are you kind of being literal like your efficiency ratio it should be in the ballpark or better than theirs and if it is it s just a it s a bold comment given where you are coming from and obviously reflects i assume optimism on both cost and revenue but maybe you could just elaborate on some of those themes thank you john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer sure we re going we re going business by business and selecting the peer group that best represents the either the products or the segments that had established what best in class looks like so it could be the component pieces of our larger peers it could be the component pieces of regional banks and it could be the component on what the business is and then for the company as a whole the weighted average the mix adjusted average of what those inputs are results in the outcome that s part of this review process that charlie had alluded to earlier and it s definitely aspirational as we sit here today but that is the direction that we are setting for ourselves as charlie mentioned for every business that we re likely to be in over the long term we ve got all of the benefits of scale working for us it s very mature in most of them and we should there may be specific reasons and we will address them if we find them why we can t compete effectively with the most efficient but that s what we re setting our sights for matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency there are comments as it could be both kind of revenue and expenses should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer too early to know we know there s work to do on expenses but it s too early to start attributing percentage driver for example matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay and i guess lastly charles w scharf chief executive officer and president matt it s charlie let me just add one thing because i do think it s important this isn t something that i would say that john and i sit here in a room and believe and then we get in a room with others and they argue with us there is a clear understanding from our business leaders that this opportunity exists and i would say quite frankly there is very little conversation internally about the need to use revenue to improve the efficiency rate because we do understand that there are series of things that we do that are highly inefficient that s not to say to get the best in class that we won t need some revenue growth to get there but i just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what they re talking about as the types of things that ll be in the line of sight matt o connor deutsche bank analyst okay all right thank you for that charles w scharf chief executive officer and president sure operator your final question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore john pancari evercore analyst good morning john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning john charles w scharf chief executive officer and president good morning john pancari evercore analyst on the spread income guidance of down low to mid single digits i know you reiterated that but you also indicated that you are still pruning does that guidance factor in the pruning and accordingly any additional adjustments to your business base would not be all that meaningful to impact that guidance or would that guidance change if you did continue to prune john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer if we continue to prune in ways that caused us to shed either loans or deposits then we would adjust the guidance it contemplates the company as it exists today john pancari evercore analyst okay all right just wanted to verify and then in terms of cecl day two impact i just want to get your thoughts on the appetite to lend in certain longer duration consumer areas has that been impacted at all by the implications of the new methodology john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president and chief financial officer that s a good question we ve done the work product by product to consider what the return characteristics are and at this point it s not likely that we change our appetite for longer duration consumer loans it definitely it s depending on where you are in the cycle it can cause you to think differently about what your returns are but it hasn t closed anything to drop below a hurdle level that says to us we need to either meaningfully reprice it or where we think whether we re there in the business john pancari evercore analyst okay and then lastly just back to the expense expectations again i know it s too early to give a more accurate expense expectation but i know you re going through your planning process so what s the timing when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to full year expenses charlie charles w scharf chief executive officer and president yeah i guess there is nothing more that i can say that i haven t already said i think what i ve said is that we ve got this process to go through there is a lot to do and when we know something we ll tell you i wish i could be more specific i really do but we have a lot to do to get to but we think the right answer should be john pancari evercore analyst got it okay thanks charles w scharf chief executive officer and president all right listen thank you very much for your patience and joining us this morning i do hope that you just walk away with just a couple of important thoughts we have work to do it s clear what we have to do we re committed to getting it done and we will get it done the quality of the franchise is still extraordinary we have thousands and thousands of dedicated people across the company that can come in every day to serve their clients they are doing an extraordinary job and we re going to do our part to help them do their job even better as time goes on and we think our future is very bright and so we appreciate again the patients that you have and look forward to have more conversations in the future operator duration 82

however removing china from the currency manipulator list a thorny issue for the mainland eliminates one of the significant obstacles in the way to the next phase of the comprehensive agreement on the more one sided tails for asian fx particularly in the more trade growth tech oriented north china is expected to toe the line on any weakness in the rmb as we move forward to negotiating phase two meanwhile a more on the nose surprise like an explicit roadmap for a further rollback in tariffs could open the way for more definite appreciation where the cnh and the krw will shine the market is more convinced about the direction of travel than it is about the shape and form of the next step of the deal so market momentum will be critical to sustaining the rally as will trade calming headlines of course none of this would have been made possible without the fed s dovish impulse and given the lack of policy uncertainly as we move through 2020 the low for longer narrative will

of the signing of a phase 1 trade deal today story continues investors are incredibly concerned about the well documented non opec supplies coming to market in 2020 and those worries came to the fore as oil prices headed lower after a bearish to consensus inventory build was reported early this morning gold markets safe haven assets are again under pressure with treasuries weaker across the curve gold weakens as risks recede but continue to find buyers on dips and the thought of resurfacing of threats continues to support prices but for the next little while it s hard to see gold markets trade anything but sideways gold markets eased on the cusp of the phase one trade agreement between the us and china as equities are holding firm and the usd remains stable in g 10 no impulse for gold from

bloomberg core cpi rose 0 1 m o m which was also just below consensus expectations of 0 2 currency markets the euro with all the demand for yuan why isn t the eur higher this is the most asked question from my clients that are for the most part left scratching their heads as to why the usd is not weaker in g 10 us government s public consultation on eu tariffs has closed and the trump administration s action is imminent which could end up one of the more significant tail risks for the euro in months ahead bloomberg reported it best that the u s eu square up for trade brawl after

usdjpy touched 110 22 yesterday on fixing demand before giving way to export seller as 110 continued to be a fundamental psychological level for both exporters and speculator market participants i was twitting to my tokyo based fx trading followers yesterday as everyone was trading usdjpy which is excellent to see when i was trading forex usdjpy for sumitomo bank there is a well known but still amazingly persistent tendency for usdjpy to go down in tokyo possibly due to exporter and reversion selling and up in new york on speculative demand with japanese investors very much involved again in usdjpy since the turn of 2020 and primary using reversion strategies so it will be worth keeping an eye on this tendency the usdjpy massive volumes going through the big japanese domestic retail

bullish expectations anticipated based on the current level or anticipated level of tariff rollback suggesting markets could base and probably consolidated in the near term but equity inflows have caught more than a few traders by surprise however yesterday inflows into the onshore stock market slowed and if this continues it may take some pressure off of funding and usdcnh could gravitate 6 9 level with funding a bit tight due equity inflows and possible cnh overshoot as a result traders will be on the lookout for potential pboc injections ahead of the chinese new year holidays because of the overshoot profit taking was always on the cards and provided an excellent level for long usdcnh defensive positioning as the market pivots to phase 2 with stops just below 6 85 the ringgit the

washington the us treasury department on monday dropped its designation of china as a currency manipulator days before top officials of the world s two largest economies were due to sign a preliminary trade agreement to ease an 18 month old tariff war the widely expected decision came in a long delayed semi annual currency report reversing an unexpected move by treasury secretary steven mnuchin last august at the height of us china trade tensions mr mnuchin had accused china of deliberately holding down the value of its yuan currency to create an unfair trade advantage just hours after president donald trump angered at the lack of progress in trade negotiations had also accused china of manipulating its currency the treasury department had not labeled china a currency manipulator since 1994 beijing had recently met just one of the department s three criteria needed for such a designation a large bilateral trade surplus with the us in its latest currency report the treasury said that as part of the phase 1 trade deal china had made enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation and agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and external balances chinese vice premier liu he arrived in washington on monday for a white house ceremony to sign the trade deal with mr trump people familiar with the negotiations said that although the manipulator designation had no real consequences for beijing its removal was an important symbol of goodwill for chinese officials us trade representative robert lighthizer on monday told fox business that the translation of the us china trade agreement was almost completed and the text of the deal would be made public on wednesday before the ceremony the currency report said the chinese yuan also known as the renminbi had depreciated as far as 7 18 per us dollar in early september but had rebounded in october and was currently trading at about 6 93 per dollar in this context treasury has determined that china should no longer be designated as a currency manipulator at this time the report said it said however china should take decisive steps to avoid a persistently weak currency and allow greater market openness to strengthen its long term growth prospects there was no immediate reaction from beijing in august china s central bank denied it had intervened to weaken the yuan and said washington s designation of china as a currency manipulator seriously harmed international rules mark sobel a former senior treasury official and adviser to the london based official monetary and financial institutions forum or omfif economy policy think tank said china was errantly designated at a moment of presidential pique it should never have happened in the first place he said china manages but does not manipulate its currency mr sobel said china s current account surplus was small as a share of gross domestic product and it had not intervened in currency markets for years the august move came at a time when the yuan had fallen against the dollar because of market apprehension over mr trump s ratcheting up of trade tariffs he said switzerland added to monitoring list the treasury report also cited continued concerns about the currency practices of eight other countries germany ireland italy japan malaysia singapore south korea and vietnam and added a ninth switzerland to its list it raised particular concerns about germany the world s fourth largest economy which it said continued to have the world s largest current account surplus and was slipping into recession it said the german government had a responsibility to undertake tax cuts and boost domestic investment the treasury report said the continued strength of the us dollar was concerning given the international monetary fund s judgment that the dollar was overvalued on a real effective basis it said the real dollar remains about 8 above its 20 year average noting that sustained dollar strength would likely exacerbate persistent trade and current account imbalances for the united states us senate democratic leader chuck schumer a fierce critic of china s currency and trade practices blasted the trump administration for its decision to back down from labeling china a currency manipulator china is a currency manipulator that is a fact mr schumer said in a statement unfortunately president trump would rather cave to president xi jinping than stay tough on china the yuan reached five month highs earlier on monday ahead of the expected signing of the trade deal reuters

u s president donald trump signed a trade agreement wednesday with china that is expected to boost exports from u s farmers and manufacturers and is aimed at lowering tensions in a long running dispute between the economic powers trump said during a white house ceremony that the deal is righting the wrongs of the past he promoted the signing as a way of delivering economic justice for american workers and said we mark a sea change in international trade with the signing chinese leader xi jinping in a letter to trump that was read by beijing s chief negotiator liu he said concluding the first phase of the trade deal was good for china the u s and for the whole world but the so called phase 1 pact does little to force china to make the major economic reforms such as reducing unfair subsidies for its own companies that the trump administration sought when it started the trade war by imposing tariffs on chinese imports in july 2018 the u s has yet to reveal details of the agreement though u s trade representative robert lighthizer has said they would be made public wednesday most analysts say any meaningful resolution of the key u s allegation that beijing uses predatory tactics in its drive to supplant america s technological supremacy could require years of contentious talks and sceptics say a satisfactory resolution may be next to impossible given china s ambitions to become the global leader in such advanced technologies as driverless cars and artificial intelligence welcome de escalation of hostilities the signing of the phase 1 deal would represent a welcome even if modest de escalation of trade hostilities between china and the u s said eswar prasad a cornell university economist and and former head of the international monetary fund s china division but it hardly addresses in any substantive way the fundamental sources of trade and economic tensions between the two sides which will continue to fester in a letter to trump on monday the top senate democrat chuck schumer of new york complained that the phase 1 deal appeared to make very little progress in reforming china s rapacious trade behaviours and seems like it could send a signal to chinese negotiators that the u s can be steamrolled the thornier issues are expected to be taken up in future rounds of negotiations but it s unclear when they will begin and few expect much progress before the november u s election phase 2 i wouldn t wait by the phone said john veroneau who was a u s trade official in the george w bush administration and is now co chair of the international trade practice at covington burling that is probably a 2021 issue under the phase 1 agreement which the two sides reached in mid december the administration dropped plans to impose tariffs on an additional 160 billion us in chinese imports and it halved to 7 5 per cent existing tariffs on 110 billion of good from china beijing to increase purchases of u s products for its part beijing agreed to significantly increase its purchases of u s products according to the trump administration china is to buy 40 billion a year in u s farm products an ambitious goal for a country that has never imported more than 26 billion a year in u s agricultural products china s finance ministry has released the chinese language version of the phase 1 trade deal according to the text china agreed to buy at least 200 billion in additional u s goods and services over two years the deal may be most notable for what it doesn t do it leaves in place tariffs on about 360 billion in chinese imports a level of protectionism that would have been unthinkable before trump took office chad bown of the peterson institute for international economics calculates that the phase 1 agreement will leave nearly two thirds of chinese imports covered by trump s tariffs beijing s retaliatory tariffs affect more than half of american exports to china the average u s tariff on chinese imports has risen from three per cent in january 2018 to 21 per cent now high tariffs between the world s two biggest economies bown says are now the new normal the trump administration argues that the phase 1 deal is a solid start that includes chinese commitments to do more to protect intellectual property curb the practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology and refrain from manipulating their currency lower to benefit chinese exporters in advance of the phase 1 signing in fact the treasury department on monday dropped its designation of china as a currency manipulator it s a really really good deal for the united states and it will work if reformers in china want it to work robert lighthizer us trade representative and by maintaining significant tariffs on chinese imports the administration retains leverage to force beijing to abide by its commitments something the united states says beijing has failed to do for decades we ve never punished them before said derek scissors china specialist at the american enterprise institute if you don t have tariffs you can write down anything you want and the chinese will cheat the administration contends that however narrow the phase 1 agreement may be it represents a significant breakthrough across the board it s a really really good deal for the united states lighthizer told fox business network on monday and it will work if reformers in china want it to work and if that happens great if it doesn t happen the pact is fully enforceable we expect them to live up to the letter of the law we ll bring cases we ll bring actions against them if they don t scissors said the trade war has already delivered a benefit for trump even if it hasn t forced beijing to make major changes to its economic policy trump s tariffs have reduced chinese exports to the united states and narrowed america s trade deficit with china trade deficit with china good or bad the president has long lambasted the u s trade gap with beijing as a sign of economic weakness though many economists disagree a wide trade deficit can actually reflect economic strength because it means that a nation s consumers feel prosperous and confident enough to spend freely on imported goods as well as on home grown goods so far this year the u s deficit with china in the trade of goods has declined by 16 per cent or 62 billion to 321 billion compared with a year earlier and the deficit will narrow further if beijing lives up to its pledges to buy dramatically more american imports currency traders watch computer monitors near the

the likely outcome of the deal lee jin man the associated press trump s tariff hikes have proved to be a headwind for china s economy which was already slowing though the damage has been less than some forecasters expected chinese global exports eked out a 0 5 per cent increase in 2019 despite a plunge in sales to the united states according to chinese customs data chinese exporters responded to trump s tariff hikes by shipping goods to the united states through other countries and by stepping up sales to asia europe and africa the government reported double digit gains in 2019 exports to france canada australia brazil and southeast asia tariff war slowed chinese economic growth economists said the tariff war slowed chinese growth which hit a multi decade low of six per cent in the quarter ending in september by as little as 0 6 percentage point weak domestic demand and the cooling of a construction boom inflicted more damage it is unrealistic for the u s government to think they could defeat china by exerting extreme pressure said tu xinquan director of the china institute of wto studies at the university of international business and economics in beijing as an economy with a massive size china will gradually absorb such external shocks china didn t get everything they wanted out of this deal and the u s has obviously not got the structural changes in the chinese economy they wanted said julian evans pritchard of capital economics but they are going to get a substantial increase in exports and a reduction in the bilateral trade deficit which i think the trump administration will clearly see as a win
one of most enduring economically and socially damaging downright frustrating facts about life in the united states is how expensive health care is here not only does u s health care cost far more than in other advanced economies but compared with the nations that spend less we have worse or equivalent health outcomes in fact u s life expectancy now lags behind that of all the advanced economies an mri scan that cost 1 400 here went for 450 in britain and 190 in holland thirty tablets of a drug to reduce the risk of blood clots xarelto cost 380 here 70 in britain 80 in switzerland and 60 in holland hospital admission for angioplasty is 32 000 here 15 000 in australia 12 000 in britain 7 000 in switzerland 6 000 in the netherlands add to those differences the latest outrage in health care costs surprise medical billing when even well insured patients can wake up from surgery finding that they owe thousands of dollars because someone treating them while they were unconscious was out of their insurance network princeton economists anne case and angus deaton a nobel winner recently summarized the problem by labeling it an 8 000 a year annual health care tax paid by u s families this is the difference in costs between what we pay for health care and what people in other countries pay as case put it we can brag we have the most expensive health care we can also now brag that it delivers the worst health of any rich country why call this expense a tax well for one if you want health coverage you can t escape it but even if you don t and good luck with that you still can t escape the tax as both employer and government provided health care extract payments through lower paychecks and public financing advertisement case and deaton may be erring on the low side in their 8 000 per family figure the organization for economic cooperation and development puts per person spending in the united states at 8 950 a year that compares with 5 060 in germany 3 470 in canada and just 3 140 in britain if we assume a family of three we would get an annual health care tax of 11 670 compared with germany and more than 17 000 compared with the cost of health care in britain how can such differences persist especially in a service where consumption is so essential to well being if ice cream were that much more expensive here we d have a lot to squawk about for sure but it wouldn t be a matter of life and death an obvious and correct answer as to why u s health care is so expensive is because we do so little relative to other systems to control costs but it s worse than that we do a fair amount to make health care more expensive first our system of private insurance costs far more than single payer systems like canada s and also more than countries with private but heavily regulated insurers like germany oecd data show that as a share of health spending our administrative costs are three times that of canada s and twice that of germany s getting our administrative costs closer to those in other countries would require regulating private insurers and expanding public coverage but it could save us at least 10 percent of our total health care bill next we pay twice as much to our health care providers and for prescription drugs as everyone else the latter costs us more than 3 000 per family per year we pay more than twice as much for medical equipment costing us a bit less than 1 500 per family per year doctors and dentists cost us close to an extra 750 per family per year one reason for the outsize costs of these inputs to u s health care is that government policy protects our providers when it comes to manufactured goods like cars and clothes and almost everything on the shelves of walmart economists and policymakers push for free trade and more competition but when it comes to health care providers these same authorities turn protectionist in areas like prescription drugs and medical equipment this protection is explicit manufacturers are granted patent monopolies the government will arrest anyone who sells protected items in competition with a patent holder in the case of doctors we have maintained or increased barriers that make it difficult for qualified foreign physicians to practice in the united states we also prevent other health care professionals such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners from doing many tasks for which they are entirely competent there is a similar story with dentists and dental hygienists advertisement other countries directly control drug prices in france the government determines whether a new drug is an improvement or a copycat and if the drug is deemed useful the government negotiates drug prices with the manufacturers and caps their revenue when sales exceed the cap the manufacturer must rebate most of the difference back to the government here in the united states we give drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers patent monopolies and allow them to charge whatever they want we don t even let the government use its massive leverage to negotiate lower drug prices for medicare beneficiaries that s what makes these goods expensive they re almost always relatively cheap to produce this is fixable it would take regulating costs reducing reimbursements to providers and increasing competition the pharmaceutical industry s rationale for cost exploding medical patents is that it helps incentivize research and innovation without them it s likely that pharmaceuticals and medical equipment companies would do less speculative research but it would take a fraction of the savings from reducing such protectionism to replace patent support research with publicly supported research for which we already spend 40 billion a year in terms of boosting competition allowing foreign doctors whose training meets our standards to more easily practice medicine here would bring u s physicians pay in line with international standards of course our doctors pay much more for their education than doctors trained elsewhere so part of this new structure would also require reducing the domestic cost of medical education and alleviating some of the educational debt burden that u s trained doctors have acquired increasing competition would also require using antitrust measures to push back on the pricing power engendered by the consolidation of both hospital groups and medical practices an analysis by the new york times of 25 metro areas found that hospital mergers have essentially banished competition and raised prices for hospital admissions even if we succeed in raising competition and reducing protectionism health care will still be too expensive for many low and moderate income families many of whom have suffered stagnant incomes in recent decades like every other wealthy country we will need to get on a path to universal coverage but whatever form that takes if we can significantly reduce our current health care tax the savings will easily be large enough to extend quality affordable coverage to every american jared bernstein chief economist to former vice president joe biden is a senior fellow at the center on

president donald trump talks with chinese vice premier liu he in the east room of the white house wednesday jan 15 2020 in washington before the trade agreement signing ap photo evan vucci evan vucci ap the phase one trade deal between the u s and china ends some uncertainties for the global economy but tensions between the u s and its trading partners could continue even with the reprieve analysts also expect trade skirmishes to crop up elsewhere and they expect the trump administration could have europe in its sights for its next round of tariffs stocks were higher wednesday as president donald trump signed the trade deal with chinese officials shortly after noon east coast time the market has been boosted by the prospects for trade peace and the end of escalation in the dispute between the two countries which until october appeared to be moving forward on new tariffs and counter tariffs watch now the s p 500 has risen 12 since trump said on oct 11 that the u s and china came to a substantial deal semiconductor stocks caught in middle of the trade war are also sharply higher since then with the vaneck vectors semiconductors etf up more than 18 caterpillar a poster child for u s chinese trade and the global economy is up 19 in that period there will be continued tension over china over cyber over national security over human rights those issues aren t going to go away but those issues don t really matter to the earnings of the s p 500 companies the way an escalation of tariffs would said daniel clifton head of policy research at strategas clifton said however the response to the deal could continue to be favorable you ve seen financial conditions loosen and that s been the biggest benefit of this deal for example the yield curve uninverted on the day they announced the deal the chinese currency has been tightening relative to the dollar since they announced the deal said clifton the truce is working and that s the most important detail of this all and we continue to benefit from this the phase one trade deal goes a long way in terms of tamping down immediate market concerns about trade and trump said china has committed to 200 billion in purchases of american goods and services vice president mike pence said there would be agricultural purchases worth 40 billion to 50 billion china is also expected to crack down on fentanyl shipments to the u s and the two countries will cooperate on north korea trump also said the deal includes strong protection of intellectual property tech still under a cloud but the u s technology industry remains under a cloud with no clear resolution over the status of suppliers to huawei and the company itself blacklisted by the u s for alleged cyber espionage the vaneck vectors semiconductor etf closed down 1 5 on wednesday they want to have the huawei situation distanced on a national security path separate from anything else i think they re trying to figure it all out how to deal with china and the tech stuff and national security said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group there remains no clear path to enforce aspects of the deal that have to do with china s theft of intellectual property or the transfer of technology mentioned in phase one it is expected to be a much bigger part of a phase two deal that deal is not expected to be addressed until after the november election even though trump said the administration would work on a phase two deal as soon as the current deal kicks in watch now we think the tensions will remain in 2020 said cesar rojas citigroup economist he said the u s used tariffs as leverage in the negotiations for phase one but now might use things like heavier regulatory reviews for investments into china the negotiating tools are going to be investment or potentially other restitution he said clifton said the u s is making progress on other trade fronts including with the new agreement that congress is expected to approve shortly with mexico and canada to replace nafta with china out of the way the new risk is that trump puts tariffs on europe both because of a wto ruling that found airbus received subsidies and a french digital tax on u s companies the administration has been looking at putting tariffs on french wine and other goods clifton said a ruling is expected from the world trade organization that boeing received subsidies and that could open the door for some accord between the u s and europe the one risk is you re going to see a flare up on europe said clifton that may spook investors and may give investors a reason to take profits after a big run up in stocks it probably would be a buying opportunity if there was a sell off on europe in q1 the washington post reported wednesday that trump threatened to put 25 tariffs on european autos if european countries did not call out violations by iran of its nuclear treaty as for the china deal the u s also said it was removing the label of currency manipulator slapped on china in august after claims from the u s administration that china was intentionally weakening its currency the deal should help business confidence with much less risk now of more tariffs with china the u s agreed not to put another round of tariffs on china and to cut back on some that were already in place that could help the retail sector and manufacturers but analysts say there is still no finality first of all probably the china commitment might be too ambitious to achieve it s still a deal that s fragile said aichi amemiya senior economist at nomura for instance china is reported to be committed to purchase 200 billion in u s goods and services over the next two years however in order to achieve that goal china might have to reduce imports form other trading partners very significantly or make other changes domestically priced in

myanmar formerly known as burma moved from a 50 year long military regime to budding civilian rule in 2011 the political transformation has initiated social and market reforms and has piqued foreign investors interest in one of the last asian frontier markets to open having moved from being one of the richest countries in asia before world war ii to one of the most isolated states under military rule and then one of the poorest in 2013 ranked 157th by the international monetary fund myanmar seems to re emerge as one of the most attractive and lucrative countries for foreign investors in recent years notably in 2013 foreign direct investment fdi represented 3 5 billion and was 350 percent above its 2011 levels the first three months of 2013 saw more investments than the first half of 2012 and the rates of investment continue to rise from china s and india s regional investments to us and european grants for preferential tariff concessions and renewal of interest in myanmar s economy there are important reasons to consider myanmar as the next top spot for foreign investors why is myanmar attractive for foreign investors located at the crossroads between china and india two economic powerhouses along with bangladesh and thailand myanmar borders over 40 percent of the world s population with a land mass the size of britain and france combined 2nd largest in southeast asia and the 40th largest country in the world a population of more than 60 million 24th most populous country and ports lying just above the malacca strait in the indian ocean one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world myanmar offers an unfettered strategic opportunities for easy access to export and consumption markets myanmar is also attractive for its cheap and young workforce according to statistics from the world economic forum the country s working age population has increased over the last ten years and is projected to grow further with a median age of 27 literacy rates of 92 7 percent and one of the lowest wages for manufacturing workers in the region the country s population becomes particularly attractive for manufacturing companies which aim to counter increasing costs in the rest of southeast asia it is also a goldmine for extractive industries abundant material reserves oil gas precious metals and stones are fuelling the interest of foreign investors the country s 20 trillion cubic feet tcf of known natural gas and over 50 million barrels of proven oil reserves more than thailand and brunei darussalam place it 41st and 78th in the world respectively more importantly explorers have only drilled a total of 19 offshore exploration wells since 1970s meaning that the country remains almost completely unexplored it is expected that in addition to the current 20 tcf reserves there could be another 80 tcf of undiscovered resources worth 424 billion besides natural endowments and human capital myanmar is also becoming attractive due to its recent economic growth liberalisation policies and increasing consumerist demands myanmar currently boasts the fastest growth pace among asean nations its 2013 gdp growth was an impressive 6 8 percent since the opening up of its economy in 2011 it grew at rates of 5 3 percent and 5 5 percent in 2011 and 2012 respectively with world bank and asian development bank estimates of 7 9 percent yearly growth until 2030 and a forecast by mckinsey stating that myanmar s economy will quadruple by 2030 the projections add up to an annual growth rate that is greater than china s the country s fast urbanisation also continues to fuel demands for more sophisticated products and the presence of foreign companies it is estimated that by 2017 the proportion of upper mass and mass affluent household segments in the cities will reach 80 percent of the total number of households hence the demand for quality and diversity of products is likely to increase finally while the government seems to have learned the lessons of the past the unwillingness to reform politically and economically are rapidly giving way to openness and liberalisation policies that are friendly to foreign capital private banks are now allowed to engage in the foreign exchange market the currency exchange rate has been changed to floating by the central bank of myanmar the 2012 foreign investment law set out an easy land lease policy while allowing a five year tax break for foreign companies along with foreign owned investment of up to 100 percent the government also signed the new york convention on the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in 2013 and a bilateral investment treaty with japan in order to cultivate a positive investment climate in the country in addition the myanmar government has established a national human rights commission and instituted amnesty for political prisoners it has put in place new labour laws allowing unions and strikes and has relaxed press and media censorship in order to improve the political and social environment for businesses these reforms continue to create a positive investment environment and increase interest from foreign capital holders potential risks despite the positive developments investing in myanmar however remains a complex process the conditions are anything but optimal political stability is shaky and legal certainty is virtually zero these risks threaten to undermine the confidence that the country has been steadily gaining from foreign investors in 2013 the world bank ranked myanmar 182nd out of 189 countries for the ease of doing business myanmar remains a very underdeveloped country with rough terrain poor transportation and weak communication infrastructure thus creating high set up costs for many companies as many areas remain inaccessible by road connections between different parts of the country are difficult to maintain despite its abundant natural resources the country itself suffers from chronic energy shortages with only 22 percent of the population having access to electricity in 2011 moreover only about 1 million cellphones are available in myanmar making connectivity extremely difficult politically despite the budding civilian government the influence of the military remains a great concern over 25 percent of the mps remain appointed by military myanmar scores very low on government investment in key necessities as well as in government effectiveness and regulatory quality while the government has taken measures to improve transparency and governance frameworks the business climate continues to be relatively non transparent with pervasive corruption and efficiency deficits and legal frameworks for foreign companies that still lack the clear rules and regulations necessary for safe and confident investment finally many of the country s long running civil wars remain unresolved though there are ongoing efforts between the government and the non state armed groups to reach a peace agreement sectarian tensions between buddhist and muslim communities fuel instability in some parts of the country thus threatening the stable investment environment el dorado for risk takers today the world is undoubtedly interested in asia s last frontier myanmar emerges as a relatively untouched economic canvass with great resources ready for foreign investment while the future seems promising for the liberalising country and those directly involved in the development of myanmar the current hype among investors should be tempered with a pinch of reality and an awareness of the risks of doing business here with an unstable legal framework political uncertainties societal tensions development issues and marginal economic reforms investment in myanmar remains a business for risk takers yet since the government is taking measures to improve those who evaluate the risks and opportunities and are willing to stay the course from the start can possibly find an investment el dorado in myanmar dominykas broga is a geopolitical risk analyst at global risk insights with a focus on frontier and emerging markets his experience ranges from his endeavors at the

inflation is running near 40 per cent assailing consumers with sharply rising prices for food and other basic necessities more than one in four young iranians is jobless with college graduates especially short of work according to the world bank the missile strikes that iran unleashed on bases in iraq last week in response to soleimani s killing appeared calibrated to enable its leaders to declare that vengeance had been secured without provoking an extreme response from president donald trump such as aerial bombing hostilities with the most powerful military on earth would make life even more punishing for ordinary iranians it would likely weaken the currency and exacerbate inflation while menacing what remains of national industry eliminating jobs and reinvigorating public pressure on the leadership spectre of collapse conflict could threaten a run on domestic banks by sending more companies into distress iranian companies have been spared from collapse by surges of credit from banks the government controls about 70 per cent of banking assets according to a paper by adnan mazarei a former imf deputy director and now a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics in washington roughly half of all bank loans are in arrears iran s parliament has estimated advertisement many iranian companies depend on imported goods to make and sell products from machinery to steel to grain if iran s currency declines further those companies would have to pay more for such goods banks would either have to extend more loans or businesses would collapse adding to the ranks of the jobless the central bank has been financing government spending filling holes in a tattered budget to limit public ire over cuts that entails printing iranian money adding to the strains on the currency a war could prompt wealthier iranians to yank assets out of the country threatening a further decline in the currency and producing runaway inflation in sum this is the unpalatable choice confronting the iranian leadership it can keep the economy going by continuing to steer credit to banks and industry adding to the risks of an eventual banking disaster and hyperinflation or it can opt for austerity that would cause immediate public suffering threatening more street demonstrations that is the spectre hanging over the iranian economy mazarei said the current economic situation is not sustainable though such realities appear to be limiting iran s appetite for escalation some experts suggest that the regime s hardliners may eventually come to embrace hostilities with the united states as a means of stimulating the anaemic economy resistance economy advertisement cut off from international investors and markets iran has in recent years focused on forging a so called resistance economy in which the state has invested aggressively subsidising strategic industries while seeking to substitute domestic production for imported goods that strategy has been inefficient say economists adding to the strains on iran s budget and the banking system but it appears to have raised employment hardliners might come to see a fight with iran s arch enemy the united states as an opportunity to expand the resistance economy while stoking politically useful nationalist anger at a protest outside the british embassy in tehran last weekend demonstrators burnt british and israeli flags ap there will be those who will argue that we can t sustain the current situation if we don t have a war said yassamine mather a political economist at the university of oxford for the iranian government living in crisis is good it s always been good because you can blame all the economic problems on sanctions or on the foreign threat of war in the last couple of years iran has looked for adventures as a way of diverting attention from economic problems how ever iran s leaders proceed experts assume that economic concerns will not be paramount iran s leaders prioritise one goal above all others their own survival if confrontation with outside powers appears promising as a means of reinforcing their hold on power the leadership may accept economic pain as a necessary cost the hardliners are willing to impoverish people to stay in power said sanam vakil deputy director of the middle east and north africa program at chatham house a research institution in london the islamic republic does not make decisions based on purely economic outcomes advertisement but iran s leaders need only survey their own region to recognise the dangers that economic distress can pose to established powers in recent months iraq and lebanon have seen furious demonstrations fuelled in part by declining living standards amid corruption and abuse of power as recently as november iran s perilous economic state appeared to pose a foundational threat to the regime as the government scrambled to secure cash to finance aid for the poor and the jobless it scrapped subsidies on gasoline sending the price of fuel soaring by as much as 200 percent that spurred angry protests in the streets of iranian cities with demonstrators openly calling for the expulsion of president hassan rouhani that s a sign of how much pressure they are under said maya senussi a middle east expert at oxford economics in london pressure release in unleashing the drone strike that killed soleimani trump effectively relieved the leadership of that pressure undercutting the force of his own sanctions say experts advertisement within iran the killing resounded as a breach of national sovereignty and evidence that the united states bore malevolent intent it muted the complaints that propelled november s demonstrations laments over rising prices accusations of corruption and economic malpractice amid the leadership replacing them with mourning for a man celebrated as a national hero a country fraught with grievances aimed directly at its senior leaders had seemingly been united in anger at the united states the killing of soleimani represents a watershed not only in terms of directing attention away from domestic problems but also rallying iranians around their flag said fawaz a gerges a professor of international relations at the london school of economics trump had supplied the iranian leadership time and space to change the conversation he added iranians were no longer consumed with the misguided and failed economic policies of the iranian regime but rather the arrogant aggression of the united states against the iranian nation iranian president hassan rouhani has been the target of a growing protest movement ap but then came the government s admission that it was responsible for bringing down the ukrainian passenger jet now iran s leaders again find themselves on the wrong end of angry street demonstrations advertisement for now the regime is seeking to quash the demonstrations with riot police and admonitions to the protesters to go home but if public rage continues hardliners may resort to challenging american interests in the hopes that confrontation will force trump to negotiate a deal toward eliminating the sanctions iran may threaten the passage of ships carrying oil through the strait of hormuz the passageway for more than one fifth of the world s consumption of liquid petroleum disruption there would restrict the global supply oil raising the price of the vital commodity that could sow alarm in world markets while limiting global economic growth potentially jeopardising trump s reelection bid as the logic goes iran previously had a different pathway towards gaining relief from the sanctions under a 2015 deal forged by president barack obama the sanctions were removed in exchange for iran s verified promise to dismantle large sections of its nuclear program but when trump took office he renounced that deal and resumed sanctions the iranian leadership has courted european support for a resumption of the nuclear deal seeking to exploit divergence between europe and the united states the europeans have been unhappy about trump s renewed sanctions which have dashed the hopes of german french and italian companies that had looked to iran for expanded business opportunities whatever comes next iran s leadership is painfully aware that getting out from under the american sanctions is the only route to lifting its economy say experts the nuclear deal was intended to give iran s leaders an incentive to diminish hostility as a means of seeking liberation from the sanctions trump s abandonment of the deal effectively left them with only one means of pursuing that goal confrontation they see escalation as the only way to the negotiating table vakil said they can t capitulate and come to the negotiating table they can t compromise because that would show weakness by demonstrating that they can escalate that they are fearless they are trying to build leverage

after nearly two years of a bruising trade war president trump signed an initial trade deal with china on wednesday that provides the president with political bragging rights but allows both sides to put off the most difficult disputes until after the november election despite the ceremonial pomp of a white house signing event and trump s extravagant remarks on his achievement the so called phase 1 agreement only begins to address the potentially dangerous gulf between the united states and china on trade and economic policy speaking in the east room beside senior chinese officials trump hailed the long sought agreement as a momentous step that was righting the wrongs of the past advertisement the 86 page agreement which the administration had kept under wraps until wednesday includes specific commitments by china to ramp up purchases of u s farm goods and other products and services and to protect intellectual property and open up financial services in many cases however the agreement locked in commitments that china had adopted or were already in the works and although analysts were encouraged that the two sides agreed to meet regularly in the hopes of keeping tensions at bay the phase 1 text made no mention of tariffs let alone a plan to roll them back the trump administration made only a small cut in tariffs on some chinese goods leaving in place hefty 25 duties on about 250 billion of imports from china beijing made no change in tariffs it has slapped on american products trump described the roller coaster negotiations including punishing tit for tat tariffs over the last 18 months as tough honest open and respectful and said he would visit china in the not too distant future although the signing signified a cease fire in the trade war the two nations remain on the cusp of long term decisions that will have potentially harsh consequences for both washington and beijing the united states already has moved to restrict chinese investments in america deny licenses for chinese telecom firms and blacklist others notably huawei research collaborations are coming under scrutiny and more chinese international students are being denied visas that means that the fundamental tensions between the u s and china will not subside even if the administration has achieved some incremental progress as well as met certain political goals that could calm the relationship for the short term said claire reade who served as first chief counsel for china trade enforcement at the office of the u s trade representative from 2006 to 2010 over time the relationship between the world s two economic superpowers seems all but certain to go in one of two directions in the best case scenario both governments would pull back from confrontation expanding not curbing their mutual dependency on trade and at least ameliorating some of washington s most serious grievances those include industrial espionage such as cybertheft and beijing s heavy subsidies for its many state owned enterprises that most economists say undercut foreign rivals and distort global markets neither is dealt with in the phase 1 agreement this does not in any sense tackle the big systemic issues that the u s and china have on trade said chad bown a trade expert at the peterson institute for international economics a nonpartisan think tank in washington robert lighthizer trump s chief negotiator acknowledged that the chinese had actually made more commitments in the past than what is in the phase 1 deal what s new he said was the enforcement mechanism and lighthizer suggested that the trump administration would not easily pull back from tariffs that remain on some 360 billion of chinese products entering the united states any movement towards a phase 2 depends on this being implemented he told reporters wednesday at the white house ceremony liu he china s vice premier and chief negotiator read a letter aloud from chinese president xi jinping the agreement shows that the two countries can work on a basis of equality and mutual respect xi wrote expressing hope that the u s side will treat fairly chinese companies and their regular trade and investment activities liu said that china would strictly honor the agreement accommodate each other s core concerns and ensure the good implementation of the phase 1 trade agreement for both sides however turning toward a strategy of compromise and short term sacrifice instead of confrontation would be difficult under the best of circumstances that may be especially true for the chinese communist party and its elites who are deeply invested in the status quo xi jinping made clear that their system is working very well and that they re not going to try to make their society or their economic system look like western capitalism said henry m paulson jr former treasury secretary in the george w bush administration he founded the paulson institute in 2011 to focus on u s china issues and has been in regular contact with senior chinese officials this is not the china we would like to have but it is the china we got paulson said in an interview we are stuck with each other and both sides have got to figure out a path forward which preserves global peace stability and sustained economic growth in a rules based system analysts fear that if the hard line nationalistic turn in both countries continues as seems highly possible in view of a rising tendency among americans to see china as an adversary the result could be a new cold war that would potentially lead to a more isolated and embattled beijing with reduced access to western markets that now support a chinese economy still dependent on trade and foreign technology eventually china might be able to shift more assuredly to domestic consumption and homegrown innovation but the transition even if ultimately successful would put enormous political pressure on a regime already becoming more and more authoritarian this may be as far as we re going to go said david bachman a china expert at the university of washington referring to the phase 1 deal i think it was really an attempt to put the china dispute on the back burner until after the election with expectation that the chinese will step up their agricultural purchases significantly and that the trump campaign can claim that farmers got a good deal he added analysts examining the text of the agreement said there was plenty to be worried about for one thing the chinese have said very little about it and have yet to release a chinese language version of it the english text is strongly worded saying for example that china shall ensure that its imports of u s goods and services increase by at least 200 billion over two years from the level in 2017 in that year china purchased about 190 billion of products and services from the united states according to u s figures chinese farm imports would rise to about 40 billion this year and next on average from 24 billion in 2017 under the agreement and there are numerical commitments for manufactured goods u s energy and services although u s farm and business groups welcomed those commitments analysts questioned whether china had the capacity to make such large purchases not to mention world trade organization rules and the strains that it could cause china with other trading partners moreover the text wasn t clear about what trade data would be used to determine whether china met its pledge or whether an inability on the part of the chinese to make purchases because of u s export controls could be counted against the commitment u s officials said that in the deal beijing would get a small rollback of tariffs although there was no mention in the text earlier this week as a goodwill gesture the trump administration also withdrew its designation of china as a currency manipulator although the label had little basis or practical significance in the agreement china pledged to refrain from competitive devaluation of its currency and to certain transparency requirements essentially restating a long standing pledge the enforcement chapter set up a graduated process in which the two sides could bring complaints appeal them to top trade officials and allow the parties to ultimately withdraw from the agreement and take remedial action presumably including new tariffs trump has been consistent in demanding more chinese purchases of u s goods and reducing the large american trade deficit and he has had modest success less clear are his convictions and resolve in taking on china to make fundamental changes to its economic system my take on phase 1 is that it largely restores the status quo said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing a labor industry proponent for fair trade i m not optimistic that we ll get a phase 2 deal that s going to dramatically alter the landscape and in that way he said trump will have adopted the pattern of past administrations where they just kick the can down the road on these very tough issues the one difference paul noted is that trump has made extensive use of tariffs and has kept most of them in place as leverage for future talks that could push more u s multinationals with operations in china to look for new places for production and supplies mostly in other parts of asia at the same time trump s tariffs and chinese retaliatory duties on american goods have not only squeezed farmers but also caused a shrinking of business spending in the united states and volatility in stock markets it s going to take an all out strategy from the administration said paul and trump may not want to do anything to risk disrupting financial markets and the broader economy ahead of the november election the deal has some encouraging language but its provisions still leave open questions around the severe structural issues in the u s china trade relationship said nick marro an analyst at the economist intelligence unit this combined with likely difficulties in implementing many of these commitments suggests that there is a high risk that the deal might fall apart later this year
1 signed sealed delivered investors spent wednesday preparing for and then digesting the details of the phase one us and china trade deal initial reactions judging by the moves on wall street appear to be slightly mixed if not marginally positive after an initial sell off after the deal s publication the s p500 ended the day 0 2 per cent higher and the dow closed at a record us stocks ended higher on wednesday with the dow posting a record close after the united states and china signed a phase 1 trade agreement and pledged to resolve a tariff dispute that has roiled financial markets for over a year the spi200 futures contract was up 16 points or 0 2 per cent at 6946 at 7 30am this morning following a new high on the australian stock exchange of 6 996 8 points on wednesday the local sharemarket looks to be headed for another record day after us stocks rose following the signing of a long awaited trade deal with china 2 key points from the trade deal the trade deal addresses several ongoing issues that had defined the 18 month old trade dispute china has committed to increase its purchase of us goods by a minimum us200 billion china has committed to increase its efforts to protect intellectual property china has also pledged to take steps against forced technology transfer in its economy and has promised to open up its financial services industry to us firms both sides have agreed to establish an enforcement mechanism to manage competitive currency devaluations 3 us earnings season traders were also busy assessing corporate results overnight on wall street the big financial stocks continued to be the focus goldman sachs reported and missed estimates largely due to ongoing legal costs associated with the 1mbd scandal bank of america also underwhelmed after it reported a drop in net interest income but target was perhaps the major disappointment the retailer cuts its sales outlook citing weak consumer activity during the christmas sales period with the result stoking some concern about the state of us consumption 4 asx set for positive open wall street s positive end to its session is setting up the asx200 for a solid start today spi futures are implying the index ought to open 16 points higher this morning the move will likely see the asx200 break through the 7000 mark which the market fell just short of yesterday calls of a touch of exuberance in stock markets are growing louder as valuations domestically and abroad become increasingly rich raising concerns of a looming correction 5 british inflation data falls short in macroeconomics uk cpi data captured the lion s share of attention it missed estimates coming in at 1 3 per cent versus a 1 5 per cent forecast the data adds to a series of disappointing data releases out of the uk recently and further adds fuel to the notion that the bank of england ought to be cutting interest rates soon the market has now increased the odds of a rate cut at the end of the month from the bank of england to 67 per cent 6 us producer price pressures subdued us ppi data also registered highly on traders minds overnight following on from tuesday s cpi release us producer inflation was shown to have missed market forecasts coming in at 0 1 per cent versus an estimated 0 2 per cent the data was seen as further evidence that price pressures remain subdued in the us economy us treasury yields dipped as a result of the news while the us dollar traded lower against other g10 currencies
today s the day many investors waited for the last two years pen is finally hitting paper on a phase one trade deal with china that doesn t mean the market s out of the woods far from it stocks gave up some of their early gains yesterday after a news report that tariffs would continue that took some of the wind out of the sails even though no one ever was promised that a phase one deal would remove tariffs the market looks set for a flat to lower opening this morning judging from overnight trading when you think about the trade with china there s still a bunch of delicate issues to work through on topics like intellectual property and technology transfers that didn t necessarily get resolved by the deal being signed today in fact we still don t know all the details of the phase one agreement we ll talk more about all this further down jpmorgan chase co jpm and citigroup inc c got earnings off to a good start yesterday the year over year numbers looked great but let s not forget the fourth quarter of 2018 was miserable earnings comparisons could get more challenging from here on for some of the big banks that were struggling in late 2018 and on the rebound by the first half of 2019 despite solid results from those two and mostly strong showings this morning from several other big banks see more below markets have a weaker tone early wednesday following tuesday s slight downturn if you re keeping score at home it s been more than a month since the s p 500 index spx fell two sessions in a row if today ends that streak it wouldn t be the end of the world things can t keep going up forever without a break back to the banks the firm bank earnings came amid challenges for the industry when you consider the low interest rate situation banking is the sector that had to work against the macroeconomic environment more than any other after the fed cut interest rates three times last year however consumer health came through in the clutch with credit card operations shining this morning goldman sachs group inc gs and bank of america corp bac joined the earnings parade bac registered better than expected earnings per share and revenue while gs saw revenue beat estimates but missed on earnings both banks benefited from firm trading volume bond trading revenue led the charge at gs rising 63 year over year though you have to remember the q4 last year was rough for trading across the board stock trading also climbed at gs last quarter by about 12 bac got some benefit from lower interest rates that helped lead to more consumer borrowing in q4 as total loans and leases rose 4 however the weak rates did eat into net interest income which fell 2 9 from a year earlier like the banks that reported yesterday spending was disciplined but the macroeconomic picture makes it hard for this sector the gs earnings miss looked related to a litigation charge the company is gearing up for an investor day later this month when it will release strategic goals and financial targets gs said in a press release the company s one time charge means the earnings number doesn t look great but what investors wanted to see was strong performance from investment banking and the brokerage business and that s what they got shares of both gs and bac fell in pre market trading for bac earnings were good but the stock was up over 40 last year when you have that kind of movement the company almost has to do something spectacular with earnings to get more traction earnings today were good but not unbelievable and the stock s had a good run blackrock inc blk also reported strong earnings today but didn t get much of a reward from investors in pre market trading blk s revenue from investment advisory administration fees and securities lending in q4 the biggest component of its revenue rose 11 morgan stanley ms is set to report tomorrow morning analysts expect a strong quarter with ms consider looking for some of the same metrics we saw today focus is likely to be on investment banking and trading tough sledding with tariff jitters still dominating trade talk yesterday markets skidded to a mixed close bonds gained a little bit and the 10 year yield dropped to 1 81 gold is hanging in there near recent highs but gave up some ground tuesday volatility remains hard to find besides the bank earnings and producer prices today investors might want to look out for the weekly u s crude stockpiles data last week it surprised to the upside one of a bunch of things keeping u s crude on the defensive lately after that early january surge last year crude spent a lot of time hovering near 55 so at current levels below 59 it s possible the 55 level might hold some technical support since we re talking technicals one consideration is how last week s brief fling above 29 000 for the dow jones industrial average dji might be affecting the market that intraday peak could be one reason things have gotten sluggish over the last few days sometimes when a major index hits a big round number you see stocks fall back and consolidate for a while before retesting it the market had a bit of buyer exhaustion yesterday briefing com observed earnings drive stocks so maybe if results stay firm it might give buyers more energy on the down side valuations are pretty high compared with recent years that means companies that miss expectations could get punished more than usual even meeting expectations might not be enough to get investors excited especially considering 2019 earnings overall have barely risen even while stocks have rolled up one record high after another things seem a bit defensive with investors looking for a catalyst earnings season might give people a pause to re assess the focus today could be on the producer price index ppi which rose just 0 1 in december that might mean less reason for the fed to worry about any inflationary winds blowing the ppi is up just 1 3 over the last year more key data arrive tomorrow in the form of december retail sales wall street consensus is for a rise of 0 3 in retail sales up from 0 2 a month earlier consider paying attention to the separate figure that strips out cars however because weakness in the auto industry might drag down the headline number though 2019 was a decent year as a whole for car sales december wasn t the best month down at the dealership will trade deal signing spark investment one question as the phase one deal gets signed today is whether u s manufacturers some of whom appeared to hold off infrastructure investment as they waited for trade rules to become clear are ready to jump back in or still feel like they need to know more it s a good time to keep monitoring earnings calls especially from big multinationals to see if you can glean anything on the trade and investing fronts executives are almost certainly going to be asked any major revival in company investment could help the u s economy shake off the sluggish growth we ve seen for a while now and maybe keep job growth on a constructive path however it s going to take a while to figure out where everything might land stay tuned and consider watching for any new trade deal agreements that might surface from today s signing if there s anything major that people didn t know about it could have a market impact trade related earnings to watch companies with major exposure to china expected to report soon include ibm common stock ibm next week and caterpillar inc cat and apple inc aapl later this month transport firms like railroads might also have something to say about any possible pickup in freight demand now that it looks like china might be stuffing cargo ships full of u s agricultural commodities china s december soybean imports jumped 67 year over year and 15 from november as some delayed u s soybeans cleared customs reuters reported citing customs data right now china sources 80 of its soybeans from brazil however trucking along transports lagged the broader market last year but maybe they ll get some traction now that earnings season s arrived delta air lines inc dal kicked things off nicely for the sector yesterday thanks in part to low fuel costs and what the company s ceo called healthy demand for travel united airlines holdings inc ual reports next week and we ll see if they also rode the wave of that magic formula for airlines of affordable fuel and consumer health the transport sector isn t just airlines naturally there s also freight and we ll hear next week from union pacific corporation unp the stock is outperforming its sector but analysts are worried that the long trade war might have dampened freight volume also railroads and other freight handlers face growing competition from delivery providers like amazon com

the dow jones industrial average closed above 29 000 points for the first time and the s p 500 index hit its second record high in three days wednesday the milestones came on a day when the market traded in a narrow range as investors weighed the latest batch of corporate earnings reports and the widely anticipated signing of an initial trade deal between the u s and china president donald trump and china s chief negotiator liu he signed the phase 1 deal before a group of corporate executives and reporters at the white house advertisement the pact eases some sanctions on china in return beijing has agreed to step up its purchases of u s farm products and other goods this was telegraphed well enough that the market is kind of looking through it and toward the next phase and what that means said keith buchanan portfolio manager at globalt investments health care stocks accounted for much of the market s gains utilities and makers of household goods also rose those gains outweighed losses in financial stocks companies that rely on consumer spending and the energy sector the s p 500 index rose 6 14 points or 0 2 to 3 289 29 the index also climbed to an all time high on monday the dow gained 90 55 points or 0 3 to 29 030 22 the nasdaq composite added 7 37 points or 0 1 to 9 258 70 smaller company stocks fared better than the rest of the market the russell 2000 picked up 6 66

advertisement while limited in its scope investors have welcomed the u s china deal in hopes that it will prevent further escalation in the 18 month long trade conflict that has slowed global growth hurt american manufacturers and weighed on the chinese economy the world s two largest economies will now have to deal with more contentious trade issues as they move ahead with negotiations and punitive tariffs will remain on about 360 billion in chinese goods as talks continue with the phase 1 agreement now a done deal investors have more reason to focus on the rollout of corporate earnings reports over the next few weeks earnings have been flat to down for the last three quarters and if the fourth quarter meets expectations it should be around the same however analysts are projecting 2020 corporate earnings growth to jump around 9 5 which is why traders will be listening this earnings reporting season for any clues management teams give about their business prospects in coming months we re expecting a reacceleration in the back end of the year so any company guidance that brings any type of skepticism to that could threaten the recent rally we ve had and the gains that we ve accrued in the past few months buchanan said health care stocks powered much of the market s gains wednesday several health insurers climbed as investors cheered a solid fourth quarter earnings report from unitedhealth group the nation s largest health insurer which covers more than 49 million people said its revenue rose 4 on a mix of insurance premiums and growth from urgent care and

the new poor laws how mr gingrich brought back tiny tim january 10 1995 the push to end welfare is more than just another front in the war on big govern ment and high taxes in the name of reform america is about to cross a gigantic social fron tier what s at stake today is not whether the dependent poor will shiver in unheated apart ments and sink slowly into malnutrition that was the 80s when the real value of welfare grants dropped nationally by an average of 25 per cent and city governments cut costs fur ther by churning arbitrarily lopping welfare recipients off the rolls and making them reapply in the 90s a bipartisan consensus has emerged to take us beyond administrative harass ment and immiserating budget cuts in this national movement there are no hawks and doves only bolsheviks and mensheviks the republicans are the tough unyielding bolsheviks uncompromising in their zeal to abolish the exploitation of the taxpayer by the indigent the democrats are the hamlet like mensheviks tortured by moral scruples concerned that the pace of change is too fast but neither party disagrees on principle both insist that the old order is cor rupt and must be eliminated and since no one opposes it the revolution accelerates the latest proposals from the republican led house finance committee contain provisions that make the contract with america seem like the new deal not just because of 50 per cent cuts in the value of some grants or because more than half the children who now qualify for aid would be ren dered ineligible because they were born out of wedlock more funda mentally the new measures strip the indigent of their right to receive public assistance based on need as in the last century when the urban gentry chiefly property owners and their allies in bank ing passed sweeping legislation against the poor the current plan for welfare reform will produce not just a decline in the standard of liv ing but a change in the civil status of the poor stripping them of rights they have had for more than 50 years taken together with legislation passed in state houses and city halls across the country these federal proposals amount to a new set of poor laws that 19th century term for regulating the underclass the inspiration for enacting poor laws in america came from britain where in 1834 a parliamentary commission met to rectify the damage done to the incentive structure of the poor by well meaning 18th century tories the 60s liberals of their day the result of the commission s deliber ations was to privatize state charitable institutions crimi nalize begging set up private mendicancy police jail va grants roust the homeless from public shelters and abolish what victorians called outdoor relief the urban elites insisted as a condition of receiving assistance that poor peo ple live and perform hard labor in a workhouse what makes us willing to step again into this same river of urban misery and calculated cruelty why are we willing to reconsider social darwinist notions that poverty has a ba sis in biology and that as an hereditary pariah group the poor no longer qualify for basic human rights that the poor have any rights at all in this coun try is largely due to the passage in 1935 of the so cial security act at the time all across america state and local relief programs had gone bankrupt new york city didn t even have such a program the 1897 city charter forbade it essentially roosevelt s new deal and tru man s fair deal created two primary entitlements first the social security act gave states access to unlimited matching federal funds and then in 1950 the federal government granted in dividuals entitlement status depriv ing states and cities of the power to deny the needy the social security act contained deep flaws it allowed localities to establish different benefit levels which could never be standardized by the federal government this crazy quilt pattern kept the u s from mandating welfare as a national program the way european nations do and the provisions for unemployment compensation at the urging of southern congressmen left out blacks by ex empting maids and farm workers but for all its defects the social security act did grant poor people entitlement sta tus local governments can t simply turn them away with the explanation that s all folks the money s run out if that happens officials are obligated to raise more but in the new welfare consensus state and individual entitlements disappear automatic matching funds are transformed into block grants administered by the states spending caps are imposed on programs for the poor even legal immigrants become ineligible for aid cities and states will again be able to dump the indigent by a competitive lowering of benefits the few states like new york whose constitutions guarantee the right to aid will be threatened with inundation elsewhere local officials will need only a shrug and a show of empty hands to fend off the importunate poor the real issue looming today is whether america will once again draw the line against the growing millions of its urban poor turning a deprived economic class into a de spised social caste propelling the poor into the presumptive criminal status they enjoyed throughout most of the 19th century the new poor laws could create just such an outcome in this respect they are exactly like the old poor laws even down to small particulars last fall fusion mayor rudolph giuliani declared war on soup kitchens he demanded that the city council close ranks behind his decision to deny funds for those who would feed the hungry in the 1890s fusion mayor william l strong led a similar crusade against permissive soup dispensers these philanthropists helped the deserv ing and undeserving indiscrimi nately leaving them more money for gin palaces and low public houses workfare invented by the ford foundation in the mid 1970s doesn t mean work at fair wages it means working off the value of your welfare check which in some states can mean a wage of less than 1 25 an hour it revives the 19th century work test a key element in the orig inal poor laws before allowing the indigent to eat the new york char ity organization society took male applicants down to their west 28th street wood yard if they chopped vigorously enough they might get fed or if an interviewer discovered a pattern of dependency they might be sent to jail female paupers were taken to the cos laundry to see if they could really scrub such measures rehearse the small humiliations and petty irritants the 19th century inflicted on the poor rudolph giuliani s criminaliza tion of squeegee men and beggars outside the atms ominously repris es the furious campaigns against begging and vagrancy that began in the 1870s the battle reached a peak in 1911 when the state legislature at the behest of the new york city cos passed a law that created upstate prison camps for city beggars the idea that the dependent poor could be transformed once again into quasi criminals hardly seems far fetched any more the punitive and ascetic 1990s already resemble the 1890s more than the comparatively liberal 1970s when the dominant idea of welfare reform was to give every ameri can a guaranteed income that was richard nixon s plan what happened one easy explanation is that reagan s the one for the left these days reagan still serves as in tellectual hamburger helper to pad out our understand ing of painful changes we can t quite yet grasp from the fall of the soviet union to the decline of the u s labor move ment but we need to get past our fixation on ronnie a democrat is chief executive now those who prize simple explanations could far more plau sibly blame clinton for rekindling the spirit of poorhouse america as new york times welfare writer jason de parle observes clinton has taken a tougher stance on welfare than any other president it was he who literally took a page from murray s book it was clinton not reagan who insisted on the two year cutoff clinton not reagan or bush who campaigned to end welfare as we know it but clinton s responsibility for america s rightward shift on welfare ought not to be stretched too far to advert to the postmodern idiom clinton is not a subject as a signifier he simply expresses a certain malaise of the democratic par ty he s a vector of various polling results not an agent of so cial change if the welfare reform parade hadn t been com ing down the street if the ford and rockefeller foundations hadn t already agreed to pay for the band and the uniforms clinton wouldn t have stepped off the curb to lead it nor can the feminization of poverty explain the resump tion of america s class war against the poor in 1984 bar bara ehrenreich and frances fox piven predicted that by the year 2000 the poverty population would consist entirely of women and dependent children feminists argued that the whole binary structure of wel fare male programs like unem ployment don t have the built in surveillance requirements of afdc as well as the growing hostility to welfare expressed nothing less than a patriar chal backlash but the welfare recipients under the most severe attack are those drawing general assistance home relief in new york these are poor people in need of emergency aid who can t qual ify under any other program they re not blind old disabled or caring for dependent children in new york their number has grown to nearly a quarter of a million at a rate 10 times faster than the growth of the afdc caseload reformers don t just want to discourage or cut back on home re lief they simply want to abolish the program but the point is that home relief recipients are overwhelmingly male the angry focus on this program has fiscal not patriarchal roots afdc ssi and food stamps are chiefly fund ed by the feds but every dollar of home relief comes from local taxes what about the power of ideas is the ground burning under the feet of the dependent poor because charles murray and his fellow neocons developed powerful proposals for welfare reform whatever one says about murray no one can accuse him of having an original thought not a single one of murray s claims not a single criterion for handling the poor would have surprised thomas malthus in fact murray s main rant that welfare causes black girls to have extra kids is a false coin handed down directly from parson malthus whose 18th century law of population was specifically designed to afflict poor welfare recipients and comfort rural landlords most of the remaining items in murray s policy invento ry consist of variations on jeremy bentham s less eligibil ity principle as bentham s disciples put it in 1834 in the famous chadwick commission report that inspired the vic torian poor laws the pauper s situation on the whole shall not be made really or apparently so eligible as the situation of the independent laborer of the lowest classes translat ed from 19th century policyspeak the idea was to keep workers from applying for relief and to prevent paupers from staying on the dole conditions have to be made worse for the pauper than anything likely to be experienced by the poorest worker very simply if the worker s conditions are terrible the pauper s must be made revolting without a whole network of foundations think tanks grants and conservative publishing houses amplifying the low wattage of his contribution it s unlikely that so many americans would have paid attention to mr murray or his fellows these people brought us welfare reform in the same sense that the budweiser clydesdales bring us beer some one hitched them to the wagon who is that and why now were you aware that the real estate project most associated with the rockefeller family rockefeller center is going down the toilet the new york times business pages suggest they and their japanese partners mitsubishi estates will renege this year on the mortgage payments they owe and simply walk away from rockefeller center christmas tree and all that s on fifth avenue the downtown real estate situation is much worse vacancy rates in the area approach 30 percent and rents continue to fall that s why the downtown lower manhattan association headed by a vice chairman of the chase manhattan bank came up with a massive bailout plan called the low er manhattan project the wall street area stands as prob ably the most subsidized square mile of real estate in the world battery park city alone last year got a 127 8 million subsidy but aggressive wall street panhandlers want more aid they want the money to convert their office buildings to luxury rentals to lower property taxes and simply to wreck some of their superannuated buildings at taxpayer ex pense promoters of the lower manhattan project appear to have worked out a deal with giuliani to get upwards of 234 million for these projects at least that s the bill for the first three years on the same day mayor giuliani announced the 234 million sub sidy plan for the real estate rich he proposed cutting public assistance payments by another 300 million the mayor of course insists that wall street subsidies don t take money out of the budget that could go to the poor his plan provides seed for eco nomic growth welfare for the real es tate rich will produce jobs but nelson rockefeller was just the first of many to promise the same thing billions of dol lars ago and downtown has fewer jobs now than in the 60s downtown real tors are simply shoving their way to the front of the municipal soup kitchen elbowing aside the poor the same struggle drives welfare re form at the national level the contract with america seeks to have welfare cut backs finance capital gains tax cuts and increased military expenditure this and not more diffuse cultural anxieties is why it s murray time again welfare reform has an added urgency because poverty has grown to 19th cen tury proportions the numbers of peo ple on relief are far larger than the pub lished figures reveal in new york city the official tally of 1 1 million is dwarfed by the number of people who actually receive aid from the basic means tested programs afdc ssi home relief and medicaid only recipients total 1 8 million people one out of four new yorkers naturally welfare reformers whose political base is in the suburbs and the white neighborhoods in the outer bor oughs focus their attacks on inner city welfare moms but they also want to take money away from disabled men and from elderly ladies too cutting off old and disabled ssi recipients is all part of the contract with america s personal responsibility act denying nurs ing home care figures heavily in giuliani s plan to cut med icaid by one third our modern elites need some higher justification for their calculated cruelty than christianity and judaism can provide this is why social darwinism is back what do the social classes owe each other asked america s most famous 19th century social scientist yalie william graham sumner in a bestselling book by that title nothing he answered people chatter about the right to existence complained sumner but where do we find this right to existence not in nature there he explained all we see is a pitiless struggle between individuals go ahead says sumner leg islate such a right what will happen it is plain he says that we shall not abolish the struggle for existence we shall only bring it about that some men must fight that struggle for others some people s taxes will support others right to existence what a waste look at the poor drunkard in the gutter exclaims sumn er you want someone to help him but your pity is perverse a drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be na ture is working away at him to get him out of the way nine tenths of our measures for preventing vice are really protec tive towards it because they ward off the penalty if we map the social policy landscape over the 150 years since america began rapid urbanization what we find are jagged cycles of meanness and relative liberality permitting public outdoor relief and then angrily taking it away these swings in mood and policy correspond roughly to the business cycle and more particularly in big cities to the real estate cycle the meanness phase of the cycle begins when the real estate rich start to feel pinched in the boom phase they re too busy speculating to worry about the bur den of the poor but when the real estate crunch comes their incomes fall they find themselves struggling to pay the banks at the same time as the hard times intensify welfare rolls soar putting pressure on the budget politicians seek to raise taxes real estate responds with a crusade against the poor and the urban machine that coddles the undeserving today s elites react not to the feminization of poverty or because blacks get afdc checks disproportionately they act because they are acted upon they want to get rid of welfare because with real estate revenues being squeezed they want to appropriate the public revenue spent on the poor social historians have misunderstood the 19th century charity reformers they weren t just rich they were rich real estate developers as such they were city shapers and planners they saw welfare expenses not just in terms of the tax burden but in terms of lost opportunities the president of cos robert defor est who successfully led the battle to get rid of public outdoor relief in new york was the principal developer of forest hills queens he was financed by his co reformer otto bannard vice president of new york life insurance in their 1897 crusade against outdoor relief deforest and bannard were following in the footsteps of seth low who d gotten rid of out door relief as far back as 1870 when he was mayor of brooklyn low who inherited millions from his father in the opium trade was the largest landowner in brooklyn he d founded brooklyn charities with oth er developers who d invested heavily in what were then outlying areas of brooklyn what united these charity reformers were their speculations they needed the city to invest heavily in streets gas and lights as well as transportation to make their in vestments pay off the whole reason for the creation of greater new york in 1898 was to grab hold of the manhattan tax base to finance these projects developers insisted on pro ductive not unproductive expenditure roads not relief in new york city in the aftermath of the great depres sion of 93 sleeping in the police station remained the last resort for the homeless these lodging houses served as shel ters for tens of thousands of new yorkers until that is the election of the fusion administration of william strong in 1896 strong appointed teddy roosevelt to lead the new york police board and roosevelt persuaded the charter revision commission to remove from the organic law of the city the clause giving to the police the care of vagrants in 1897 strong also succeeded in get ting the raines law passed this meant literally no more free lunches bars could no longer serve them welfare reformers argued they attracted the homeless next new york s welfare reformers turned to suppressing street begging and vagrancy the cos campaign compiled an exhaustive list of street beggars based on this information the cos s own squadron of mendicancy police was able to round up beggars and turn them over to the police in 1896 the organiza tion turned to teddy roosevelt they asked him to establish a mendi cancy police unit inside the department teddy was the scion of one of new york s richest fami lies an uncle james roosevelt had founded the chemical bank the fam ily led the redevelopment of park avenue after the new york central de pressed its tracks beneath street level theodore sr was president of the new york state charities aid association james was a member of the cos so when teddy was ap proached by the cos ac cording to one witness he listened attentively for the few moments it took for him to grasp the idea and then ordered it done scholars argue over whether it was stalin or hit ler who invented labor camps in fact labor camp proposals predate both the soviet and nazi regimes as ear ly as the turn of the centu ry new york charitable authorities promoted camps as a solution to the vagrancy problem having been rousted from shelters and driven out of bars vagrants were more underfoot than ever especially after the very sharp depression of 1907 as usual questions of economy drove policy discussions the state charities aid association counted up the number of vagrants in peniten tiaries jails workhouses and almshouses in 1908 authorities estimated the cost at more than 2 million the vagrancy prob lem could be more cheap ly handled by the creation of a state labor colony at the prodding of the reformers state legislators passed a bill in 1911 that called for the detention humane discipline in struction and reformation of male adults committed therefore as tramps or vagrants a 900 acre tract in dutchess county was set aside for the camp but the next incoming governor william sulzer refused to appropriate the funds reformers howled sulzer was actually impeached a few months later but the camp was nev er built flash forward to 1994 house speaker newt shook up not only or dinary folks but some hard line welfare reformers with his insistence that kids born out of wedlock be sent straight to orphanages horrifying exclaimed the american enterprise insti tute s douglas besharov who performed a careful cost benefit analysis of the proposal outrageously expensive it turns out orphanages cost 15 000 a year per child at present il legitimacy rates it would cost 70 billion a year to put all the kids born out of wedlock in these new boys towns the entire afdc program costs only 21 bil lion besharov concludes orphanages would have a powerful deterring effect on young girls thinking about getting pregnant but not one worth 50 billion naturally there were sensitive moral thinkers like be sharov around in the 19th century their logic remains our logic to see what choic es present day child welfare reformers will embrace we only have to examine the preferences of their 19th century counterparts the ordinal costs of child welfare alternatives haven t changed since then or phanages are the most cost ly payments to single mother are less costly and sheer indifference is least costly naturally number three was the optimal choice for those dealing with the problem of homeless children in new york but they faced a threat in 1898 while charity re formers relaxed their customary vigilance the legislature passed the ahern bill it allowed public support for the children of widowed mothers the measure would have used public funds to get these children out of orphanages and reunite them with their mothers charity movement repre sentatives thundered against the bill they had just ren dered outdoor relief illegal now the legislators were sneaking public outdoor re lief in through the back door outdoor relief argued a lobbyist from the state charities aid association was a system which in large cities has always been found to promote pauperism to discourage self reliance and thrift and to be especially li able to flagrant abuses the welfare reformers convinced mayor strong he persuaded the governor who vetoed the bill that had been passed by the state house it had been official new york welfare policy since the 1870s to encourage family integrity state orphanages didn t even exist but with child abandonment becom ing an ever more serious problem local officials began to resort to placing orphans in private orphanages which received per capita funds from state institutions in an 1896 investigation the state charities aid association demonstrated terrible child abuse one state supported orphanage the ladies deborah nursery spent a total of 27 cents a day on its charges even in the 1890s that wasn t a lot of money reformers argued that the worst family home is better than the best institution they moved to empty out new york s orphanages but as bad as many orphanages were charity reformers encouraged even worse al ternatives the new york branch of the na tional children s home society headed by the reverend w jarvis maybee offered 100 a head for homeless children he promised to find places for them many children wound up placed as prostitutes thousands of others were sent out west to become indentured servants farmers in particular sent in their orders for strong healthy boys a whole pattern of cost driven child dis posal emerged involving public authori ties too state investigators discovered that local officials in many counties placed the child in any home obtainable where it will cease to be a county charge they con cluded that less cost to the taxpayer seems to be the main consideration unlike india with its untouch ables or japan and its burakumins the rationalistic west has no tradition of religiously sanctioned pari ah groups when competition for resources becomes intolerable the in group sumner s term sanc tions the creation of out groups by means of science in the great depression the germans turned to racial science to justify stripping jews of their civil rights and separating them from the rest of society science explained that the jews were a parasitic growth on germany the 1935 nuremburg laws were offered as a step towards racial sanity they also validated the eventual distribution of jewish property among german businessmen it s true that nothing today or even in 19th century america compares with what the nazis eventually did to the jews but in fact the nuremburg laws didn t establish death camps they only caused the jews to revert to their medieval status just as today the poor laws merely send our indigent back to their 19th century semicriminal status the germans made the jews wear yellow badges until the mid 19th century in bal timore the poor had to wear badges too in colonial new york paupers had the letter p sewed in red or blue on their clothes inspectors of the poor were directed in the language of the time to see the letter p sett on there garment as a token of there being supported by ye town similar economic conditions filtering through similar institutions provoke re sponses that need to be examined for simi larity this isn t the great depression but never before in american history not even in the 30s has the u s seen such a pro tracted fall in wages the twin pillars of u s business strategy capital export and labor import mean that workers can t raise their wages the only hope they have of pre venting their incomes from falling further is to cut government spending and lower taxes that s why there is such a broad con stituency for tax cuts and welfare cutbacks but the existence of an eager audience doesn t tell us who s producing the show the ford and rockefeller brothers foun dations have been promoting radical welfare reform since the 70s that s when the fiscal crisis ended the confident mood of the 60s in the wake of the real estate collapse of that decade foundations began to pro mote neighborhood self help economic strategies in ghetto areas ford discovered the underclass it funded experimental groups like wildcat that put afdc recipi ents into unionized public sector jobs workfare was born the urgency with which these measures were pressed seemed to fade with the sur prising real estate revival of the 80s but fol lowing the 87 crash the greatest real estate downturn in american history began to work its way through the budgets of cities and states the fight for public revenues that began then is still going on local real es tate elites need the cash now not for any great projects but just to stay afloat they need rudy just as the defense industry and the capital gains seekers need newt of course speaker gingrich is not a nazi he is a liberal a 19th century liberal of the manchester school and mayor giuliani is no gauleiter he is simply another liberal admirer of the night watchman state and that is why tiny tim is back
