soon launch some online and offline projects to promote media exchanges and training in asia in the fields of education science and technology and culture the bfa has introduced and will continue to introduce specific programs to promote dialogue and cooperation in related fields the themes and topics of the bfa annual conference are usually formulated in light of the world and asian economic situation how would you evaluate the current situation since the outbreak of the global financial crisis a decade ago countries have worked together to help the global economy out of the crisis global economic growth returned to pre crisis levels in 2017 a synchronized global economic recovery greeted the start of 2018 but it suffered a series of shocks later in the year global trade frictions escalated the u s federal reserve raised interest rates four times currencies in many emerging economies depreciated sharply oil prices plunged and global stock markets tumbled a very important reason giving rise to these phenomena is that in the decade after the outbreak of the global financial crisis many countries neither carried out enough structural reforms nor properly solved the problems of weak endogenous economic power and social polarization as a result economic globalization became the scapegoat while global populism unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise posing challenges to existing international economic trade and financial systems the international monetary fund imf toned down the expected global economic growth rate for 2019 and 2020 to 3 5 and 3 6 percent thus the international community needs to make great efforts to remedy and improve the situation nevertheless despite these changes in the past year the asian economy showed strong resilience and realized overall good performance asia was still the fastest growing region in the world economy contributing more than 60 percent to world economic growth the imf estimated that asia grew at 5 6 percent in 2018 and would grow at 5 4 percent in 2019 despite downturn pressure from external risks high savings and investment rates balanced current accounts sustained investment in human capital and technological innovation and the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep under negotiation will become important forces driving sustainable development in asia in the future what has caused increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development structural problems in various countries coupled with the escalation of global trade frictions tightening financial conditions and increasing fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices in 2018 have led to a deterioration of the external development environment for countries and increased instability and uncertainty in world economic development the escalation of trade frictions has become a major disturbance for the sustainable growth of the global economy since 2018 the u s has imposed tariffs on a variety of imports triggering countermeasures by trading partners and resulting in a tense global trade situation in the third quarter of 2018 the growth rate of new export orders slowed down significantly with the global trade outlook indicator dropping to 100 3 approaching a tipping point between boom and bust increased trade tensions can directly deflate business and market confidence as well as weaken investment and trade increased trade barriers can also increase commodity transaction costs reduce the efficiency of global resource allocation disrupt global supply chains and hinder the dissemination of new technologies thereby reducing productivity in the long run trade tensions could cloud the medium term growth prospects of the global economy the tightening of global financial conditions is a significant external factor affecting the steady growth of emerging market economies after the global financial crisis major countries implemented a long term quantitative easing monetary policy and as a result low cost capital flowed into emerging market economies on a large scale in 2018 as the u s federal reserve hiked interest rates more frequently as the u s dollar strengthened and as the european central bank sent signals to stop quantitative easing global financial conditions gradually tightened exposing emerging market economies to increased financing difficulties and financial market shocks in addition trade frictions and geopolitical risks have created fluctuations in commodity prices exchange rates of emerging market economies such as argentina turkey and south africa fluctuated dramatically greatly affecting the stable development of the domestic economy financial markets in some asian economies with better domestic economic fundamentals have also been affected by spillover effects in addition disruptive technological innovation while promoting leapfrog economic development has also created many difficulties for policymakers artificial intelligence block chains big data cloud computing and other disruptive technologies have spawned a variety of businesses rapidly changed people s way of life and work reconfigured the value system and inspired new products and services however disruptive technological innovation can also be used to evade traditional regulation for example the vigorous development of financial science and technology has brought about such thorny and wide ranging problems as the distortion of market supply and demand caused by high frequency transactions the use of virtual money for illegal transactions the leakage of consumer financial data and cyberattacks on important financial infrastructure which may cause significant risks given unstable and uncertain economic growth prospects how should globalization be promoted and international economic rules improved the international community should adhere to multilateralism work together to promote globalization improve global trade rules and return the world economy to the track of strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth currently it is urgent to reform the world trade organization wto and safeguard the multilateral trading system wto reform cannot be accomplished by one country or one party alone multilateral discussions and consensus are needed to promote it wto members need to deepen mutual understanding and cooperation jointly safeguard free trade actively explore ways to improve trade negotiation frameworks and establish a new global trade order as soon as possible at the same time the international community should continue to reform the international monetary system and build a global financial safety net as the core institution of this safety net the imf needs to ensure sufficient liquidity while also improving the flexibility and pertinence of loan conditions asia europe latin america and brics countries brazil russia india china and south africa are also constantly improving arrangements for providing financial assistance at the regional level since 2008 more than 70 swap agreements have been signed between more than 50 central banks around the world stabilizing market confidence in addition more equitable globalization should be promoted by strengthening infrastructure interconnection according to world bank estimates about 60 percent of the world s economic output comes from coastal areas lying within 100 km from the coastline some countries especially landlocked countries are marginalized in the process of economic globalization which in turn hinders economic globalization meanwhile some experts estimate that the mode of economic globalization characterized by tariff concessions can promote world economic growth by up to 5 percent while the new type of economic globalization driven by interconnectivity can promote world economic growth by 10 15 percent it is for this reason that president xi jinping proposed the belt and road initiative to promote a new type of globalization the initiative has been recognized and supported by more than 100 governments and international organizations and has the broad participation of the private sector across the world what role does asia play in promoting globalization and improving international economic rules faced with the rise of anti globalization sentiment and trade protectionism asian leaders have jointly voiced their firm support for economic globalization and trade and investment facilitation through various platforms and have actively promoted regional integration in may 2018 the leaders of china japan and the republic of korea met and reiterated that they should jointly safeguard free trade and promote regional economic integration the qingdao declaration of the shanghai cooperation organization summit in june pointed out that economic globalization and regional integration are the general current trend so all parties should safeguard the authority and effectiveness of wto rules consolidate an open inclusive transparent non discriminatory and rule based multilateral trading system and oppose any form of trade protectionism in mid november the east asian leaders meetings proposed trade facilitation in east asia should be further strengthened e commerce and the digital economy should be promoted and rcep negotiations covering nearly half of the world s population and nearly one third of its trade volume should be completed as soon as possible as supporters of the multilateral free trade system many share common views on improving trade liberalization and investment facilitation resisting protectionism and unilateralism and addressing climate change at a time when global economic growth is facing bottlenecks and trade rules are being challenged asian countries hope to work with countries in other parts of the world to set up a bridge for restructuring the international trade and economic order formulate and maintain new rules and contribute to the sustainable growth of the world economy currently there are many high level exchange platforms such as the world economic forum and the asia pacific economic cooperation economic leaders meeting moreover china has initiated events including the belt and road forum for international cooperation and the world internet conference what are the unique features of the bfa compared to other platforms how can its competitiveness and attractiveness be maintained some of these platforms are intergovernmental international conferences and some are nongovernmental forums every one of them has its own characteristics and plays a very good role the annual meeting of the bfa covers various aspects of asia emerging markets and the world economy its participants include state leaders government ministers executives of the world s top 500 enterprises and other business leaders as well as opinion leaders it is a top notch feast of ideas in terms of the popularity depth and breadth of its

the mission of the international monetary fund completed its work in kyiv the national bank once again did not dare to lower its key rate while the government continued to raise social standards and take new loans ahead of the elections these are the key economic news of the outgoing week this week the mission of ukraine s key creditor the international monetary fund completed its work in kyiv the main topic of discussions with the ukrainian authorities was the resonant decision of the constitutional court of ukraine on the abolition of illegal enrichment article in the criminal code the norm had been introduced in 2015 as part of anti corruption measures in the course of the previous cooperation program with the fund the ccu ruling has already sparked sharp reaction from international partners and may become an obstacle for further cooperation with the imf but so far no statements from the fund have followed as the delegation simply gathered the necessary information and left experts believe that the lender will make an informed decision the issue concerns the implementation of the previous imf program restoration of responsibility for this violation is a complex legal and procedural issue which is difficult to figure out from afar all the way from washington explains olena belan chief economist at dragon capital she recalls that the mission s decisive visit on the next bailout tranche is expected in may and by this time ukraine needs to have fulfilled a number of conditions including to appoint judges of the high anti corruption court adopt the split law on optimization state regulation of markets of non banking financial services and review gas prices by the way the issue of raising by 15 gas prices for households from may 1 2019 as stipulated by the imf cooperation program and set out in the state budget may also be a subject of debate the relatively warm winter contributed to the fact that european prices for natural gas fell almost to the level of the current gas price for ukrainian households given this fact in the outgoing week prime minister volodymyr groysman announced negotiations between njsc naftogaz of ukraine the ministry of finance and the international monetary fund видео дня i will instruct naftogaz together with the ministry of finance to start a working discussion with the international monetary fund to resolve the issue and prevent any increases in gas relying on the proposal of naftogaz of ukraine the pm said obviously the upcoming review of the program by the imf will be a difficult one meanwhile the national bank is seeing no risks for continued cooperation with the fund even taking into account the ruling of the constitutional court we continue to work as usual and see no risks in this for the continued cooperation with the imf and receiving the next tranches which are scheduled for may and november said nbu governor yakiv smolii nbu assessing risks despite the slowdown in inflation and optimistic expectations the national bank did not dare to lower its key rate which could contribute to cheaper bank loans and accelerate economic growth at a traditional monetary briefing on thursday the nbu governor announced that the rate remained unchanged at 18 per annum for the fourth consecutive time previously the national bank made similar decisions in october and december 2018 as well as in january 2019 the nbu explained their indecisiveness by the relevance of previously identified risks that may impede a further decrease in inflation as well as a number of new risks associated with the next increase in social standards it s about monetization of subsidies that started in march of this year for which almost uah 5 7 billion will be allocated from the state budget this month in addition since march the government has introduced automatic indexation of pensions thanks to which payments will increase for almost 9 million of 10 2 million ukrainian pensioners the amount of the increase will average uah 515 according to nbu estimates raising social standards is unlikely to have a significant impact on consumer price hikes while being able to push inflation expectations we evaluated the impact of individual decisions regarding monetization of subsidies and the increase in pensions but for each of these elements we had estimates of up to 0 1 commented serhiy mykolaichuk head of the nbu monetary policy and economic analysis department but this may affect inflation expectations given the information campaign that accompanied these measures despite nbu fears the cabinet in its pre election fever has been pumping social spending at its traditional meeting on wednesday the government introduced additional payments for large families from april 1 they will receive an additional uah 1 700 for each child starting from the third until their kids reach the age of six as stated by the minister of social policy andriy reva the cabinet of ministers is this way implementing the initiative of president poroshenko to help children in large families by the end of the year uah 2 4 billion will have been allocated in the framework of this program new loans the unprecedented generosity of ukrainian authorities in relation to the electorate does not reduce the urgency of financing the budget deficit to this end in the outgoing week the ministry of finance increased by 350 million the amount of ten year eurobonds issued in october last year the interest rate as in october was at 9 75 while the settlement on the transaction is scheduled for march 21 finance minister oksana markarova explained that the transaction was due to the need for timely financing of budget expenditures considering that in 2019 we must spend uah 418 billion on servicing and paying off debts besides clearly monitoring tax and non tax revenues we must conduct monthly internal and external borrowings she said the finance ministry recalled that this year ukraine has already attracted a eur 529 million loan guaranteed by the world bank and also announced talks with official lenders on new concession loans in addition funds are being actively attracted in the domestic market in the first two months of this year the state budget received almost uah 35 billion us 886 million and eur 33 million from auctioning off domestic bonds it should be noted that the rates on domestic loans remain very high at 19 for securities in uah 6 5 in dollars and 4 5 in euros on the other hand investors are not yet ready to lend ukraine funds at more attractive rates given that the credit ratings remain low in the outgoing week fitch confirmed ukraine s sovereign rating at b which reflects the country s external liquidity which is still weak as well as political risks next week promises to be no less interesting the state statistics service will release data on the growth of the ukrainian economy over the past year and the dynamics of industrial output we might also see the outcome of an ongoing conflict between naftogaz ceo andriy kobolyev and prime minister volodymyr groysman the head of government promised to discuss the proposal of naftogaz supervisory board to extend kobolyev s contract for another year while reducing his salary by half in addition groysman proposed to oblige the head of naftogaz to ensure the growth of domestic gas output transmission of russian gas from 2020 and the company unbundling kobolyev s dismissal under groysman s scenario could be rather costly for the ukrainian treasury according to valeria hudiy a lawyer with ilyashev and partners the termination of the contract provides for a severance pay which taking into account the salary of naftogaz ceo may amount to about uah 171 million failure to pay this benefit as well as dismissal in violation of the established procedure without a proper motion of the supervisory board may be the subject of litigation olha hordienko

2019 epa issued the final resource conservation and recovery act rcra rule streamlining standards for managing hazardous waste pharmaceuticals 84 fed reg 5816 certain pharmaceuticals are regulated as hazardous waste under rcra when discarded the final rule removes these pharmaceuticals from full rcra regulation and creates a new part 266 subpart p for the management of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals by healthcare facilities and reverse distributors healthcare facilities for both humans and animals and reverse distributors will manage their hazardous waste pharmaceuticals under this new set of sector specific standards in lieu of rcra generator regulations in part 262 the new rule also prohibits the disposal of hazardous waste pharmaceuticals down the drain sewering and eliminates the dual regulation of rcra hazardous waste pharmaceuticals that are also drug enforcement administration dea controlled substances the rule maintains the household hazardous waste exemption for pharmaceuticals collected during pharmaceutical take back programs and events the new subpart codifies epa s prior policy on the regulatory status of nonprescription pharmaceuticals going through reverse logistics specifically the rule reaffirms that non prescription pharmaceuticals and other unsold retail items that have a reasonable expectation of being used reused or legitimately reclaimed are not solid or hazardous waste epa also is amending the p075 acute hazardous waste listing of nicotine and salts to exclude certain u s food and drug administration fda

declined by 11 million pounds in 2017 since 2007 air releases of tri listed chemicals fell 57 percent at industrial facilities submitting data to the program electric utilities are responsible for the greatest decreases in air releases since 2007 but nearly all industrial sectors have reduced their air releases over that time epa stated and 87 percent of the nearly 31 billion pounds of tri chemical waste was prevented from being released into the environment due to practices such as recycling energy recovery and treatment the analysis shows industrial facilities also reported implementing nearly 4 000 new source reduction activities that eliminated or reduced the creation of chemical waste the 2017 national analysis is available online phmsa issues ifr revising hmrs for lithium batteries the

integrity act introduced in house senate on march 13 2019 representative tonko and senator brian schatz d hi introduced the scientific integrity act h r 1709 s 775 the bill would shield public scientific research and reports from the influence of political and special interests representative tonko in a statement said president trump s assault on environmental standards has hinged on efforts to distort bury and even rewrite credible public scientific findings including his absurd denial of the growing climate crisis and efforts to cover up evidence that the american people are being exposed to dangerous toxins protecting the integrity of that science is one of the most important ways we can hold this president and his administration accountable distorting or suppressing public science undermines our ability to protect the health and safety of the american people the statement also cited as the need for the legislation president trump s track record of distorting or suppressing science he stated that in its first two years the trump administration has buried reports on public health risks from pfas substances falsified scientific claims to justify restrictions on birth control access prohibited cdc staff from using the phrases evidence based and science based and banned federal scientists from speaking about climate change the bill would seek to prevent undue influence over federal science by establishing uniform standards at u s agencies to adopt or strengthen existing scientific integrity policies the legislation would formalize and reinforce policies that require federal agencies that conduct or fund scientific research to maintain clear scientific integrity principles it also would affirm that science dictates policy and that scientific research should be free from the pressure of politics ideology or financial influence and it would hold public scientists to high standards and guarantee their rights and protections under the law

welcome to this week s market wrap podcast i m mike gleason coming up michael pento of pento portfolio strategies joins me for a must hear conversation on why he believes central bankers must perpetually keep interest rates near zero and the massive inflationary bubble economy that will likely result also find out how michael is approaching gold and gold related investments for his clients right now don t miss a tremendous interview with michael pento coming up after this week s market update precious metals markets are trading mixed this week as gold struggles to regain the 1 300 level gold prices pushed higher mid week but got pulled back down on thursday as of this friday recording the yellow metal comes in just above that key physiological level at 1 303 an ounce up a very slight 0 3 for the week silver looks lower by just a couple cents or 0 3 this week to bring spot prices to 15 36 an ounce the platinum market shows a weekly gain of 1 6 to trade at 834 and finally palladium is leading the precious metals pack once again advancing 2 4 this week to trade at 1 559 per ounce palladium finds itself just few dollars shy of another new record high it has been recording all time highs with regularity this year over the past three years palladium prices have tripled in value one of the real world consequences is a rise in catalytic converter thefts from parked vehicles a car s catalytic converter typically contains platinum or palladium in relatively small amounts the metals help remove harmful pollutants from emissions in recent years automakers have favored palladium for use in the converters of most gasoline powered vehicles that decision seemed smart when palladium prices were cheap now that they are approaching sky high territory automakers are fretting and many car owners across the country are facing costly replacement bills for stolen catalytic converters thieves eager to cash in on high palladium prices are targeting everything from students cars to church vans some in law enforcement are calling on car manufacturers to install anti theft cages around catalytic converters to deter thieves in the meantime motorists are being advised to install vehicle alarms and avoid parking their vehicles in unsecure wide open areas where thieves like to operate unfortunately bull markets in metals bring out the worst in some elements of society when copper prices were at record highs criminals set their sights on homes construction sites and electrical infrastructure when other base metals were flying high a few years ago some cities even suffered thefts on manhole covers when gold prices were setting records day after day from 2010 to 2011 scammers came out of the woodwork some ran slick television ads on cable tv news programs touting the value of gold but then sold customers overpriced coins falsely touted as rare some of these shady coin dealers got hit with lawsuits over their fraudulent and deceptive business practices

money manager and a terrific market commentator and author of the book the coming bond market collapse how to survive the demise of the u s debt market he s been a regular guest right here on the money metals podcast and we always love getting his wonderful insights michael thanks for the time again today and welcome back michael pento hey looking forward to be back on with you again mike mike gleason to begin as a primer for our discussion today i wanted to turn back the clock a bit and revisit some of what we were talking about during our last conversation now when we had you on back at the very end of november we were in the midst of what was a pretty bearish time and the stock market and that continued up until christmas but then treasury secretary steven mnuchin came out and made some interesting comments and also met with the heads of many of the nation s biggest banks and sure enough in the weeks following the equity markets went on a tear so did you watch what transpired there michael and come away with some of the same suspicions that we did that being that the powers that be worked in concert to keep the wheels on the markets and help it rebound from a very rough ending to 2018 or was the market simply due for a bounce back after a late year selloff touch on that first if you would before we get into other topics michael pento sure my pleasure i believe the market bounced and by the way i was short from a september late september all the way through christmas eve so i covered my shorts in the portfolio in the inflation deflation portfolio i then went long a little bit too early obviously in january so i m on the wrong side of that particular part of the trade although that s offset by longs in other stuff like gold and in treasuries and utilities but the reason why the market in general bounced is because how many times can you hear that the trade deal between xi jinping and trump is going to be fantastic and it s going to happen imminently so i firmly believe mike that nobody wants to be under the market or short the market especially in front of the imminent announcement of a trade deal that s number one number two is of course the move from an extremely hawkish jerome powell one that was going to raise rates to three and a half percent on the fed funds rate and was promising that the quantitative tightening program was going to remain on autopilot just like the predecessor janet yellen assured that it would be like watching paint dry of course none of those things happened and it totally seized up the high yield and junk bond market stock market drops 25 to 30 depending on the index you look at and of course that through the fed into fits so they came out and moved from being hawkish to being more dovish although i hasten to add i want to add two things why i still by the way still have a short buffer in the portfolio is number one is mike the trade deal or the trade tensions have nothing to do virtually nothing to do with the plunge in global growth in the global economy virtually nothing first of all i can prove that by claiming the facts the facts are that chinese exports to the united states increased by 11 in 2018 and exports from the u s to china we re up by a little bit less than 1 so trade actually increased and it led to huge buildup in inventories which is a plus the gdp because people were front row and front running the tariffs that we re going to go up supposedly in january and then they were supposed to go up again in march of course that has never happened so the trade conflagration has nothing to do with this collapse in global growth which we ll get into later that is not what hurt the global economy number two is the federal reserve did move incrementally more dovish however i hasten to add this this event is not lowering interest rates at this juncture that s number one number two the fed is still in the process of its quantitative tightening programs still unwinding burning about 40 billion worth of its assets per month now that s going to change that s going to end probably in october they ll let us know in the march meeting the fomc will let us know when that process is going to end but again the fed reserve is not dovish a dovish federal reserve is one that has hundreds of basis points on the fed funds rate that they are in the process of reducing or one that is in the process of buying assets and increasing its balance sheet that is a dovish fed we do not have that at all as a matter of fact if you look overseas or you look abroad other central banks like japan the boj and the ecb the european central bank have no room to reduce interest rates so if i m correct and economic cycle has turned and we were heading into a global recession then i would be very hesitant to go out and buy shares of the s p 500 at 18 times trailing 12 month earnings which by the way these earnings are falling mike gleason michael you wrote something recently about the extraordinary levels of consumer debt in the u s and mounting evidence of a crisis building you noted there are now more than 7 million car loans delinquent more than 90 days and an overall debt levels are higher than just prior to the 2008 financial crisis yes the real estate mortgage market might be healthier now but the fundamental problem of a nation choking on unpayable levels of debt has certainly not been solved share some of your observations about the current state of this slow motion crisis and what are some of the signs to look for with regards to the wheels finally coming off and this debt cycle shifting away from expansion into contraction michael pento well okay we haven t solved any of the problems that were extent in 2008 what we did was take interest rates down to 0 from five and a quarter percent in fact the whole world reduced interest rates are virtually 0 which engendered a huge increase in the amount of debt outstanding the s p ratings agency just said that debt has increased by 50 globally you ve increased the debt level by 50 other metrics are showing that we have 250 trillion of global debt right now and that s 330 of global gdp a you record high if you look what is going on in china for instance chinese household debt this is not me this is an independent agency called the s p 500 ratings agency this is not what michael pento has come up with household debt in china is up 716 since 2008 non financial corporate debt up 400 in 10 years total government debt up 416 in china in the last 10 years now that s just china but you look at the record high amount of corporate debt here in the united states to 9 trillion from 6 trillion if you look at a record amount of household that you ll get a doubling and then 2 trillion more of a government debt here in the united states what we ve done is we ve enabled we ve juggled using smoke and mirrors all of this phony economy by taking debt up to record high levels and making it sustainable by keeping interest rates at 0 which has also engendered asset bubbles that are out of this world in other words the home price to income ratio in the united states right now is 4 5 to one the record high was 5 3 but the average is three to three and a half so you have a whole group of gen xers or millennials that cannot afford their house because they re buried in student loans and their incomes are woefully insufficient to purchase home prices that are way above their salaries that s just in real estate look at the stock market back to 140 of gdp when the average of that metric is 60 of gdp we ve all of these bubbles they re supported by records amount of debt that are in turn supported by interest rates and borrowing costs that are 0 so this is a very unhealthy very dangerous cocktail that could blow up at any moment mike gleason yeah it seems like the question is just a matter of when not if when it comes to that blow up now we aren t political commentators and i know your focus is on economics and markets though these days it is hard to keep the markets and politics separated so we thought it would be fun to get your take on where you think the proverbial ship is headed the federal government is back to running trillion dollar deficits and there s almost no one left in washington who seems to care much about it in fact there are some avowed socialists who think government should be doing a whole lot more and they are getting ready to challenge donald trump in 2020 we don t know how good the chances are of a socialist getting elected but there is little doubt the ideology is increasing in popularity would you care to comment on what you think our listeners should expect out of washington over the next few years michael pento well this is even if you re a big believer in republicans i m a libertarian so i just come out and say i voted for donald trump and i m a libertarian by nature even the republicans or more and more like enemies of the free market so what i m trying to say to you is that across the globe there is an intractable move towards communism socialism and the abolition and abrogation of free markets so the control of governments no matter who you vote for of course if you vote for someone like a bernie sanders is going to be worse than if you voted for donald trump but the point of the matter is that nobody believes in markets any longer so we don t have a president who wants a fair and honest interest rate we don t have a central banker that wants an honest interest rate we don t have a politician who wants an honest interest rate we don t want to protect savers we don t want to protect retirees what we have become in this country and around the world are purveyors of asset bubbles that is the only job now of central bankers and politicians is to ensure since they ve usurped the power of the free market and taking it upon themselves they have one mandate it is only this to make sure asset prices and that s is the value of bonds the value of equities the value of real estate never fall that is their only mandate that s so sad to say but no matter who you vote for you can be assured that your freedoms will be usurped and you can be assured that free markets will become more and more extinguished and extinct mike gleason what are the dangers the long term dangers i know we talk about this a lot but just to expand on it if you would in terms of not letting markets ever correct i mean this sort of gets back to the whole idea of the difference between say austrian economics and keynesian economics markets do need to correct do they not michael pento mike the markets have become the economy so this was the determination made by jerome powell and the time span between october 3rd and december 24th so he then realized that his reverse qe program or quantitative tightening taking money out of the system when you ve already sent asset bubbles astronomically above the underlying economy was an untenable position and he realized this because the high yield market see he stopped there wasn t any issuance not one high yield bond was issued in the fourth quarter in december so they understood that the level of junk bonds the price level of junk bonds and the level of the stock market and the condition of solvency or perceived solvency of pension plans all hinged upon the level of asset prices stocks and bonds and real estate and once those prices corrected and by the way they were only down 25 20 to 30 depending on the index 30 on the russell and a little less on the s p 500 but it was determined that this is very quickly it was determined that this cannot be allowed to occur but here s the problem that i see you saw nothing so you asked me well then michael why don t a central banks just stay at zero and just keep printing money well eventually mike they re going to get the inflation that they so desire and when that happens every fixed income instrument that is not being actively purchased by the central bank will implode and yields will skyrocket and inflation by the way is going to wipe out any vestige left in the middle class but here s what quantitative easing does accomplish it does if it s protracted and immense in nature it can produce asset bubbles that we know but we also are aware that quantitative easing money printing just think of monetizing debt it s something that you hear about this modern monetary theory it s all a recycling of the same theory and the same thing is tried had been tried over and over again where the government just prints up just spends money and the central bank buys it prints it but it does not do anything for the underlying economy that s why you see total market capital gdp far astronomically far above the underlying economy so let s look at some of the data that we see around the world today so u s retail sales plunge a couple of months ago not the nonfarm payroll report for february showed a net number of jobs of 20 000 housing starts are down double digits existing home sales went to a three and a half year low let s look overseas where they just got out of qe in december europe s growth is practically zero italy is a 0 gdp germany is at 0 gdp japan as a 0 gdp growth the united states if you look at the atlanta fed our q1 gdp growth is projected to be 0 4 from 4 2 in q2 of last year and when you think about all this the earnings per share on the s p 500 which was once growing at 28 at the height of all his global qe when it was 180 billion every freaking month would now it s zero the earnings per share has gone from 28 growth to negative three and a half percent according to factset for q1 so this is what we ve been gendered in this is what we ve created in the world this is an artificial world totally dependent upon perpetual interest rates at 0 and never ending quantitative easing or debt monetization that s where we re at unfortunately markets no longer exists there is no more free mortgage in the fixed income spectrum and in most other areas of the world there is no free market for equities mike gleason yeah very well put couldn t agree more wells as we begin to close we definitely want to get your take on the gold and silver market specifically here the metal s got off to a great start this year we saw a pullback at the end of february now we re seeing a bit of a rally again the metals are going to need a catalyst in order to get something serious going to the upside at this moment we can see some potential drivers some volatility and selling coming back in the equities markets could push metals higher but we aren t a sure we re going to see that happen in the very near future what do you make of the current landscape for metals and what are you expecting in the weeks ahead michael pento so here s where what s going on and we are at a record high position for gold in the inflation deflation and economic cycle model that i run here at pento port so why is that okay why is that the case so we were a 5 goal when it was crashing in 2016 and 17 but we are now at 22 gold and gold related investments so why is that the case because nominal interest rates there s been a proclamation from central bankers that nominal interest rates can never go above zero you look at the negative rates now in japan the german boom has a yield going out 10 years now of 0 7 so interest rates can never be allowed to rise if you look at our 10 year note is now at least in the terms of yields is in a bear market so a bull market and bond prices in a bear market in that yield and when you come to the realization that nominal rates can never really get much above zero that s a rocket fuel for gold because gold loves are interest rates that are close to zero and falling because it doesn t produce any income it just preserves your purchasing power i say just in quotations just is pretty important now because its central banks are also going to have to resort to a return to quantitative easing i believe that the ecb is moving in that direction they also extended the tltlro which is a targeted long term refinancing operation basically just to spell it out for your audience it s basically when the central bank makes loans to commercial banks and commercial banks don t have to pay back the central bank if they make that loan to the private sector they don t have to pay back all of that debt so it s a negative interest loan to commercial banks they re more than incentivized to throw money into the real economy so you get and this was the same thing that the quantitative easing does it s an increase it leads to an increase in the money supply which tends to erode the faith and fiat currencies which of course leads to inflation so that means that real interest rates are going to be very much negative they are negative and they re going to be coming more and more negative and finally i think that eventually as this condition of stagflation at first is going to pervade across the entire globe and it s going to wax worse and worse with greater and greater intensity and then finally i believe the imf is going to have to come in and reset all of all the debt and all of the currencies together concurrently i think that s going to destroy all the faith and fiat currencies that includes the u s dollar so the u s dollar will seed its world s reserve currency status because of that fact and that means that gold is going to benefit from three things three things that are rocket fuel gold is going benefit from 0 nominal rates and below real interest rates that are negative and heading lower and the end of the u s dollar as a strong and independent reserve currency that s why i own gold now more than ever and i intend on only increasing that allocation as my predictions span out mike gleason yeah certainly would be a massive flight to safety into the yellow metal if that does transpire very interesting comments as always we ll leave it there we thank you again for your time and your wonderful commentary and look forward to catching up with you again down the road as this begins to unfold now before we let you go please tell folks about pento portfolio strategies and then also how they can follow you more closely and then also how they could potentially reach you if they d like to do that michael pento we have an office number here 732 7729 0500 my email address is the website is pentoport com you can go to the website and get a two free trial subscription to the podcast if you want to become a subscriber it s 49 99 per year you ll get my general thoughts on a weekly basis if you want to become a client of pento port there is 100 000 minimum but then you ll get me to manage your money and i ll tell you one thing s for sure is that if you look at over the next few years one thing is for sure is that the control over the market is going to go in the hands more and more to the central planners and they are going to need it to default upon all of this debt this 250 trillion of debt which is up astronomically as a percentage of gdp and in nominal terms since the great recession occurred they are going to need to default on this debt either through or actually both in different times either through inflation or deflation so there s going to be an explicit restructuring which is very deflationary but before that there s going to be a massive bout of stagflation in fact i think that s already starting across the globe so what you re going to see in the short term is a recession and deflation followed by years of stagflation and then finally that great reset which is going to be a deflationary wipe out of the global economy and that means that you need an active strategy to navigate those treacherous waters and that s exactly what i do what i created with my 20 point model known as the inflation deflation and economic cycle model and investment strategy mike gleason yeah that s fantastic stuff people do need to keep in mind that the old days of just buying an index fund and sitting back and watching it to go higher probably coming to an end and michael would be a fantastic person to look at to switch some of those funds and he s got a great handle on the markets as you just heard well thanks again i appreciate the time hope you have a great weekend and i look forward to

china says ready to use more policy tools to help economy nantong a worker welds a liquefied natural gas lng tank at a factory in nantong in china s eastern jiangsu province afp beijing the chinese government has additional monetary policy measures that it can take to support economic growth this year and will even cut its own flesh to help finance large scale tax cuts premier li keqiang said on friday china has promised billions of dollars in tax cuts and infrastructure spending to help businesses and protect jobs as economic momentum is expected to cool further due to softer domestic demand and the trade war with the united states li s comments suggest beijing is ready to roll out more stimulus measures to ensure the economy grows within a targeted range of 6 0 to 6 5 percent gross domestic product grew 6 6 percent in 2018 the least in 28 years shares on chinese stock exchanges climbed after the government reaffirmed its commitment to boosting growth the yuan recovered from a three week low against the dollar after li s comments of course we are faced with many uncertain factors this year we have to prepare more and we have reserved policy room to address uncertainties li told a news conference after the annual parliament meeting ended moreover we can deploy quantity based or price based policy tools such as reserve requirements and interest rates this is not monetary easing but to more effectively support the real economy the support measures rolled out so far are taking time to kick in and most analysts believe activity may not convincingly stabilize until the middle of the year the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr five times over the past year with a two stage rrr cut in january releasing a total of 1 5 trillion yuan 223 23 billion into the financial system further cuts in rrr had been widely expected this year after fresh data pointed to persistently soft demand in the asian economic giant raising fears of a sharper slowdown sources told reuters in february that the central bank is not yet ready to cut benchmark interest rates to spur the slowing economy but is likely to cut market based rates the premier said the government would take multiple measures to lower funding costs for small and micro firms by 1 percentage point this year an across the board cut in borrowing costs could also risk another flare up in debt and speculative activity like that in the wake of the 2008 9 global financial crisis cutting taxes slitting wrists to help finance the tax cuts the government would need to tighten its belt li said china will bolster its national coffers by collecting more of the profits earned by some financial institutions and centrally owned firms while general expenditure will be cut li said that will collectively cover 1 trillion yuan of the government s planned tax cuts he said large scale tax cuts and fee reductions would affect the government cutting its own flesh li said this kind of reform is equivalent to turning one s blade inward and slitting one s wrist promised cuts in value added tax vat for manufacturing and other sectors will take effect from april 1 while social security fees will be reduced from may 1 li said the premier announced on march 5 that the vat for the manufacturing sector would be cut to 13 percent from 16 percent vat for the transport and construction sectors will be reduced to 9 percent from 10 percent li s comments reconfirm a consistent pro growth stance with clarity on fiscal easing and an earlier than expected effective date for tax cuts morgan stanley said in a note adding that it expects improved growth from the second quarter beijing s tax cut efforts have focused on the manufacturing sector and small businesses that are vital for economic growth and employment li said the government hopes to create 13 million jobs this year the same as last year not allowing the economy to slip out of a reasonable range that is to say we will not allow waves of layoffs said li adding the government will provide support to firms creating the most jobs data on thursday showed that china s survey based jobless rate rose to 5 3 percent in february from 4 9 percent in december partly due to job shedding by export oriented companies trade war china is still negotiating with the united states to resolve their trade frictions li said adding both sides have far more shared interests than conflicts and it would be unrealistic to decouple the world s two largest economies we hope that the consultations will be fruitful and will achieve mutual benefit and win win i believe that this is also the expectation of the world li said a summit to seal a trade deal between us president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will not happen at the end of march as previously discussed treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday washington and beijing have been locked in a tit for tat tariff battle as u s presses china for an end to practices and policies it argues have given chinese firms unfair advantages including subsidizing of industry limits on access for foreign companies and alleged theft of intellectual property on friday china s parliament approved a new foreign investment law that promises to create a transparent environment for foreign firms though there is skepticism about its enforceability the law designed to ease concerns among foreign companies about the difficulties they face in china will ban forced technology transfer and illegal government interference in foreign business practices li stressed that china did not and would never ask chinese companies to spy on other countries his comments came after increased international scrutiny of chinese telecommunications giant huawei technologies co ltd which has been caught in the cross fire as trade tensions ratcheted up reuters
kingsmill bond certainly sounds like a proper name for a city of london financial analyst he looks the part too gray hair expertly trimmed well cut suit he s lived in moscow and hong kong and worked for deutsche bank the russian financial firm troika dialog and citibank he s currently new energy strategist for a small british think tank called carbon tracker and last fall he published a short paper called 2020 vision why you should see the fossil fuel peak coming it asks an interesting question at what point does a new technology cause an existing industry to start losing significant value this may turn out to be the most important economic and political question of the first half of this century and the answer might tell us much about our chances of getting through the climate crisis without completely destroying the planet based on earlier technological transitions horses to cars sails to steam land lines to cell phones it seems possible that the fossil fuel industry may begin to weaken much sooner than you d think the british venezuelan scholar carlota perez has observed that over a period of twenty years trains made redundant a four thousand mile network of canals and dredged rivers across the uk the canal builders fought hard and even finished a couple of major canals in the 1830s but defeat was inevitable as it later was for american railroads and horses when they were replaced by trucks and cars major technological transitions often take a while the czech canadian academic vaclav smil has pointed out that although james watt developed the coal powered steam engine in 1776 coal supplied less than 5 percent of the planet s energy until 1840 and it didn t reach 50 percent until 1900 but the economic effect of those transitions can happen much earlier bond writes as soon as it becomes clear to investors that a new technology is accounting for all the growth in a particular sector over the last decade there has been a staggering fall in the price of solar and wind power and of the lithium ion batteries used to store energy this has led to rapid expansion of these technologies even though they are still used much less than fossil fuels in 2017 for instance sun and wind produced just 6 percent of the world s electric supply but they made up 45 percent of the growth in supply and the cost of sun and wind power continues to fall by about 20 percent with each doubling of capacity bond s analysis suggests that in the next few years they will represent all the growth we will then reach peak use of fossil fuels not because we re running out of them but because renewables will have become so cheap that anyone needing a new energy supply will likely turn to solar or wind power bond writes that in the 2020s probably the early 2020s the demand for fossil fuels will stop growing the turning point in such transitions is typically the moment when the impact is felt in financial markets when stock prices tumble and never recover who is going to invest in an industry that is clearly destined to shrink though we ll still be using lots of oil its price should fall if it has to compete with the price of sunshine hence the huge investments in pipelines and tankers and undersea exploration will be increasingly unrecoverable precisely how long it will take is impossible to predict but the outcome seems clear this transition is already obvious in the coal markets to understand for example why peabody the world s largest private sector coal mining company went from being on fortune s list of most admired companies in 2008 to bankrupt in 2016 consider its difficulties in expanding its market india until very recently was expected to provide much of the growth for coal as late as 2015 its coal use was expected to triple by 2030 the country was resisting global efforts like the paris accords to rein in its carbon emissions but the price of renewable energy began to fall precipitously and because india suffered from dire air pollution but has inexhaustible supplies of sunlight its use of solar power started to increase dramatically in 2017 the price in india of wind and solar power dropped 50 percent to 35 40 a megawatt hour said tim buckley who analyzes australasia south asia for the institute for energy economics and financial analysis fifty percent in one year and a zero inflation indexation for the next twenty five years just amazing this price drop occurred not because india subsidizes renewable energy it doesn t but because engineers did such a good job of making solar panels more efficient the cost of power from a newly built coal plant using indian coal is by comparison about 60 a megawatt hour if you have to import the coal the price of power is 70 megawatt hour and solar s 40 megawatt hour price is guaranteed not to rise over the thirty year life of the contract the suppliers sign their bids are based on building and then running a facility for the life of the contract no wonder that over the first nine months of 2018 india installed forty times more capacity for renewable than for coal fired power much the same is happening around the world president trump has spared no effort to help the coal industry but more coal fired power plants shut down during the first two years of his presidency than during president obama s entire first term american coal consumption fell 4 percent in 2018 in 2017 kentucky s coal mining museum installed solar panels on its roof in order to save 10 000 a year on electric costs and it s not just coal that s on the way out natural gas was supposed to be the planet s next big fuel source since it produces less carbon than coal although its production releases great clouds of methane another potent greenhouse gas while fracking has produced high volumes of natural gas especially in the us where it was pioneered wells tend to dry out quickly and despite enormous investment the international energy agency estimates that between 2010 and 2014 the shale industry operated with negative cash flows of more than 200 billion even cheap natural gas is now starting to look expensive compared to the combination of sun wind and batteries in an essay for vox the energy reporter david roberts listed all the natural gas plants many of them designed to provide quick bursts of peaking power on heavy demand days whose planned construction has been canceled in recent months as utilities and banks began to figure out that over the projected forty year life of a new plant there was a good chance it would become an uncompetitive stranded asset producing pointlessly expensive electricity the chief executive of one us solar company said in january i can beat a gas peaker anywhere in the country today with a solar plus storage power plant who in their right mind today would build a new gas peaker we are a factor of two cheaper you get some sense of the future from the stunning fall of general electric they were the world leader the thought leader the finance leader the it leader said buckley and their share price is down 70 percent in the last two and a half years in a market that s up 50 percent it s a thermal power reliant basket case that s in large measure because manufacturing turbines for coal and gas fired power plants was a significant part of the company s business in 2015 it hugely expanded that capacity by buying its largest european competitor alstom but then the bottom dropped out of the industry as proposed new generating plants couldn t find financing ge makes wind turbines too but that s a lower margin business with many more competitors the fall in ge s stock has meant hundreds of billions of dollars of shareholder value reduction according to buckley last june after more than a century general electric was dropped from the dow industrial index replaced by a drugstore chain oil was believed to be better protected than coal and gas from competition because cars have long needed liquid fuel to run but electric cars are becoming affordable for more and more consumers in 2017 only three million out of a worldwide total of 800 million cars were electric but they accounted for 22 percent of the growth in global car sales the world s leading car companies have become convinced that electric vehicles will account for all the growth in demand by the early 2020s that s why by january 2018 they had committed 90 billion to developing electric vehicles and why by 2017 tesla was worth more than gm or ford and for every tesla that rolls off the assembly line chinese manufacturers are producing five electric cars auto analysts are already warning consumers to think twice before buying a gas powered car since its resale value may fall dramatically over just the next three years the oil companies tell investors not to worry in mid february exxon announced that it had found huge new deepwater oil deposits off the coast of guyana and that overall it planned to pump 25 percent more oil and gas in 2025 than it had in 2017 which it claimed would triple its profits in september opec released a report predicting higher oil demand due to increases in jet travel and the production of plastics which are made from petrochemicals analysts like bond are skeptical of such claims although oil has been the planet s most important industry for over a century over the last five years it s been the slowest growing sector of the stock market petrochemicals and jet fuel are indeed harder to replace with renewable energy but they make up a relatively small part of the market for oil even if demand for them grows it can t offset the losses in core uses like pumping gas for cars the recent history of european utilities may provide a more realistic preview of what will happen in the rest of the world in the early years of this century the german government increased the pace of decarbonization subsidizing solar and wind energy as more and cheaper renewable supplies became available the existing utilities were slow to react they had built new gas plants to account for what they assumed would be rising demand but solar and wind cut into that demand and the price of electricity began to fall so far european utilities have written down about 150 billion in stranded assets fossil fuel installations that are no longer needed in the netherlands by the time the last three coal plants were turned on their owners had already written them down by 70 percent said buckley and they re scheduled to close by 2030 one obvious question is why the fossil fuel companies don t simply transform themselves into renewable energy companies and use the huge cash flows they still have to gain control of future markets they re putting under ten percent of capital expenditures into renewables says bond which translates into about one percent of their balance sheets as exxon s ceo recently told the economist we have much higher expectations for the returns on the capital we invest than sun and wind can provide from their point of view there s some money to be made from putting up solar panels but once they re on the roof the sunshine is free for corporations that made vast profits by selling their customers fuel every day for a century that s not an attractive business model another important question is whether this transition will crash the world economy investors have money at risk and not just in fossil fuel shares a shift of this size will affect car companies machinery companies and many others but as the climate activist and billionaire investor tom steyer has pointed out most technological transitions damage existing industries without wrecking the economy because they create value even as they destroy it look at the communications industry over the last two decades as the internet came of age steyer said some of the most valuable businesses on the planet that had been around for more than a century got decimated i mean newsweek sold for a dollar but a lot of new businesses got created that were worth more and banks have had at least some warning to prepare for this enormous shift in 2015 mark carney the governor of the bank of england began issuing strident warnings about stranded fossil fuel assets urging the banks he regulated to begin taking close account of their exposure he gave a memorable speech on the trading floor of lloyds of london pointing out that if countries made serious efforts to meet climate targets vast amounts of money spent on oil wells pipelines coal mines and tankers would be written off he had to issue the warnings he said because the normal time horizon for financiers was too short once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability it may already be too late he said noting that the exposure of uk investors including insurance companies to these shifts is potentially huge he urged them to start preparing for a lower carbon world companies he said should disclose not only what they are emitting today but how they plan their transition to the net zero world of the future carney s warning which reverberated out from the financial center of london seems to have spurred a reevaluation of fossil fuel exposure by many big financial institutions the major banks are now addressing this risk whereas three years ago they were asleep to it buckley said now in australia all our banks have climate policy where they didn t three years ago we didn t even have data a report in late february from the institute for energy economics and financial analysis showed that since 2013 a hundred major banks had restricted coal lending or gotten out of the business altogether 1 a far more important question of course is whether the changes now underway will happen fast enough to alter our grim climatic future here the answers are less positive scientists conservative by nature have routinely underestimated the pace of planetary disruption the enormous melt now observed at the poles was not supposed to happen until late in the century for instance and the galloping pace of ocean acidification wasn t even recognized as a threat two decades ago that means that we have very little time to act not enough certainly for business cycles to do the job alone the latest report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change released last autumn laid out a strict timeline we need to effectively halve our use of fossil fuels within a dozen years to prevent the worst damage which is why activists and politicians have called for dramatic government interventions like the green new deal recently proposed by representative alexandria ocasio cortez and her democratic colleagues 2 government action is required because for one thing there s vast inertia in the energy system plants are built to last decades and even if plants that use fossil fuels aren t built today banks will insist that existing ones operate long enough to pay back their investments and in some parts of the world fossil fuel expansion continues china for instance is trying to close down its own coal fired power plants because its cities are choked in smog but chinese companies are using their expertise to build coal powered plants abroad buckley noted that the opportunities for bribes on colossal projects mean among other things that a number of developing countries may indeed continue down the fossil fuel path in countries like the us or canada the political power of the fossil fuel industry is still considerable barack obama boasted to a texas audience last year that during his administration the us had passed russia and saudi arabia as the biggest producer of hydrocarbons even the progressive canadian prime minister justin trudeau recently spent billions in tax dollars to finance a pipeline designed to increase exports from the country s environmentally ruinous tar sands that s why the most important aspect of the decline of fossil fuel companies might be a corresponding decline in their political influence the coal oil and gas industries have been the architects of the disinformation campaigns that kept us from responding earlier to scientists warnings about climate change and they are using every trick they know to keep us from making a quick transition history indicates that the oil majors and those who invest in them will bribe and fund trump type candidates and use their money in any other way to slow down change carlota perez said but change is here while engineers are doing their part by making renewable energy cheaper activists are mounting efforts to weaken the companies directly and there are some signs that the pressure is working an effort that i helped launch beginning in 2012 to persuade universities and churches to divest their fossil fuel shares has spread rapidly and become the largest divestment campaign in history over the last five years insurance companies and sovereign wealth funds have joined in raising the total value of endowments and portfolios involved to over 8 trillion and prompting shell to declare the campaign a material risk to its future business early last year the governments of new york city and london pledged to divest their pension funds and the entire nation of ireland joined in midsummer campaigns have also targeted banks like wells fargo and jp morgan chase to force them to stop supporting particular pipelines the bottom line is clear to the degree that the fossil fuel industry is weakened by some combination of technological change and furious activism the chances for serious change increase if energy barons like the koch brothers and exxon remain flush with cash they can probably delay or undermine initiatives like the green new deal but if their businesses are under strong pressure from a rapidly changing energy economy polities around the world would be freer to take the steps that scientists insist are necessary with the speed required to prevent global catastrophe should these changes happen quickly they could do more than save us from planetary peril a new world the january report on the geopolitics of energy transformation from the international renewable energy agency irena is one of the most hopeful documents i ve read in a long time it points out that for the 80 percent of the world s population that lives in countries that are net importers of fossil fuels the transition to renewable energy means the end of a crushing import burden the long term consequences of a switch to renewables are very positive said bond who helped write the report fossil fuels are produced by a small number of companies and countries and the benefits flow to a small number of people with solar and wind you get a lot more local jobs a lot more local investment you get a whole new geopolitics take india the poorest large nation on earth it imports 80 percent of its oil and 40 percent of its gas along with much of its coal currently that costs the country 240 billion a year if as its leaders hope its economy grows 7 percent annually that figure would double in a decade which is economically unsustainable renewables also offer developing economies an opportunity to leapfrog not only fossil fuels but to some extent the need for a centralized electricity grid the irena report concludes countries in africa and south asia have a golden opportunity to avoid expensive fixed investments in fossil fuels and centralized grids by adopting mini grids and decentralized solar and wind energy deployed off grid just as they jumped straight to mobile phones and obviated the need to lay expensive copper wired telephone networks the changeover of course would be rocky beyond the effects on the global economy or on particular companies and their investors countries like russia or saudi arabia and increasingly parts of the us are essentially oil companies themselves as these petro states face a fall in the value of their only real asset there is a risk of destabilization on a vast scale in fact it s possible that we re in the early stages of this process with mischief and cruelty increasingly on display as countries with no other source of economic power struggle to maintain profits while they can the worst damage will as usual be inflicted on the poorest oil producers kuwait might be able to manage the transition but could angola yet overall the benefits would be immeasurable imagine a world in which the tortured politics of the middle east weren t magnified in importance by the value of the hydrocarbons beneath its sands and imagine a world in which the greatest driver of climate change the unrelenting political power of the fossil fuel industry had begun to shrink the question of course is whether we can reach that new world in time over 100 global financial institutions are exiting coal with more to come february 27 2019 available at ieefa org see my

trump will always tell you the truth up to 30 percent of the time on august 18 2016 donald trump delivered his first major speech with steve bannon and kellyanne conway at the helm of his campaign press and pundits seized on his humbler tone and less incendiary rhetoric but their focus should have been on this but one thing i can promise you is this i will always tell you the truth i speak the truth for all of you and for everyone in this country who doesn t have a voice even as he spoke politifact was reporting that roughly 70 percent of the trump statements it evaluated were rated either mostly false false or pants on fire as of this writing that ratio has hardly budged since donald trump was inaugurated by the new york times count in his first 10 months trump told nearly six times as many falsehoods as obama did during his entire presidency as of march 3 2019 the washington post updated its ongoing tally of donald trump s lies to a total of 9 014 in 773 days 2 we are not going to cut social security we are not going to cut medicare on monday the trump administration unveiled its fiscal year 2020 budget proposal calling for a staggering 4 7 trillion in spending next year the blueprint also takes the axe to social security down 25 billion medicaid 777 billion and medicare 575 billion over the next decade now these reductions are not unexpected coming from a republican party that has targeted all three programs for decades in fact the 2016 gop platform called for slashing spending in all three areas of the social safety net but candidate trump repeatedly promised to preserve and protect all social security medicare and medicaid throughout 2015 and 2016 as he tweeted on may 7 2015 i was the first only potential gop candidate to state there will be no cuts to social security medicare medicaid that december trump proclaimed so you ve been paying into social security and medicare but we are not going to cut your social security and we re not cutting your medicare by october 2016 trump s lie had become double while he would protect social security medicare and medicaid trump charged that democrat hillary clintonwould savage the programs she wants to knock the hell out of your social security she wants to knock the hell out of your medicare and medicaid and i am going to save them 3 the trump tax plan will pay for itself why is the trump administration looking to gut outlays for those three popular programs in the first place well they already gave all that money and more to the wealthiest americans during his presidential campaign donald trump unveiled not one but three tax plans the clashing often contradictory proposals had one thing in common each was certain to drain trillions in revenue from the united states treasury his first whack at the tax code was estimated to generate a staggering 12 trillion in new red ink with its first decade nevertheless trump s treasury secretary steve mnuchin repeatedly promised the opposite despite more than four decades of experience with the reagan and bush tax cuts as well as the overwhelming consensus of economists mnuchin boasted the tax plan will pay for itself through economic growth the nonpartisan congressional budget office cbo rejected that idea outright in 2015 cbo director keith hall hand picked by the gop leadership said so in no uncertain terms no the evidence is that tax cuts do not pay for themselves and our models that we re doing our macroeconomic effects show that ultimately cbo forecast the tax cuts and jobs act signed by donald trump in december 2017 would deprive uncle sam of 1 5 trillion over the ensuing 10 years even after accounting for faster economic growth and as it turned out in calendar year 2018 federal tax revenue declined by 1 percent from the year before 2 7 percent after inflation this just in tax cuts still don t pay for themselves the idea that the trump tax cut would pay for itself that is generate as much tax revenue as the u s would have without the tax cut was and remains a laffer 4 it s going to cost me a fortune which is actually true when donald trump rolled out his tax program in september 2015 he made a very specific if unverifiable claim trump boasted it s going to cost me a fortune which is actually true even as his proposals mutated into what became the republican tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 trump never wavered in making this claim in september 2017 he reiterated no i don t benefit i think there s very little benefit for people of wealth emphasizing that day that the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan the president put it this way in november 2017 this is going to cost me a fortune this thing believe me mr trump said in the midst of a frequently meandering 45 minute speech to a festive crowd of 1 000 then he invoked senator chuck schumer of new york the democratic leader this is not good for me me it s not so i have some very wealthy friends not so happy with me but that s ok you know i keep hearing schumer this is for the wealthy well if it is my friends don t know about it of course what resulted is exactly what democrats predicted as the new york timessummed it up in august you know who the tax cuts helped rich people the steep corporate tax cut from 35 to 21 percent and the reforms aimed at repatriating overseas income fueled a massive wave of stock buybacks and m a activity according to the center on budget and policy priorities an estimated 70 percent of the benefits from those tax cuts went to the top one fifth of taxpayers with a whopping 34 percent pocketed by the top 1 percent add to that the winnings for owners of s corporations and other pass through businesses and partnerships who gained a 20 deduction in the gop bill among them as his own tax preparer explained is one donald j trump you hold interests as the sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate entities these entities are referred to and do business as the trump organization because you operate these businesses almost exclusively through sole proprietorships and or closely held partnerships your personal federal income tax returns are inordinately large and complex for an individual now we have yet to see individual 1 s tax returns but from what do know of his finances if donald trump has been paying any federal income taxes at all his bill always certainly went down 5 under trump the u s economy will return to 4 percent annual economic growth throughout his campaign candidate donald trump made a very specific pledge about the economy as he put it in september 2016 i believe it s time to establish a national goal of reaching four percent economic growth a year earlier he boasted a trump economy could do even better perhaps hitting six percent yearly gdp growth after his inauguration the white house web site guaranteed a return to 4 percent annual economic growth now there are only a couple of problems with trump s forecast for starters no president of the united states has averaged 4 percent annual gdp growth since lyndon johnson no president named bush hit that mark even once in 12 years worse still the cbo has forecast that starting in 2019 the u s economy will average only around 2 percent growth through 2028 ironically unless the united states experiences a dramatic increase in productivity the only way trump can hit his 4 percent goal is to significantly ramp up immigration in trump s defense gdp expanded by 4 1 percent in the second quarter of 2018 that prompted the president to tell a group of business leaders that the next quarter could be in the fives it wasn t third quarter gdp grew by 3 4 percent while the fourth quarter slipped to 2 6 percent 6 trump promised to eliminate the national debt over a period of 8 years besides breaking his promise to spare social security medicare and medicaid from the chopping block president trump s proposed fy 2020 budget reneges on other campaign pledges as well assuming no recessions and 3 percent gdp growth above cbo s estimate but below the trump 4 percent guarantee over the next decade the new budget blueprint projects the budget won t be balanced for 15 years and that s a problem a problem that is because in march 2016 candidate donald trump pledged to bob woodward eliminate the entire national debt in eight years donald trump we ve got to get rid of the 19 trillion in debt bob woodward how long would that take trump i think i could do it fairly quickly because of the fact the numbers woodward what s fairly quickly trump well i would say over a period of eight years a quick glance back at the numbers shows that trump s commitment was even more preposterous than it sounded at the time the total u s national debt was 19 trillion but cbo was forecasting an additional 9 trillion in new red ink over the following decade as spending 51 trillion would continue to exceed tax revenue 42 trillion that total of 28 trillion would have been made much worse by trump s own tax plan which at that time was forecast to hemorrhage 12 trillion more from the united states treasury to eliminate the entire national debt a president trump would have to cut 40 billion or nearly 80 percent of all federal spending then as now it was literally impossible and if it could be done it would cause an economic cataclysm that would make the financial collapse of 2008 seem like happy days are here again in comparison it s no wonder trump s own budget chief mick mulvaney in april 2017 referred to the debt elimination promise as hyperbole as heather long explained in the washington post even using its own rosy scenarios the trump budget will increase the national debt held by the public by over 50 percent by the end of a second term far from eliminating the debt in 8 years trump s adding a lot of red ink to it 7 we re going to have insurance for everybody once in a rare while fox news reports the truth on jan 23 2019 fox businessoffered this headline us uninsured rate at 4 year high amid trump s obamacare attacks the u s adult uninsured rate climbed to 13 7 percent this past quarter the highest level since the first quarter of 2014 before people were required to buy health insurance as a result of obamacare when the rate skyrocketed to 18 percent that s a 2 8 percentage point increase from the low point in 2016 of 10 9 percent and represents roughly 7 million additional people lacking health insurance for the trump administration this result was a feature not a bug after gutting marketing for the affordable care act ending funding for cost sharing reductions repealing the individual health insurance mandate supporting short term health care plans and enabling new state restrictions on medicaid enrollment president trump guaranteed millions more americans would lose coverage or pay more for the insurance they could get but this turn of events represents a betrayal for candidate trump as he told scott pelley of cbs 60 minutes in september 2015 i am going to take care of everybody as he put in a january 14 2017 interview with the washington post we re going to have insurance for everybody trump said there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can t pay for it you don t get it that s not going to happen with us people covered under the law can expect to have great health care it will be in a much simplified form much less expensive and much better trump is like the reverse mcdonald s of health insurance millions more unserved 8 trump will deport 11 million undocumented immigrants in 18 months to two years after getting stopped in his tracks in his search for funding from congress to get funding for his border wall donald trump is trying again while certain to override a congressional veto of his emergency declaration designed to unconstitutionally redirect some 5 billion toward the wall trump asked for 8 6 billion more in his 2020 budget whether he gets any of it or not president trump long ago gave up one of the promises that drew some of the loudest applause from the maga crowd when it came to the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the united states 85 percent of whom have been here for at least five years trump assured americans he would deport them all and fast how fast as he put it in september 2015 i think it s a process that can take 18 months to two years if properly handled you read that right donald trump promised to kick out 15 000 people every day for two years and that s not all trump also said that he wouldn t build the wall along the southern border he has proposed until all the undocumented immigrants are out i will get them out so fast that your head would spin long before i even can start the wall trump said they will be out of here you know we have tremendous problems of crime 9 we re gonna put the miners back to work we re gonna get those mines open on may 5 2016 donald trump traveled to west virginia where he donned a hard hat and addressed an audience of 10 000 in front of signage reading trump digs coal trump declared i m thinking about the miners all over this country adding we re gonna put the miners back to work we re gonna get those mines open but that s not all he promised if i win we re going to bring those miners back you re going to be so proud of your president for those miners get ready because you re going to be working your asses off candidate trump told the crowd at the end of the rally at a november 2018 rally in west virginia president trump told the state s coal miners you re back in business as it turned out not so much coal mining jobs did increase from 49 500 in october 2016 to 52 800 in february 2019 in 1985 the figure was 175 000 but mining positions actually decreased in kentucky down to roughly 6 380 from 6 550 in the first quarter of 2017 the number of mines and total coal production has continued to plummet as well that grim reality has little to do with government regulation and almost everything to do with the free market the much lower cost of natural gas and the rapidly dropping prices of renewable energy alternatives has coal production on an inexorable downward slope if not for a recent uptick in exports the picture in coal country would be more dire still even with the rollback in regulations by trump s epa the past two years the u s energy information agency projects that u s coal consumption will decline 4 this year to 691 million short tons this will be down 44 since coal s peak usage in 2007 and the lowest amount since 1979 when jimmy carter was president the three mile island nuclear accident occurred and espn was launched american coal production is plummeting while natural gas and renewables soar trump promised to bring back coal jobs the washington post reported in march 2017 adding that promise will not be kept experts say by august 2018 president trump was boasting the coal industry is back he s still lying 10 trade wars are good and easy to win after his immigration crackdown a new hard line on trade was the other centerpiece of donald trump s campaign candidate trump threatened to rip up nafta and to impose 35 percent and 45 percent tariffs on mexico and china respectively if his trade demands were not met the american worker is being crushed and the great american middle class is disappearing trump wrote in a march 2016 op ed due to unfair trade deals and chronic trade deficits as he summed up his approach in march 2018 trade wars are good and easy to win as it turned out not so much the revised nafta deal trump inked with mexico and canada was little different than proposals already in development when barack obama was still in the oval office the ongoing tariff dispute with china has hammered america s farmers and is fueling a sharp increase in farm bankruptcies meanwhile the unresolved trade war is slowing the chinese economy and helping to kill business confidence last year produced the largest american trade deficit on record as bloomberg summed it up earlier this month president donald trump regularly declares that he s winning his trade wars yet evidence is growing that the u s economy is a net loser so far in two separate papers published over the weekend some of the world s leading trade economists declared trump s tariffs to be the most consequential trade experiment seen since the 1930 smoot hawley tariffs blamed for worsening the great depression they also found the initial cost of trump s duties to the u s economy was in the billions and being borne largely by american consumers back on july 24 2018 a confident donald trump tweeted tariffs are the greatest trump also added all will be great promises promises hopefully now that they ve literally

the us dollar ended the week lower against all of the major currencies on the back of softer economic data instead of improving the empire state manufacturing index dropped to a 22 month low in the month of march while industrial production grew less than expected the university of michigan consumer sentiment index increased but the improvement also fell short of expectations in response treasury yields turned lower and the dollar head south the us dollar has been in an uptrend for most of the quarter but as we head into next week s federal reserve meeting investors could send the dollar lower no changes are expected from the us central bank but press conferences follow every meeting this year and chairman powell s comments could hurt more than help the greenback even though there have been more improvements than deterioration in the us economy since the last central bank meeting the fed is in no rush to raise interest rates last week we learned that retail sales increased by only 0 2 in january as payroll growth slowed to 20k in february the housing market has peaked with rising interest rates slowing new and existing home sales growth while manufacturing and service sector activity recovered the us trade deficit hit an all time high most importantly inflation is low with consumer price growth easing to 1 5 from 1 9 in february so even if the central bank finds the uptick in confidence wages economic activity encouraging low inflation gives them the flexibility to hold off tightening until there s signs of consistent strength in the economy when the fed last met the dollar plunged after they removed the reference to further gradual rate increases from their monetary policy statement we don t expect the dollar to crash at this upcoming meeting but we can expect powell to his patient approach on rates which could be enough to encourage profit taking on long dollar positions one of the primary reasons why the dollar outperformed in the first quarter is relative weakness abroad but as some big uncertainties subside money could flow back into riskier currencies and riskier assets britain still doesn t have a brexit deal but at least we know that they won t be spinning out without an agreement slower growth in china has been a big problem for the rest of the world but tax cuts could provide a big boost to the economy the prospect of improvements could make other investments more attractive easing demand for us dollars even as the us economy outperforms in the long run however demand for the greenback should remain strong as the fed remains the only major central bank to raise interest rates this year usd jpy is in an uptrend but if it falls back below 111 we should see a deeper slide towards 110 the bank of japan left interest rates unchanged last week but lowered its export and output assessment in response to terrible trade numbers

remember president donald trump s state of the union addresses last february and in particular in january 2018 amid a wave of teachers strikes can you recall the talking points he elaborated on the need to support public education no well that s because since taking office he s uttered barely a word about our at risk public education system or the sharply waning fiscal support for public higher education which has led to skyrocketing tuitions as well as exacerbated a student debt crisis that is deleterious to the economy overall to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily the sounds of trump s silence on public education are audible to the point of being deafening indeed when in 2018 teachers from west virginia arizona kentucky oklahoma and colorado effectively engaged in mass strikes the likes of which our nation has not witnessed since the 1930s trump said not a word to acknowledge or in any way address both the lagging teacher salaries in those states or the woefully low levels of funding for public education which was also a major impetus behind the teachers mass actions this year has witnessed massive teachers strikes already in denver los angeles and oakland for similar reasons trump s recent proposed budget for 2020 however loudly announces his administration s objective to undermine public education especially public higher education calling for a deep and brutal cut of 7 1 billion dollars the budget of course will not pass but that is not my point here the budget nonetheless reveals trump s priorities and his overall thinking about what constitutes effective and responsible fiscal behavior in terms of what we spend and don t what we view as investment and how best to grow the economy while there are many avenues of analysis to pursue and conclusions to draw from trump s proposed gruesome slashing of the education budget a salient point worth noting and elaborating is what the budget discloses about trump s real goals when it comes to economic development and how trump thinks about the relationship between educational and economic policy in short what we learn from this budget is that trump cares little about educating americans and perhaps most striking for a president who sells himself as expert on the economy and business he cares very little about stimulating and growing the economy to improve the lives and opportunities of americans this fact becomes clear when we think about his proposed education cuts in relation to the now infamous trump tax cuts in both areas the effect of his policies is not to stimulate economic growth but to transfer even more wealth to wealthiest among us take the student debt crisis college debt levels have topped 1 4 trillion and according to many economists constitute a major drag on our economy think about it college graduates saddled with debt are reluctant and frankly unable to purchase a home start a family or create a small business constraining key sectors that drive economic growth and vitality under capitalism such as the housing market and entrepreneurial development according to a study from the levy institute canceling the 1 4 trillion in student debt would spur economic activity to the tune of creating between 1 2 and 1 5 million new jobs in the first few years creating tax paying citizens who buy houses start families create businesses and so forth canceling the debt is a matter of reversing the transference of wealth economic policies such as the trump tax cuts have been orchestrating beginning most intensely in the reagan years as economist marshall steinbaum of the roosevelt institute has noted we shifted the cost of education to individuals and simultaneously required anyone who wanted a job to get a degree and to finance that degree with student debt we ve managed to do is shift the cost of job training from employers to workers while wages stagnated yet the cuts to education trump has proposed only intensify this shift making it even harder to afford college and repay loans here are only a few of the proposed cuts that exemplify this policy the cuts would eliminate public service loan forgiveness and subsidized student loans and streamline income driven repayment programs for student borrowers it would cut the funding of the federal work study program for students by 55 it would reduce spending on student loans by 207 billion over 10 years as a result of higher loan payments and the elimination of subsidized loans and public student loan forgiveness the budget proposal also called for freezing the maximum pell grant award and eliminating the supplemental education opportunity grant another need based aid program a consequence of such cuts given that we know college graduates earn substantially more over a lifetime is that the government would be lose out on the tax revenue it would gain from higher earning taxpayers so much for stimulus these budget choices depress the economy and people too but we saw the same with his tax cut reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and saving corporations some 13 billion in taxes supposedly this windfall was to spur economic growth create more jobs and induce companies to raise wages while treasury secretary steve mnuchin trumpeted that 90 percent of working adults would experience an increase in pay tied directly to the tax cuts in fact only 4 3 percent of workers in fortune 500 companies have received either a one time bonus or an increase in wages businesses have reaped nine times more in tax cuts than what they have passed on to workers and gm still announced massive layoffs last december giving corporations free money does not trickle down or curtail capitalist behavior as trump promised his tax cuts would so for our president ceo

there is a certain trend of opinion amongst the liberal left particularly in the us which never felt very comfortable with the bolivarian revolution now in the midst of a serious and well organised attempt by washington to remove maduro s government they insist on equally blaming both sides for the crisis one which in their view can be resolved through negotiations between the government and the opposition a chief representative of this point of view is gabriel hetland who has written several articles on venezuela for the nation jacobin and other left wing publications his latest article venezuela s deadly blackout highlights the need for a negotiated resolution of the crisis sums up this argument neatly so it is useful to analyse it in some detail the article is full of inaccuracies and half truths but its main flaw is a mistaken analysis of the situation in venezuela one that avoids a class approach to the different forces involved from which hetland derives a completely utopian solution the devil s in the details let s start with some of the factual inaccuracies the caption of the picture illustrating the articles reads people collect water from a leaking pipeline along the guaire river the same line is then used within the article for effect it is false during the blackout there was lack of water supply as a result people resorted to collecting water from springs coming down the avila mountain some of these springs are canalised and then end up in the guaire river people were collecting water from two such springs on the side of the guaire notfrom a leaking pipe water pipes were actually not carrying water this might seem like a small detail but it has a certain importance the headlines in many of the newspapers claimed people were collecting water from the guaire river itself which is extremely polluted el nuevo herald in miami said desperate venezuelans collect rotten water in the midst of blackout the mass media exaggerates and sometimes publishes straight lies in order to fit into a narrative of harrowing crisis in venezuela in order to justify the need for foreign intervention or in any case regime change hetland is not new to this business and should know he needs to check all the details he uses in his story another one in the opening paragraph of his article hetland seeks to draw attention to how bad and long lasting the blackout was he does mention how power was intermittently restored on sunday and monday in parts of caracas and elsewhere but then ends the paragraph with a mention of the new york times headline with the new york times on monday publishing an article titled no end in sight to venezuela s blackout experts warn what s the conclusion he wants the reader to draw that the blackout is far from over in fact we don t know when power will be restored at all there is just a small detail it does not coincide with the facts by midnight 11 march power had been restored in merida zulia and táchira the last remaining states affected by the blackout hetland s article carries the date of 13 march when the blackout was already over and there were only a few smaller towns left affected in paragraph two hetland states the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals of course the lack of power in hospitals is alarming and very dangerous however all hospitals in the country have their own independent power generators that activate in the event of an emergency a report by the opposition aligned ngo médicos por la salud published on 11 march in the evening a list of all 32 of the country s hospitals with a detailed explanation of their situation in all of them their own power plants were working with the exception of one where it was working intermittently heltand then adds to be blunt people are dying and more will die the longer the blackout continues to back up his assertion he links to a reuters report which quotes from medicos por la salud saying that 17 people have died as a result of problems with electricity supply when you then look at the ngo s own report the picture is less clear in the report about the state of hospitals which i quoted above of the 32 hospitals listed all bar two are marked as no deceased and the other two account for a total of three people dead in a separate report by the same ngo about the number of people who died during the blackout 24 are listed but no details are given as to the causes of death so these could be people who would have died regardless of the blackout again this might seem a small detail but details are important because they are what build a story a story can be constructed in two ways one would say hospitals dealt with the blackout by using their own emergency generators which greatly minimised the dangerous impact of lack of electricity the other says the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals to be blunt people are dying and more will die you are more likely to write the second if you rely largely or solely on material from reuters and other such agencies and you are also more likely to stray from the truth what caused the blackout of course heltand s article is built around the blackout and so an explanation of the causes for it should be given what does he tell us about it he starts by saying there are two competing narratives a word i particularly hate but neither he goes on does justice to venezuela s reality in heltand s opinion the blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of maduro nor of the united states and the domestic opposition the urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis but then hetland states that only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government s clear responsibility for the perilous state of venezuela s electric grid and goes on to give as an example the scandal of the tacoma hydro plant a project that was never finished as a result of corruption even here he gets some facts wrong by using a report that is now outdated however the question is how does a non functioning power plant relate to the current blackout everyone government and opposition agrees that something went wrong inside the control centre for the el guri hydro complex the dispute is about what caused the fault the opposition says it was a wildfire under the main high power line out of el guri while the government claims it was a cyber attack affecting the scada system that regulates the plant which produces 80 percent of venezuela s power what is heltand s opinion about this he does not say though he of course mentions the possibility of a cyberattack quoting an article from forbes he does not go into any of the details and his conclusion is clear available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance available evidence perhaps heltand knows more than everyone else because so far neither the government nor the opposition have provided much if any evidence to back up their stories their arguments are mostly based on circumstantial evidence the opposition has not provided any evidence of the mysterious wildfire that they say affected the 765kv power line and then caused the el guri system to shut down which should be relatively simple if such a fire had occurred furthermore guaidó rejected the idea of a cyber attack as he alleged that the el guri hydro complex was controlled analogically something that is a straight lie all of these things are being widely discussed in venezuela with claims and counter claims being made heltand ignores all of this and simply claims that available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage without even mentioning what is this available evidence he bases himself upon or providing any useful links as a reference in fact he has already decided on an explanation that fits his narrative and has written a story that ignores the available evidence just to cover himself after having declared what the cause of the blackout is he adds getting to the bottom of the blackout is important journalists based in venezuela should investigate the possible causes yes mr hetland getting to the bottom of the blackout is important jumpìng to conclusions based on preconceived ideas does not help journalists based in venezuela have already done a very good job of attempting to establish what actually happened and this article in 15 y últimois perhaps one of the best efforts it was published on 11 march two days before hetland s article was published in the nation the path of negotiation however the main problem with heltand s article lies in the conclusions he draws calls for military intervention must be rejected one must recognize however the untenability of the status quo the combination of maduro s repressive and inept rule and debilitating us sanctions has brought venezuela to the edge of catastrophe the longer the situation continues the worse things will get yes on one thing we can certainly agree the situation in venezuela is bad and has significantly worsened over the last four or five years but what is the plausible path for resolving venezuela s crisis that he proposes first of all he accepts the premise that a peaceful transition needs to take place and this must be through free and fair elections here we see how our liberal critic in fact accepts all of the premises of regime change on which us imperialism bases its current assault on venezuela washington too says it is for a peaceful transition and above all for free elections in fact this is precisely what nominally they are trying to achieve with their policy of diplomatic pressure sanctions and the threat of military intervention hetland therefore assumes without explaining why that the presidential elections in 2018 were not free and fair and that therefore maduro is an illegitimate president otherwise why should there be new elections when he was just sworn in in january our liberal friend finds himself firmly in the camp of the venezuelan opposition and us imperialism his disagreement with imperialism seems to be just tactical he does not think that this outcome can or should be achieved through sanctions or military action he seems to will the ends but not the means how does he think this can be achieved then the only real hope for venezuela s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition this is completely utopian and ignores venezuela s recent past in fact over the years there have been many negotiations between the government and the opposition the current attempt by imperialism is not the first already in april 2002 the opposition carried out a us backed coup barely three years into the chavez government when president chavez was returned to power by a mass movement of the poor what did he do he called on the opposition to the negotiating table how did they respond by immediately starting to prepare for another coup this time in the form of the sabotage of the oil industry and a bosses lockout which lasted from december 2002 until february 2003 and nearly crippled the economy the opposition does not want negotiations they want to crush the bolivarian revolution by any means necessary if they think they can achieve this via negotiations they will not object as long as their objectives are guaranteed the most recent attempt at negotiations was the 2016 17 talks in the dominican republic brokered amongst others by the former social democratic president of spain zapatero the main demand of the opposition in those talks was precisely free and fair early presidential elections when it seemed that an agreeable compromise had been reached and even a date for the elections had been fixed then the opposition under pressure from bogotá and washington decided to walk out of the talks zapatero was fuming and he advised the government to go ahead with the elections on the agreed date the election in which a section of the opposition led by henri falcon participated did take place maduro won and zapatero who acted as an observer vouched for the process but all of this appears to be a closed book to hetland and who is the government supposed to negotiate with throughout his article and in other writings hetland insists on establishing a difference between radical sectors of the opposition or sectors of the far right opposition and the opposition as a whole in practice on the ground such a difference does not exist the current coup attempt led in venezuela by guaidó is backed by all the opposition parties represented in the national assembly the 2016 violent riots which hetland mentions in his article were also part of a joint and unitedcampaign by the opposition as a whole the bulk of the opposition under pressure from washington boycotted the presidential election and expelled henri falcón from the mud democratic unity roundtable for taking part in it in any case how are these negotiations going to happen the government has said repeatedly that it is prepared to negotiate even with trump but the opposition has rejected any advances hetland suggests that perhaps the eu s international contact group could make this happen this is either naïve or seriously dangerous the main eu countries are completely subordinate to washington s strategy on venezuela it was spanish president sanchez who issued an eight day ultimatum to maduro to call presidential elections he was then joined by france the uk germany and the majority of eu members who went on to recognise guaidó as the legitimate president of venezuela the icg was only created in order to destroy mexico s independent initiative to find a negotiated solution when the icg representatives arrived in montevideo the uruguayan government under pressure abandoned its independent position and left mexico on its own you cannot have half a revolution to add to hetland s mythical unicorn of a democratic opposition he then adds that once the us is removed from the equation how by whom then we can hope hope springs eternal in the liberal breasts for a growth of a much broader opposition movement one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight this is perhaps the crux of the matter the main problem in hetland s approach is the lack of any discussion of the class nature of this conflict the venezuelan opposition and behind it washington represents the interests of the country s oligarchy the rich and wealthy families that have ruled venezuela for over a 100 years and playing a subordinate role to us imperialism their mass base of support is mainly drawn from the middle class and upper middle class areas in the east of caracas and other major cities chavismo has its roots amongst the working class the poor peasants and the urban poor the opposition supporters have an irrational hatred a primal fear of the chavista masses during the violent opposition rioting in 2016 a young man orlando figuera was burnt alive and died as a result his crime being dark skinned and therefore looking both poor and like a chavista certainly in this opposition the voices of the popular classes have no weight for good reason most of the venezuelan poor and the working class have a healthy class instinct and they reject an opposition that they correctly see as representing los amos del valle the age old oligarchy abiding by the interests of imperialism the maduro government has had a policy of attempting to compromise with and make concessions to the ruling class this has eroded popular support for the bolivarian revolution what progressives need to discuss is the root cause of the crisis in venezuela and on that basis discuss a solution that benefits the country s working people the frightful economic crisis from which venezuela is suffering was triggered in 2014 by the collapse in the price of oil and has been aggravated by some of the government s policy decisions deficit financing paying the foreign debt widespread corruption and us sanctions but its root cause are the well meaning attempts of the bolivarian government to regulate the capitalist economy through price and foreign exchange controls and robust labour and trade union legislation in order to protect the interests of the many this does not work capitalism cannot be regulated if such a thing is attempted capitalists resort to any measures necessary legal or illegal to circumvent such controls establish systems by which they end up benefiting from them foreign currency speculation black marketeering hoarding and generally resort to sabotage investment strikes and capital flight venezuela is a textbook case of this there are therefore only two solutions to the untenable status quo hetland talks about one resolves the crisis in the benefit of the capitalist class and imperialism that is the one advocated by guaidó in his plan país with the backing of the us it involves privatising state owned companies opening up the public sector to private capital and above all opening up the oil industry which is what john bolton demanded this would mean making the poor and workers pay the full price of the crisis that is the opposition s programme and it certainly does not give any weight to the voices of the popular classes the other solution would be based on pursuing genuine revolutionary policies in the benefit of the majority a return to the tasks that chavez announced but left unfinished a socialist economy and a communal state a socialist economy would require the expropriation of the multinationals and the main capitalist groups in venezuela as well as the latifundia in order to create a democratic plan of production under workers control to satisfy the needs of the majority a communal state would imply putting power in the hands of workers committees peasant committees and neighbourhood councils so that the people can rule hetland seems to perceive only a handful of actors in venezuela the us the far right opposition a mythical democratic opposition and the maduro government however there is also a chavista revolutionary movement which is not the same as the government this can be found in the el maizal in organisations like alexis vive in the few remaining experiences of workers control and in the tens of thousands of poor and working class venezuelans who have come out in the last few weeks to oppose imperialist intervention but you will not find it in the pages of the mass media in the us they are in different degrees critical of the maduro government as a whole or at least of some of its worst aspects corruption bureaucracy etc but they know full well that the coming to power of guaidó on the back of an imperialist intervention would be a major disaster what progressives in the us should do is first and foremost oppose the imperialist policies of their government including sanctions and military intervention this should be done not just through writing articles but by organising a mass campaign in the streets and a mass education campaign amongst students and workers that campaign must distance itself from and challenge the main premises that imperialism is using to justify its intervention it does not mean suspending criticism of the maduro government but that criticism should be made from the point of view of the interests of venezuelan workers and peasants not with a view to pleasing liberal academics in the usa of course such a campaign needs to offer an analysis of what has gone wrong in venezuela but that analysis needs to be firmly based on a class perspective not on the utopian idea that eu brokered talks can somehow resolve the conflict between the interests of the venezuelan workers and poor and those of the oligarchy and imperialism the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the venezuelanalysis editorial staff

president trump s 2020 spending proposal has drawn criticism from deficit hawks worried that it fails to balance the budget within a decade but some democrats are promoting a new economic theory that says deficits don t really matter the rationale known as modern monetary theory mmt argues that debt poses much less of a threat than previously thought mosads and while it remains far from the economic mainstream the idea is gaining traction among left wing democrats proposing expensive policies like medicare for all and the green new deal freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y has said mmt should absolutely be part of a conversation on paying for new government programs the theory s main proponent is stephanie kelton who previously served as chief economist of the senate budget committee under ranking member sen bernie sanders i vt she says the conventional wisdom that deficits crowd out private investment lead to higher interest rates and easily spur inflation is largely wrong what s wrong with it is the very simple point that budget deficits augment private savings says kelton now an economics professor at stony brook university whereas economists traditionally argue that a growing debt will weigh down an economy kelton says deficits put more money in people s pockets which in turn spurs growth mossecondads when the government runs a budget deficit it means they re putting more money into the economy than they re taking out she said most congressional democrats including speaker nancy pelosi calif and appropriations committee chairwoman nita lowey n y adhere to conventional wisdom arguing that fiscal responsibility is important pelosi angered some progressives earlier this year by insisting on including pay as you go rules for the new congress while lowey slammed trump s 2020 budget request as irresponsible and dangerous mmt veers outside the mainstream by arguing that instead of issuing debt to pay for deficits the government should print more money terminology kelton chafes at saying it conjures images of weimar germany after world war i and the hyperinflation that it caused the theory also contends that congress and the executive branch should take charge of monetary policy and put in place mechanisms like a federally funded jobs guarantee to automatically adjust deficits based on the economic cycle congress should also determine how best to offset new spending based on the inflationary effects of the policies as opposed to waiting for the federal reserve to react the theory says but that approach would violate the commonly agreed upon tenet that a functional financial system depends on an independent central bank to set monetary policy free of political influence which is one reason why economists have been aghast at president trump for publicly demanding that the fed lower interest rates critics of mmt are many and they have not been shy about speaking out to think that if there s massive inflation that congress and the president will be able to act is completely whacko says marc goldwein policy director at the committee for a responsible federal budget which advocates for lowering the national debt congress seldom manages to even pass spending bills on time and even let funding lapse for five weeks earlier this year he noted former treasury secretary larry summers argued in the washington post this month that the ideas behind mtt were oversimplified and exaggerated by fringe economists who hold them out as offering the proverbial free lunch the ability of the government to spend more without imposing any burden on anyone and nobel prize winning economist paul krugman wrote in the new york times last month that the theory s supporters were messianic in their claims proponents say there is more nuance and that mainstream economists have missed the boat on some of its more accepted premises budget hawks they say have warned about the detrimental effects of high deficits for years rewind the clock 10 years same argument rewind another 10 years same argument this goes all the way back to reagan says kelton both inflation rates and interest rates were higher in the 1990s when the debt was a fraction of what it is today and the budget was balanced kelton also emphasizes that mmt doesn t argue there should be no checks on the deficit whatsoever but that the main concerns about debt should focus on inflation not crowding out investment or high interest rates it s all about the economy s capacity to absorb the new spending she said look at what the republicans just did if all those things that they say were true we would have had to raise taxes all the extremely large deficits run under obama look at what the republicans just did she added referencing the 2017 gop tax cut law that is projected to add 1 9 trillion to the deficit if all those things that they say were true we would have had to raise taxes all the extremely large deficits run under obama goldwein says the evidence that debt leads to higher interest rates is clear but acknowledges that the economy may have more room for debt spending than once thought frankly i am surprised even from 10 years ago that interest rates are so low but it doesn t follow that debt doesn t have an effect he said the global trend toward lower interest rates is not set in stone and having a large pile of debt will be more dangerous when rates spike he argued but even as critics pile on the conversation around mmt and the role of debt is likely to get louder in the run up to the 2020 presidential election kelton said she has advised four declared presidential candidates on her views and two more that are potential white house hopefuls

rights abuses during and after the january 14 16 violent riots involving opposition political activists the army is currently fighting down the deadly havoc of cyclone ida muchinguri is publicity shy and she is not know to love headlines that much for many zimbabweans it is positive that for the first time since independence a woman is in charge of the defence ministry not many people want to follow the daily routines of zdf and not much is expected from any minister that may so occupy the position rating 5 10 3 local government public works and national housing hon july moyo he took the

focus will continue to be on how he will handle the devolution policy rating 7 10 4 foreign affairs and international trade hon sibusiso b moyo has been a very busy man with the re engagement efforts and some of it has been fairly successful the regional diplomatic campaign has been a success with the au and sadc expressing more and more solidarity with zimbabwe reported ill health has affected moyo s efforts but he has been seen in public of late looking fairly good enough for the demanding job while regional powers like south africa and nigeria have been won over the same cannot be said about the world super power the united states having started impressively well with the tory gvt in the uk that relationship was bit shaken after the january riots events bi lateral treaties and mous signed between zimbabwe and countries like china russia botswana south africa and many others are yet to yield the filter down effect to the ordinary person a lot of people are becoming more and more sceptical with phrase mega deals as many heralded mega deals are yet to yield anything from the time ed came into power much is still expected on the diplomatic front rating 6 10 5 public service labour and social welfare hon sekesai nzenza an enthusiastic minister with a lot of zeal and goodwill has had to deal with an underpaid civil service strikes from the education and health sectors restructuring of the civil service the labor front of her portfolio is a huge challenge workers are largely exploited in zimbabwe because they have zero bargaining power in a country with a very high rate of unemployment seen as high demand for labour by employers the social welfare bit of the job is in a mess dealing with the highly politicised civic sector and also eroded pensions for senior citizens nassa and other challenges without resources it is hard to imagine a motivated civil service a productive and happy workforce and a well looked after retired workforce sekai nzenza has enough exposure to first world development and she must know well how to formulate policy goals around her portfolio rating 6 10 6 industry and commerce hon mangaliso ndlovu young and looking intelligent yet not much has been seen from this young man he has been holding a lot of workshops and consultative meetings with industry and recently there were a lot of negotiations over the pricing systems his portfolio is to look after industry and commerce and he relies heavily on what sibusiso moyo achieves in the trade portfolio by way of attracting investment he also relies heavily on other line ministers like mines energy and so on he is more or less in the same catch 22 fix like nzenza rating 5 10 7 home affairs and cultural heritage hon cain mathema we have heard next to nothing on cultural heritage and we haven t heard much on immigration as well it is of course the police force that always highlights this portfolio mathema is not new to politics at all and his predecessors at home affairs were not very popular for obvious reasons by and large the zrp has been spared condemnation during the second republic with most of the blame on alleged brutality going to the zdf we hope mathema will transform the zrp into a professionally run security outfit befitting of our longstanding reputation on the continent rating 5 10 8 higher and tertiary education science and technology development hon professor amon murwira professors do not do always well when taken out of lecture rooms a very intelligent man but lacks the touch that jonathan moyo had in setting up an agenda foe everyone to follow things are administratively quite at the ministry of higher learning yet so much needs to be addressed from welfare of students evaluation of the standards of learning and so on and so forth professor murwira could do well with a bit of media publicity over our higher education system we might not care much what happens at defence but we certainly want to know what our universities and colleges are doing rating 4 10 9 primary and secondary education hon professor paul mavima he has avoided the unfortunate bad publicity that surrounded his bearded predecessor who was

schools rating 5 10 10 lands agriculture water climate and rural resettlement hon air chief marshal perrance shiri he has a large portfolio deputised by two men these are three ministries in one focus

with that phase we also need to know where we stand with food security do we have enough food in the country if yes how much of what if not what do we lack and what are we doing about it shiri does not like the press he is a disciplined soldier and works with action not rhetoric talk or politics we are hoping for the best from him rating 5 10 11 mines and mining development hon winston chitando he is disappointment looks like everyone thinks can run the mines sector the way they want chitando is a technocrat who must understand how best to professionalise and formalise the mining sector a lot is still expected from this young man 4 10 12 energy and power development hon joram gumbo has very little good will from people must have been rested with other old timers has zimbabwe airways

services hon monica mutsvangwa decent lady positive sober and professional monica must focus on dealing with media reforms and she is doing fairly well in that her deputy is out of sorts and must must doing other things like going back to the entertainment industry he is an unwanted distraction in the ministry there is need to improve in terms of being government spokesperson delegated or directly carried that role needs a little more intellectual stamina and mental strength than we are seeing right now maybe the fact that charamba got promoted with his spokesman role is complicating matters

planning and implementation so we do not have the fire in the first place he needs a plan on how to source external resources its easier to get donations for health than any other sector but the minister comes across as a decent fellow who is flat minded rating 3 10 19 justice legal and parliamentary affairs hon ziyambi ziyambi busy political animal good for counter politics with the abrasive

reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 third time lucky may be if at first you don t succeed try and try again and again and again the uk parliament has voted to extend the march 29 exit date but prime minister theresa may is still hoping to railroad lawmakers into approving the eu divorce deal she s negotiated the unpopular agreement has already been heavily rejected twice but prospects of a long delay or even another referendum that may reverse brexit could well swing eurosceptic tories over to her side so a third meaningful vote dubbed mv3 is planned for the coming week if that fails well mv4 is already being touted there is of course no guarantee an exasperated eu will play ball all 27 remaining members have to agree the extension and there are doubts a three month delay will break the deadlock if mv3 fails the eu s march 21 summit will be key first to see if it agrees an extension and second whether it presses britain for a delay of one year or more with the parliamentary votes meaningful or otherwise grabbing the limelight there s probably not much the bank of england can add at its meeting on march 21 it s already said no deal brexit is a bad idea any clarity on its policy intentions is likely only after the manner and timing of brexit becomes evident 2 figure it out boeing president trump has told boeing nyse to figure it out fast that s probably good advice for the company a long standing stock market darling that s lost almost 28 billion or 13 percent of its value since the march 10 ethiopian airlines crash the disaster has prompted country after country into grounding boeing s fleet of 737 max aircraft the model involved in the ethiopian crash and another recent one in indonesia possible links between the accidents have rocked the aviation industry scared passengers worldwide and left the company scrambling to prove the safety of its best selling model that was intended to be the standard for decades before the crash boeing was the seventh most valued stock on the jones but it s fallen to 14th its shares hit record highs just a week before the crash having risen a stunning 52 percent since the end of december they are still up almost 20 percent year to date so what s next moody s reckons boeing will overcome the near term challenges the question for investors is whether the share price slide takes into account the damage to the bottom line and potential legal exposure analysts will be assessing the possible fallout chances are some earnings downgrades will start coming through boeing faces crisis with worldwide grounding of 737 max jetliners boeing 737 max 8 groundings spread around the world boeing shares cheaper but are they a buy 3 pause perfect u s unemployment is plumbing its lowest level in half a century wages are ticking up but the federal reserve meeting on tuesday and wednesday is not poised to snatch away the proverbial punch bowl on wall street at least the fed s dovish 2019 conversion is paying off the is up about 6 percent since the fed s jan 30 meeting signalled it was putting in abeyance a tightening policy that began in 2015 labor shortages notwithstanding the slowing economy is keeping prices in check giving the central bank leeway to stand pat on interest rates after hiking four times in 2018 compared to the fed s 2 percent inflation target producer inflation was up 1 9 percent in the year to february while consumer inflation rose just 1 5 percent to its smallest annual gain in 2 1 2 year the next reading of the fed s preferred inflation measure the core personal consumption expenditures price index is due on march 29 but that gauge rose 1 9 percent year year in december already money markets are building in some easing in 2020 by then the fed should have completed a review of how it manages its policy mandate of keeping prices stable and employment high 4 surprises good and bad it s been a rough old time for europe s economy with momentum steadily waning last year even as the united states powered ahead growth warnings issued by the oecd and the european central bank have rattled investors further this year as they try to assess what kind of toll the euro zone has suffered from trade wars brexit and italian debt concerns but finally there are some signs the nasty surprises are fading citi s well known economic surprise index a gauge showing how much economists have been over or underestimating economic performance compared to what indicators actually deliver now shows a cross over between the euro zone and the united states that means negative surprises from economic indicators in the world s top economy have worsened dramatically in recent weeks euro zone data misses meanwhile have been less bad than previously whether this run continues or not will become evident in coming days first up on tuesday comes germany s zew economic index purchasing manager indexes a crucial forward looking gauge will be released on friday from the united states euro zone and japan 5 searching for meaning to many economists the bank of japan s forecasts have long seemed to be on the optimistic side the key difference in views was the global outlook well the world economy is slowing down and even if japanese companies are awash with cash and no major central bank runs a looser policy than the boj the no 3 economy is still feeling the pinch what s worse inflation encounters less resistance on the downside than it does on the upside so the boj is well and truly in a corner there was little it could do at its march meeting save keeping policy unchanged and tempering its economic outlook predictions but might the boj be forced to resort to further policy easing that question is being asked of the ecb too while central banks elsewhere from australia to the united states may also have to cut rates upcoming data on japan s trade and price growth will help investors determine what happens next policymakers will also be hoping for a resolution soon to the u s china trade dispute the data could intensify the debate on whether the boj s dogged adherence to a 2 percent inflation target means anything finance minister taro aso predicted things could go wrong if the boj hung on to that goal
first a review of last week s events eur usd during the whole week the european currency was pushed up not only by the growth of the euro stoxx 600 index accompanied by the pigeon rhetoric of the ecb head mario draghi but also above all by an optimistic attitude regarding the exit conditions and perhaps not the exit of the uk from the eu as a result the pair re consolidated within the medium term corridor 1 1215 1 1570 in which it has been moving since end october 2018 and even approached its central line reaching a height of 1 1338 on wednesday march 13 thursday march 14 turned out to be the only bad day for the european currency it became known on this day that there would be no meeting of the leaders of the united states and china donald trump and xi jinping in march and it may happen only in april this news again aroused investors interest in the dollar though not for long and the pair could be seen at 1 1345 on friday as for the end of the trading session thanks to a strong university of michigan consumer sentiment index the pair met it 20 points lower at the level of 1 1325 gbp usd most experts expected strengthening of the british currency and its growth in march first to the february high 1 3350 and then 200 points higher this forecast starts to come true last week s high was fixed at the height of 1 3380 and the pair completed the five day marathon in the area of a very strong resistance level of 1 3300 the weekly amplitude of oscillations reached 420 points and if you look at the pair s chart it somehow resembles a cardiogram whose jumps and falls are related to what was happening these days in london the parliament of great britain voted against a repeated referendum and spoke in favor of postponing brexit s deadline to june 30 at the same time the hard exit scenario without a deal with the eu was rejected now prime minister theresa may will have to bow to the european union with a request to postpone brexit but the eu 0reaction to this is another question since all 27 countries of this community should give their consent to this and what will happen with the new agreement is also unclear if the parties could not agree for more than two years what can they do in the next three months usd jpy as most analysts predicted the pair remained within the ascending channel which began at the very beginning of january 2019 and almost reached the bar at 112 00 it stayed only 10 points below this height but the head of the bank of japan haruhiko kuroda managed to halt the fall of his national currency economic performance of japan does not look best the trade deficit is the largest in 6 years and the reduction in exports to china is the highest in 2 years this is partly due to the celebration of the new year in china but the fact remains that japan has suffered greatly from the slowdown in global economic growth the planned increase in sales tax for 2019 does not add optimism either however according to kuroda things are not all that bad at present he said at a press conference on march 15 our main scenario assumes the recovery of the economies of china and the eurozone in the second half of this year and the japanese economy itself remains in moderate expansion and the impulse to achieve the inflation target of 2 remains unchanged cryptocurrencies there is such a famous philosophical paradox called buridan s ass this is a parable of the ancient greek philosopher aristotle and its meaning lies in the problem of choice there is a donkey dying of hunger and it stands exactly in the middle between two absolutely identical heaps of hay which one to choose according to the parable the donkey could not decide and in the end died of hunger there are no donkeys in the cryptocurrency community there are bulls and bears but even they have been roaming along one line for many weeks not knowing which way to go in order to get enough profit the above is a metaphor but the fact that the price of bitcoin has consolidated around 3 900 is a fact it is for the third week that the maximum volatility does not exceed 200 300 points some experts hopefully call this the end of the accumulation phase and the lull before a storm but what is considered a storm as predicted the btc usd pair moved in the 3 850 4 050 corridor last week ethereum eth usd and litecoin ltc usd demonstrated similar modest volatility and it was only ripple xrp usd that showed several spikes although later everything calmed down and returned to normal as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd on the one hand the slowdown in us gdp and the prospects for economic recovery in the eurozone play in favor of the european currency on the other hand trump s threats to launch a new round of economic wars against the eu are causing alarm for the future of the euro as a result most experts 65 believe that the pair will continue to balance in the range of 1 1215 1 1570 at the same time positive information on brexit will contribute to its targeted advancement to the upper boundary of this channel the nearest strong resistance is in the 1 1400 zone the next one is 100 points higher on wednesday march 20 the us federal reserve interest rate decision and the traditional press conference of jerome powell the head of this organization await us there will most likely be no surprises for the first issue and the rate will remain unchanged so far most of the experts 60 believe that its next increase will occur only in september or even later but powell can make adjustments to these forecasts in his speech and then the pair may turn down break down the lower border of the channel 1 1215 and return to the march 7 low 1 1175 about 15 of experts do not even rule the decline of the pair in march april to the area of 1 1000 1 1100 gbp usd on tuesday march 19 and wednesday the 20th a block of macroeconomic data from the uk will be published and on thursday the 21st the decision of the bank of england on the interest rate but all these events are fading compared to the next episode of the series called brexit there will be another vote in the parliament on the deal with the eu on march 20 which will certainly cause the pair to increase its volatility the pair completed the past week in the zone of a very strong resistance level 1 3300 which it has been trying to overcome since last june whether this zone will become a level of support depends on the note on which this meeting of the parliament ends and also what signals will come from the bank of england the next day 70 of analysts supported by 90 of trend indicators and oscillators on d1 are optimistic considering that the pair will be able to rise to the level of 1 3470 the next target is 1 3600 an alternative point of view is supported by 30 of experts according to them the pound has already exhausted its potential and the pair is facing lateral movement in the channel 1 2960 1 3300 support resistance levels are 1 3080 and 1 3200 usd jpy the basic forecast for this pair remains the same 75 of analysts believe that the uptrend will continue the pair will overcome the bar at 112 00 after which it is expected to move in the side channel 112 25 113 70 as it was in last november december the forecast that is drawn by graphical analysis on d1 looks more restrained lateral movement within 111 35 112 70 as for indicators 70 of them both on h4 and d1 are colored green 20 are gray neutral and only 10 are red in the case of a trend reversal support levels are 109 10 110 25 and 110 75 cryptocurrencies if you look at the bitcoin chart you have a bad feeling about another disaster look at the segment from mid july to mid november 2018 gradual decrease in volatility consolidation calm and as a result a drop in quotes by almost 45 from 6 500 to 3 660 and now take a look at the period from mid november to today you see absolutely the same picture a gradual decrease in volatility consolidation calm and as a result but what the result will be is still unknown the crypto market is known for its unpredictability although 70 of specialists vote for the fall of the pair btc usd in spring below 3 000 as for the forecast for the near future it remains unchanged most likely the pair will continue to move along the horizon of 3 900 with quotes spikes by 200 300 points in one direction or another it should be noted that the trading conditions offered by the brokerage company nordfx make it possible to profit intraday even on most minor fluctuations of cryptocurrencies trading takes place on the mt4 and mt5 platforms familiar to traders commissions are minimal and just 100 for mt5 or 300 for mt4 is enough to open a buy or a sell position with a volume of 1 bitcoin 1 lot
greyerz have the ides of march been delayed as the world edges closer to the next crisis today the man who has become legendary for his predictions on qe and historic moves in currencies told king world news that the ides of march may have only been delayed have the ides of march been delayed march 18 king world news egon von greyerz have the ides of march been delayed in 2019 normally the ides of march just means the date march 15th shakespeare made the expression ominous as it was the day that julius caesar was murdered today in 2019 the 29th of march seems more significant than the 15th because on the 29th we first have the conclusion of brexit or maybe we don t brexit has been a torturous process that after 3 years has gone nowhere all it has done is to reveal the eu elite s megalomania as well as their intransigence it has also revealed the complete incompetence of the uk government as well as mrs may s total indecisiveness and her inability to distinguish between activity and achievement listen to the greatest egon von greyerz audio interview ever by clicking here or on the image below sponsored march 29th is also very important in the banking world since it is the date when gold is recognized as a tier 1 asset and thus equal to cash until now gold was only a tier 3 asset and its value was taken at 50 for the purpose of a bank s solvency it is of course totally ridiculous that cash or fiat currencies which we know always go to zero over time should have been taken at twice the value of gold there are people speculating that gold becoming a tier 1 asset will have major significance for the gold price also some market observers even think that this is the beginning of a new era with gold again resuming the mantle of backing currencies or sdrs special drawing rights obviously this would require a substantial revaluation of gold in relation to the dollar in order to achieve sufficient cover for the debt outstanding so shall we beware of the ides of march as shakespeare said and will they be delayed to march 29th in 2019 i doubt it very much even if brexit is a mess that is unlikely to end well and won t be resolved by march 29 also the global debt situation will necessitate a restructuring of the currency system and sadly there are no sdrs or no new government crypto currencies that will make the debt just disappear as the story goes all the king s horses and all the kings men couldn t put humpty back together again but even if the ides of march are not delayed and march 29th does not have a major influence on the world it will serve as a warning of things that are likely to happen in the world financial system desperate debt laden governments will take desperate actions we could easily see a time when the us devalues the dollar significantly or introduces a crypto dollar and backs it with gold at a massively higher price i doubt that the us will succeed in maintaining the hegemony of the dollar in the longer term for a number of reasons first the us is unlikely to be able to prove that they have the 8 000 tonnes of gold that they purport second china and russia would never accept that the debt infested usa is still in control of the world s reserve currency a country with 60 years of real deficits 45 years of trade deficits and at least 200 trillion of debts and unfunded liabilities does not deserve to have the reserve currency of the world the next few years will give us all unlimited opportunities to lose money last week i talked about 3 dozen reasons to buy gold and risks to investors assets at least 99 5 of investors are oblivious to the risks i outlined which is surprising since they will lead to the biggest asset destruction in history but the norm is that maximum bullishness occurs at market peaks the coming decline in all asset markets be it stocks bonds or property will shock investors as they in real terms will lose at least 75 of their assets and probably more than 90 in most cases the 3 dozen financial economic political and geopolitical risks will see to that the problem is that the world is now entering an era when money printing and deficit spending will no longer work it has been an absolute miracle that the world has survived on fake money and fake promises for such a long time but we have now reached the point where it will no longer be possible to fool all of the people all of the time throughout history governments have mismanaged the economy and thus destroyed the people s hard earned money this is the rule rather than the exception there are numerous examples of countries collapsing under their own debt but the best analogy to the world s situation today is the roman empire because of its size during a 500 year period the romans dominated an area both militarily and culturally which included major parts of europe north africa and parts of asia as with all empires the roman one carried the seeds of its own destruction interestingly the world is now at a point when virtually all countries carry these destructive seeds after the fall of the roman empire the dark ages lasted for over 500 years but as opposed to the roman empire the current period of debts deficits and decay encompasses the whole world and is of a magnitude much greater than 2 000 years ago therefore it is likely that the effects of the coming collapse of the world economy could last a very long time just as the term the dark ages was only invented in the 14th century future historians will only know afterwards if the world is now entering a period which will be a return to the dark ages if that will be the case there would be a total destruction of both the financial system and the world economy with all its infrastructure it would also involve wars civil wars a breakdown of society and a fall in population by several billion to most people this clearly sounds like unrealistic scaremongering and a prophecy of doom and gloom of dramatic proportions the intellectual capacity of most human beings doesn t include these complex issues and longer term projections it s much simpler to talk about brexit or trump and his alleged russia connection clearly we hope that these cataclysmic events will not come to pass but what we do know is that the risk is greater than ever in history and just like the dark ages we will only know about it after the event the older generation living today would see the mere beginning of the fall but that can be dramatic enough what is certain is that our children and grandchildren are very unlikely to have the prosperous and peaceful life that most of the world has enjoyed since 1945 it is virtually impossible to prepare for a potential extended downfall but what we can do is to prepare for the short term and protect our investment assets governments have many tricks in their bag to steal the citizens money the easiest way is to debase the currency and this is always what governments have done with superb skill throughout history as the roman empire started to crumble the value of the currency the silver denarius fell rapidly in those days money printing consisted of reducing the silver content of the coin so from almost 90 silver in 180 ad the rulers cheated their people by using less and less silver to coin the denarius by 270 ad around 90 years later the silver coin was both silver less and worthless gradually the roman empire started to crumble and rome had all the expected problems of a state that was living above its means including major deficits and debts in 180 ad cassius wrote our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of iron and rust as did the affairs of the romans that day since the beginning of the 20th century the world has experienced exactly the same thing as the romans did 1 800 years earlier the value of all currencies have declined by 97 to 99 and we will see all the major currencies reaching their intrinsic value of zero in 1949 ludwig von mises wrote there is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion the alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved thus history repeats itself and we are again at the point when the final catastrophe is very near the chart of the denarius almost 2 000 years ago and the statement of cassius are almost identical to the currency chart of the 20th century and the von mises statement plus ça change plus c est la même chose the more it changes the more it s the same thing so this year we should clearly beware of the ides of march even if they are late but it is not enough to be aware we must also take the necessary actions to avoid suffering from the final catastrophe of the currency system involved physical gold is the best means to avoid that catastrophe for those who would like to read more of egon von

distressing news of our poor economic management practices pierced through the hoopla over the just concluded elections the government spent n2 95 trillion on petrol imports last year an almost 50 per cent rise over the 2017 figure and almost one third of the 2018 national budget of n9 1 trillion according to the national bureau of statistics when a country spends most of its revenue importing a product made from a raw material it has in abundance halting the frenzy should be a national emergency in the management of the country s most valuable natural resource successive nigerian governments have demonstrated neither shame nor acumen lacking the essential ingredients of vision and selfless leadership that have elsewhere enabled emerging economies to become champions they have persisted in an unsustainable economic model that depletes resources pauperises nigerians and bewilders the world consider the obvious absurdity the nigerian national petroleum corporation said crude oil production was 2 09 million barrels per day in 2018 which was nine per cent higher than the 1 86 million bpd average in 2017 yet the nbs data shows that the country spent n1 97 trillion on petrol imports in 2017 n1 63 trillion in 2016 and n1 14 trillion in 2015 the n114 3 billion that its four refineries posted as losses in the first 11 months of 2018 would fund 500 primary health centres at the cost of n21 95 million per unit the government could only build 91 units across the country in 2014 15 or two modular refineries or complete the rehabilitation of the lagos ibadan expressway or construct 20 mini micro water works petrol accounted for 22 4 per cent of the country s total import bill in 2018 rising from 20 6 per cent in 2017 18 4 per cent in 2016 and 17 per cent in 2015 this figure excludes subsidy payments and the sums spent importing other refined products for instance of the 6 14 billion litres of refined petroleum products imported in q1 2018 954 47 million litres were automotive gas oil diesel and 66 91 million litres were kerosene the waste is mind boggling and official indifference to it stupefying the minister of state for petroleum resources ibe kachikwu in 2017 put annual spending on petrol imports at 28 billion with 40 per cent of this spent on logistics it is difficult to imagine that though it spent n1 24 trillion importing petrol in 2015 yet instead of radical steps to reverse or reduce it nigeria carries on with the policies that entrap it in such a quagmire this is a reflection of how the country runs its oil and gas sector with the nnpc as its fulcrum its reported loss of n228 1 billion between april and november 2018 is typical perpetually running at a loss with cumulative deficit of n114 3 billion in january november 2018 capacity utilisation in the refineries was zero in some and did not rise beyond 22 per cent in any of the four refineries located in port harcourt warri and kaduna this charade is killing the economy that a monopoly serving a market with an official daily demand of over 60 million litres still manages to run at such huge loss must be a world record not even the provision of 445 000 barrels of crude per day their combined installed capacity at preferential prices to the nnpc to refine or exchange for refined products has been sufficient to transform the refineries into going concerns president muhammadu buhari should drop his obduracy nigeria s economic salvation lies only in privatising and deregulating the oil and gas downstream private capital and competition in crude refining will not materialise until this is done the brave effort by the dangote group through its planned 650 000 barrels per day refinery in lagos state commendable though it is may end up as another monopoly in an operating environment with practically no anti trust legislation a robust regulatory framework targeted incentives in the form of waivers tax holidays and exclusivity periods should replace the fraud ridden cash subsidy regime to marketers and transporters to draw in foreign direct investment in local refineries the world s biggest refining nation the united states has no state owned refinery just as japan and south korea at fifth and sixth positions respectively rely on private sector ingenuity emerging economies too are increasingly turning to refining as new technology transforms the us to top crude oil producer it further cut its imports of nigerian crude by another 43 per cent in 2018 other countries are creatively reforming their energy sectors and optimising resource utilisation qatar petroleum has created the world s biggest liquefied natural gas business reports petroleum economist an online resource while saudi aramco is turning to state of the art downstream projects too adnoc owned by abu dhabi one of the seven emirates that make up the uae has sealed a deal with an italian austrian consortium in privatising its downstream operations china powered its way to the world s second biggest refiner by 2016 and one of its nocs petrochina had once been the world s biggest spender on r d said booz co a consultancy that has since been acquired by the pwc responsible behaviour demands that we stop this reckless practice buhari and the national assembly should seek self sufficiency in domestic refining through market based reforms the nnpc should get its hands off the downstream completely as state participation drives away private capital entrenches inefficiencies and corruption apart from transparent targeted sale of wholesale and retail businesses the railway reforms prepared by the bureau of public enterprises should be dusted off and that sector liberalised as well the state should strictly remain a facilitator of a liberalised operating environment and regulator with the political will the refineries can be sold in a few months but the game changer will be a market environment that can attract fdi and foster a revolution similar to the telecoms makeover copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or

pity the nation whose people are sheep and whose shepherds mislead them pity the nation whose leaders are liars whose sages are silenced and whose bigots haunt the airwaves pity the nation that raises not its voice except to praise conquerors and acclaim the bully as hero and aims to rule the world by force and by torture pity the nation oh pity the people who allow their rights to erode and their freedoms to be washed away lawrence ferlinghetti poet war spending is bankrupting america our nation is being preyed upon by a military industrial complex that is propped up by war profiteers corrupt politicians and foreign governments america has so much to offer creativity ingenuity vast natural resources a rich heritage a beautifully diverse populace a freedom foundation unrivaled anywhere in the world and opportunities galore and yet our birthright is being sold out from under us so that power hungry politicians greedy military contractors and bloodthirsty war hawks can make a hefty profit at our expense don t be fooled into thinking that your hard earned tax dollars are being used for national security and urgent military needs it s all a ruse you know what happens to tax dollars that are left over at the end of the government s fiscal year government agencies including the department of defense go on a use it or lose it spending spree so they can justify asking for money in the next fiscal year we re not talking chump change either we re talking 97 billion worth of wasteful spending according to an investigative report by open the government among the items purchased during the last month of the fiscal year when government agencies go all out to get rid of these use it or lose it funds wexford leather club chair 9 241 china tableware 53 004 alcohol 308 994 golf carts 673 471 musical equipment including pianos tubas and trombones 1 7 million lobster tail and crab 4 6 million iphones and ipads 7 7 million and workout and recreation equipment 9 8 million so much for draining the swamp anyone who suggests that the military needs more money is either criminally clueless or equally corrupt because the military isn t suffering from lack of funding it s suffering from lack of proper oversight where president trump fits into that scenario you decide trump may turn out to be as policy analyst stan collender warned the biggest deficit and debt increasing president of all time rest assured however that if trump gets his way to the tune of a 4 7 trillion budget that digs the nation deeper in debt to foreign creditors adds 750 billion for the military budget and doubles the debt growththat trump once promised to erase the war profiteers and foreign banks who own our debt will be raking in a fortune while america goes belly up this is basic math and the numbers just don t add up as it now stands the u s government is operating in the negative on every front it s spending far more than what it makes and takes from the american taxpayers and it is borrowing heavily from foreign governments and social security to keep the government operating and keep funding its endless wars abroad certainly nothing about the way the government budgets its funds puts america s needs first the nation s educational system is pathetic young people are learning nothing about their freedoms or their government the infrastructure is antiquated and growing more outdated by the day the health system is overpriced and inaccessible to those who need it most the supposedly robust economy is belied by the daily reports of businesses shuttering storefronts and declaring bankruptcy and our so called representative government is a sham if this is a formula for making america great again it s not working the white house wants taxpayers to accept that the only way to reduce the nation s ballooning deficit is by cutting entitlement programs such as social security and medicare yet the glaring economic truth is that at the end of the day it s the military industrial complex and not the sick the elderly or the poor that is pushing america towards bankruptcy we have become a debtor nation and the government is sinking us deeper into debt with every passing day that it allows the military industrial complex to call the shots simply put the government cannot afford to maintain its over extended military empire money is the new 800 pound gorilla remarked a senior administration official involved in afghanistan it shifts the debate from is the strategy working to can we afford this and when you view it that way the scope of the mission that we have now is far far less defensible or as one commentator noted foreclosing the future of our country should not be confused with defending it to be clear the u s government s defense spending is about one thing and one thing only establishing and maintaining a global military empire although the u s constitutes only 5 of the world s population america boasts almost 50 of the world s total military expenditure spending more on the military than the next 19 biggest spending nations combined in fact the pentagon spends more on war than all 50 states combined spend on health education welfare and safety the american military industrial complex has erected an empire unsurpassed in history in its breadth and scope one dedicated to conducting perpetual warfare throughout the earth since 2001 the u s government has spent more than 4 7 trillion waging its endless wars having been co opted by greedy defense contractors corrupt politicians and incompetent government officials america s expanding military empire is bleeding the country dry at a rate of more than 32 million per hour in fact the u s government has spent more money every five seconds in iraq than the average american earns in a year then there s the cost of maintaining and staffing the 1000 plus u s military bases spread around the worldand policing the globe with 1 3 million u s troops stationed in 177 countries over 70 of the countries worldwide future wars and military exercises waged around the globe are expected to push the total bill upwards of 12 trillion by 2053 the u s government is spending money it doesn t have on a military empire it can t afford as investigative journalist uri friedman puts it for more than 15 years now the united states has been fighting terrorism with a credit card essentially bankrolling the wars with debt in the form of purchases of u s treasury bonds by u s based entities like pension funds and state and local governments and by countries like china and japan war is not cheap but it becomes outrageously costly when you factor in government incompetence fraud and greedy contractors as the nation reports for decades the dod s leaders and accountants have been perpetrating a gigantic unconstitutional accounting fraud deliberately cooking the books to mislead the congress and drive the dod s budgets ever higher regardless of military necessity dod has literally been making up numbers in its annual financial reports to congress representing trillions of dollars worth of seemingly nonexistent transactions knowing that congress would rely on those misleading reports when deciding how much money to give the dod the following year for example a leading accounting firm concluded that one of the pentagon s largest agencies can t account for hundreds of millions of dollars worth of spending unfortunately the outlook isn t much better for the spending that can be tracked a government audit found that defense contractor boeing has been massively overcharging taxpayers for mundane parts resulting in tens of millions of dollars in overspending as the report noted the american taxpayer paid 71 for a metal pin that should cost just 4 cents 644 75 for a small gear smaller than a dime that sells for 12 51 more than a 5 100 percent increase in price 1 678 61 for another tiny part also smaller than a dime that could have been bought within dod for 7 71 a 21 000 percent increase 71 01 for a straight thin metal pin that dod had on hand unused by the tens of thousands for 4 cents an increase of over 177 000 percent that price gouging has become an accepted form of corruption within the american military empire is a sad statement on how little control we the people have over our runaway government mind you this isn t just corrupt behavior it s deadly downright immoral behavior the u s government is not making the world any safer it s making the world more dangerous it is estimated that the u s military drops a bomb somewhere in the world every 12 minutes since 9 11 the united states government has directly contributed to the deaths of around 500 000 every one of those deaths was paid for with taxpayer funds the u s government is not making america any safer it s exposing american citizens to alarming levels of blowback a cia term referring to the unintended consequences of the u s government s international activities chalmers johnson a former cia consultant repeatedly warned that america s use of its military to gain power over the global economy would result in devastating blowback those who call the shots in the government those who push the military industrial complex s agenda those who make a killing by embroiling the u s in foreign wars have not heeded johnson s warning the u s government is not making american citizens any safer the repercussions of america s military empire have been deadly not only for those innocent men women and children killed by drone strikes abroad but also those here in the united states the 9 11 attacks were blowback the boston marathon bombing was blowback the attempted times square bomber was blowback the fort hood shooter a major in the u s army was blowback the transformation of america into a battlefield is blowback all of this carnage is being carried out with the full support of the american people or at least with the proxy that is our taxpayer dollars the government is destabilizing the economy destroying the national infrastructure through neglect and a lack of resources and turning taxpayer dollars into blood money with its endless wars drone strikes and mounting death tolls as martin luther king jr recognized under a military empire war and its profiteering will always take precedence over the people s basic human needs similarly president dwight eisenhower warned us not to let the profit driven war machine endanger our liberties or democratic processes every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not clothed this world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of its laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children the cost of one modern heavy bomber is this a modern brick school in more than 30 cities it is two electric power plants each serving a town of 60 000 population it is two fine fully equipped hospitals it is some fifty miles of concrete pavement we pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat we pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8 000 people this is i repeat the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the cloud of threatening war it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron is there no other way the world may live we failed to heed eisenhower s warning the illicit merger of the armaments industry and the government that eisenhower warned against has come to represent perhaps the greatest threat to the nation today it s not sustainable of course eventually inevitably military empires fall and fail by spreading themselves too thin and spending themselves to death it happened in rome it s happening again the america empire is already breaking down we re already witnessing a breakdown of society on virtually every front and the government is ready for years now the government has worked with the military to prepare for widespread civil unrest brought about by economic collapse loss of functioning political and legal order purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency pervasive public health emergencies and catastrophic natural and human disasters for years now the government has been warning against the dangers of domestic terrorism erecting surveillance systems to monitor its own citizens creating classification systems to label any viewpoints that challenge the status quo as extremist and training law enforcement agencies to equate anyone possessing anti government views as a domestic terrorist we re approaching critical mass as long as we the people continue to allow the government to wage its costly meaningless endless wars abroad the american homeland will continue to suffer our roads will crumble our bridges will fail our schools will fall into disrepair our drinking water will become undrinkable our communities will destabilize our economy will tank crime will rise and our freedoms will suffer so who will save us as i make clear in my book battlefield america the war on the american people we d better start saving ourselves one by one neighbor to neighbor through grassroots endeavors by pushing back against the police state where it most counts in our communities first and foremost and by holding fast to what binds us together and not allowing politics and other manufactured nonrealities to tear us apart start today start now do your part literally and figuratively the buck starts and stops with we the people via rutherford
three events next week will shape the investment climate the federal reserve meets and will update its forecasts and guidance the british house of commons may vote for a third time on the withdrawal bill before prime minister may heads of the eu summit to ask for an extension of the uk leaving the eu the eurozone sees the flash march pmi with great hope that the green shoots of spring will be evident fomc there is little chance of a change in policy at the fomc meeting the meeting is important because the fed s verbal communication has changed dramatically since the december projections the fed s thinking about its balance sheet has also evolved often officials make small incremental changes to their forecast but it could be a step function this time that said the fed s view of the economy has probably not changed materially the economy hit a soft patch at the end of last year and early this year as various crosscurrents hit but the underlying fundamentals remain firm financial conditions tightened dramatically but have eased nearly as quickly the s p 500 is up over 12 since the start of the year the federal reserves real broad trade weighted dollar index fell in both january and february to snap an 11 month rally us interest rates remain below q4 18 levels the 10 year note yield was near 3 25 in early november and finished last week below 2 60 for the first time since early january the two year yield closed the week a little above 2 40 it peaked shy of 3 0 four months ago in december the median forecast for growth this year was shaved to 2 3 from 2 5 the median dot for 2020 and 2021 was unrevised at 2 0 and 1 8 respectively like many private sector economists officials will likely recognize that the economic weakness in q1 may be more pronounced than anticipated and could trim their forecasts again growth forecasts need to be understood within the context of what is seen as the long term prospects which are understood as trend growth the range of forecasts in december was 1 7 to 2 2 in september it was 1 7 to 2 1 so the median projection at the end of last year was for a little more than trend growth the new update will put it back into the range a forecast below the range would be understood as a dovish signal of course but the variable lag times even projections of growth in the future years below the range of the long term forecasts would impact the trajectory of policy federal reserve chair powell indicated that he would like to see inflation accelerate before resuming the tightening cycle in december the median forecast for both the headline and core pce deflator was pared to 0 1 to 1 9 and 2 0 respectively the 2020 and 2021 median headline forecast did not change it remained at 2 1 for both years while the median core forecast was slipped 0 1 to 2 0 for both years core inflation readings have been soft and market measures of inflation meanwhile the 10 year breakeven spread between the conventional treasury securities and inflation linked instruments has risen by about 20 bp from late last year to 1 93 the two year breakeven shot up from around 65 bp last december and early january to 1 985 the university of michigan survey of 5 10 year inflation expectations bounced between 2 4 and 2 6 last year and fell to 2 3 in february matching the cyclical low set at the end of 2016 the preliminary march estimate jumped back into the range at 2 5 discussions of the dramatic drop in equities and yields in q4 18 often do not include the collapse in oil prices from around 75 wti and 85 brent in late september early october to 43 and 50 respectively by the end of 2018 both have rallied more than 35 off the lows fed officials also see tighter labor markets this year with the median forecast for the unemployment rate to fall to 3 5 this year it stood at 3 9 in december and last month was at 3 8 in december two of the seventeen officials anticipated that no hikes were necessary this year it is easy to see how the four officials that saw one hike could join the standpat camp eleven fed officials had foreseen the need for two or more rate increases almost evenly divided 6 5 in favor of three it seems unreasonable to expect them all to completely reverse themselves the median forecast will still likely anticipate a hike the market is not there the january 2020 fed funds futures contract implies a 2 30 average effective rate it is currently at 2 40 the fomc statement may not contain detail about its balance sheet plans powell mostly likely will in his remarks and the media will press as well generally speaking the market has understood the fed to say that the balance sheet unwind is likely to be completed this year many expect late q3 or early q4 issues of the duration of the portfolio or how to transition to treasuries may not have been resolved yet the fed s balance sheet was shrinking when the equities rallied in middle quarters of 2018 and when it sold off in q4 18 and rallied in q1 19 making a causal relationship improbable brexit and the eu summit the strongest majority in the uk house of commons was to reject the withdrawal bill negotiated by the tory government and the ec there is only one way it will pass and that is for the alternatives to be perceived as worse may has framed the issue as ultimately a choice between the withdrawal bill leaving with no agreement and not leaving at all the stark choice facing parliament on tuesday is to accept withdrawal bill or put the length of the extension in the ec s hands assuming the house of commons is still not persuaded may will go to the eu summit and admit that the uk is not quite ready to leave thank you she will have to explain why an extension is needed and what the uk will during the extension one would think that if parliament can vote on the same measure three or four times surely a second popular referendum is not some abridgment of democracy even though labour formally endorses a second referendum it largely voted against the very thing last week as did an overwhelming majority the bar to a second referendum still appears high may will not be telling the other heads of state that she needs more time to hold a second referendum nor is she likely to announce snap elections it is not clear what a short delay will accomplish european council president tusk has advocated a longer extension it is not clear what a long delay will accomplish it prolongs the uncertainty for businesses time is not the real problem it is that the uk seems to know what it does not want like immigration and unelected officials in brussel making rules but it does not know what it does want and to the extent it knows what it wants it is to have its cake and eat it too reaping the benefits of a community without any of its subordination of interests the withdrawal bill will likely get more support in the third attempt than it got in the first two many brexiters encouraged by the prime minister will view a long delay as a trojan horse for an eventual reversal the vote will cast as a reenactment of the referendum leave with the withdrawal plan or don t leave one may be forgiven for thinking the third defeat would surely kill the withdrawal bill there may be the fourth incarnation after the european council offers its extension then the final vote on the withdrawal bill can be held at the same time in order to continue to control the process may ceded to parliament the right to debate alternatives such as a norway styled relationship that would still allow the uk full access to the half a billion consumer bloc current volatility suggests a range for sterling next week between roughly 1 30 and 1 36 one week implied volatility finished the week a little below 16 the 100 day moving average is 10 50 putting the current level a little more than two standard deviations above it emu flash pmi the european central bank recently chopped this year s growth forecast by a third to 1 1 from 1 7 and warned that risks were still on the downside did they overreact investors did they panicked in q4 18 driving the dow jones stoxx 600 down around 12 25 and pushing it back up almost 13 so far here in q1 the flash markit march pmis will be reported at the end of the week the composite reading will likely improve for the second consecutive month the composite rose in only three months last year if it did rise in march it would be the first back to back increase since november and december 2017 in february it stood at 51 9 it averaged 52 3 in q4 18 and 54 6 for the whole year the german manufacturing sector has been hit by both domestic diesel engine reliance and foreign slowing of china shocks the manufacturing pmi fell every month last year but july it fell below the 50 boom bust level in january and fell further in february march may be the first increase since last july but it may still be below 50 the same general pattern holds for emu s manufacturing pmi except that it slipped below 50 only in february the eurozone service pmi has fared better as it is less sensitive to the global slowdown and trade disruption it rose six times last year and was unchanged once the service pmi peaked january 2018 at 58 and trended lower to 51 2 in december 2018 and january 2019 it rose to 52 8 in february which matches the q4 18 average it seems to be a bit exaggerated it is the largest gain since february 2016 the euro has retraced the ecb induced losses in full it had finished the night before the ecb meeting a little above 1 1305 and closed last week a touch above 1 1320 on the back of disappointing us industrial production and an unexpected decline in february manufacturing output the euro reached almost 1 1345 its best level since march 4 we anticipate additional gains into the 1 1400 1 1420 area in the coming days with one week volatility a little above 5 the implied range would be around 1 1230 to 1 1430
age 60 address 5310 walker ave occupation attorney political party republican education bachelor of science university of nebraska lincoln and juris doctor university of nebraska college of law website cyndiforthecity com experience lamm a city councilwoman representing northeast lincoln for four years spent time as a homeless teenager in lincoln and graduated from law school here she says personal adversity combined with experiences as a working mother small businessperson attorney and legislator have influenced her perspective why are you running and what do you want to accomplish in office i am running for mayor because i am committed to restoring the people s confidence and trust in city government as mayor i will prioritize transparency we will open the books open new doors and open our minds to what takes our city from good to great a mayor must be responsive to the needs of citizens and businesses alike every stakeholder in this city can be assured that my door will open to everyone with an idea on how we can improve our policies and practices to better serve the people i will work every day to give our citizens a break through meaningful and sustainable tax reform and relief i will continue the work i have already begun to implement policies and standards that open development opportunities reduce land costs and remove barriers to greater economic growth most urgently i will be a mayor committed to fixing our city streets and neighborhood roads that have been neglected for far too long the solutions are there to fix our roads we need a mayor with the will to get it done every candidate includes public safety and streets as their top priorities in lean financial times how would you budget for parks libraries and other city services taxpayers have every right to expect more from government services like public safety road maintenance and repair snow removal and public services these must be top priorities in any budget to maintain a high quality of life regardless of the city s financial health the budget process must become more collaborative as mayor i will bring all stakeholders including the city council to the table early in the process to help prioritize what s important to every corner of the city should voters approve a quarter cent hike in the city sales tax with proceeds earmarked for streets why or why not the funding already exists to fix roads without squeezing taxpayers for more and i will build a road maintenance policy that doesn t constantly require higher taxes the city already charges the highest wheel tax in the state yet less than 3 million of the 19 million generated is spent on residential street maintenance and repair that s why i oppose the quarter cent tax increase and as a member of the city council i opposed placing it on the ballot ensuring that everyone has access to decent housing that they can afford has become a national topic what is your definition of affordable housing what should the city do to encourage or provide for more affordable housing housing affordability is a key component to attracting a young and growing workforce the most important thing city government can do to provide affordable housing is to eliminate the red tape and regulations that make new housing projects more expensive for developers and tenants increasing government influence through subsidies or land trust policies that compete with the private sector are not sustainable ideas for growth instead we must reduce government interference and empower developers to finish projects efficiently and affordably with the rise in home values the city and other local governments could bring in more revenue by not reducing the property tax rate the additional tax revenue coming from the increase in appraised value has been called a windfall how should the city respond a windfall created by higher property valuations is usually bad news for property owners stretched to their limits city spending has been rising faster than revenue for a number of years and it is past time that government learn to take less and live within its means like families and small business owners do instead of using the windfall to irresponsibly increase spending as others have done i would lower the tax rate and let taxpayers keep their hard earned dollars in 2012 the city council passed an ordinance protecting people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation in housing employment and public accommodations a referendum petition stopped the ordinance from going into effect the council has not rescinded the ordinance nor put the issue on the ballot if the state does not pass discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity this session should the city council put the proposed fairness ordinance on the ballot for a citywide vote why or why not discrimination is wrong and everyone deserves to be treated fairly and equally under the law as i have done in my practice as an attorney i share the view of those who supported the referendum petition that there should be a fair discussion among all in our community who would be impacted by the ordinance about whether city government is the appropriate means to implement or enforce these kinds of anti discrimination policies followed by a vote of the people some lincoln residents including members of nebraskans against gun violence believe the city council should pass a safe gun storage ordinance do you think the city should require gun owners to lock up guns in their homes i support freedoms and protections afforded our citizens under the second amendment many in our community maintain a firearm for self defense while we can agree that gun education and safety should be practiced by all city government should not be responsible for arbitrary restrictions that could potentially impede the ability of gun owners to protect themselves their families or their property i will oppose gun storage ordinances that place an undue burden on the constitutional rights of law abiding gun owners the city has banned cardboard from the city landfill and required local haulers to provide curbside recycling service should the city go further by banning other recyclable products paper plastic from the landfill what changes if any would you propose for the recycling program my family chooses to recycle and do our small part to keep materials from the landfill and it s clear the city imposed ban on cardboard has also helped however these mandates create hardships on local businesses and taxpayers are paying more as trash hauler fees increase to keep up with recycling policies i would not make any changes or ban any other recyclables from the traditional stream until the city is ready to absorb the costs of a more substantial program what role should the city take in planning and paying for bike paths on streets or wider sidewalks and bike trails separate paths for bikes and walkers bike trails add to the quality of life in our city and undoubtedly help us compete for the next generation of university students and workforce talent while government focuses on basic priorities i believe there is a real opportunity to build partnerships with major employers developers and community leaders to sponsor improvement projects like these we should allow for more ownership from these stakeholders in a bike trail plan that could help them attract and retain people in our city is climate change real and what are its likely causes does the city have any role in trying to help curb climate change every person wants clean air to breathe and clean water to drink and should work to be a good steward of our environment regardless of an individual s personal belief on climate change the solutions generally proposed are incredibly complex and expensive calling for participation and leadership on a larger scale as mayor i will prioritize the immediate needs of our taxpayers and businesses first and work with state and federal leaders to ensure our voice is heard on these issues winter weather has created an abundance of potholes do you think the city does enough to address the problem is there anything it should change the pothole problem has grown worse over time and i believe the entire process must change from prioritization of funding to materials we use to decision making and planning as mayor i will make sure wheel tax revenue is directed to street maintenance where it belongs i will make sure we re using high quality materials for joint sealing and repairs and i will change the process and protocols so decisions can be made in real time for the safety of our citizens
while local school districts continue to jettison staff over rising pension and health care costs the real winner in the equation appears to not be students teachers or taxpayers but private equity firms carlisle area school district s board will vote in the coming weeks on a proposal to cut the remaining teachers aides that are directly employed by the district and offer to re hire them through education solutions services a private staffing company flat levels of state assistance have combined with rising pension and health costs carlisle self funded health plan ran 1 7 million in the red last year according to the district to put school districts in a tough spot taking employees off the district s payroll and placing them with ess instead means aides don t have to be offered the same retirement and health care that teachers receive but not all the savings are going toward the district s bottom line ess is owned at least in part by nautic partners a private equity firm while it s true that ess offers to cut school districts overhead costs nautic s webpage for its portfolio of outsourced services investments offers a much different mission with a tagline that reads profit by a wider margin ess did not respond to requests for comment the privatization of school services such as buses food service janitorial and now teaching assistants isn t a new phenomenon but the sector is increasingly being occupied by large investment groups who see a chance to take a healthy return off the top of the windfall savings realized when districts outsource and cut benefits at the end of the day it doesn t come out of the pockets of any entity other than the workers themselves said mark price a labor economist with the keystone research institute and a critic of public school privatization in pennsylvania the danger is not only do you end up paying workers less you end up paying more in profits to these firms in the long run price said health costs but districts like carlisle say they ultimately have no choice shifting employees to private contractors is the only way to get out of pension and health requirements that districts cannot afford the cost structure is just unsustainable under the current conditions said shawn farr the district s director of finance it forces our hand it s not like we want to contract out these employees even if the additional outsourcing for aides is approved carlisle schools are still looking at a 3 million budget gap assuming no other changes with 84 3 million in revenues to cover 87 3 million in expenses the district s primary means of revenue is property tax but this can t be increased beyond the state s act 1 index which caps tax hikes at a rate determined by consumer prices and real estate markets for the 2019 20 budget year that cap is 3 percent or about 1 3 million in new revenue according to farr s calculations this means that tax hikes alone are an unsustainable revenue model given that health insurance premiums increased 15 percent this year alone and will go up another 14 percent in the next budget year according to farr the district is self insured maintaining its own pool of money through south central trust that pays out medical claims but in the 2017 18 fiscal year those claims exceeded premiums by 1 7 million the driver isn t doctors visits per se farr said its prescription drugs particularly school district employees who require medicine that is proprietary giving pharmaceutical companies the power to dictate cost free of competition the district insures roughly 550 employees farr said which adds up to about 1 200 people when one includes spouses and children for employees who have chosen family coverage this patient base required about 10 000 prescriptions last year at a total cost of over 1 6 million a 35 percent increase from the prior year versus a 19 percent increase for nonpharmaceutical medical claims the vast majority of prescriptions were incredibly cheap farr said about 1 million or 61 percent of the total prescription cost was incurred by just 147 prescriptions farr said the prescription drug costs are out of control farr said the rest of the medical expenses are still going up but there s more competition controlling that with some of the prescriptions we re really at the mercy of the pharmaceutical companies staff the savings from outsourcing employees is entirely on the benefits side as opposed to wages carlisle school district can set the rate of pay for the positions it fills through ess farr said and the current proposed pay schedule anticipates that all but four of the 67 aides expected to be outsourced will see an increase in their daily pay rate the scale varies between 80 and 100 per day for a 6 5 hour work day since 2017 the district has hired new aides and support staff through ess but 83 aides hired prior to that many with decades of experience are still on the district s payroll this number is expected to drop to 67 through attrition by the start of the 2019 20 school year farr said but the district still expects to save about 600 000 by transferring the remaining 67 employees or almost 9 000 per aide per year put simply it s because the health plan offered through ess is much worse even if we get a little bit over what we re making now we re still losing money in the long term said leslie paine and aide in mount holly springs paine said she expects to lose about 3 000 per year in insurance costs if her job is outsourced from the district to ess s payrolls based on the insurance plan being provided to staff who have been hired under ess that s only if i don t go to the doctor at all or if i don t need any prescriptions that s because the insurance through ess is less than par it s not worth having paine said the health plan paine and other aides have referenced a copy of which was provided to the sentinel charges employees on a weekly basis for one of two schedules of benefits which have a daily dollar limit and a yearly limit on the number of days that can be used under the least expensive plan employees pay 24 48 weekly for an individual or up 83 40 for a family that plan for instance pays up to 25 per day for prescription drugs and only pays out a maximum of seven days per year ess did not respond to request for information regarding its health plan or other employment practices ess the company appears to be one of the largest school staffing companies in the united states and is based out of tennessee in july 2017 ess merged with source4teachers another educational staffing company that was financed by nautic partners the combined operation is now listed as source4solutions llc on nautic s portfolio page the combined company will serve nearly 300 districts across 10 states and employ approximately 40 000 educational professionals and 230 corporate staff members according to nautic s 2017 press release that release also stated that ess was founded in 2016 by the same management group that partnered with nautic on gca services group a janitorial staffing firm specializing in schools nautic sold gca to the blackstone group in 2012 it s impossible to tell what exactly a private equity firm s return on investment on a school outsourcing company is but ess s current contract with carlisle schools for newer aides and staff includes a 31 percent premium on pay farr said if the district specifies a given aide s pay at 100 per day farr said it pays ess 131 with that 31 going toward ess s corporate management costs and profit margin while this may seem like a lot of taxpayer dollars going out the door it s a smaller margin than the district would be paying in benefits if it didn t outsource the state s pension requirements alone cost 34 cents on every dollar of employee pay farr said meaning that ess s take is still smaller than the state pension system even before one includes the medical side in this way pennsylvania by delaying the amortization of new benefits during the 2000s and causing the current pension cost balloon has inadvertently pushed taxpayer dollars out of the hands of the state s public employees and into the hands of out of state outsourcing firms i sympathize with the districts price said part of what s driving this trend is that the state has not done it s fair share in funding education outsourcing while the outsourcing trend has hit teachers aides hard only in the past few years schools have been outsourcing for decades often starting with bus services in 2012 price co authored a study on bus outsourcing by pennsylvania school districts which found that while bus outsourcing may save money short term it rapidly becomes less efficient as time goes on school districts that spent a greater proportion of their transportation budget on outsourced services per state education budget data analyzed by price had greater per pupil transportation costs and those costs continued to climb at an equal or greater rate throughout the study period of 1986 to 2008 compared to districts whose outsourcing was proportionally lower using these efficiency rates and factoring in the relative impact of school district population density and wealth the average district s transportation costs would be about 13 percent lower if it moved from 68 percent of its transit services being contracted out the average outsourcing rate during the study period to a fully in house model data on outsourcing for nontransportation services is scarce in 2008 a paper published through the education policy research institute at arizona state university and the education and public interest center at the university of colorado boulder said the most commonly cited data was generated by groups that were either explicitly pro or anti privatization but the lack of empirical data is unlikely to slow the growth of privatization the authors found one issue with the privatization and outsourcing debate is that while short term savings for school districts are easy to model long term harm is more difficult to predict this is especially so when one views outsourcing through the lens of the local economy as a whole while the school district may be paying less for a given service thus reducing its burden on local taxpayers a greater proportion of the cost that remains is being bled off to in the case of ess its corporate management in tennessee and its capital ownership in rhode island put another way although the school may be paying more by keeping services in house that value stays entirely local in the form of higher wages better health benefits and greater retirement equity for locally based employees contract an analysis from daphne greenwood at the university of colorado colorado springs cited the link between outsourcing and the decline of sustainable middle class jobs as well as heightened public benefits use in certain sectors a 2010 study for instance found that outsourced school cafeteria workers in california used an average of 1 743 per year in welfare benefits while no such data appears to exist for pennsylvania use of public benefits is explicitly part of ess s model according to school administrators namely because of state labor statutes public schools cannot lay off aides over the summer instead they are furloughed with a guarantee of being offered work again in the fall and thus do not qualify for unemployment benefits this is not a requirement for private contractors in fact claiming unemployment over the summer through ess is an explicit part of the transition deal that carlisle schools would present to their remaining aides if the board votes for outsourcing farr said big spring school district also uses ess for a number of services including outsourced aides although unlike carlisle aides were not required to switch to ess and some are still on the district s payroll according to superintendent rich fry those who stayed in the district s direct employment fry said were aides with 10 or more years experience who had higher pay rates and worked enough hours to qualify for benefits less experienced aides who worked 5 5 hour shifts tended to voluntarily go to ess fry said those aides weren t working enough hours to qualify for benefits fry said meaning that summer unemployment checks were the only outstanding difference and was a significant incentive to be employed under the outsourcing company rather than the district big spring inked a four year contract with ess fry said with ess committing to keeping its costs under a 1 percent per year increase this could go up when the contract is re negotiated price s study and others identified issues with outsourcing companies low balling their initial terms but fry said that for pennsylvania schools in recent years rate increases by private contractors are less than health insurance hikes and the pension rates foisted on the districts by the state further the districts can plan for these in multiyear contracts with vendors like ess it still pales in comparison to the cost increases from pension and health care fry said
we re all faced with a series of balancing acts trade offs confronting us include labor vs leisure saving vs spending and calories vs calisthenics these calibrations have been taken to new depths of detail by an explosion of data and apps that analyze it smart watches can now nag you to relax rebalance your portfolio and restrain your appetite central banks also face a balancing act as they try to modulate growth and inflation during the last decade that balancing act has centered on balance sheets as quantitative easing qe programs have gained prominence because there is no history that conclusively illustrates the effects of qe on economic outcomes calibrating monetary policy is more difficult in this realm at the federal reserve s meeting next week it is expected to announce changes to its balance sheet strategy while esoteric to some this topic has been top of mind for the financial markets handling its balance sheet well and communicating strategy effectively will be among the fed s biggest tasks this year the fed s balance sheet used to be pretty boring it was small and grew slowly over time in concert with the american economy that changed when crisis era programs and quantitative easing were implemented by the beginning of 2014 the fed s balance sheet was five times larger than it had been in 2008 under qe the fed purchased treasury and mortgage backed securities in an effort to bring down long term interest rates in so doing they sought to make it costly for investors to become too risk averse qe was a departure for the fed which is reluctant to own too many government securities it gives the appearance of monetizing deficits which runs counter to fed independence the separation of the fed from the department of the treasury was formalized more than 60 years ago studies of the effectiveness of qe in the united states have produced mixed results as you might imagine the need to control for the multitude of factors that affect interest rates makes isolating the impact of the program tricky in aggregate the program is estimated to have lowered long term interest rates by about 1 5 but successive phases of the effort are thought to have had diminishing influence in 2014 the fed stopped adding to the balance sheet confident in the durability of the u s economic expansion and in the middle of 2017 plans for reducing the balance sheet were announced at the time the fed earned high marks for the design of the retreat and the manner in which it was communicated a formulaic approach was employed to give investors clarity janet yellen fed chair at the time indicated uncertainty would be minimized by implementing a high bar for changes to the schedule phrases like watching paint dry or autopilot were used to describe the process at the time the new normal for the fed s balance sheet seemed a long way off respondents to a survey taken by the federal reserve bank of new york in january of 2018 expected the balance sheet to settle in somewhere around 3 trillion a 30 reduction from its peak on the fed s schedule it would have taken several years to reach that level a key determinant of the new steady state is the level of reserves that banks choose to hold prior to the crisis banks were able to manage reserves down to negligible levels since then a new range of requirements has led banks to keep more liquidity on hand reserves held with the fed are the most liquid assets one can own other than cash and receive favorable treatment when bank capital is measured in the middle of last year signs of reserve scarcity began to emerge in the markets for overnight funding forcing the fed to alter some of its short term rate setting those frictions seemed to intensify as 2018 drew to a close even though the fed s balance sheet had declined by less than 15 from its highest point a strategy re think seemed warranted but officials vowed publicly to press on this along with other fourth quarter phenomena led to a modest tightening of financial conditions market participants assumed that if qe lowered interest rates a reversal of qe would have the opposite effect using simple math they calculated a retreat to 3 trillion would be the equivalent of two or three interest rate hikes there was concern that economic activity was not strong enough to withstand tightening on this scale the validity of this calculation can certainly be questioned but the perception that the fed was overdoing it took root among some market participants to pacify them monetary officials have been conducting an increasingly public review of balance sheet policy and changes to that policy are imminent several elements of the updated strategy will be worth watching the equilibrium size of the balance sheet is certainly one of them a level of around 3 5 trillion is now forecast by the new york fed survey the fed is also likely to shift away from mortgage backed bonds and into treasury securities with shorter term treasuries taking a more prominent role these moves would be designed to steepen the yield curve and provide the fed with flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances the fed hopes to return to a set it and forget it approach to balance sheet management but that luxury will probably prove elusive with no history to guide it and an explosion of data to analyze regular calibration will probably be required and there is no app for that results not guaranteed trade surpluses and deficits are not intrinsically good or bad in a global economy each nation exports the goods and services for which it has an advantage and imports what it cannot efficiently produce in every year since 1976 the u s has run a deficit in goods a gap that merits closer scrutiny now because of the actions the u s has taken to change the terms of trade a year has passed since the administration proclaimed significant tariffs covering steel and aluminum several tranches of tariffs on chinese imports followed the goal of these actions was to support domestic production but results so far demonstrate a different outcome last year the u s trade deficit in goods reached a new depth with the u s importing over 891 billion more than it exported imports rose by 8 6 from 2017 to 2018 exports also increased but did not keep pace growing only 7 6 for the full year tariffs are a simple construct when a tariffed good reaches the border the importer must pay a tax before border agents will allow it to enter the country money flows from the domestic agent who ordered the good to the coffers of the country that imposed the tariff any notion that tariffs are making exporting countries pay into the u s treasury is a misstatement the presence of a tariff may not result in a higher price to consumers the foreign exporter may offer to reduce prices to remain competitive the importer can similarly try to absorb the tariff cost into its profit margins but the capacity of either entity to eat the new cost is limited if the importer chooses to increase prices domestic producers have a decision to make the tariff could allow domestic providers to sell their wares at a lower price than their import competition and gain market share however if domestic producers have been struggling to profitably compete with the importer s previously low prices it is more likely they will raise their prices to match the elevated cost of imports thereby padding their profits in the end buyers find a market that has not structurally changed but now features higher prices over the long run capital could be redirected to support domestic investment that avoids tariffs but in the near term tariffs simply increase the cost of existing supply chains and drive higher inflation the persistence of u s trade deficits is partly the byproduct of something positive buoyant demand for products resulting from outperformance of the u s economy the last time the trade gap significantly narrowed was in 2008 2009 as u s consumers and businesses slowed their spending and investment we do not encourage a recession as a remedy our trade imbalance is also a natural outcome of trade between a country that saves heavily and one that saves little china embraces a culture of saving whereas the united states has a stronger tradition of consumerism this is a natural recipe for the former having a trade surplus with the latter the chinese preference for saving and the american preference for consumption are structural differences that will take a long time to converge while we support the economic consensus that tariffs are inefficient we don t deny the unfair trade practices that have led to current tensions many of today s trade discussions were necessary and overdue to their credit tariffs have been effective at bringing world leaders to the table for broad discussion but tariffs alone cannot correct trade imbalances dovish turn last week the european central bank ecb conceded the region s deteriorating economic prospects and acknowledged rising external risks to respond the ecb extended the forward guidance of no hikes through the end of 2019 and announced a third series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii the tltros are one of the ecb s non standard monetary policy operations that provide cheap finance to eurozone banks even during adverse market conditions their objective is to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy by lowering banks marginal funding costs and stimulate lending to the real economy past tltros aided the region s struggling banks helping banks to maintain access to ample liquidity at low costs the tltro iii operations will be conducted starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 offering funding with two year maturities the timing is important the first maturities of the 722 billion of long term loans granted in past ecb actions will start to come due in june 2020 the ecb s net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement mandates that banks have a certain amount of funding with a maturity of at least one year without tltro iii banks would have been forced to find alternative and likely higher cost sources of funding to keep their nsfrs in compliance italian banks have recently struggled to access capital markets owing to volatile government bond yields italian banks along with their spanish counterparts have been major beneficiaries of preceding editions of tltros and are likely to benefit the most from the new round though precise details are still forthcoming the new program would likely be aimed at prolonging existing liquidity support rather than providing a significant amount of additional stimulus the eurozone economy today is in relatively better shape than at the onset of the debt crisis or even in 2016 when tltros rate cuts and asset purchases were deployed to combat deflation risks should further downside risks materialize the ecb would need to creatively use its weapons to fight the slowdown the toolkit is not exactly robust we therefore concur with ecb president mario draghi s conclusion that the central bank must try to be proactive rather than reactive in its actions
trump is on an impossible mission tariffs will not reduce the trade deficit and will likely make matters worse to fully understand trump s trade dilemma consider the following chart trump s current account and trade deficit problem in one picture identity government saving private saving exports imports the identity is not debatable but it is misunderstood exports and imports are not just about trade one must factor in capital thus my annotation about foreign direct investment for the government saving component pencil in deficits in excess of 1 trillion dollars for five years projected deficits vs projected increase in debt for more details please see my post projected us budget deficit lie in four pictures the important point as relates to this article is the increase in debt is the true deficit this happens because the projected deficit does not include all of the amount owed to the social security trust fund that amount is called off budget but when the calendar year rolls over the difference magically appears on the balance sheet as actual debt trump tax cuts regardless of what you think of them the trump tax cuts unaccompanied by spending cuts dramatically increased deficits that money has to come from somewhere tariffs not the answer tump s tweet is absurd in theory and practice the deficit has risen since trump went on his tariff man binge options increased consumer saving fewer consumer purchases increased business saving lower capital spending increase in the trade deficit increase in direct us investment from abroad those are the options capital flows dwarf trade flows i bounced some ideas off michael pettis at china financial markets he responded capital flows have grown so much that investment flows wholly overwhelm trade flows a s a result one country s trade imbalances with another can easily be the consequence of capital flows created by distortions originating elsewhere current account balance vs trade balance thus the increased fiscal deficit does not guarantee an increased trade deficit analyzing mexico pettis added this important point tariffs on foreign goods don t necessarily reduce the trade deficit in fact they may actually increase them if they make foreigners more eager to invest in the us he explains why in mexico s positive impact on the u s trade balance contrary to what one might first expect mexico s role in global trade is actually beneficial to the united states while restricting mexican imports will reduce the american deficit with mexico it will increase the overall american deficit nixon closed the gold window note that these imbalances started after nixon closed the gold window pettis comments on the gold window i suspect that the ballooning of the inflows and the closing of the gold window may have been the consequence of the same processes my basic view of the relevant history is that at some point in the very late 1800s and early 1900s advanced economies mainly the uk but also western europe and even the us had reached the stage economists had never considered in which investment was no longer constrained by the scarcity of savings income levels were high leading to plenty of available savings and there was so much existing capital stock john hobson in the uk and charles arthur conant in the us were probably the first to notice this and discuss the implications but the destruction wrought by two world wars changed all of that by destroying savings by destroying wealth and creating new investment needs by destroying infrastructure and manufacturing capacity however by the late 1960s and early 1970s much of the advanced world had been substantially rebuilt returning us to the condition of excess savings excess savings i am not a subscriber to the excess saving theory rather i believe that governments and central banks have so distorted money it is difficult to know what the pool of real savings is in the traditional sense savings production consumption printing money does not constitute saving it constitutes distortions that have benefited the banks and wealthy at the expense of the middle class and poor that s a debate for another time meanwhile i greatly appreciate as always discussion from michael pettits in my estimation he is the world s leading authority on trade he will have a new book out shortly and i look forward to reviewing it meanwhile it is safe to conclude trump is on a mission impossible path that cannot possibly work at least as he expects recession a means to the goal note the recession bars in the top image then ponder my recent post trump again threatens europe with tariffs expect instant global recession if trump succeeds in reducing the trade deficit with his policies he s highly likely to cause a global recession in the process
slowing economy might sting california budget despite gov newsom s restrained approach show caption hide caption california scraps plan to build high speed railroad california governor gavin newsom is abandoning plans to build a high speed railroad between los angeles and san francisco saying the ambitious project that was approved by voters and championed by his predecessor is too costly time gov gavin newsom s first budget proposal unveiled two months ago took a surprisingly conservative approach given his promises of high dollar spending during his campaign for the governorship while he proposed token appropriations to expand health insurance for the poor and pre kindergarten care and education his 2019 20 budget would devote most of the state s hefty surpluses to reserves one time expenditures and paying down debt it was in brief just the sort of cautious budget that outgoing gov jerry brown would have presented along with his annual warning that recession may be just around the corner newsom said his goal was a structurally balanced budget over the next four years but the budget s own economic forecast sees slowing growth and warns that risks are rising in the weeks since newsom released his budget we ve seen several indications that california s economy which has been booming for the better part of a decade and generating many billions of extra dollars in state revenue may in fact be slowing there s been a marked slowdown in the state s once red hot housing market for example and while unemployment remains at historic low levels just 4 2 percent in january job creation also seems to be slowing in part because employers are having difficulty finding enough qualified workers as it solicited bids for a new bond issue recently the treasurer s office listed 12 economic and budget risks facing the state including a threat of recession uncertain international trade policies and the budget s ever increasing reliance on income taxes from a handful of wealthy californians and their investment earnings when brown began his second stint as governor in 2011 personal income taxes provided 53 percent of the state s general fund revenue but as newsom succeeds brown income taxes account for 71 percent and half of them are paid by just 1 percent of the state s taxpayers thanks not only to overall economic gains but also to higher tax rates on the wealthy which brown championed the proportion of taxes coming from capital gains a major income source for the one percenters has doubled from 4 8 percent to 9 7 percent despite his advocacy for those tax increases brown repeatedly warned that relying so much on high income taxpayers creates higher levels of revenue volatility that bite hard during economic downturns during the great recession california saw its general fund revenue drop by about 20 percent with most of that decline stemming from reductions in taxable income among the state s wealthiest residents is california beginning to feel that bite again state controller betty yee reported this month that two thirds through the 2018 19 fiscal year revenue is running several billion dollars under assumptions because of lower than expected income tax payments it could reflect a slowing economy a sharp drop in the stock market late last year and or high income taxpayers adjusting to changes in federal tax law particularly a 10 000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes the latter is an incentive for those with income flexibility such as the ability to defer capital gains to minimize their state tax exposure all of these indicators could be just temporary blips or the harbinger of a downward trend that could undermine newsom s hopes of having a balanced budget throughout his first term tellingly the legislature s budget office advises lawmakers in a recent budget overview that building more reserves than proposed by the governor would be prudent however newsom s fellow democrats in the legislature would like to save less and spend more particularly on expensive entitlements such as health care and early childhood education calmatters is a public interest journalism venture committed to explaining how california s state capitol works and why it matters for more stories by dan walters go to calmatters org commentary

sector of the stock market every day today is thursday march 14 and we re talking energy and industrials i m your host nick sciple and today i m joined by motley fool contributor jason hall via skype how are you doing jason jason hall i am fantastic it s good to be back on it s been a little while i think this is the longest gap in shows that i ve had in a little while it s good to hear your voice sciple yeah jason we haven t chatted since around the new year it s good to catch up with you we ve got a lot of news this week we re going to give our listeners a preview on how to handle their taxes as we approach the dreaded tax day april 15 and we re going to talk about some of our favorite yieldcos these are companies we ve talked about a lot on the show and some of our listeners had asked us to talk about some of our favorites so we re going to do that but first boeing is in the news this week there was a second tragic crash of the 737 max aircraft on sunday that occurred in ethiopia shortly after takeoff tragically killing all the passengers on board the pilot had cited issues with the plane s controls leading up to the crash in the ensuing aftermath the 737 max has now been grounded by boeing following a large number of groundings from countries as diverse as the u s china and india shares of boeing are down nearly 12 this week on the news jason how should investors be approaching this uncertainty around boeing and this latest tragedy from this airplane hall first obviously this is tragic what s happened you think about these kinds of things two planes crashing on the other side of the world we actually have a colleague who had a friend who was killed on this latest crash it kind of comes home a little bit when that kind of thing happens looking at it just as dispassionately as possible frankly i don t see this as a catalyst for investors that are value hunting to try to look at this as a great opportunity to buy boeing if you think about this from a pure valuation perspective boeing shares were pretty much at their all time high in late february so not too long before all this happened this stock was at its all time high if you go back to christmas eve the low point for stocks over the past decade really shares are still up 27 we re talking less than three months boeing shares are up 27 still that s after losing what 15 from the high i don t think we re talking about a stock that i would necessarily be running out to buy on this like it s really cheap right now if you think about it from a pure earnings valuation perspective right now shares trade for almost exactly 21 times trailing earnings i d say that s probably fair value for boeing with no overhang like the 737 max potentially represents it was trading for 25 times earnings three weeks ago if you look at it in the aerospace industry look at it for defense contractors usually that s the two areas where it makes a living it s an expensive stock and it generally always is because it executes so well now thinking about it from the longer term perspective if this is a stock that you bought six months ago three months ago five weeks ago i can t say that i think this is really a catalyst to necessarily sell one of our colleagues adam levine weinberg who writes a lot about airlines and the aerospace industry pointed out really well just a couple of days ago that the 737 max airlines don t really have any other alternatives the airbus a320 is the other similar narrow body aircraft that airlines are buying that s similar to the 737 max they have a backlog that s like five years at their maximum output capacity which is like 750 planes a year they can t build anymore it s not like airlines that are lined up for the 737 max have somewhere else they can go to buy jets that they need for their operations the other thing too you go back not too long ago four or five years ago the 787 dreamliner i don t know if you remember nick the lithium ion battery problems they had the fleet was grounded these lithium ion batteries were catching on fire on the planes obviously i don t want to compare that situation to two jets that have crashed and killed hundreds of people but it was a severe concern that planes would spontaneously catch on fire in the air it was quickly corrected that 787 has been a very successful plane i think over the long term boeing is going to address this they re going to get it taken care of the business should be fine i just don t see this as a catalyst to necessarily jump in and buy or even to sell as far as that goes sciple yeah jason i agree with you completely there it s kind of a wait and see position here the 737 max the numbers that i ve seen are that that aircraft represented nearly a third of boeing s profits boeing had been expecting the 737 max to make up maybe 90 of its deliveries in 2019 so of course in the near term that s a really significant cloud over the stock as we see how boeing can resolve the safety issues with the plane if course if this ends up being something they can fix over the air with the software update it could be just a little bit of a speed bump for the company but if this is something mechanical and you have to do a full redesign that can really weigh on earnings for a long period of time but really when you look at the company over the long term as you mentioned jason when we look at these large passenger aircrafts it s really a global duopoly between boeing and airbus that dynamic is not going to change based on this recent news as you said we ll have to see how the 737 max safety concern gets shaken out over the next weeks and months that s going to be definitely a near term cloud over the stock but the global environment for aircraft is still bullish over the long term and the competitive environment hasn t been changed significantly by this any thoughts before we move on jason hall no i agree i agree 100 sciple awesome well jason now i want to talk a little bit about before we get into our discussion on yieldcos we ve gotten a couple of listener questions about schedule k 1 taxes we ve spent a decent amount of time on this show in the past six months talking about mlp companies and companies that might pay this type of income that can complicate your taxes when you own an mlp business jason first off for listeners who aren t familiar can you talk about what schedule k 1 is and when it might apply to you as an investor hall the best way to describe it is a pain in the butt complex tax form that has lots of individual lines that you have to input if you do your taxes yourself and you itemize your deductions you have to input each of these individual fields into your tax software to properly calculate what your tax obligation is mlps master limited partnerships are commonly called a pass through entity they don t pay corporate income taxes because they re not a corporation it s a partnership you as a unitholder which is mlp speak for shareholder are a partner in it that means that you get a share of the earnings that it passes through here s where it can get tricky if you have multiple mlps that you own and here s the key thing these are dividend stocks these are stocks that you buy because they re cash flow efficient because they don t have the tax impact they can pass through an outsized amount of cash flows they typically pay pretty high yields generally 5 and above and in some cases well above 5 that s what makes them attractive as an investor you re generally going to end up paying a little bit of a higher tax rate sometimes your tax rate on the distributions that you get is regular earnings so they don t always qualify for that long term capital gains tax rate that s 15 for most people it s 20 for some people you may pay a higher effective tax rate on the income you get from them than you do from regular c corps and real estate investment trusts so that s one of the things it s more complex to fill out the taxes and file and you can end up paying a higher tax rate now here s the other part of it too this is really really important if you re investing inside a retirement vehicle so if you can buy individual stocks in a 401 k if you have a roth ira or traditional ira that you re buying shares in if you own mlps inside those accounts you could end up having to pay taxes on the dividends that you get because of a rule something called ubti it s unrelated business taxable income some of the distributions paid by a lot of master limited partnerships qualify for ubti the threshold s pretty high you have to earn more than 1 000 in a year from all of the mlps that you own in all your accounts so let s say you have a roth ira and a traditional ira and you have some mlps in both you have to add it all together and if you exceed 1 000 in ubti in a year earned inside those retirement accounts then you may have to pay taxes on it that s an additional complexity that it adds that s why in a lot of cases for most investors sometimes it s better to just avoid owning a limited partnership now i will say this this is something really interesting the brookfield family of limited partnerships they explicitly say in their frequently asked questions on the taxes section that their mlps are generally fine for american investors and canadian investors to own in their retirement accounts because they don t pay ubti the caveat with a couple of them is that they do have some revolving credit instruments that they have available to be able to use that are kind of a last resort credit instrument they have if they tap those it could generate ubti but in general they don t i personally own two of the brookfield mlps inside my 401 k so i feel pretty confident that there s not going to be any tax implications from those companies but in general the schedule k 1 is just kind of a pain in the butt document because it adds complexity especially if you do your taxes yourself it s going to add probably a half an hour of time plugging these individual lines in maybe an hour if you own three or four of them plugging all that into your tax form every year if you pay somebody to do it they might want a little more money if you re giving them k 1s but in short that s pretty much it sciple right basically because a partnership is a pass through entity and you re the owner of the partnership and the income of the partnership s getting passed through to you it has to be accounted for through the schedule k 1 in the same way your income say from dividends might be in a 1099 it s a special form to cover that it adds extra complexity it s also one of those forms that s notoriously one of the last to come in so if you re a person who likes to get your taxes done early it s something to be aware of make sure you have all those forms in it s not to say that you shouldn t invest into a company that s going to give you a schedule k 1 just know what you re getting into particularly when it comes to tax season it s going to be a little bit extra effort jason let s move on to our main topic today we re going to talk about some of our favorite yieldcos the inspiration for this came from a question from our listener cam kane on twitter he asked us to do a show diving into the american yieldcos terraform power pattern energy nextera energy and brookfield renewable partners before we dive into those businesses jason for our listeners who may not be familiar with what a yieldco is can you talk about what exactly a yieldco is and how it fits into the tapestry of the global energy market hall in short yieldco is a little bit of a catch all term traditionally what a yieldco is it s really a vehicle to fund these large utility scale energy projects primarily renewables think about solar and wind projects to be able to develop these big projects and then to monetize the production of the power that they sell and make money on the cash flows generally the way it works is a yieldco would be sponsored by either a project developer for example pattern energy came to be because of pattern development which is a privately held renewable energy primarily wind energy project developer for a number of years they actually share the same ceo it was a vehicle to use the capital markets to develop and monetize these big projects then you have nextera energy partners which is sponsored by nextera energy which is one the biggest utilities in the united states and the biggest renewable energy utility in the u s you ve got brookfield renewable and its almost subsidiary terraform power brookfield renewable owns almost 70 of it they re sponsored by brookfield asset management which is one of the world s biggest infrastructure real estate asset developers in the world so when somebody says yieldco it s an energy producer that is sponsored by some big asset developer or utility company the thesis for investors is yield it s right there in the name you re going to make money from the dividends or distributions that they pay out they typically take on a lot of debt to build out these projects but the debt is typically at fixed terms over very long periods of time then they sell the power from their wind or solar assets or nextera energy for example owns a lot of natural gas distribution resource assets then they sell those things on these really long term contracts like 20 25 years they make money on the difference between their operating and their debt costs and the cash so you can get these really good predictable long term dividends that s the thesis and that s what makes them really interesting to investors sciple as we were prepping for the show you had mentioned some macro trends as we see energy shift over toward more renewables and the cost of each individual unit of new electricity company regresses more toward zero over time the role yieldcos play as the middleman between these power companies puts them in an attractive position do you want to talk a little bit about that thesis for our listeners and how that fits in hall it s interesting you think about you re a big utility southern company or duke energy or one of these big guys why would you want to go to a middleman to buy power it seems like it doesn t make sense to do that the reality is if you re a utility and you need more power than you re able to produce from your existing assets especially if you re a regulated monopoly a power producer you don t just go contract a builder to build you a coal or natural gas or a wind plant it s not that easy typically you have to get approval from your regulator which is often the state because you have to pay for that which means you re going to have to take on debt which is going to mean incremental expense which means that you re going to have to go to ratepayers to sometimes increase your rates there s all these steps that you have to go through furthermore there s been some utilities that have really had some serious debacles over the past few years with these big projects that they ve tried to develop and just haven t panned out ratepayers are on the hook for something that has failed so if you re a utility and you need to add a little bit of incremental power being able to tap a terraform power to buy a certain amount of electricity is a great way to be able to do it because you can meet that incremental need without having to add capital expense add leverage which means adding additional risk for your shareholders and not have to go through the process of getting approval from your regulator to do all those things so it s really a great situation for these independent producers these yieldcos to be able to fill a need that really really supports the utility s ability to provide low cost especially renewable energy to the ratepayers now one thing that you brought up that s really important you want to talk about the accelerated depreciation that s another big issue for the utilities i think that s another thing that s really important sciple sure as the cost of renewables have come down over time it makes these existing assets like coal and things like that the value of those assets are reduced over time when you install these new renewables once they re physically in place they re going to continue producing energy at a marginal cost that s much lower than each incremental bit of energy you have to produce via coal plants as that happens over time and those plants become less economical those have to be written down by utilities over time which creates additional pressure on the business from the ability to put more cash to work to expand and transition their power assets jason i m kind of rambling here a little bit hall no no it does i think the key part of it is the incremental cost think about especially wind and solar is coming down quickly too but especially wind it s cheaper for a utility in many cases to buy wind from a pattern energy than it is to continue to fire a 40 year old coal plant in terms of per unit energy production costs they have this old asset that s too expensive it costs them more to maintain and use that asset than it might be to buy incremental power from one of the yieldcos and they have to write off the value of that old asset it has a negative impact on their books if they try to replace it by accelerating the depreciation of it it s another way that renewables and these yieldcos are really disrupting the utility industry but at the same time they re providing the utilities with what they need to address the disruption that s happening sciple right they operate in this nice little space where they re not subject to the regulation that existing utilities have to deal with when you talk about having to negotiate increases in rates as well as they re not limited by these existing assets that put pressure on the ability for these yieldcos to allocate their capital in the best way they could let s talk about some of these yieldcos that we think investors should be paying attention to the first one i want to talk about is brookfield renewable partners matt dilallo and i spoke about this company at some length on a recent episode when you look at brookfield renewable most of their assets are hydroelectric assets they ve been moving more recently into wind and solar what do you like about brookfield renewable partners as a yieldco for investors to take a look at hall one thing that jumps out at me and stock has bounced back but over the past year the stock price continued to fell pretty steeply and it really pushed the yield up because of the way that the folks at brookfield tend to run their businesses they really have a long term focus they think about these assets and what can they generate over a five year period over a 10 year period and longer they don t get caught up in managing to the quarter to quarter wall street mentality one thing that brookfield renewable has done a lot over the past year year and a half is they ve done a lot of what they call asset rotation asset recycling they take assets that they don t really project that asset s ability to grow cash flows at the rate that they want to generate the kind of returns that they want if they can yield a good premium by selling that asset they ll sell it then they take the capital the proceeds and then they re going to hunt and they re going to find the next opportunity to redeploy that capital into assets they re going to generate higher returns than what they just sold the short term impact of that is it might be a quarter it might be multiple quarters when they don t redeploy that capital and you see a short term impact on cash flows but in the long term it absolutely always pays off because these guys are so good at being disciplined and then finding the next thing to buy they sell something that might generate 2 3 year on year cash flow growth and they buy something that s going to generate upper single digits maybe even lower double digit year on year cash flow growth they re really good at that and often when they sell an asset they can get a really good multiple on the cash flow yield of that asset then when they buy they often pay a lower multiple than what they realized to generate that cash they re just really really good at capital allocation the second thing that they re really good at is once they own these infrastructure assets in this case we re talking about power assets they re really good at standardizing and making sure that they wring all the costs out that they can to maximize the cash flows and maximize the output of these things for example one of brookfield renewable s great sources of cash flow is from terraform power i think it owns like 69 of terraform power they helped provide a large cash injection that allowed terraform to buy this big spanish renewable energy producer that increased terraform s cash flow something like 40 year on year they also helped push this initiative for terraform power to sign a deal with ge to take over maintaining their north american wind fleet that s going to reduce the cost of maintaining their wind turbines in north america by like 10 these things flow right to the bottom line if you re looking for a steady solid buy it and forget about it high yield stock i mean i love brookfield renewable for that then you think about its ability to grow brookfield renewable forecasts between 5 and 9 year on year long term growth of the dividend payout the ability to grow that dividend regularly by growing cash flows over the long term makes this a great buy and hold reinvest those dividends stock i m just a huge huge fan of most of the brookfield entities brookfield renewable especially right now sciple right brookfield renewable if you look over its history it s delivered a 15 total annual return obviously that takes into account that dividend but if you can compound your wealth at 15 particularly as we look at the way the trends have to move when it comes to renewables over time there s going to be real opportunities for them you talked about their asset recycling 2018 was really a period in which brookfield renewable was going through that in a really significant way they ve opened up a lot of liquidity on their balance sheet to allow them to start redeploying capital to drive new investments and continue to drive returns they have over 2 billion in liquidity on their balance sheet they ve been able to have their debt structured in such a way that they don t have any maturities for the next four or five years so they can really start deploying their liquidity to grow the business as you mentioned the track record of management to continue to allocate capital in a prudent way and drive returns for shareholders in a really attractive way to get exposure to renewables i will say a lot of folks will see that they have a large portion of their assets in hydroelectric power and maybe it s not as exciting as wind and solar but those assets can give you a really dependable return over time we ve talked in the past jason and i about the issues that you can have with matching supply and demand from an energy point of view with solar and wind you avoid those issues with hydroelectric power i really like the way they ve allocated their assets i like their track record i like that they have a strong history of prior returns it s a really great business to look at and put in your portfolio and be able to sleep at night pretty well jason you mentioned terraform power that s the second yieldco i d like for us to talk about you mentioned brookfield renewable and brookfield asset management together the brookfield family took a majority interest in terraform power back in 2017 bought it away from sunedison when they were in bankruptcy this is another instance as we mentioned of brookfield being able to buy assets at attractive valuations talk about an asset you can buy out of bankruptcy rarely do you see better valuations than that they ve really been able to as you mentioned pump cash into the business to allow it to continue to grow when you look at terraform power ticker terp as an opportunity separate and apart from brookfield renewable what advantages does terraform power have vs brookfield renewable when it comes to an investment to differentiate between the two and which do you find more attractive today hall one thing is going back to the whole schedule k 1 thing brookfield renewable partners is a limited partnership you get the k 1 i address the fact that the brookfield partnerships tell you that you can own them in a retirement account i personally do so i don t have any concern about it but if you do have any issues and there s a lot of cases where you re buying in a taxable account again you may have to pay the higher tax rate there s more complication especially if you re dealing with a larger portfolio and you may own a multitude terraform power is not a limited partnership it s just a regular old corporation it pays out qualified dividends you get your 1099 it s a lot cleaner it s a lot easier that s just a nice thing to know in terms of the thesis it s a wind and solar play it really is that s where their assets are the dividend yield s a little bit lower i think it yields around 6 or so right now brookfield renewable yields something like 6 4 so there s around a 7 premium yield you get from brookfield renewable today that can change pretty quickly over a few trading days but in general brookfield renewable has paid a higher yield that s part of the exchange for the higher taxes lower taxes go into terraform power i think in terms of pure growth from here terraform power is a little smaller so there s a little bit more potential to grow its asset base i think brookfield renewable has prioritized giving it the tools to be able to grow its per share cash flows you have to remember brookfield renewable based on what it s paid to buy its stake in terraform it gets a cash on cash yield of like 11 or 12 based on what it paid for its stake it s getting a very high rate of return as terraform power is able to grow its dividend there s a lot of incentive for brookfield to grow terraform power because of its ability to grow that cash on cash yield as a shareholder you re very aligned with the majority owner of terraform power i think that s a really really powerful advantage that terraform power has to be a market beating dividend growth investment right now i really really like terraform power a lot sciple again the brookfield relationship really gives you reassurances that they re going to be managed in a prudent way if they need capital that relationship with brookfield asset management gives them access to capital at attractive rates things like that definitely an interesting opportunity particularly if you want the brookfield relationship but more of a pure play on wind and solar vs brookfield renewable which is going to get you more of that hydro exposure i personally like that but different investors may have different preferences let s move on and talk about pattern energy group this is a another yieldco focusing primarily on wind and solar this is a company that has been among one of the highest yielding stocks on the stock market over the past year or so they ve had some issues continuing to finance their dividend the number i saw is they paid out 99 of their available cash flow last year as dividends really want to bring that number down as you look at pattern energy group what stands out to you what should investors be paying attention to hall that s the big thing it paid out basically all of its cash flows last year to cover its dividend if you go back to the end of 2017 the company had increased its dividend every single quarter sequentially every single quarter it had been able to increase its dividend since going public it had to halt that increase because of the fact that its cash flows stopped growing part of the federal tax legislation that was passed little over a year ago now one of the things that changed was i don t want to get into the weeds too much but essentially it affected the pool of debt that was available to develop these wind and solar projects the ability to share in some losses that were beneficial for highly profitable organizations to invest in these projects to be able to offset their earnings and reduce their tax exposure factor in that and also interest rates haven t gone up over the past year it s just been harder to get a lot of these projects financed at the same time pattern s largest wind project is in puerto rico it was a long time that those wind turbines just sat there not producing any cash flow at all because they couldn t be connected to the grid because the grid was basically down so that took a bite out of its cash flows for much of the year prior and created this situation where the dividend had to be frozen where it was it wasn t cut it was just frozen where it was but there was a lot of concern and the stock was shorted pretty heavily because of this expectation that the dividend was going to get cut over the past year michael garland is the ceo he s also the ceo of pattern development that s the privately held project developer that sponsored pattern energy he followed the brookfield model a little bit they did some asset rotation they sold off a couple of projects that they weren t necessarily getting the best cash on cash yields from they were a little more expensive for them to operate because they geographically weren t located in the same area that they tended to operate in they sold off those assets and they ve been steadily redeploying that and it s starting to pay off their cash flows increased double digits this year which is good because if they didn t increase their dividend would have cost more than their cash flows they were able to avoid having to cut the dividend by reallocating and rejiggering their portfolio of assets the company just did something that i think is really interesting with their most recent earnings they actually outlay their guidance for the next two years and explained how they re going to be able to get to that targeted 80 payout ratio meaning that it will take about 80 of their cash flows to cover their dividend giving them a 20 buffer that two year guidance broke out between asset rotations and their ability to tap some of the other liquidity tools that they would be able to grow their cash flows 20 over the next two years mostly in 2020 some second half of 2019 but mostly in 2020 and how they would be able to accomplish that without having to sell stock to fund any of those capital projects that s important with the dividend yield still being close to 8 it s hard to generate per share cash flow growth when you re going to be essentially paying 8 to come up with the cash to do it so this is definitely higher on the risk reward side the potential reward is you get a yield that s a good 20 higher than most of the other yieldcos if you re willing to take on the risk that management can t pull off what they re saying they re going to be able to do to build a little bit of a gap to make their cash flows a little bit more secure in terms of protecting the dividend i think the worst case scenario is they make a really bad investment decision into something that they can t bring online and their expenses go up while their cash flows don t grow and they end up having to cut the dividend because something happened on the way to the coliseum as the show says it s just risk reward if you don t want to take on that risk and you want to guarantee the predictable income pattern energy is not the way for you to go look at brookfield look at nextera energy partners which we ll talk about in a second but if you want to play that risk reward pattern s worth a look sciple yeah jason when you look at the issues that they re facing trying to get that payout ratio down the plan that they ve laid out you follow this business closer than me what kind of track record does this management have when it comes to handling these types of issues when you look at the return opportunity here vs the risk would you be buying shares today how do you feel about the business give a little context for that hall of all of these yieldcos my largest personal stake is in pattern energy i ve been a relatively aggressive buyer over the past year year and a half primarily because i m 42 i m not looking for income to pay for my retirement today this is not a source of income that i need today i have a long term thesis if the worst case happens and they have to cut the dividend and it costs me in the next two or three years it s not going to affect me personally even if that happens i think a decade from now it would still work out to be a profitable investment again it depends on your individual situation as an investor if you re retired close to retiring or you re looking to buy this to count on income today and you really couldn t afford it if they had to cut the dividend that would be a big hit to you then it probably wouldn t be the right stock to buy but if you re thinking for the long term and you re still working today and this is part of a retirement plan for 20 or more years from now i absolutely could see somebody making a call so the biggest reason why i feel that way is because i have a lot of faith in michael garland the ceo and the team that he has around him he s been developing renewable projects for something like 30 years now he has a long track record of success he s familiar with the government side the regulatory side again he s very well aligned as the ceo of pattern development the development company and the ceo of pattern energy the yieldco you have alignment in management there and i think that s really important again you look at what they did over the past year selling off assets it s going to sound like exactly what we just said about brookfield renewable they sold assets at a higher yield multiple than what they paid when they redeployed that capital into new assets when you have a management that has a clear record of being able to get a better premium when they sell something than they pay when they buy something i think you can feel pretty confident that you have a management team that s really disciplined when it comes to managing capital sciple definitely an interesting opportunity for investors to look at particularly with this high yield and the near term questions the long term opportunity is certainly there the last yieldco i want to talk about today is nextera energy partners ticker nep you mentioned earlier nextera energy partners is servicing the energy projects led by nextera energy which is the world s largest publicly traded utility by market cap and has the country s largest renewable energy backlog obviously a great relationship to have for nextera energy partners when you look at this yieldco investment what stands out to you hall the partnership is great for nextera energy partners there s no doubt about that you think about florida which is nextera energy s primary market the population s booming there s huge demand for renewable energy it really has the partnership in a great position to be able to grow i think that one of the more aggressive plans is to grow their dividend payout they re projecting a double digit dividend growth at 12 to 15 annual growth over the next four or five years that s a much more aggressive growth rate for the dividend considering it only yields around 4 you re not getting the bigger payout that you get but its ability to grow that payout is pretty good that makes it really attractive again for investors looking for that long term ability to be able to grow the payout to grow your returns that way it s really interesting sciple right when you see the way they ve been acquiring their assets really novel financing they entered a convertible equity funding agreement with kkr which is a large private equity firm through that kkr paid 900 million for an equity interest in this portfolio of renewable assets that nextera energy partners created after they bought some assets that dropped down from the nextera energy parent company when you see this financing they re partnering up with a private equity company to monetize their existing assets what advantages does this financing structure give to nextera energy partners with that liquidity what might they use that for going forward hall i got a message on linkedin from a reader about an unrelated company with a somewhat similar question in his case he s asking about share issuance for a particular company i think the key thing about it is this is no different from selling stock or raising debt or using internal cash flows what it really boils down to is what is your rate of return this is just another tool that management has in its tool belt of capital to be able to use the reality is one of the reasons nextera energy partners dividend yield is low is you pay a higher cash flow premium to buy nextera energy partners because it has a really good track record of growing those cash flows and growing them on a per share basis management has a really good track record of getting very high rates of return i think this is just another way to do that i don t think it s necessarily fundamentally a great big deal it s just another creative way to leverage the best rate of return that they can get on wherever they get their capital from sciple sure the other question mark floating around nextera energy partners has been their relationship with pg e management was really open with this on their last call almost a quarter of the partnerships cash flow available for distribution is exposed to pg e in one way or another management has stuck by its guidance that even despite these near term issues related to the pg e bankruptcy they still expect to achieve its 12 to 15 growth in distributions through 2023 as we look at the complications that might be added by this pg e bankruptcy to nextera energy partners is that anything that investors should be concerned about or management has said they re going to still meet their targets so stay the course hall i think you have to be cognizant of it to some extent and this isn t the only yieldco with exposure to that pattern energy very early in the year mid january the ceo wrote a letter to shareholders addressing the same concern because they have a couple of wind farms that sell power on long term contracts to pg e too the reality is you have to remember that with pg e its liabilities because of all of the recent wildfires are its biggest issue it s going to continue to need to buy power it s going to continue to need to produce power unless somehow the terms of some of these deals are just onerous and a bankruptcy judge says this deal needs to get cut by 30 and i don t think that s the case i think these deals are probably pretty competitive and they re pretty reasonable i think the bigger risk is if any of these deals to buy power are a sweetheart deal and nextera energy partners is getting way too much cash flow from them that s one thing i think it probably feels like a bigger concern than it really is i think over the long term it s not going to really cause any issues sciple right they re not going to turn the power off in california because pg e went bankrupt i sure hope they don t for you jason i d like the lights to stay on in the in the hall household over there when you re looking at nextera energy partners like you said that partnership with nextera energy really powerful for them a really good customer to have opportunities for growth maybe some near term concerns with pg e but still an attractive opportunity the market recognizes that that s why it only yields 4 vs pattern energy that s had some near term concerns and its yield got bid up for that reason another interesting yieldco for folks to look at to wrap everything up jason as you look at these opportunities in the yieldco space is there any of these that specifically you think would be most attractive for investors today obviously different portfolios have different needs but for the general investor if you only had to buy one what would you be most excited about buying today hall if you could only buy one of these companies no matter your situation i would say terraform power that s the one i would suggest you re going to get a solid yield it reduces any potential risks of weirdness with your taxes so it s nice and clean and easy and i think it has a tremendous pathway to growth and to grow the dividend you re getting a nice strong yield right off the bat today terraform power would be the one i d suggest across the board sciple sure can t go wrong there jason i think i would probably lean a little bit more toward the brookfield renewable you get that exposure to terraform power but you also get those hydroelectric assets which i think is really interesting jason thanks for coming on the show sharing with our investors this really interesting space to get exposure to renewables in a way that you really can sleep at night and get some dependable cash flow definitely something for our listeners to pay attention to thanks for coming on jason hall absolutely i think five years from now you and i both are going to be proven right for our recommendations sciple fingers crossed we ll circle back in five years hall perfect sciple as always people on the program may own companies discussed on the show and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks discussed so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear thanks to austin morgan for all his work behind the glass for jason hall i m nick sciple thanks for listening and fool on check out the latest earnings call transcripts for the companies we

this is the first in a three part mini symposium on wages unemployment and underemployment presented by the conversation and the academy of the social sciences in australia read the other pieces in the series here the long debate over the causes of wage stagnation took an unexpected turn last week when finance minister matthias cormann described downward flexibility in the rate of wage growth as a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture it was a position that was endorsed in a flurry of confusion 16 seconds after it had been rejected by defence industry minister linda reynolds cormann had said policies aimed at pushing wages up could cause massive spikes in unemployment the ease with which reynolds was trapped into at first rejecting and then accepting what her ministerial colleague had said flowed from the fact that cormann had broken one of the standing conventions of politics in australia and for that matter the english speaking world for more than forty years both the architecture of labour market regulation and the discretionary choices of governments have been designed with the precise objective of holding wages down these policies have been quite successful as can be seen from the graph however at least until recently there has been bipartisan agreement on at least one aspect of them that no one should mention their role in holding back wages instead the decline in the wage share of national income has been variously blamed on technology immigration imports from china and more recently the end of the mining boom none of these explanations stand up to scrutiny the idea that technology is driving the wage share down is perhaps the most popular but technological change has been continuous if uneven since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 18th century most of the time workers have shared in the resulting productivity gains there have however been a number of exceptional periods in which workers have been harmed they have been times when the balance of power had favoured employers at those unusual times any kind of disruption whether caused by new technology or not has had the potential to enable employers to break working conditions and cut wages right now for example there is no necessary reason for the ability to do business over the internet to harm workers in many ways it empowers workers by reducing the information advantages of big employers but in an environment where unions are weak and working conditions are vulnerable to erosion the outcome is firms like airtasker where workers bid against each other to perform outsourced tasks often for less than the minimum wage there is nothing new about this kind of working arrangement it could be seen outside the wharves on sydney s hungry mile in the 1930s where workers went from wharf to wharf each day hoping for work or today on street corners in the united states where often undocumented construction workers gather in the mornings hoping to be picked for work but if technology isn t to blame what is the overlong shadow of the overhang the real story begins in the early 1970s when there was an upsurge in inflation associated with the breakdown of the post war bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates and soaring prices in commodity markets including that for oil the result was a wage price spiral as both wages and prices rose at unexpected annual rates of more than 10 in a nation with a history of strong trade unions decades of full employment and the boundless faith in the future forged by the 1960s wages grew faster than prices as both spiralled upwards by the time rising unemployment began to bite and inflation slowed down the wage share of national income had risen to an unprecedented 62 reining in this real wage overhang became the central preoccupation of macroeconomic policy throughout the 1970s and 1980s this made sense at the time but as in other fields ideas formed in the 1970s and 1980s continued to dominate the thinking of policymakers long after they had either been proven to be failures or rendered obsolete by changing circumstances as was the case with policies designed to hold back wages the policies had several elements there were a series of changes in industrial relations law most of which have attacked unions and weakened the bargaining power of labour the fraser government introduced sections 45d and 45e of the trade practices act banning secondary boycotts that is action in solidarity with other workers fraser also created the industrial relations bureau the first of a series of industrial police forces on its election in 1996 the howard government introduced the workplace relations act 1996 which extended scope for non union agreements after winning a senate majority in 2004 howard introduced workchoices which limited the scope of collective bargaining and wound back protections against dismissal read more explainer what are the abcc and registered organisations bills the industrial relations bureau maintained at least a pretence of impartiality by contrast the organisations created by the abbott and turnbull governments the registered organisations commission and australian building and construction commission have been so nakedly anti union that they have repeatedly broken the law they are supposed to uphold labor governments have wound back some of the most extreme measures but have not changed the general direction of policy even measures that appeared superficially favourable to workers turned out differently for example in 1993 the keating government introduced the concept of protected industrial action it was some time before it became apparent that the result was to abolish any general right to strike something that exists in almost every other democratic government as minister for workplace relations bill shorten introduced measures that were pitched as protecting penalty rates through a review process undertaken by the fair work commission a few years later in a highly politicised process the commission used the process to cut penalty rates coalition governments have also used the power of the state directly against unions notable examples include the string of royal commissions created by the abbott government and the use in 1998 of ex military strikebreakers to break the maritime union of australia their training and deployment was facilitated by a government consultant who worked with the major waterfront employer patricks orchestrating the offshore training of the replacement workforce through the actions of consultant stephen webster and other shadowy ex military figures finally macroeconomic management has operated on the basis that any increase in wages is a danger signal requiring a tightening of fiscal and monetary policy a notable example was the warning by then employment minister eric abetz in january 2014 months after taking office that australia faced a wages explosion far from exploding wage growth slid and hasn t recovered more striking than his failed prediction was abetz assumption taken for granted in policy debate that any substantial increase in wages would be disastrous it is only in the last few years that this assumption inherited from last century have been challenged the reserve bank in particular has become an advocate for higher wage growth yet as cormann s incautious outbreak of truthtelling has shown the view has yet to percolate through to australia s elites the academy of the social sciences in australia is one of australia s four learned academies the assa coordinates the promotion of research teaching and advice in the social sciences promotes scholarly cooperation across disciplines comments on national needs and priorities in the social sciences and provides advice to government on issues of national importance

one of the enduring legends associated with patrick patron saint of ireland whose feast day many of us will celebrate sunday is the sprouting into a living tree of the ash walking stick he planted into the soil of aspatria similarly investment dollars planted in ireland by dozens of u s multinationals have blossomed into a vibrant source of jobs and wages unfortunately that source may find itself uprooted by a surprise tax ruling mosads what is the most important element of good tax policy certainly reasonable arguments can be made for low rates fairness simplicity and ease of compliance yet perhaps the most critical aspects are transparency and certainty failure to deliver all of these other tax policy considerations while not optimal can be adjusted for and often worked around but abrupt changes especially in the level of tax liabilities that come without prior visibility can cause not just extreme anxiety but also massive uprooting of plans and aspirations in ways that destroy value and send taxpaying entities into a downward spiral the destructive combination of tax opaqueness and uncertainty explains why although it seems irrational to some there was such turmoil recently over unexpected reductions in the amount of income tax refunds some households received even if their overall tax bills were lower the pain is not irrational at all however when you consider that families become accustomed to a certain annual cash infusion and more important make concrete plans counting on their continuation the disappearing refund might represent a lost car down payment a foregone opportunity to settle a medical debt a sudden inability to meet a tuition installment or a missed vacation in such situations while lower tax rates are welcome tax surprises are not which brings us to the current state of affairs in st patrick s homeland whose prime minister leo varadkar and other government officials are presently in the u s promoting ireland and its business friendly atmosphere the emerald isle has gained a reputation as a tax paradise for u s corporations that reputation is attributable both to competitive corporate rates and favorable tax provisions this tax treatment and its certainty is important to massive companies like apple and its suppliers pharma companies airplane leasing and others dealing in information technology the people of ireland have enjoyed an enormous economic boost from the country s inviting investment climate as u s based companies have come to dominate its business landscape the irish times reports that they represent 25 of the top 50 enterprises according to the american chamber of commerce ireland u s foreign investment in the nation is valued at 387 billion more than our investment in south america africa and the middle east and more than in the bric countries brazil russia india and china combined this level of foreign direct investment is responsible for the employment of 20 percent of the irish private sector workforce at average wages nearly 2 5 times the nation s average salary and in 2016 the nation s office of the revenue commissioners estimated that these multinationals paid 80 percent of the island s corporate taxes but even the lowest rates and most favorable tax provisions won t promote such investment if they can t be counted on and that s why recent rulings from irish revenue are so troubling not only for u s companies investing there but from the millions who benefit from their presence the agency delivered a notice of amended assessment to a leading global health care company largely doing business in the u s but based in dublin the assessment took a look back over five years and then handed the company a massive tax liability in another case the irish government accessed a huge tax liability to a major supplier of apple again the assessment looked back over years there are reports of more to come mossecondads these resulting additional tax liabilities sent shock waves through both stock markets and the foreign investment community not only did these notices represent out of nowhere change from years of past treatment of similar transactions the government has largely refused to explain its reasoning it goes without saying that these actions will endanger any existing and future investment planned there and the many high paying jobs that result surely much like st patrick s living staff job creating foreign investors would prefer to stay firmly rooted in ireland and benefit from the competitive tax rates and favorable provisions nourishing their growth but their future presence and positive impact will come into question if tax precedents can be suddenly torn up and tossed aside by the government let s hope the government can find its way to raising

the government from proposing a third vote unless they could provide evidence to suggest the substance of the document had been altered advertisement bercow said that while the government could table a new or substantially different agreement what the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition or substantially the same proposition as that of last week which was rejected by 149 votes he went on however to stress that this ruling should not be regarded as my last word on the subject it is simply meant to indicate the test which the government must meet in

finance minister ken ofori atta seeks to issue multi billion dollar eurobonds imminently reopens domestic 3 yr bond issuance just 2 months to maturity seeks us 750m bridging loan from two int banks the government of ghana is facing a severe financing crisis goldstreet business has learnt to avert it top government officials led by finance minister ken ofori atta have opened negotiations with potential investors in a planned eurobond issue of up to us 3 billion earlier this week in london new york and boston at the same time government has re opened a tap issuance for an undetermined volume of three year domestic bonds but while this is a standard strategy the fact that the original issuance done in 2016 is due to mature just two months from now in may illustrates the intensity of government s need but the biggest evidence of the immediate need for finance comes from government s proposal to parliament made last week for approval for a us 750 million syndicated bridging finance loan which is to be paid from the proceeds of the impending eurobond issuance which could become available within the next two to three months government s financing crunch has been brought about by the reticence of investors to buy up its debt securities aside from making it difficult for government to meet its budgetary deficit financing needs and repayment obligations on maturing public debt the reluctance of foreign currency wielding non resident investors to buy up domestic debt securities is instigating accelerated depreciation of the cedi which bloomberg now rates as the worst performing of the 140 currencies it tracks so far this year government has appointed bank of america merril lynch jp morgan chase co morgan stanley standard bank and standard chartered bank plc to organize the meetings with potential investors in its imminent eurobond issuance which started on wednesday it has also appointed local institutions fidelity bank ic securities and databank as co arrangers for the issue which could be done immediately if investors can be convinced to accept a coupon interest rate acceptable to government if not government officials are claiming they are ready to wait a bit for more favourable pricing to be secured to this end the banks contracted are to arrange a benchmark dollar denominated bond issuance with maturities of between seven and 12 years or perhaps longer however government cannot afford to be very patient last week it proposed to parliament that it takes a us 750 million syndicated bridging finance facility being negotiated with two international banks standard bank and standard chartered bank plc which would be paid back from the proceeds of the impending eurobond loan ministry of finance officials explain that this is needed because even if the ongoing meetings result in a firm agreement with investors securing the proceeds of a consequent eurobond issuance could still be two to three months away this implies that government would be forced into the best eurobond deal it can get within the time frame provided by the tenor of the impending bridging loan ghana needs us 2 billion to fund its budgetary expenditures inclusive of maturing debt amortization and is ready to take up to another us 1 billion to refinance existing bonds if it can secure a new issuance at relatively low interest rates the primary target here would expectedly be the eurobonds issued by the mahama administration in 2015 at a coupon rate of 10 25 percent the highest cost bonds on ghana s books specifically bloomberg reported this week that government is offering to buy back us 250 million of its us 2 billion in bonds maturing in 2023 and 2030 however financial analysts are not sure that a pricing deal can easily be reached bloomberg reported earlier this week that analysts at renaissance capital a global investment banking firm represented in ghana have formally warned its clients that ghana has a terrible fiscal record in recent years this refers to the two most recent general election years in which the mahama administration churned up unplanned fiscal deficits of nearly 10 percent of gdp on both occasions each time nearly doubling the target for the year added to this are fears that ghana may abandon its fiscal discipline once the international monetary fund exits at the imminent expiration of its extended credit facility programme begun in april 2015 and due to end on april 4 this year although the incumbent president nana akufo addo administration has passed legislation limiting the fiscal deficit to not more than five percent of gdp going forward analysts and investors fret over the government s turn from demand management to supply side economics the fiscal deficit target was raised rather than lowered for the 2019 fiscal year for the first time since ghana entered the imf programme even as government intensifies its efforts to secure dollar denominated funding it has also taken an unprecedented step to attract more foreign exchange through cedi denominated domestic debt bond issuance yesterday march 14 it reopened a tap issue for the three year bond issuance done in 2016 and which is due to mature in may this year just two months away the issue was originally done at a coupon rate of 24 50 percent which is significantly higher than the current three year bond yield less than 22 percent under the terms of the offer there is no uniform clearing level successful bidders will be allocated at the price at which they bid and partial allocations will go to bids at the cut off price at government s discretion in event of oversubscription it is similarly instructive that this tap offer is additional to the debt issuance calendar for the first quarter of 2019 which had one three year bond issuance of ghc800 million slated for march government s ongoing difficulties are illustrated by the recent shortfalls it has suffered in its debt securities issuances for instance a fortnight ago it was only able to raise ghcx993 32 million well below the target of ghc1 26 billion

returns the dairy sector s outlook had brightened due to strong production growth which was now estimated to be 3 7 per cent higher than last year that had been accompanied by a recovery in prices as production growth expectations stalled in other exporting regions and the eu had sold down its skim milk powder stocks which had weighed on markets over the past few years dairy export revenue was forecast to lift 5 5 per cent to 17 6 billion for the year ending june 2019 the volatility in commodity prices experienced over the current dairy season underlined an increasingly uncertain outlook for new zealand s dairy export revenues there was down side risk to dairy prices if china s economy was damaged by any further escalation in the us china trade dispute similarly a return to growth in

revenues were forecast to increase to 10 1 billion for the year ending june 2019 up 6 per cent from last year the main driver was high prices which were being driven by strong international demand especially from china and supply constraints in australia due to drought and a recent flood wool exports were forecast to increase 0 7 per cent to 550 million in the year ending june 2019 that

republican u s sen dan sullivan r alaska was in juneau last month to deliver his annual update to the alaska legislature at the capitol while in town sullivan met with the empire on thursday feb 21 for an exclusive interview the interview has been edited for length and clarity here is the full transcript of the empire s interview with sullivan sullivan i m in town for the annual speech to the legislature which i always enjoy as i mentioned i don t know if you saw it i appreciate you blogging on it just a recap there the message was on the big important issue the economy we certainly think the policies we ve enacted at the federal level tax reform for a whole host of folks families businesses regulatory reform which is really huge for alaska both congress and the trump administration and issues like unleashing energy for the country we re the largest producer of oil gas and renewables in the world which is pretty remarkable when you think about it bigger than saudi arabia bigger than russia and things like the defense buildup these are having a really really positive impact on the lower 48 economy in terms of economic growth it s really strong in terms of job growth it s through the roof if you saw for example the january jobs report number 304 000 in one month i mean that s just very very strong lowest unemployment rate in 50 years wages finally going up it s taken 20 years so my big point was ok but we need to bring that here that s been probably my biggest focus since i ve been in the senate for the reasons i laid out in the speech we actually think and i ask this all the time of business leaders do you think we re kind of starting to see the end and not everybody but i think that a lot of folks believe that which is good because as you guys know optimism is a force multiplier as colin powell used to say if you have a sense that things are turning around business leaders will start to invest more people will come back home so i laid out the reasons why i thought that was the case the energy renaissance on the north slope s clearly happening i walked through all those numbers on why that s the case we want to make sure we have a strong arctic national wildlife refuge lease sale which again won t be immediate production but that s a huge psychological hurdle that we ve been dealing with in alaska for a long time the military and importantly here in southeast the coast guard recapitalization and buildup is also very strong the last appropriations bill that was just signed last week by the president has a lot in it which i know will be coming here so there s a lot happening here and i also wanted to highlight there s a lot of bipartisan work going on here in the congress you don t read about it a lot unfortunately but it s everything from the national defense authorization act that passed with like 86 senators the coast guard bill that i authored passed with 94 senators the veteran s mission act that rep josh revak r anchorage asked me about that passed with what 90 plus on that empire reporter mollie barnes do you think that these sexual assault bills will have kind of bipartisan support sullivan well my power act passed very strong bipartisan that s the thing that s kind of the precursor to this it was signed into law by the president in september so then i highlighted what i thought could be areas where we could build on this bipartisan cooperation recognizing that to be perfectly blunt that the new house majority and the new speaker might take a look at undoing some of what i thought are key successes for alaska whether it s tax reform whether it s significant military construction whether it s anwr i mean they re already talking about holding hearings on rolling back anwr in the house not going to happen i mean they re going to hold the hearings but the ability to get it done is not going to happen so i mentioned that we re going to protect this we re going to protect it because it s really important for the state but in other areas let s work together on things that we ve already worked together on so i went through some of the health care issues the big issue that i ve talked to you guys a lot about that i care very deeply about is opioids and addiction challenges in our state the save our seas act which i m very very excited about which actually i would love it if you guys could write about that we could send you the whole transcript you rarely have alignment on a big environmental issue like that in d c that has democrats republicans the white house and industry all aligned i just think it s a big deal nobody wrote about it even though it s a big deal finally on this issue of the sexual assault and domestic violence this is an issue i ve been focused on literally for 10 years since i was attorney general in 2009 and 2010 we had a big statewide initiative that was increase penalties for perpetrators public service announcements more legal services for victims and survivors and getting the state really engaged and to recognize this problem and then longer term work into changing the culture right which is what needs to happen so i had a bill last year that was all about increasing pro bono domestic services for victims which is what we did here when i was ag that passed so that s signed into law we re going to start implementing it this year u s sen dan sullivan r alaska speaks during an interview with the juneau empire at the capitol on thursday feb 21 2019 michael penn juneau empire empire editor emily russo miller is that different than the legal representation that you talked about sullivan yeah it s different it builds on it miller the legal representation have any other states done that sullivan no miller so we would be the first sullivan well no what i want to do is make it required federally it s a big idea but it makes sense because it s a simple idea like i mentioned in my speech the trigger on this would be if you re a victim of a crime so a rape stalking sexual assault and the person the perpetrator who is charged gets a lawyer snaps they get a lawyer under the 6th amendment my legislation that we re finalizing would trigger then to say ok wait what about the victim how come doesn t she get a lawyer and get a lawyer for the victim now the benefit of that is she has legal counsel whether she can afford it or not just like the perpetrator or alleged perpetrator and as i mentioned and we can get you the studies there are very powerful studies that show that one of the best ways to help survivors of domestic violence and domestic assault break out of the cycle is to get a lawyer because then they re empowered to say get a protective order or boot the guy out of the house or get custody of the kids and so we did that when i was ag we held these pro bono legal summits all over the state we did a summit in juneau to get people to step up and do that kind of work we had over 100 attorneys in two years do the volunteer work so that amounts to tens of thousands of dollars of free legal service hours but what we re doing is we ll take this a step further we re finalizing the legislation it wouldn t be a constitutional right like the defendant has it would be a statutory right and how you would fund that could be partially through federal grants states would have to step up you d do a lot more on pro bono so it would be a combination of that and again it d be triggered by indictment of a crime that s the big idea then we had these other ideas here a pilot program which is kind of i think interesting a lot of the advocacy groups see this as one of their biggest problems is to serve a protective order on somebody it s actually hard you have to physically serve it and estimates are that up to 50 percent of targets of these protective orders dodge them so they never get served so there s never the protection that you would get from that so we re looking at a pilot project that could use electronic devices so like text you have to think through the legal ramifications and due process that s why it s a pilot but for the advocacy groups on domestic violence this is one of their biggest goals so that s the other idea and then the third like i said is a national public awareness campaign we did do that in alaska if you remember in 2010 we ran these ads real alaska men choose respect and we did public service announcements all over the state and we would look at revamping that at a national level miller where did that idea come from to pick that up since it got dropped a few years ago under walker sullivan it came from me and my staff to be honest i was the one who spearheaded the first effort when i was ag it was governor sean parnell and commissioner joe masters and the legislature the first initiative in alaska i was the guy who spearheaded that with the governor so a lot of those ideas we took from alaska now look you saw me i don t point fingers but you re right it was dropped over the last four years and i have no idea why this should not for any reason at all be viewed as a partisan issue miller it was funding sullivan yeah i don t know what it was that s why i mean i didn t really follow it but that s why i did encourage the legislature to pick it up and i had a number of legislators after the speech said they were interested so i think if we re doing it at the fed level and the state reinforces it at the state level it will be a good combo and to be honest alaska s an amazing place we re no 1 in so many great categories but you know we remain no 1 in this horrendous category which is a blight on our state u s sen dan sullivan r alaska speaks during an interview with the juneau empire at the capitol on thursday feb 21 2019 michael penn juneau empire barnes have you talked with other people in congress about this legislation do you think it will be easy to pass sullivan well right now we re working on it and i don t want to lay out who would be our cosponsors but we ve been working with a number of senators democrats and republicans on these ideas we re already putting this through legislative counsel the lawyers to draft it so i d say pretty advanced stages of cosponsorships with this will it be easy to pass i don t know my power act took two congresses to pass but i had really good cosponsors heidi heitkamp the senator from north dakota was my main cosponsor in the senate sen lisa murkowski was of course a cosponsor and then in the house was joe kennedy who s a democrat and tulsi gabbard who s a democrat congressman don young was a cosponsor cathy mcmorris rodgers who s a republican so we had a really strong bipartisan group so i kind of anticipate we will be doing something similar no i don t anticipate we will be doing something similar miller to hit on a few other topics some of which didn t make the speech can we get an update with transboundary mining that s a big issue here i think last we talked we were asking what kind of pressure can you put on the canadian government sullivan look it s an issue that about a year ago at this time was when i traveled to canada with lt gov byron mallott and we had very high level meetings with i think five different cabinet members of prime minister justin trudeau s i ve raised this with trudeau in d c when he s visited but we went there and the good news was if you remember that the trump administration kind of got much more involved than sec john kerry under president barack obama so we had a lot more power and influence from the feds relative to the trump administration vs the obama administration and since that time we ve had a number of follow up meetings with canadian officials in d c like with the ambassador and some of the other canadians who ve come through the minister of natural resources and others so we re continuing to keep pressure on it as a matter of fact let me get back to you on this because we wrote a letter the delegation barnes i think i saw that letter miller there have been a few letters sullivan but i mean it s more than letters what we re trying to do is keep the pressure on and to be honest when we re in canada the environmental minister in particular i don t think they had a very good response at one point she mentioned anwr opening anwr and i m like what does this have to do with tuslequah chief mine that s spewing toxic waste into the taku river outside of juneau nothing so let s not divert the discussion here miller i know that lt gov mallott is no longer in the picture has someone else kind of stepped up in that way sullivan no but i have good relations with gov mike dunleavy and lt gov kevin meyer we re continuing to press it but let us get that to you more in detail miller another southeast issue specifically where do you stand on the roadless rule and then a second question with that they ve been taking public testimony 140 000 people submitted testimony about the roadless rule and the majority of them are support in keeping it in place sullivan yeah i m not miller can you elaborate a little bit more sullivan well i just think that and we pushed legislation for this sen murkowski and congressman young and i had an exemption for southeast in the farm bill that made it in the house version didn t make it in the senate version and it got dropped in conference which was too bad it was great work by congressman young i just think that our resources our access to our resources is too limited too restrictive you know the tongass is the largest national forest in the country and the ability to have some access via roads i actually think it s required by law but it s been in litigation for a long time so we re continuing to encourage the trump administration to do this from an executive order standpoint it would have been better to get it into law but i think it would help some of the struggling communities i was just outside talking to some folks about secure rural school funding i m a huge proponent of that as you know that was established in the congress because the congress acknowledged that the federal government had decimated so many communities in southeast that they re having a difficult time with the tax base to pay for their public school education i d much rather have the economic activity and tax base for our southeast communities to be able to fund their schools through vibrant timber sales and a timber economy vs having to get the secure rural schools funding but as long as we can t do that i m going to be a huge advocate for secure rural schools funding but i just think it s a fairness issue so yeah i would not were the 140 000 people were they alaskans sullivan3 miller i think it s available for anyone to comment sullivan yeah i d be surprised if it was 140 000 alaskans look part of our challenge always and it s reflected in a little bit of what i was talking about with the new majority in the house is you have a lot of people who don t live here who don t care about our economic opportunities who don t care about our kids education don t care about the school base funding and they just want to shut us down you know i fight that really really strongly because i don t believe in it miller do you think you support former governor walker s project of the natural gas pipeline do you think now that he s not in office it should still be pursued sullivan yeah look i m mean i m a huge proponent of resource development i worked a lot on the gas line when i was department of natural resources commissioner there s a lot of alignment with regard to the companies and the state and the buyers at the time i never got the details of what governor walker was doing on that you know i talked to him a lot i m not sure a lot of legislators had a lot of the details which is problematic i was a little skeptical of some of the salaries that were being paid out to some of the members who were doing it you know in the million dollar range which is pretty remarkable to me but we have an incredible resource in terms of natural gas and i think it would be great if we could commercialize not just certainly for alaskan use but for export i ve been pressing the trump administration even in recent talks with cabinet officials when they go meet with the chinese to make sure this is on their agenda they have told me it is high on their agenda that s all positive but the details in which the governor was negotiating it you know equity stakes by chinese companies i was not aware of whenever i raised it with the governor and chinese officials i was in china last year my view is it would be great to sell clean burning alaska natural gas to china it would be great for the environment it would be great for our economy it would be good for our national security and our energy security but there are two conditions that i thought were critical a and i mentioned this to the chinese on a regular basis we are not nigeria we are not west africa the chinese if you look at their record of resource development is they go into countries and they bring 7 000 chinese workers and they do all the work and i ve told them that won t fly in alaska or america we will build whatever this is and b you should not anticipate this going solely to you our allies like japan and korea and taiwan and singapore should also be able to get clean burning alaska natural gas other than that if the governor or the companies can come together on reasonable terms that benefit alaska i would have no objection to that as a matter of fact i ve tried to promote it with everybody from the president on down and they re certainly interested but the details that governor walker negotiated are very opaque to me miller ok switching topics to the green new deal sullivan green new deal miller you do not support it you mentioned it in the speech sullivan i am not a supporter miller but is there anything in there that you do think is a good idea sullivan well look the whole approach just is kind of a look i think we need to take it seriously the last count i think close to 25 percent of the democrats in the house and i think in the senate we can get you the exact numbers are cosponsors of it ok cosponsors but to me it s kind of this command economy socialism model that quite frankly i fundamentally disagree with miller have you had a chance to look at it sullivan i ve looked at it i haven t read every word of it but i ve looked at a fair amount of it and i look forward to debating it right now the plan is to bring it to the senate floor and have a debate and vote on it i just think there s a bit of a naivety that exists with regard to the notion that somehow we re going to put the government in charge of every aspect of american life it s a very top down command economy approach to not just the environment and energy but to the entire u s economy i think it would cost millions of jobs and certainly tens of thousands of jobs in alaska the affordability of it say for example to retrofit every house in america is very very skeptical and look with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions i think that s important you look at what happened during the obama administration president obama used to like to talk about how we reduced greenhouse gas emissions during his time office that was true but he never talks about the next step or the next sentence why that happened why did it happen it was because of the revolution and the production of natural gas that s why it happened which he was primarily opposed to so what i think people are not thinking about which is exciting is the ability to combine for example renewables wind solar hydro and we have so much in terms of renewables here with natural gas to combine high tech you know in silicon valley with natural gas this is starting to happen and it s really really exciting why is this because we have 200 to 300 years of natural gas supplies in this country especially if you include alaska and we should be combining that with the best technology whether it s renewable technology whether it s for example fuel cell technology and i think the sky s the limit on a cleaner environment but still combining the abundance of hydrocarbons that we have in this country to get to a cleaner atmosphere but also not in a way that s going to shut down the economy or crush the alaska economy in the future so no i m not a supporter of the green new deal did you gather that from my comments miller when was the last time you talked to the president and what was said sullivan so i don t normally go into a lot of the discussions that i have with the president but i talk to him on a regular basis the one thing about the president that s pretty remarkable is when you reach out and call him he s very receptive he either takes your call at least from me or calls you back the same day i think that s pretty much always happened with him including i was mentioning i called him right before thanksgiving on a couple of issues and you know he wasn t available then i was at dinner with my wife and three daughters in outback steakhouse in anchorage and we were getting ready to see the new bohemian rhapsody movie it was 7 45 p m in anchorage and i get this phone call unknown number and i pick it up and they said sen sullivan and i said yes and they said this is the white house switchboard i have the president on phone so i was in outback steakhouse but think about that that was 11 45 p m in d c which is where he was miller what did he say sullivan he just said hey dan i saw you called what s up barnes you were at outback steakhouse on thanksgiving sullivan no no this is the tuesday before thanksgiving laughs sullivan that s a good question you looked shocked i thought you were shocked about the trump phone call so i called him recently on a couple foreign policy issues but also the issue we had caught wind that the emergency declaration by the governor had been kind of there was some bureaucratic obstacles in the trump administration between certain agencies and it was kind of stuck so i called him to ask him to respectfully take a look at it and within like an hour we had several senior trump administration officials calling us so obviously he rattled some cages and i think we got the declaration from the president out the next day and then i was asked to go into a meeting with him and about six other senators just to talk about some broader foreign policy issues relating to syria and afghanistan and nato and korea so they re good at reaching out this morning i got a phone call to get briefed by senior trump administration officials on these upcoming north korean negotiations so i just took that at my hotel here in juneau so he and his team reach out a lot and i think that s important miller do you think he reaches out the alaska senior senator lisa murkowski in the same way and do you think that s maybe because i mean have you broken with party lines in your four years now sullivan oh i ve voted against a number of things that they ve wanted i vote for things that i think my constituents want me to vote on and things that i campaigned on right i think one thing the people want their elected leaders to do is not go out and campaign for a year and then go to washington and be like you know what i was just kidding that breeds cynicism but with senator murkowski i have no idea but i think she certainly talks to senior administration officials cabinet officials the president on a fairly regular basis i think i don t go into the detail on that for example we have lunches tuesday wednesday thursday the republican senators together a lot of times the administration or the president or the vice president comes so yeah and you know senator murkowski and i work daily hourly almost our staffs work i mean we re very very very integrated in our approach to getting things done her lands bill for example is a really big success had a provision in there that i ve been championing for four years i think i ve talked to you guys about that the alaska native allotment act for the vietnam veterans who missed their chance so hopefully the house passes that we work very closely together i mentioned this issue you know i talked a lot about the military and coast guard buildup what s exciting about that from our perspective is we re kind of a one two punch i m on the authorizing committees so armed services we do the authorization of these big buildups i m on the commerce committee i chair the coast guard subcommittee we do the authorization on all that she s on the appropriations committee on these subcommittees that actually appropriate the funds that we ve authorized so that is a powerful combo and that s why you re seeing a lot of that military coast guard investments in alaska really spiking miller gotcha we had a question about medicaid do you want to take that one mollie barnes sure i think you mentioned during your speech that you want to decrease the cost of health care while still maintaining the aspect that we have really good doctors for oncology and stuff like that so if you don t support a medicare for all system what are sullivan medicare for all barnes what changes do you think could be made to kind of meet in the middle to decrease those costs while still maintaining level of care sullivan well look i laid out a number of them in the speech the transparency the issue that relates to these new association arrangements say for example with the chamber of commerce in alaska with all the members that s working pretty dramatically in other states we were the first state i didn t mention this in my speech here this year but i mentioned it last year we were the first state in the country that was able to get approval of a what s called a section 1332 waiver under obamacare president obama s administration never granted those waivers to anybody when the trump administration came in they granted it to alaska i was a very strong advocate in d c on getting the administration to advocate for that that provided if you remember the state legislature did a really good job they put together a pool in money up to about 60 million for super high cost conditions that cost a lot in terms of health care and then the federal government came in and not only matched that but put out i think it s close to 300 million over five years to grant that waiver and if you look at our individual market it s the first time in years that our premiums actually went down they went down by double digits one of the few states in the country where that happened now remember that was after in increase of over 200 percent under obamacare in the individual market so we got rid of the individual mandate which i actually think was really important because a lot of people didn t write about it but that was a regressive tax that was a tax on americans and alaskans who were penalized for not buying something they couldn t afford the numbers are remarkable over 70 percent of the people who had to pay that tax in alaska it was about 21 000 alaskans it was seven million americans over 70 percent of them made 50 000 or less so you re taxing middle class or low middle class families penalizing them because they couldn t afford insurance that the federal government had made so expensive that was a horrible policy that i m glad we got rid of so i think there s a really good opportunity on the drug cost to bring those down with more transparency and a large issue that i ve been working on and that we ve had some success but we need more providers up here we need more doctors up here that s one of the reasons our health care costs are so high our health care costs structurally are always going to be high higher than a lot of other states but i had a bill and i talked about the veterans mission act that passed a couple months ago we had a provision in there for a pilot program that will essentially be an alaska pilot program to have more residency programs in alaska between the va and alaska native health organizations this will help bring doctors to alaska this is a bill of mine called the enhancing rural health care providers act it got tucked into this broader bill so that became law so there s a number of areas that i think we can work on but medicare for all sounds good when you actually say to people oh would you like medicare for all it polls at like plus 60 percent when you tell people what it means which is that two thirds of alaskans and americans that get private insurance and are typically satisfied with it the government will kick you off that private insurance and put you into a government run program that s not a policy that i would support and i don t think most alaskans would support it either and the cost on that is estimated at 33 trillion that s trillion with a t over ten years miller the states bill being called the most significant piece of marijuana related legislation ever introduced in congress do you support this bill and do you think pot should be legal at the federal level sullivan so on this so you know we had our referendum in 2014 state referendum i was running for office then and even though it was a state referendum and i was running for federal government i got asked about it a lot i was not supportive well it passed with really strong numbers it certainly got more votes than i did or don young or the governor so my view on that was look i m a believer in the 10th amendment and constituents strongly supported a referendum and i was going to try to be supportive of the federal elements that could help make this more that you could execute it on so i ve worked on there s banking issues there s the prosecution issues the so called coal amendment so we ve been very focused and actually part of a group of senators which is an interesting group right it s cory gardner it s elizabeth warren it s some of the more libertarian senators who are strong believers in the 10th amendment so actually i ve been someone who s been trying to help with legislation that can execute the people s wishes and in this case with alaska it s that so yeah i do support the elements of what s in that bill and we also put forward a bill on the veterans affairs side a lot of you know one of the big challenges on the opioid issue you had a lot of these vets come home from iraq afghanistan they were suffering and they really really got and the va even acknowledges this now they got like hooked and pumped up with opioids and they got addicted horrendous that our va was kind of inadvertently they weren t doing it on purpose getting our veterans hooked on opioids so a number of the vet communities and i reach out to that community a lot have said look are there ways that we can look at other alternatives whether it s chiropractic whether it s studying the effects of marijuana and different elements of that as an alternative to opioids so it s been something else i ve been supportive of as well contact reporter mollie barnes at mbarnes

excepted from jay taylor s latest newsletter zerohedge com sun 03 17 2019 in 2018 central banks added nearly 23 million ounces of gold up 74 from 2017 this is the highest annual purchase rate increase since 1971 and the second highest rate in history russia was the biggest buyer and not surprisingly the lion s share of gold is flowing into central banks of countries that are in the sights of america s killing machine the military industrial complex that eisenhower warned us about in 1958 the bank for international settlements bis located in basal switzerland is often referred to as the central bankers bank related to this issue of central bank hoarding of gold is the fact that on march 29 the bis will permit central banks to count the physical gold it holds marked to market as a reserve asset just the same as it allows cash and sovereign debt instruments to be counted there has been a long term view that china and other nations dishoarding dollars in favor of gold have been quite happy about western banks trashing the gold price through the synthetic paper markets but one has to wonder if that might not change once physical gold is marked to market for the sake of enlarging bank balance sheets this also raises the question with regard to how much gold the u s actually holds as opposed to what it claims to hold james sinclair has always argued that the only way the world can overcome the debt that is strangling the global economy is to remonetize gold on the balance sheets of central banks at a price in many thousands of dollars higher this would mean a major change in the global monetary system away from the dollar as china has been pushing for the last decade or so if banks own and possess gold bullion they can use that asset as equity and thus this will enable them to print more money it may be no coincidence that as march 29th has been approaching banks around the world have been buying huge amounts of physical gold and taking delivery for the first time in 50 years central banks bought over 640 tons of gold bars last year almost twice as much as in 2017 and the highest level raised since 1971 when president nixon closed the gold window and forced the world onto a floating rate currency system but as chris powell of gata noted that in itself is not news the move toward making gold equal to cash and bonds was anticipated several years ago however what is news is the realization by a major italian newspaper ii sole 24 ore that synthetic gold or paper gold has been used to suppress the price of gold thus enabling countries and their central banks to continue to buy gold and build up their reserves at lower and lower prices as massive amounts of artificially created synthetic gold triggers layer upon layer of artificially lower priced gold as unaware private investors panic out of their positions the paper concludes that in recent years but especially in 2018 a jump in the price of goldwould have been the normal order of things on the contrary gold closed last year with a 7 percent downturn and a negative financial return how do you explain this while the central banks raided real gold bars behind the scenes they pushed and coordinated the offer of hundreds of tons of synthetic gold on the london and new york exchanges where 90 percent of the trading of metals takes place the excess supply of gold derivatives obviously served to knock down the price of gold forcing investors to liquidate positions to limit large losses accumulated on futures thus the more gold futures prices fell the more investors sold synthetic gold triggering bearish spirals exploited by central banks to buy physical gold at ever lower prices the only way governments can manage the levels of debt that threaten the financial survival of the western world is to inflate debase their currencies the ability to count gold as a reserve from which banks can create monetary inflation is not only to allow gold to become a reserve on the balance sheet of banks but to have a much much higher gold price to build up equity in line with the massive debt in the system
three events next week will shape the investment climate the federal reserve meets and will update its forecasts and guidance the british house of commons may vote for a third time on the withdrawal bill before prime minister may heads of the eu summit to ask for an extension of the uk leaving the eu the eurozone sees the flash march pmi with great hope that the green shoots of spring will be evident 1 fomc there is little chance of a change in policy at the the meeting is important because the fed s verbal communication has changed dramatically since the december projections the fed s thinking about its balance sheet has also evolved often officials make small incremental changes to their forecast but it could be a step function this time that said the fed s view of the economy has probably not changed materially the economy hit a soft patch at the end of last year and early this year as various crosscurrents hit but the underlying fundamentals remain firm financial conditions tightened dramatically but have eased nearly as quickly the is up over 12 since the start of the year the federal reserves real broad trade weighted fell in both january and february to snap an 11 month rally u s interest rates remain below q4 18 levels the note yield was near 3 25 in early november and finished last week below 2 60 for the first time since early january the yield closed the week a little above 2 40 it peaked shy of 3 0 four months ago in december the median forecast for growth this year was shaved to 2 3 from 2 5 the median dot for 2020 and 2021 was unrevised at 2 0 and 1 8 respectively like many private sector economists officials will likely recognize that the economic weakness in q1 may be more pronounced than anticipated and could trim their forecasts again growth forecasts need to be understood within the context of what is seen as the long term prospects which are understood as trend growth the range of forecasts in december was 1 7 to 2 2 in september it was 1 7 to 2 1 so the median projection at the end of last year was for a little more than trend growth the new update will put it back into the range a forecast below the range would be understood as a dovish signal of course but the variable lag times even projections of growth in the future years below the range of the long term forecasts would impact the trajectory of policy federal reserve chair powell indicated that he would like to see accelerate before resuming the tightening cycle in december the median forecast for both the and pce deflator was pared to 0 1 to 1 9 and 2 0 respectively the 2020 and 2021 median headline forecast did not change it remained at 2 1 for both years while the median core forecast was slipped 0 1 to 2 0 for both years readings have been soft and market measures of inflation meanwhile the 10 year breakeven spread between the conventional treasury securities and inflation linked instruments has risen by about 20 bp from late last year to 1 93 the two year breakeven shot up from around 65 bp last december and early january to 1 985 the university of michigan survey of 5 10 year inflation expectations bounced between 2 4 and 2 6 last year and fell to 2 3 in february matching the cyclical low set at the end of 2016 the preliminary march estimate jumped back into the range at 2 5 discussions of the dramatic drop in equities and yields in q4 18 often do not include the collapse in oil prices from around 75 and 85 in late september early october to 43 and 50 respectively by the end of 2018 both have rallied more than 35 off the lows fed officials also see tighter labor markets this year with the median forecast for the to fall to 3 5 this year it stood at 3 9 in december and last month was at 3 8 in december two of the seventeen officials anticipated that were necessary this year it is easy to see how the four officials that saw one hike could join the standpat camp eleven fed officials had foreseen the need for two or more rate increases almost evenly divided 6 5 in favor of three it seems unreasonable to expect them all to completely reverse themselves the median forecast will still likely anticipate a hike the market is not there the january 2020 fed funds futures contract implies a 2 30 average effective rate it is currently at 2 40 the fomc statement may not contain details about its balance sheet plans powell most likely will in his remarks and the media will press as well generally speaking the market has understood the fed to say that the balance sheet unwind is likely to be completed this year many expect late q3 or early q4 issues of the duration of the portfolio or how to transition to treasuries may not have been resolved yet the fed s balance sheet was shrinking when the equities rallied in middle quarters of 2018 and when it sold off in q4 18 and rallied in q1 19 making a causal relationship improbable 2 brexit and the eu summit the strongest majority in the uk house of commons was to reject the withdrawal bill negotiated by the tory government and the ec there is only one way it will pass and that is for the alternatives to be perceived as worse may has framed the issue as ultimately a choice between the withdrawal bill leaving with no agreement and not leaving at all the stark choice facing parliament on tuesday is to accept withdrawal bill or put the length of the extension in the ec s hands assuming the house of commons is still not persuaded may will go to the eu summit and admit that the uk is not quite ready to leave thank you she will have to explain why an extension is needed and what the uk will during the extension one would think that if parliament can vote on the same measure three or four times surely a second popular referendum is not some abridgment of democracy even though labour formally endorses a second referendum it largely voted against the very thing last week as did an overwhelming majority the bar to a second referendum still appears high may will not be telling the other heads of state that she needs more time to hold a second referendum nor is she likely to announce snap elections it is not clear what a short delay will accomplish european council president tusk has advocated a longer extension it is not clear what a long delay will accomplish it prolongs the uncertainty for businesses time is not the real problem it is that the uk seems to know what it does not want like immigration and unelected officials in brussels making rules but it does not know what it does want and to the extent it knows what it wants it is to have its cake and eat it too reaping the benefits of a community without any of its subordination of interests the withdrawal bill will likely get more support in the third attempt than it got in the first two many brexiters encouraged by the prime minister will view a long delay as a trojan horse for an eventual reversal the vote will cast as a reenactment of the referendum leave with the withdrawal plan or don t leave one may be forgiven for thinking the third defeat would surely kill the withdrawal bill there may be the fourth incarnation after the european council offers its extension then the final vote on the withdrawal bill can be held at the same time in order to continue to control the process may ceded to parliament the right to debate alternatives such as a norway styled relationship that would still allow the uk full access to the half a billion consumer bloc current volatility suggests a range for next week between roughly 1 30 and 1 36 one week implied

a slow moving phenomenon is unfolding all over the world it will have serious consequences but very few people are consciously aware of it perhaps because it involves something seemingly banal and benign the spread of digital payments this phenomenon is not only occurring in the major cities of economically advanced nations but also in poorer countries often promoted via the financial inclusion programs of international development organizations in partnership with major financial institutions the rise of digital payment sometimes going under names like e money plastic money or mobile money and the associated phasing out of physical cash gives financial institutions and governments a new means of financial monitoring and control on an unprecedented scale as i will argue this can be seen as the gentrification of payments the term gentrification usually refers to the neighborhood process in which a marginalized community often characterized by informal economic networks street markets and a rough edgy vibe finds their environment gradually diluted by the influx of wealthier newcomers who price them out and use their community as the setting for new formal markets domat33f via flickr the process sets in motion a cleansing of informality in which the newcomers who are attracted to certain desirable appearances of the community such as the music or the fun atmosphere eliminate the threatening elements that accompany the original precarity the gangs the drug dealers the rough markets related story economy labor making finance pay a plan for workers in new york could save tens of billions in annual fees directly at the expense of the financial industry truthout a process of neighborhood gentrification culminates with a hollowing out of the original community the neutralization of the risk that it represents to wealthier people and the rise of an nonthreatening simulacrum of that community backed by elite business owners and large scale institutions it may begin with hipster clothing boutiques replacing the small scale fabric merchants but inevitably it is completed with the appearance of corporate chain stores that replace everything from family owned delis to religious community centers when we stand back and generalize though gentrification simply appears as the process in which informal and unpredictable community networks that are potentially threatening to mainstream business interests are replaced by formal standardized and predictable state corporate structures accompanied by superficial appearances of niceness coolness and convenience the figure of the consumer seeking a buying experience from a shopping mall replaces the community member seeking belonging within networks of friends family and associates how does this relate to payments cash is a form of payment long associated with those on the lower rungs of post colonial informal economies the fish market in maputo the back street hairdresser in mumbai or the andean craft merchant issued by states but easily taken out of their view and direct control digital payment however is the domain of large scale globalized financial corporations and cannot be separated from them or taken out of their view to use or to be forced to use digital payments is to enter their sphere of influence and power un women via flickr in all gentrification processes those who are dispossessed support themselves through informal structures or gain a sense of identity meaning and belonging from using those structures from the perspective of large scale institutions however such people are often implicitly seen as backward even criminal seeking to escape the gaze of benevolent and responsible institutions that they would be better off with the financial inclusion community which aims to bring formal financial services to people without access to formal finance likes to present itself as a force for social empowerment but it often appears closely allied to the interests of big finance and big tech a simple search on google images for the term financial inclusion africa reveals countless promotional images of rural women smiling into the screen of their mobile phones looking at an app produced by a distant group of men in some large city and tethered to a corporate datacenter that monitors and tracks their actions in order to seek out opportunities for institutional profit the technicalities of payment to grapple with this we must first explore the basics every day modern market economies are host to countless instances of one basic social interaction two people meet in a market setting one of them hands over something specific and immediate like bananas or a manufactured toaster or a particular service and the other hands over something general and future oriented money tokens that give access to a range of potential goods and services from others in future zoom out and we can see a giant interdependent network of people and firms moving real goods and services in one direction in exchange for money tokens in the other we are all enmeshed within and dependent upon these monetary market networks most people use national currencies money tokens that work only within a particular geographic area these national currencies come in two basic forms first there is cash physical tokens issued by state backed institutions like central banks and government treasuries then there are digital bank deposits the money we see in our bank accounts these digital tokens are legally different to cash they are private ious promises issued by a bank promising you access to state cash should you request it the act of going to an atm to withdraw cash is thus the act of converting the ious in your bank account into the thing that has been promised to you alternatively we can transfer these bank ious between each other via bank to bank transfers bank money digital bank deposits can be contrasted to state money cash but we nevertheless experience them as being functionally equivalent in many places i can walk into a store and pay by cash or card nevertheless bank money is not only legally different to state money but also technologically different in its implementation and experientially different in its feel psychology and the way we interact with it cash tokens are physical objects produced by a mint or banknote manufacturer and cash transactions are essentially peer to peer involving two people only i hand over cash at a market stall and receive a jacket in return we might decide to report the transaction later and various records such as receipts might be kept but in principle only two of us are required for the transaction to occur bank money on the other hand takes the form of data objects units recorded on databases controlled by commercial banks i can carry cash tokens around but cannot do so with bank money it resides as data far away in my bank s datacenter and the only way to move it to someone else is to contact my bank and ask them to debit my account and credit the account of the person receiving the money nowadays there is a plethora of digital payments apps and devices but the basic structure of digital bank money transactions has four predictable elements you need a bank account you need a way to prove who you are and that you are the rightful owner of the account you need a way to send messages securely to your bank s datacenters in order to initiate a transaction the seller needs a way to receive confirmation of the payment marion doss via flickr these elements can be implemented in a variety of ways for example i might insert a visa debit card into a point of sale terminal at a supermarket and tap in a pin code after which the terminal will send my details via the visa system and my transfer request to my bank i might access a payments app using a fingerprint reader on my mobile phone and then scan a qr code giving me the seller s details i might tap an apple pay app attached to my credit card the process might entail layers of intermediary institutions from telecommunications companies to tech firms to credit card networks but in the end the same basic thing is happening a message ends up at my bank or at a secondary payment service provider which uses a bank to clear transactions requesting that they alter my account even in situations where it appears that banks are not involved they are services like paypal or m pesa in kenya or paytm in india or wechat in china are essentially new layers built over the bank digital money system or collaborative ventures with banks or intermediaries between you and a bank you can have accounts with them but they in turn will have accounts with banks the experiential dynamic while we may use both cash and digital bank money to achieve the same thing buying something in a shop they come with different technical and experiential features that make a very significant difference usually when people are asked to describe that difference they fixate on the immediate experiential features they might give opinions on which is faster more convenient or easier to use at the moment of the transaction they may have opinions on which is the more familiar or culturally resonant or which of the two seems safer if they have thought more about it they might make deeper observations on the psychological features for example perhaps they feel they spend more when they use digital because it seems less real all these experiential features are important to study but they are grossly over represented in popular debates about the merits of digital payment the most crucial difference between cash and digital money systems is not so banal as the question of which offers the greater short term convenience rather it is the technological or structural difference cash is a bearer instrument that requires no third party to stand between a buyer and a seller whereas digital money is a ledger money system that requires various third parties to stand between buyers and sellers people often seem unaware of this or feel that it is irrelevant perhaps because the intermediation often happens so fast that it is not consciously noticed taking the form of a mysterious background process that works just like magic it is from this background process however that the deepest politics and potentialities of digital payment all stem politics and potential of remote intermediation so what are those politics and potentialities the remote and intermediated nature of digital payment creates a number of initial features if you are far away from the person with whom you are trying to do business but you have access to telecommunications infrastructure you can pay without being physically near to them this is why digital payment is ideal for internet commerce but also for many other situations in which goods need to be supplied from afar for example a street vendor might wish to purchase goods from a wholesaler on the outskirts of the city without having to leave their stall to engage in a face to face transfer of cash if the cash distribution infrastructure has broken down does not work properly or is poorly developed e g a town with only one broken atm a person can still pay simply by having access to telecommunications the lack of physical possession of cash means it is hypothetically safer assuming you are not subject to fraud or hacking of your digital account unsgsa via flickr it is on these types of features that the mainstream of the financial inclusion community initially focuses this includes groups such as the bill melinda gates foundation the omidyar network cgap the better than cash alliance and a host of others that present digital money as safer or more convenient for customers and more efficient for vendors who can potentially process more digital transactions more securely academics in the field have produced studies on the interpersonal and psychological dynamics of having cash on hand versus having money in bank datacenters while various financial technology start ups highlight the apparently lower costs of providing digital infrastructure to reach rural areas where there may be no atms or bank branches in general these groups point to a world in which digital payment overcomes the limitations of cash to enable an expansion of trading opportunities the key trend has been to cast digital finance technologies as being a force for financial inclusion and economic growth either in terms of providing people at the bottom of the pyramid with some basic tool to prevent some hardship associated with cash or to give them access to the benefits of a digital economy from which they are otherwise excluded spreading the digital net the inclusion story is largely framed in terms of an aspirational modernism the story goes roughly as follows wealth sophistication and advancement are associated with having access to the latest technologies and the latest technologies are all digital people in large wealthy cities are the early adopters of these technologies and they are on the top rungs of a global digital economy that provides benefits to an international in group the aim thus should be to give people outside it the tools to enter that in group to share in the benefits this story is running in the background of many media reports political speeches and corporate advertising regarding financial technology and it is a very alluring one but inclusion is a slippery term for example imagine that there is an exclusive club of which you need membership to get into some people are included and others are excluded promoting inclusion in this setting could mean two things it could mean relaxing the elite membership requirements to allow more people to enter or it could mean keeping the membership requirements the same while trying to help people to enter by giving them tools and training consider for example the debate in the uk about how to get more marginalized groups into top universities such as oxford and cambridge there is an implicit recognition that political leadership and the economic system in the uk are dominated by socio economic elites from those universities but rather than breaking down that structural elitism many efforts rather aim to squeeze a slightly more diverse range of people into those elite circles the financial inclusion community has a similar problem there is an implicit recognition that the global economy is characterized by hierarchical inequality with a global geopolitical hierarchy of nations and then a hierarchy of class divisions within each of those nations at the pinnacle are the urban professional classes in major cities like new york san francisco london tokyo and so on especially those within finance and technology circles it is largely unquestioned whether the mainstream large scale digital economy that they preside over is a good thing and the objective is not to break down the basic hierarchy within it rather the goal of inclusion is to bring more people into the digital net but in the subordinated position of someone who passively accepts and uses the technology developed by those in the major global cities if you are operating under the assumption that it is a good thing to spread dependence on digital payment there are several avenues to pursue give people access to bank accounts or alternatively to accounts with digital payments providers built on top of the banking sector give them a means to communicate with those institutions remotely through digital communications mobile devices apps and so on give people new means to prove who they are identity verification when opening those accounts or when communicating with the banks or companies who host those accounts phase out the alternative means of payment cash some of the most controversial stories in the global south are related to this process a well known example is the indian government s 2016 demonetization program in which key banknotes were withdrawn from circulation causing major economic disruption for many poorer people who relied upon cash the modi government initially presented the program as a measure to combat black money corruption and crime but later spun the story into one of aspirational digital modernism a tale of a bright desirable and convenient cashless future that people would be pushed into whether they wanted to go or not the very day after the modi government announced the program digital payments companies raced to run fawning front page newspaper advertisements praising his actions paytm for example plastered a full page advert on the front of the times of india and the hindustan times stating paytm congratulates honorable prime minister sh narendra modi on taking the boldest decision in the financial history of independent india join the revolution the same underlying message is also championed through india s colossal aadhar biometrics program the world s largest which has similarly been framed in terms of financial inclusion and modernization to open accounts for digital payment people need to verify their identity and biometrics have been pitched as a way for non literate or marginalized people to do just that the official indian government line runs closely to the commercial interests of the digital financial sector and these are but two of myriad politicized programs around the world to promote a shift to digital payment and banking and which intersect with myriad private sector corporate efforts to do the same often with the support of major international development institutions where banking services among poorer communities are poorly developed there has been a push to leapfrog over traditional banking with mobile intermediaries plugged into the banking infrastructure for example m pesa in kenya was built upon the safaricom mobile phone networks many people had sim cards but not bank accounts and the strategy was thus to turn a phone number into a rough equivalent of a bank account number while the phone company interfaced with the banking sector in the background in the zealous push for digital financial inclusion a number of key features of digital payment have been curiously glossed over or spun in one sided positive terms the intermediated nature of digital money means the intermediaries can watch your transactions and collect data about your everyday economic activities the intermediaries can block your transactions because you do not possess the money tokens on your person they can be expropriated or frozen by the institutions if the telecommunications or electrical infrastructure goes down or if the intermediaries experience a hardware or software failure you can be shut out the digitally connected nature of the infrastructure opens it up to whole new cybercrime attack vectors and malicious forms of hacking while the popular narrative in the financial technology industry is that people voluntarily opt for digital payment on closer inspection the story is a lot less clear put bluntly digital payment facilitates a vast new frontier of financial surveillance and control while also exposing users to new risks not present in the cash infrastructure initially critical reflection on these negative potentials was avoided by the promoters of digital finance because the first phase of most digital products is additive digital services are added to an existing situation and so initially represent an exciting new option for example an economy that previously only had access to cash gets a new digital option which opens up a field of creative possibilities these may be used to get around some old problems albeit introducing some new ones or alternatively they may make an earlier form seem like a problem in comparison to use an analogy you do not see a wood fire for heating as a problem until your neighbor is given electricity the addition thus generally seems like a positive force it is only in the later phases of these systems when the new form establishes itself and spreads wide enough to begin to choke out the older systems that it begins to get monopoly power in the case of digital payment this spreading towards monopolization process has been pushed by various factors while the popular narrative in the financial technology industry is that people voluntarily opt for digital payment on closer inspection the story is a lot less clear first we see concerted political efforts to demonize cash through outright propaganda sometimes from state bodies such as modi s government in india but often by large commercial payments companies such as visa that have a commercial interest in getting rid of cash in a 2016 press release for example visa overtly stated that it had a long term strategy to make cash peculiar by 2020 then we see attempts to incentivize digital payment for example visa has a program of rewarding small trendy businesses such as boutique coffee shops in key urban areas to go cashless and thereby spread the message and norms of digital payment to their customers who could include for example the innovation journalists media pundits and consultants who will spread the message further then there are attempts to make cash harder to use which has the effect of making digital payment seem relatively attractive inspiring people to choose it for example banks shut down atm services and thereby make cash more inconvenient then there are all the corporate and state backed attempts to upgrade and introduce infrastructure to make digital payment more feasible and attractive these processes cause many subtle network effects and feedback loops to kick in as the economic and cultural landscape of payment choices begins to shift banks payments companies and states use evidence of that shift to push even people who do not wish to use digital payment into using it as further investment goes into digital financial services rather than physical ones and de investment occurs in non digital branches and atms people start to get in relative terms penalized for using cash and begin to be seen as nuisances by shop owners and presented as luddites in news reports or popular media people find themselves coerced or nudged into using digital payment what is really going on however is a process of expanding the digital financial net which is basically a process of consolidating the collective power of the banking sector the commercial payments industry that is built upon it and the technology companies that provide the apps and interfaces into that system while individual banks might have private battles with each other and with financial technology companies over who gets what slice of the digital finance pie in general the shift is driven by financial institutions desire to automate their processes in order to cut costs expand their reach and extract ever more data about ever more customers in other words financial institutions desire to automate is not contingent upon what their customers want but is rather an intrinsic internal drive that they justify by pointing to customer segments such as millennials who are early adopters of digital finance while digital finance is initially presented as an additional option in the longer term it really involves eliminating the competing non digital options reducing choice rather than adding to it thus towns of mainly retirees in rural uk have bank branches and atms shut down because banks can optimize profit by forcing them to use digital banking while telling them that it is millennials who are driving the change william morris cc0 public domain as digital payment takes over and cash is further demonized and discredited the story about digital financial inclusion becomes more acute if there is general consensus among the powers that be that digital represents progress and if there is ever increasing evidence of more dependence on digital finance much of it engineered by financial institutions themselves then the risk of being excluded for not using it is greater than ever and the task of providing access to it becomes seen as more noble than ever nowhere is this circular dynamic better illustrated than in the agenda and operations of the better than cash alliance an initiative run under the auspices of the united nations capital development fund but funded by visa mastercard citibank bill melinda gates foundation omidyar network usaid and a host of international corporations and mainstream ngos the alliance fluctuates between talking about the additive benefits of introducing digital payment and demonizing cash to promote the elimination of the competing option they work hard to establish as common sense the idea that digital payments are empowering modern and aspirational and presenting cash as outdated dangerous a weight on the economy and a friend to the criminal underworld empowerment in this framing involves ensuring everyone becomes incorporated into the widening digital financial net demonization of immorality the promoters of digital finance cannot forever skirt the question of the surveillance and data extraction that accompanies digital payment in general however the strategy has been to spin surveillance as transparency and to emphasize it as a tool to root out corruption and criminal transactions data extraction is also heralded as a positive step towards providing more general financial services such as credit scoring for loans for example safaricom and the commercial bank of africa launched the m shwari loan system which uses payments data from the loan recipients m pesa accounts to work out credit scores there is no denying the localized and individual benefits that certain digital finance interventions can have the point here is not to dismiss the efforts of initiatives like m shwari but rather to point out the one sided discourse that they are used to support examples like m shwari are spun into the service of a broader project of promoting the general industry interests of large scale technology and financial corporations the overarching discourse has become one that is disdainful towards economic informality and small scale economies and uncritical of large scale systems co ordinated through major corporate and government institutions the latter are implicitly presented as exemplars of progress while informal arrangements unmonitored interactions and sprawling and unpredictable networks of peer to peer relationships are seen as the realm of backwardness crime and failure we are thus left with an official story in which progress entails phasing out cash and transitioning people to dependence upon architectures of digital payments that can be used to monitor them discipline them reward them market to them and influence them this is all justified by an assertion that such an architecture will provide benefits will be cheaper to run will be safer will upgrade people into the modern world will use peoples data to give them wider access to services and will be a force for social hygiene above all it is a story in which informal relationships are dissolved and replaced with institutionally mediated relationships thereby cleansing informality this is the gentrification of payments gentrifying towards control of course it is only when this digital net fully assumes a monopoly position that its negative potentials really start to shine through nowhere is this potential more apparent than in china s new social credit system a programme in development to monitor citizens in order to provide them with reputation scores or to threaten them with possible assignment to blacklists the apparent aim is to create a carrot and stick system that rewards those who follow official conventions and behave correctly and penalizes those who do not barring them from services such as air travel if they deviate the details of the system being built are opaque and still subject to speculation but reports indicate that it is being built in conjunction with digital payments companies such as wechat or will integrate with the pre existing credit scoring data and payments data from major digital financial companies like ant financial parent company of the alipay system data is not used only for inclusion it is used for exclusion while the chinese social credit system looms in the western imagination like an episode from a science fiction movie this process of digital monitoring scoring tracking and steering is occurring all over the world often explicitly endorsed by liberal democratic states that wish to promote the industry interests of finance and technology corporations the gentrification of payments is one key strand of this overall process it is a fragmented partially completed but nevertheless calculated program to steer people into a digital financial net that may offer them short term narrow benefits while simultaneously exposing them to large scale collective threats that are systematically downplayed it is time for civil

snc lavalin affair is drawing international scrutiny as the oecd monitors allegations that the canadian government tried to politically interfere in the criminal prosecution of snc lavalin the attention from the oecd s anti bribery unit has drawn further criticism of justin trudeau on the world stage meanwhile here in ottawa the opposition is outraged their efforts to bring jody wilson raybould back to testify a second time have made no progress they say it s a cover up joining me now from toronto is canada s ambassador to the united states and a senior advisor to justin trudeau david macnaughton welcome to the show ambassador ambassador david macnaughton thank you very much good to be here story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson you advised justin trudeau on the snc lavalin affair you were hunkered down in his office for a day when you were visiting ottawa giving him advice how is the prime minister handling the fallout from the scandal ambassador david macnaughton well i think you know to begin with i was in ottawa to talk to the prime minister about a variety of things including the things that are really important in terms of my primary function which is to deal with canada s most important economic relationship and that is with the united states so we talked about 232 tariffs and the approval of the new nafta agreement and a variety of things and obviously because of my relationship with the prime minister you know he sought my advice on other matters also and you know i m happy to do so but you know i am really focused on trying to get rid of 232 tariffs and to do the things that i need to do in terms of improving our relationship with the united states mercedes stephenson and i do want to get to those tariffs later on but he gave a press conference later that week after you advised him do you think he should have apologized ambassador david macnaughton do you know i think the prime minister seeks advice from a variety of people and i was quite happy to give my advice and it was private advice and it will stay that way and then he as i found frequently makes up his own mind makes his own decisions and he did what he did and i think we ll you know we ve got a budget coming up next week there are an awful lot of things on the agenda and i know he s pretty focused on all those things story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson in 2015 you were one of the liberal campaign co chairs the campaign was about transparency about doing politics differently many are looking at what happened here and the access the powerful have to the prime minister s office and the allegations being made and they re questioning if this is the stereotypical old style liberal politics what do you say to voters who are heading to the polls and say this isn t what we voted for ambassador david macnaughton well i m not saying anything to voters you know i have in my position i have to be non partisan and have said i was going to be and i will be but i should also say that you know one of the things that you know was campaigned on when i was in that position was also improving our relationship with the united states securing our access to the u s market expanding opportunities for canadian business and canadians to do business abroad and i think you know we worked really hard at that and i know for sure i have the last two years have been as challenging a time physically emotionally and every other way in terms of trying to make sure that canadians had continued to have opportunities to have open and free access to our largest market 72 per cent of our exports go to the united states and so that s really been the focus of my attention and i m quite proud of what we ve done mercedes stephenson well let s turn our attention to that when it comes to usmca some of the democrats have been suggesting that they are not at all in favour of it and they may not sign on to it what reassurances do you have that usmca is actually going to happen story continues below advertisement ambassador david macnaughton well you know in the u s system there s never any particularly these days there s never any guarantee about what outcomes are going to come out of washington but i m quite confident that it will pass through eventually particularly if the americans remove the 232 tariffs on canada and mexico you know when you look at it in and i have said to democrats who ve asked me about the agreement you know there is a labour chapter there is an environment chapter in the rules of origin 70 per cent comes from the content comes from north america there s a clause that talks about you know 16 an hour wages it s all of these things are new things there s you know the elimination of some of the isds provisions i mean all of these things are things that i know many democrats have been asking for and seeking over the last several years and they re actually in the agreement now one can always argue whether the provisions are perfect but i don t think one should let the perfect get in the way of the good and this is a good agreement it s a good agreement for canada and i think the americans will come to the realization when it actually comes to a vote that it s a good deal for them too and you know a lot of the people you hear talking about how difficult it is going to be to get it through the u s congress are people that are selling their services to business saying that they would like to help get it through and you know having been in that business once before in my life i sometimes take all of those comments with a grain of salt i m confident that when it comes to a vote you know the u s congress will pass it that s up to them to do but i think you know when asked by members of congress i ve told them what i think are the benefits of the agreement and it s a good deal story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson but ambassador back in february you said that you were convinced the tariffs would be lifted on steel and aluminum in the next few weeks but you were pretty confident that as well that hasn t happened do you have any indication that those tariffs on steel and aluminum are drawing to an end ambassador david macnaughton i continue to be confident that they will be removed within the next few weeks my position hasn t changed it s just that the few weeks of mercedes stephenson why are you confident about that the email you need for the day s top news stories from canada and around the world ambassador david macnaughton well because i think you know if you look even yesterday i mean senator grassley who is the chairman of the senate finance committee so he s a pretty powerful guy in the united states system and he was saying you know that these tariffs need to go and that he does not believe that the trade agreement will get passed unless these tariffs are removed and not only is he believes they should because they re harming u s businesses u s consumers u s communities that s why i m confident it s not just because you know i think we ve done a good job of improving our relationship with the united states it s also that these tariffs are hurting them you know for 16 years in a row the united states has had a surplus in steel with canada last year the united states had an 835 million deficit with canada in steel trade so for those who say to me well the tariff program s working it s not really working very well because u s exports to canada and steel went down by 800 million last year story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson ambassador macnaughton thank you so much for your time today ambassador david macnaughton that s why i think it s going to get approved no problem at all thanks mercedes mercedes stephenson up next why is kevin vickers the hero from parliament hill adding his name to new brunswick s liberal leadership race mercedes stephenson welcome back he was hailed as the hero on parliament hill for helping to end the attack there nearly five years ago kevin vickers was the sergeant at arms at the time he then went on to become canada s ambassador to ireland and since former new brunswick premier brian gallant has announced that he s leaving as liberal leader for the province many have been urging kevin vickers to step up and join the leadership race i spoke to mr vickers friday shortly after he announced his decision story continues below advertisement welcome to the show kevin welcome back to canada kevin vickers hi mercedes very nice to hear you mercedes stephenson before we begin i wanted to touch on what happened in christ church this past week obviously you had such a personal and close experience with that on parliament hill your thoughts on the events in christ church kevin kevin vickers obviously mercedes these are always tragic and troubling events that happen i guess it s the dark side of humanity i guess we just have to realize that from time to time the lesser good is going to come forth in us you know in my rcmp career i ve taken confessions from 17 men who ve killed people and their backgrounds and what they ve went through in their lives was always troubling to me but if i learned anything from the incident in ottawa i had occasion to be at the simon wiesenthal center to see a young druze mother receive her husband s award posthumously he was killed in a terrorist attack in jerusalem but just prior to the attack they were married and she delivered their fourth son and she started her speech like this i do not seek revenge nor do i hate these gentlemen for i want our son to know the power of forgiveness and the weakness of hate so i m always hopeful having heard that and learned that that having that power and that great side of humanity will overcome these things and be better off overall story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson do you think that politicians here in canada are doing enough to condemn the kind of hate that drives these attacks kevin vickers well i think we in canada is a really shining light among the constellation of nations canada as i ve travelled around europe as the ambassador of canada to ireland wherever i go we re so looked up to that people so cherish and value our country and our values so i think canada is out there in the forefront mercedes we really have something magical going here we re a nation of immigrants other than of course our first aboriginal peoples but we have something very great going on here i used to call it the great canadian experiment and here we are peoples from all over the world getting along with one another we canadians have a lot to be very very proud of mercedes stephenson and part of that pride i imagine being reflected in your decision to run for liberal leader tell us about how you decided to make the big dive into politics kevin vickers well this first came about with phone calls from my friends in the canadian community as well as some english friends asking me to think about it briefly in the beginning i thought it was a compliment but the more i looked into it the more passionate and driven i became about it you know having worked across canada and in the senior executive of the rcmp as well as being the sergeant at arms at the house of commons and my experience as ambassador i was able to gain the vast experience in a wide range of areas and it s my turn to pay back to this wonderful province i was i have so much to be thankful for coming from a place like this this province is a great province with great people and it s my turn to pay back and i offer myself and my service to the province and to the citizens of this province story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson one of the big questions i think people at home might have is whether you are pro or anti energy east if that were to raise its head again kevin vickers well energy east and all these issues what i ve been doing mercedes the last few weeks is driving around listening to all new brunswickers in every part of the province and i will continue to do that and consult with caucus and consult with the liberal party to come up with specific things i guess the only thing that i find a little bit confusing with energy east is i m not sure who would champion that my understanding is trans canada pipeline is no longer interested my sense is as well irving oil is no longer interested so i think it would be very important to identify as to who is actually going to build and are they going to come forward to make the east coast pipeline a viable action mercedes stephenson and you ve just come back from ireland where you were the ambassador i m curious to know your thoughts on what s going to happen with brexit in the coming days there kevin vickers well brexit is very worrisome and very troublesome ireland just finished celebrating i think it s the 30 year history of the good friday agreements which brought peace to northern ireland and ireland and a big part of that agreement was the free movement of people and good that people from the south ireland could go up to northern ireland and vice versa and share european passports and it was a vital thing which canada played a role general john de chastelain again canada being at the forefront of those serious situations but should there be a hard brexit it ll be very difficult to avoid what is called a hard border and if that interrupts the movement of people and goods the danger is that we could very quickly fall back into the tensions that had been so troubling in the past story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson kevin vickers that s all the time we have for today but thank you so much for joining us sir kevin vickers thank you very much mercedes mercedes stephenson up next the federal government brings down the budget on tuesday we ll unpack the politics behind the pre election budget mercedes stephenson welcome back on tuesday the federal government will announce its last budget before the fall election what can we expect to see joining me now is josh wingrove from bloomberg news and our own chief political correspondent david akin welcome to the show gentlemen david what are you expecting to see in the budget this year david akin i think we re just going to see an extension of the narrative we ve heard from this government throughout its term which is this budget will be all about the middle class and those who wanted to join it we expect there to be some new spending programs or additions to existing spending programs all within the framework as one source in the pmo mentioned the other day a responsible fiscal track which says to me that we re still not going to hear about balanced budgets that debt to gdp ratio will still be the rough anchor but i think it s going to disappoint some fiscal conservatives who would have liked to see a return to balance story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson well and josh this is a government that has not been afraid to have run a deficit and run a substantially larger one than they had initially promised do you think they re going to pull it back a little bit this year or is the feeling just go full boar ahead and keep spend spend spending josh wingrove well you know i guess we ll see but the revenues are really good the money s been pouring in to federal coffers so if they wanted to tighten their belts would have some reason to do that but on the flipside the economy is not as great as we once thought it was the most recent data other than jobs numbers looks pretty crummy and so economists across the country would say they have cover fire to spend even more believe it or not so they can really try to spin this both ways i agree with david i think we ll see sort of a continued track this government just simply doesn t seem to believe the people care about deficits and they might be right and i ll put my bloomberg hat on in saying canada s deficits aren t that big by global standards so they re manageable so i don t think we ll see a lot of that i think we ll see a lot of goodies in the window they ve talked about pharmacare they ve hinted at maybe help for first time home buyers or new help skills training will be a big thing so we re going to see all that things you can put on a placard in an election campaign and hand to a voter story continues below advertisement david akin yeah the homebuyer s thing i think is interesting because the biggest group of voters in 2019 will be millennials for the first time bigger than boomers millennials people 19 to 37 and many of them are looking to buy a home have been frustrated by previous changes that the finance department made to tighten restrictions on first time home buyers so to the extent that there s something to address that that could be politically interesting and on the other hand we saw some data this week remember this that shows household debt in canada is actually moving a little higher and assets of households is dropping and that may have some a bit worried that should we be goosing up or loosening home buying restrictions when in fact we re seeing some issues around household debt get worse mercedes stephenson well i know we re all going to be keeping a close on the budget something else happening on budget day which is completely unrelated will be the decision on whether or not jody wilson raybould s able to return to the justice committee to testify again the liberals shut the committee down this week they punted it to tuesday when the budget is happening and will be an in camera meeting which means behind closed doors smart strategy or dumb strategy josh wingrove well behind two sets of closed doors because the press will be locked up in a budget lockup at the same time so even if they wanted to get there impossible story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson safely out of the way josh wingrove i think that they are trying to ride it out i think that wednesday was a trial balloon to see hey if we brazenly cut this meeting short what happens so i you know i m sure they re polling over the weekend right now to see how that goes but there will be continued pressure to get jody wilson raybould to talk about what happened after she was attorney general but still in cabinet this government simply doesn t seem to have an appetite to want her to do that david akin and this has been going on since what february the 20th when our friends at the globe first broke this josh wingrove february 7th i think david akin february 7th pardon me 20th was when we first heard some testimony that s right mercedes stephenson well over a month now josh wingrove it feels like years david akin so you wonder about the issues management strategy inside the pmo as i ve heard some people who have done issues management usually the goal of issues management is to make the issue go away and to the extent that the liberals haven t figured out how do we pull jody wilson raybould and or jane philpott back in the tent and figure something out here it finds me it strikes me as very odd and until they do there s lots of i think the opposition s going to keep beating them up some liberals are unhappy not you know majority but there are some liberals unhappy with the way their prime minister is behaving here and in an election year when you re looking for volunteers and donors who are excited about your guy even any weakening of that enthusiasm is an issue for the liberal party as it seeks re election story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson well and josh you re the business guy there s been this josh wingrove i fake it a bit mercedes stephenson there s been this big question very well though josh wingrove well thank you mercedes stephenson very convincing this big question about whether or not there was any evidence snc lavalin actually would go under and it doesn t seem the government s been able to produce a single study anything other than the company saying this even though about a third of their business is in canada the rest is elsewhere how big of a problem does that become for the liberals if they keep saying jobs jobs jobs but they can t produce any evidence that it was about jobs josh wingrove yeah people are going to want to know remember a lot of these jobs are engineers and this kind of thing so if the company was taken you d still need engineers you wouldn t buy a company that an engineering company that did not do any engineering and even if they weren t those engineers might get hired by other firms so there s a lot of questions about whether those job numbers are real one of the other fears was the company could move the company could be vulnerable mercedes stephenson right the headquarters story continues below advertisement josh wingrove to a takeover yes absolutely if they were scared about that and i think there s some question as to whether they ve had grounds to be but if they were that fear is amplified now because the company is more vulnerable to takeover if you measure it just on their share price that it was when all this was happening mercedes stephenson do you think that makes a dpa more likely right now because they re not ruling it out it s still on the table david akin i suppose i mean there are some who say that david lametti the current justice minister who replaced jody wilson raybould has already told the dpp the director of public prosecutions to start negotiating i would assume snc lavalin that s kind of a material event that we re negotiating and they re going to have to tell us but nonetheless there s a lot of thinking about this and one other thing to point out i think mercedes is right across the river behind us quebecers are looking at this in a fundamentally different way than english canada is quebecers believe quebec inc is under attack by english canada that snc lavalin is being singled out because it s from quebec and whether that s right or wrong or people in quebec are just whatever i think that s a problem for a federal party to manage that we re going to have issues we ve seen albertans are upset at the rest of the country because of oil and gas now quebecers are upset at the rest of the country and that starts to some cracks and fissures that the governing party the liberals or a party that wants power conservatives new democrats are all going to have to deal with it josh wingrove the company also isn t making the same warnings publicly that we know now they were making privately to the trudeau government so if they were telling the trudeau government that we re worried about jobs they re not saying that publicly right now they re in fact saying they re sort of moving on they re focused on fighting the charges fighting their court case rather than pressing for a dpa but if one fell from the sky i m sure they d take it story continues below advertisement mercedes stephenson we just have a few seconds left but david jody wilson raybould some are saying could speak in parliament she could stand up in the house and be protected by parliamentary privilege do you think that s something there s going to be increasing pressure for her to do david akin i think there s pressure on it i think she has to make decisions does she want to be essentially challenged is quite publicly challenging her leader in an election year does she want to lead an independent rump of liberal mps who are disgruntled for any number of reasons and that s a big choice to make mercedes stephenson well she was just confirmed on thursday as the liberal candidate for her riding so she s staying in david akin and that can be any time by the leader so you know we ll see but she has some thinking to do as well with her supporters mercedes stephenson okay well that s all the time we have for today thank you both very much for joining us and of course we ll keep an eye on the budget and jody wilson raybould this week josh wingrove thank you mercedes stephenson that s our show for today thanks for joining us i m mercedes stephenson see you next week
ken ofori atta finance minister ken ofori atta says the free fall of the cedi especially against the american dollar is to be contained in the coming days with the coming on board of the us 750 million bridge agreement and us 3 billion eurobond i am very confident the reversal is going to occur we have about us 300 million coming in from cocobod and another us 600 million also from cocobod in about a month or so we have officially launched our eurobond which will be us 3 billion and that should close within the next couple of weeks mr ofori atta declared in a bid to halt the cedi s steep fall against the dollar the central bank has also intimated a willingness to inject us 800 million into the economy to shore up the ailing currency the cedi has fared badly against us dollar selling between ghc5 55 and ghc5 75 in 2018 at this time the cedi sold at ghc4 42 depreciating by 8 4 per cent and in january 2017 sold at ghc4 27 although importers have expressed grave concern over the depreciation of the cedi against the us dollar and the pound the finance minister holds that how governments structurally balance imports and exports has been the big challenge on folks describing the cedi as a worthless currency hon ofori atta noted inflation is at a single digit which is good growth has been string six per cent through the third quarter of last year our budget deficit has gone down in a strong way and we are also getting surpluses in our current account meanwhile its evident government faces a financing crunch brought about by the disinterest of non resident investors to buy up its debt securities hastening the cedi s depreciation

singing accents tendernesses hesitantly reach toward the earth from space and country lanes are showing these unexpected subtle risings that find expression in the empty trees early spring by rainer maria rilke translated from the german when i see mexican flags waved at pro immigration demonstrations i sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment when i m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car i feel a certain resentment barack obama in the audacity of hope trump and his minions are right to say that there s a crisis at the border or at least there s a humanitarian crisis not as trump alleges a big security crisis yes thousands of refugees including many families with young children are pouring onto the border to escape violence and poverty in their home nations some naïve liberals push the idea that all these people should be allowed to enter and stay in the united states no that would encourage even more throngs to try to come in there are serious socio economic problems of unrestricted immigration including that it depresses lower and middle income wages and can destabilize american communities rich businesspeople have loved how illegal immigration lets them keep wages low it can take years to fully integrate immigrants into communities especially those who arrive speaking little english the sudden arrival of large numbers of people with cultures very different from that of most native born americans causes stress and resentment and spawns demagoguery immigration should be gradual the democrats may well lose the next presidential election if they don t get more hard headed about the political economic and social effects of america s immigration problem of course many probably most immigrants bring a hearty work ethic and some turn out to be brilliant entrepreneurs but we urgently need to regain better control of our borders in the long run no borders no country the immigration invasions of the united states and western europe in recent years have also of course helped fuel right wing populism with its strong aroma of racism hillary clinton accurately said last fall i think europe needs to get a handle on migration because that is what lit the flame of anti democratic right wing populism ditto america the most economical fairest and reliable way to address the current immigrant crisis besides hiring more border patrol people immigration judges and social workers to process asylum seekers and in some stretches putting up walls is to make life better in central america through greatly expanded economic and security aid it s in the enlightened self interest of the united states to create a sort of marshall plan for honduras guatemala and el salvador so that so many people there don t feel they must flee north but trump wants to cut foreign aid to central america as i ve often written the insatiable u s hunger for illicit drugs is a prime destabilizer in central america a lot of these drugs flow through that region giving great power to local drug gangs whose violence in turn leads many people to head north and the overdependence on monoculture agriculture encouraged by many decades of economic dominance by american companies backed up in the past by u s military forces has also helped make these countries more fragile we re the author of some of their problems some of which eventually become our problems in any event some of the more progressive democrats better start paying more attention to voters very understandable fears about immigration view larger many of us are working on taxes now and unfairly cursing the internal revenue service but do not blame those hard working agents congress and presidents are the parents of the internal revenue code the irs has the unenviable task of trying to enforce the mess much of which originates on k street in washington the epicenter of lobbying meanwhile to please the rich folks including tax avoider in chief donald trump who run america and have been given big tax cuts and other tax avoidance goodies by republicans on capitol hill irs funding and staffing have been slashed making it ever more difficult to deter tax fraud thus for example the rate of auditing of households with annual incomes of more than 10 million has fallen by two thirds since 2011 so we ve been in a golden age for tax fraud and the victims are honest taxpayers who must offset some of the huge loss of revenue to pay for essential public services and infrastructure and of course the lack of revenue helps increase the gigantic national debt which eventually forces interest rates to rise the price of admission americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear windows of their automobiles the late university of pennsylvania historian and social critic paul fussell in his 1983 book class a guide through the american status system who s prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise from cole porter s love for sale the sort of bribery fraud and related corruption that some rich and powerful and anxious upper middle class parents engage in to get their kids into the most prestigious private colleges as dramatically reported last week was no surprise it s a sign of an increasingly feudal society owned by a self perpetuating elite in the case disclosed last week it was individuals who were charged with the corruption but of course the fancy colleges themselves have long taken bribes themselves to admit the children of rich parents such as harvard s admitting jared kushner to harvard college after a 2 5 million donation by his father charles kushner okay there s some good in all this since some of these bribes may end up as scholarship money for poor and middle class kids and not just as a building with bronze plaques honoring rich donors for being rich but most students at these schools range from affluent to very rich what might reduce the tendency of ivy league and other prestigious colleges to be handmaidens for the rich would be more resources for public state universities many of which have suffered big cuts in public funding in recent years with more tax money obviously they d be more academically and socially competitive with the most prestigious private institutions which depend overwhelmingly on private money this would curb a bit the power of private money and privilege in american higher education and dilute the allure of name private colleges it s the obsession with status and the drive to maintain and strengthen socio economic connections with other members of the elite gaining high paying future jobs among other perks that explain the ferocity which these families strive to get their kids into the right schools the funny thing is that with some exceptions e g pre meds once you get into these schools it can very easy to graduate indeed just about everyone does these days with a 70 000 a year price tag colleges are loath to offend kids by flunking them out which would also irritate rich parents who might otherwise consider giving a few million

rightly condemned for her anti semitic outbursts including saying that israeli influence in american politics is all about the benjamins meaning 100 bills and denounced the powerful pro israel lobby

reviewing misdemeanors greg berman writes in governing com that law enforcement and urban life would benefit from a rethinking of misdemeanor justice that would result in what he calls pre court diversion for many people stopped for such offenses as disorderly conduct graffiti trespassing etc this would reduce the load in the courts and just might reduce the number of repeat offenders he writes of a new approach taken by new york city while the nypd has not disavowed the need to fix broken windows which emphasizes the importance of public order and aesthetics approach and its focus on an orderly urban environment since 2010 the department has reduced the number of misdemeanor arrests by 36 percent the city council has advanced the ball still further effectively re routing a number of low level violations such as public urination and unreasonable noise from criminal to civil court another important piece in the puzzle is pre court diversion in new york police and prosecutors with the help of the center for court innovation and other nonprofits are now offering individuals arrested for selected misdemeanors including shoplifting and trespassing a chance to avoid going to court altogether participants who successfully complete a restorative justice cycle or a class with a local artist focusing on positive self expression leave the process without a criminal record a recent evaluation of the program known as project reset found that cases were resolved 72 percent faster and participants had fewer new arrests compared to those who experienced conventional prosecution what seems to have worked well in gotham might not work well in other cities but it s worth looking into it could save the justice system a lot of money among other things while perhaps

and spy in the revolutionary war and was executed by the british for his brave work he s the official state hero of connecticut the other is the unfortunately named hooker hotel built in 1887 where in some of its later years some women of that age old profession were known to ply their wares in fact the building is named for the respectable seth chauncey hooker its developer both the hotels were what used to be called railroad hotels they were close to the train stations in their towns or cities and were heavily used by salesmen such as willy loman the sad protagonist of the play death of a salesman most of these hotels have long since disappeared with the demise of rail passenger service to many towns and even cities and its replacement by car travel aided and abetted by the interstate highway system the rise of car culture led to most hotels and motels being built away from downtowns on suburban shopping strips and or close to the nearest interstate with lots of parking marriotts

larger fall river mayor jasiel correia whom a federal grand jury has indicted for fraud was recalled with a vote of 61 percent and then quickly re elected in a march 12 special election this bizarre outcome can be explained by a combination of his apparently having a cult of voters who admire his charisma or at least hutzpah and manic energy but mostly by low voter turnout in a very crowded field of five candidates correia got 4 808 votes there are 45 519 registered voters in fall river only about 12 740 deigned to vote in the march 12 election the nonvoters will continue to complain about

additional 73 months though 30 will run concurrently with the impressively materialistic and greedy manafort s other sentence still many people who have committed far less important crimes have gone to jail for longer stretches judges still often favor people of socio economic privilege perhaps in part because judges especially federal ones tend to come from privilege themselves manafort appeared

disability might be he says it s gout a look at manafort s career as well as the college admissions scandal reflects the growing corruption and arrogance of parts of the u s ruling class and it s part

the political tension between kosovo and serbia is creating a perfect environment for turkey and russia the two countries vie for luring the two balkan neighbors into their respective spheres of influence meanwhile high ranking u s and eu envoys are trying to resolve the long standing dispute they urge serbia and kosovo to normalize relations when these are in fact becoming more tense serbia s refusal to recognize kosovo s borders prevent the latter from joining international organizations such as interpol and unesco in addition reneging on a 2011 freedom of movement agreement prompted kosovo to take direct action against serbia by imposing a 100 tariff on goods from serbia fake news in an effort to take full advantage of the continuing discord between the two countries russia s and turkey s propaganda machines went full throttle they spread false reports that the united states threatened to withdraw its troops from kosovo if the tax is not suspended what makes matters worse is that not only are serbia and kosovo generally vulnerable to fake news online generated by russia and turkey the balkan countries corrupt leaders continue to fall for it but those political elites are not just easily manipulated by russia and turkey they also use their own disinformation in order to influence their own publics both russia and turkey may well accelerate their disinformation campaign as the 20th anniversary of nato s bombing of yugoslavia approaches ultimately kosovars and serbians would do well to recognize that they are paying the price for the political squabbling that seems to benefit neither country they have become pawns in the feast feeding russia s and turkey s hunger to control the balkans the discord between the two countries manifests itself through the lives of the citizens of both states according to vilson kacoli from kosovo when i travel through serbia i am forced at the border to remove my car plates and pay a five euro fee for just crossing through serbia and to pay for highway toll they don t accept euros from us just serbian dinars while the serbians entering kosovo do not face these difficulties he along with most kosovars strongly support their prime minister for his refusal to revoke the tax under any circumstances pouring in money meanwhile putin and erdogan have been working hard to strengthen their own ties with the balkans and are continuing to invest in major national projects strategically calculated to have the greatest economic and political impact throughout the region trade between turkey and the western balkans has dramatically increased from 430 million in 2002 to 3 billion in 2016 roughly one third of this trade was with serbia meanwhile in kosovo turkey is continuously investing in the most important sectors and privatizing kosovo s strategic assets turkish state development agency tika has renovated hundreds of historic monuments in kosovo financed local projects and organized large events designed to reinforce bonds with turkey russia s geostrategic interests in the western balkans in addition serbia s energy agency gave final approval for the construction of a branch of the turkish stream pipeline which will deliver russian natural gas into turkey and southern europe russia has geostrategic interests in the western balkans as well as in the mediterranean countries in the balkan states russia s interest rests on two considerations first the western balkans region has strategic importance as a transit route for russia s gas second moscow wants to preserve slavic roots and the orthodox religion in the region along with bilateral cultural and traditional values this is a promising strategy particularly as long the relationship between the eu and russia is tense and not likely to improve any time soon moreover the western balkan states offer low cost opportunities for russia to undertake a combination of political and economic measures to undermine the eu s geostrategic interests the nato dimension in 2016 for instance russia attempted to organize a coup in montenegro aimed at the overthrow of then prime minister milo djukanovic in order to prevent his country from joining nato last year putin tried to block the settlement of the conflict between greece and macedonia knowing that the solution would result in the latter s membership in nato while serbia is trying to balance their bilateral relations between russia and the eu other countries like kosovo and macedonia are more transparent in seeking europeanization russia has every intent of sowing discord to keep the balkan states from becoming eu members neither russia s nor turkey s activities and intentions in the balkans are hidden both countries are taking political steps to distance the balkans from the west be that for economic strategic or hegemonic reasons the two countries are relentless and brazen in their efforts and will do everything in their power to entrench themselves into these countries by the same token it is only a question of time when russia s and turkey s interests clash in the balkans conclusion given the eu s strategic interests in and the general orientation of the balkan states toward the west the eu should insist on democratic reforms and adherence to human rights against which it would speed up its efforts to support the socio economic conditions in these countries and accelerate the membership process this will provide the balkan states the confidence that their prospective membership is real by virtue of the eu s practical deeds and continuing political engagement which will give the balkan states diminishing incentives to accommodate either turkey s or russia s ambition to lure them into their orbit editor s

associated press the scope scale and cunning of the college admission conspiracy that has embroiled more than 50 elites including hollywood stars lori loughlin and felicity huffman ceos prominent lawyers and others is nothing short of higher education s bernie madoff moment madoff a crestfallen wall street investment titan spent more than 30 years besting the market in what was later revealed to be nothing more than an eye watering 65 billion ponzi scheme like the fbi investigation that unraveled the complex web of college admission cheaters who benefited from a coordinated network of corrupt college officials prominent coaches shadow test takers and proctors all working under the coordination of william rick singer as their ring leader deals a painful blow to the american ideal of meritocracy not unlike the long shadow cast by epic ponzi schemes like madoff s this scandal will make it hard to restore confidence in the system the general public sentiment that the upper echelons of the u s economy are rigged only to privatize gains when they are on top and socialize losses when they fall requiring a public bail out is being reinforced in both cases the cynic s view that meritocracy hard work authenticity and discipline are equally rewarded and cannot be bought or cheated rings untrue indeed that the cheat conspiracy also leveraged the complex and opaque tax system to avoid paying taxes under the guise of charitable donations only adds insult to a deep biting injury one that tarnishes vital institutions including paragons of u s higher education such as usc yale georgetown and stanford among others not long before the admissions cheat ring was broken and crestfallen actors and their plausibly unwitting children had to endure the walk of shame to appear in court and post bail america s other national pastime of class action lawsuits were getting in gear one particular case has generated a collective demand of 500 billion wherein non admitted students are seeking redress and equity the particularly damning aspect of this case and where it bears echoes of madoff s market beating returns which he perpetuated over the years by paying the earliest investors with the newest investor s money is that people were given rubber checks linked to an empty vault these same rubber checks have been handed to the school going public and the educational aspirants among them for whom the dream of a college education and the certain financial risks they undertake to achieve it for uncertain professional and social returns the economic risks of a college education has saddled a generation of graduates those whose parents and guardians do not enjoy the embarrassment of riches and the luxury of cheating like the 50 admission cheat conspirators with more than 1 5 trillion in debt meanwhile leaving the same bad taste of the socialization of losses and the privatization of gain the costs of higher education outpaces wage inflation in the u s by a factor of 8 making the attainment of the foundation of the american dream nearly impossible to reach add to this the growing disconnect between a college degree in most disciplines and its relevancy in a fast moving and rapidly eroding workforce where the vision of the future of work is not pretty and frustration is reaching a tipping point underworked and overburdened would be acceptable as it has been throughout u s history when the principles that hard work self determination and meritocracy serve as guiding forces indeed in earlier perhaps simpler times people might have accepted that the occasional robber baron or industrial magnate who endowed a university or added a wing to a library might have a preferred place in line or special access is one thing an egregious cheating ring of this variety however is so unseemly that it will surely engender a vindictive backlash when the dust settles higher education must ask itself hard questions about its admissions standards in the first place especially in a country where the educational system begins with a massive zip code lottery on where a decent public education can be had for the tax payer dollar and ends with a mafia like admissions cheating ring catering to the well heeled while this sad reality is certainly not true of all higher education and the elite institutions implicated in this scandal it should provoke system wide questions on restoring trust and removing the opacity that enabled this conspiracy to fester for so long like the metoo movement which has demanded a right sizing of justice and accountability irrespective of the legal statute of limitations this scandal risks blowing apart the cover of time that may have given hundreds of past cheaters comfort that they skirted by on the easy street indeed the quest for accountability has already cost higher education 500 million as the larry nassar sexual abuse case at michigan state university which paid a big percentage of its endowment as a legal settlement while the financial calculus could be damming in this college admissions case and the full cost is still unraveling as more names are likely to come out and more rings likely to be disclosed the reputational tarnish on higher education and the cottage industries surrounding it will take long to restore indeed more damning still is the risk that this scandal prompts a look back at prior graduates or among those graduates themselves as they question the value of their hard earned degrees as has become an uncomfortable reality following scandals of this nature how long the silence lasts before implicated institutions come forward with their plans and their discovery process will be telling while meritocracy may have taken a hit with these rather obvious and sad revelations the rest of us should take solace that even in an unfair and rigged system hard work personal pride and an attained education remain great equalizers
samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street taxes unpopular though they may be fund government services americans count on every day individual income taxes may be especially hated but they are also important accounting for 48 percent of federal tax revenue for the vast majority of states income taxes are also critical to governments balance sheets the result most americans pay income tax twice every year once to federal government and once to their state no two state tax codes are exactly alike however and there are a handful of states that manage to function without levying an individual income tax to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed state level tax codes using tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax foundation after you file how long should i keep my tax returns don t do these 10 common filing mistakes to avoid this year in the vast majority of states individual income taxes represent over 15 percent of annual tax revenue because income tax is such an important and reliable revenue source the states with no income tax make up for the lost potential revenue in other ways two states on this list for example have major tourist industries and raise revenue through higher than average sales taxes three other states that levy no income tax are rich in natural resources and are able to bring in additional revenue through taxes on mineral and gas extraction operations largely as a result despite the missed income tax revenue these states manage to balance their budget just as well as the average state and do not necessarily have higher debt on a per capita basis to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed the tax code in each state using the latest tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax foundation personal income per capita for each state is for 2016 and came from the u s bureau of economic analysis all other data came from the tax foundation s facts figures 2018 how does your state compare report 1 alaska 2016 personal income per capita 51 079 11th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 405 the lowest 2015 state debt per capita 7 757 4th highest largest source of tax revenue property tax 57 2 percent of total alaska is one of seven states that does not levy an individual income tax a resource rich state alaska is in a unique position to shift tax burdens to oil and gas extraction companies and off individual residents because of the revenue it derives from some of the largest oil fields in the united states not only does alaska not have an income tax but also it does not levy a sales tax resource extraction covers much of the cost of government services and allows the state to pay residents a dividend every year last year alaskans were paid 1 600 each from the state s permanent fund with no income or sales tax a disproportionately large share of total tax revenue in alaska comes from property tax state and local governments derived 57 2 percent of total tax revenue from property tax in fiscal 2015 far more than 31 1 percent national average 2 florida 2016 personal income per capita 44 541 15th lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 822 2nd lowest 2015 state debt per capita 1 643 6th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 35 7 percent of total states with no individual income tax make up for the lost potential revenue source in other ways florida is one of the most visited states in the country and as a result tourism generates enough revenue to cover much of the difference florida levies a 6 0 percent sales tax a higher rate than most other states and that rate is applied to residents as well as to the more than 100 million tourists who visit the sunshine state each year florida collected 1 079 per resident in sales taxes in fiscal 2016 far more than the average per capita sales tax revenue collected across all states of 898 while sales taxes are a significant component of the state s balance sheet florida derives most of its tax revenue from property taxes property taxes in the state account for 35 7 percent of overall tax revenue while sales taxes account for 34 2 percent 3 nevada 2016 personal income per capita 43 972 12th lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 2 730 24th highest 2015 state debt per capita 1 160 3rd lowest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 39 7 percent of total due in large part to revenue generated by nevada s tourism industry state residents do not pay state income tax clark county home to las vegas drew over 42 million visitors in 2018 leading to over 10 2 billion in gaming revenue alone nevada levies a 6 9 percent sales tax a higher sales tax rate than all but six other states with the higher than average sales tax rates paid by visitors and residents alike nevada collected the equivalent of 1 451 per person in sales tax alone in fiscal 2016 all but two other states nevada also generates more revenue per capita in excise taxes those levied on certain goods and activities like gasoline and gambling than every state other than vermont 4 south dakota 2016 personal income per capita 52 855 5th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 2 028 9th lowest 2015 state debt per capita 3 828 16th highest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 40 5 percent of total with no state income tax south dakota generates far less revenue on a per capita basis than most other states the state collected just 2 028 per resident in fiscal 2016 about 840 less than the average across all states sales tax accounts for the largest share of government tax revenue at 40 5 percent followed by property taxes which account for 36 percent because it collects so little in taxes federal aid accounts for a larger than typical share of south dakota s revenue federal assistance is typically dispersed to supplement state funding and support projects determined to be of national interest in south dakota federal dollars account for approximately 35 1 percent of revenue compared to the average of 22 5 percent across all states 5 texas 2016 personal income per capita 45 823 21st lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 868 3rd lowest 2015 state debt per capita 1 756 9th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 42 0 percent of total texas is one of several resource rich states that do not levy a tax on personal income the lone star state is home to 40 percent of u s proved oil reserves and it is able to leverage the energy industry to partially offset potential income tax revenue the state collected 3 4 billion in revenue from oil production and another 1 4 billion from natural gas production in its fiscal 2018 relatively high property taxes also help keep the texas state government funded homeowners in texas pay the equivalent of 1 7 percent of their property value in taxes per year more than in all but five other states partially as a result state and local governments collect the equivalent of 1 731 in property taxes per residents annually far more than the average of 1 518 per capita collection across all states 6 washington 2016 personal income per capita 50 640 14th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 3 060 16th highest 2015 state debt per capita 4 495 12th highest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 45 9 percent of total washington compensates for missed income tax revenue with some of the highest sales and excise tax rates in the country the state levies a 6 5 percent general sales tax a higher rate than the vast majority of states additionally the state has the highest excise tax on gasoline and by far the highest excise tax on spirits of any state partially as a result 45 9 percent of state revenue comes from sales taxes the largest share of any state though washington does not have a corporate income tax either the state does levy a gross receipts tax on businesses collecting 0 47 percent of annual gross income of businesses in the state 7 wyoming 2016 personal income per capita 55 183 4th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 3 272 12th highest 2015 state debt per capita 1 424 5th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 36 7 percent of total much like alaska and texas part of the reason wyoming can afford not to levy an income tax is because of the revenue it generates from its natural resources energy related mining and mineral extraction is the largest industry in wyoming and the state government levied taxes on over 10 billion in oil natural gas coal and other mineral extraction in 2017 severance tax rates on those resources range from 2 percent to 7 percent companies paying the most in severance tax in wyoming include global conglomerates exxonmobil and british petroleum wyoming also has a relatively low sales tax rate and partially as a result property taxes account for 36 7 percent of state tax revenue the largest share of any revenue source 24 7 wall

posts in this series part 1 on labor in part 1 i discuss some of the ways the working class will be affected by disruptions brought on by climate change and some of the ways the green new deal proposes to ease those burdens climate change will also hurt capital and capitalists it s not possible to outline all the potential damage and disruption so i ll just lay out some of the obvious problems real estate investments are in danger some of that impact will be borne by small landholders owners of vacation homes on galveston bay or condos on the beach in naples fl for example but much of it will be borne by larger holders such as owners of apartment complexes near the coasts marinas and commercial property near the coast and the owner of mar a lago rising sea levels will also affect the infrastructure of cities on the coast such as miami which is already planning to spend 100m on flood protection the coasts aren t the only areas facing weather problems wind storms are becoming more serious recently extraordinary winds blew the roof off a warehouse near dallas here s a wikipedia page documenting tornadoes in the us in 2019 it shows we have already had 3 intense tornadoes including the two that struck alabama recently we can expect more wildfires are a terrifying danger in drought stricken areas pg e the california utility giant filed bankruptcy january 29 2019 to deal with its liability for damage from wildfires it caused the los angeles times wrote pg e said a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing which allows the company to continue operating while it comes up with a plan to pay its debts was the only way to deal with billions of dollars in potential liabilities from a series of deadly wildfires many of which were sparked by the company s power grid infrastructure financial pressure has been mounting on pg e since october 2017 when a series of wildfires ravaged northern california killing 44 people state investigators determined that pg e s equipment sparked or contributed to more than a dozen of those fires which killed 22 people the company s crisis only grew with the november 2018 camp fire which killed 86 people and destroyed most of the town of paradise pg e arranged a 5 5bn interim loan from a consortium of banks but creditors objected and then the bankruptcy judge stated serious concerns according to the wall street journal the judge noted that pg e was under criminal probation after a criminal conviction on six counts arising from the deadly san bruno fire the federal district court in that case imposed a public safety regime on pg e and the later fires might be deemed to be the result of violations of parole in which case the supervising court could replace management that would be a breach of the financing loan the bankruptcy judge also noted the strong possibility of more wildfires in 2019 saying that more damages could tip pg e into default either default would give the bank lenders control of the company in chapter 11 and the creditors objected to that possibility the costs of this bankruptcy are horrendous and will be borne at least in part by people forced to be customers of pg e because it s a monopoly some shareholders have suffered losses in stock value and more may be lost the stock is down 50 since september 2017 to about 20 it s an ugly story and it s going to be repeated climate change will also damage the oil and gas industry a number of huge petrochemical plants and refineries are located in hurricane territory here s a detailed map see for yourself last year refineries on the gulf coast of texas were hit by hurricane harvey harvey weakened to a category 3 hurricane before making landfall and the damage was mostly from flooding the loss of capacity caused spikes in gasoline prices for consumers some of the losses to refineries will be covered by insurance but insurance companies are just for spreading risk not eating it and that implies a rise in the cost of insurance here s an excellent article by bradley hope and nicole friedman in the wall street journal from october 2018 focused on the impact on reinsurance companies here s a taste related to studies predicting increased likelihood of hurricanes in the persian gulf climate change makes the historical record of extreme weather an unreliable indicator of the current risk says stephen pacala a board member at hamilton insurance group ltd and a princeton professor who wasn t involved in the study so what s the insurance industry to do no hurricane has ever threatened the massive unarmored oil and gas infrastructure in the persian gulf so what dose the green new deal offer to capital section 2 1 i think whoever made up this numbering system is a traitor to clarity calls for building resiliency against climate change related disasters such as extreme weather including by leveraging funding and providing investments for community defined projects and strategies the emphasis on community planning is notable section 2 2 calls for rebuilding infrastructure section 2 4 calls for upgrading the power grid section 2 5 calls for rebuilding existing buildings to improve durability among other things section 4 1 requires insuring sufficient capital for entities including businesses working on the goals of the green new deal section 4 4 calls for educating workers so they can handle the new work that will need to be done section 4 11 calls enacting and enforcing trade rules procurement standards and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections section 4 14 calls for strict enforcement of anti trust and other laws to encourage competition and discourage monopoly i d say that s a fairly strong plan for decent businesses under the green new deal true it doesn t give capital a free hand to make the overarching decisions and it doesn t give capital all the money and it has other provisions that hem in capital but it sure doesn t sound like the socialist dystopia the republicans are shrieking about
nomura experts said the economies affected by the looming gdp slowdown could include hong kong indonesia malaysia the philippines singapore taiwan and thailand some of these countries have prominent sources of growth and revenue outside the farming and manufacturing sectors such as the massive financial hubs in hong kong and singapore or thailand s tourism industry however indonesia and the philippines lack such diversity in their sources of gdp expansion economists at bank of america merryl lynch said in a separate report with a more favourable external backdrop and more dovish turn from other central banks we think the philippines and indonesia could afford to cut rates bofa s mohamed faiz nagutha said but they won t be in a hurry given growth is generally still firm read more china likely to pitch for investment in northeast india by partnering with japan experts believe the exposure of regional economies to international risks has traditionally been elevated but ongoing disruptions in global trade and a realignment in supply chains could be particularly painful in these two countries due to their reliance on export oriented industrial production exports by major asian economies have been on a downward trend since they peaked at the end of 2017 and the deceleration became more rapid towards the end of last year with the softening global demand and uncertainties related to the us china trade dispute this trend could continue at least in the first half of 2019 chen dong from the financial services company pictet wealth management said recent macroeconomic data suggest that malaysia already effectively faces deflation and inflation in the majority of other regional economies is close to zero this is not least due to the decline in food prices as well as signs of industrial overcapacity coupled with weakening international demand

chinese president xi jinping travels to italy this week to reportedly sign a memorandum of understanding mou for his landmark belt and road bri initiative the expected move will be the first time any g7 state has backed the 1 trillion dh3 67 trillion plan which lies at the centre of a geopolitical struggle between china and the united states for global influence while rome is not always seen as being among the top tier global powers part of the reason why the development has such potential significance is italy s continued systemic importance in europe as a g7 country it is the third largest eurozone economy and poses perhaps the biggest threat to the single currency area s future because the country has the second biggest debt load in the bloc after greece the revelation that rome has been deep in discussions with beijing first emerged last week when italian undersecretary of economic development michele geraci said that italy was considering signing an initial framework accord that prospect which predictably irritated washington drew an immediate rebuke from garrett marquis a national security council spokesman who asserted that there is no need for the italian government to lend legitimacy to china s infrastructure vanity project yet it is not just washington that is concerned but also brussels too eu officials are increasingly conscious of beijing s influence across the continent including the so called 16 1 initiative of china and key countries in eastern and central europe buttressing this a number of eu states have already signed mous with china on bri including croatia the czech republic hungary poland greece malta and portugal like washington brussels has reservations about bri not least given wider frustrations over beijing s perceived slowness to open up its own economy and a wave of chinese takeovers of european firms in key industries yet brussels has declared it will cooperate with the grand initiative on the basis of china fulfilling its declared aim of making it an open platform which adheres to market rules eu and international requirements as well as being divisive with washington and brussels geraci s initial comments prompted an apparent split in the italian government itself too indicating that rome had not 100 per cent made up its mind on this issue take the example of deputy minister for foreign affairs and international cooperation guglielmo picchi who commented last week that at the moment i do not think we should proceed with the signature signs that italy might back out of the plan especially in light of us criticism then irked china take the example of foreign minister wang yi who hit back that italy is an independent country we trust that you ll stick to the decision you have independently made on bri wang s frosty response and the concern about bri in much of the west stems from the scheme s immensely ambitious nature beijing has big plans to boost trade and stimulate economic growth across asia africa and beyond by building massive amounts of infrastructure and connecting it to countries around the globe take the example of pakistan for instance where beijing has already made commitments of around 60 billion under bri while this is to be largely spent on infrastructure it has cemented warming geopolitical ties with islamabad a previous long standing us ally during the cold war in this context one of the key reasons why washington will have been so upset by recent revelations from rome is that the trump team had been trying to form its own strong relationship with the populist government there indeed italian prime minister giuseppe conte who met with donald trump several times last year including at the white house was perceived by some to be emerging as the us president s strongest supporter in western europe trump last year declared conte a really great guy and that he will do a great job the people of italy have got it right and this political affinity appeared to rest not just on apparent personal chemistry but also the alignment of their policy positions of key issues like russia and immigration while the trump team therefore has particular perceived reason to feel vexed should conte sign the mou with xi as reported concern about bri is bipartisan in washington given the concern of many democrats too about growing chinese international influence this was underlined during the obama administration when washington raised significant concerns about the degree to which london was then perceived to be cosying up to beijing under the previous government of david cameron including the uk s decision to become a founder member of the asian infrastructure investment bank which is being championed be beijing as a potential alternative to the world bank taken overall italy s anticipated endorsement of bri will be a political breakthrough for beijing this is especially so given that the white house had perceived that the populist stripe of the administration in rome had brought new spice to bilateral bonds following the positive initial meetings last year between trump and conte

outstanding foreign debt rose 8 in 2018 as companies and the national government resorted to foreign sources for funding the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp said external debt grew to 79 billion at the end of 2018 from the year earlier total of 73 1 billion the central bank said late friday last year the government borrowed 3 5 billion from external creditors while the private sector availed of 3 2 billion worth of overseas loans the government s external debt rose to 39 7 billion at the end of 2018 from 39 5 billion at the end of the third quarter its share of total external debt declined to 50 3 from the previous quarter s 51 8 meanwhile the private sector s overseas obligations substantially increased to 39 3 billion at the end of the year from the end september level of 36 9 billion with its share of the total increasing to 49 7 from the previous quarter s 48 2 the central bank attributed the year on year growth of external debt to the government s increased financing needs for its infrastructure and social spending programs banks were also preparing for the higher liquidity coverage ratio threshold prescribed by the basel 3 reform package issued by the basel committee on banking supervision while also seeking additional funding for their purchases of philippine sovereign debt the central bank also attributed the higher foreign debt to the private sector s increased working capital needs expanded funding base and extended term liabilities external debt refers to all types of borrowing by philippine residents from non residents following the residency criterion for international statistics in the fourth quarter outstanding foreign debt rose 3 3 compared with the end september level of 76 4 billion at the end of 2018 the maturity profile of the foreign debt remained predominantly medium to long term mlt in nature or those with original maturities longer than one year accounting for 79 7 of the total or 62 9 billion meanwhile short term accounts comprised 20 3 of the debt stock mainly bank liabilities trade credits and others the weighted average maturity for all mlt accounts remained at 17 0 years in december 2018 with public sector borrowings having a longer average term of 21 3 years compared to 7 7 years for the private sector the bsp said this means that fx requirements for debt payments are well spread out and thus more manageable japan was the biggest creditor at 14 4 billion this was followed by the united states 4 billion the netherlands 3 6 billion and the uk 3 2 billion obligations to foreign banks and other financial institutions accounted for the largest share of outstanding debt at 33 6 loans from official sources stood at 31 2 broken down into multilateral creditors 17 4 and bilateral creditors 13 8 bilateral loans amounted to 10 9 billion with japan providing 7 9 billion china 772 million and germany 426 million foreign debt remained largely dollar denominated at 61 1 while yen debt accounted for 13 2 the bsp also said the debt service ratio a measure of the adequacy of foreign exchange earnings to meet maturing debt obligations was 6 3 at the end of 2018 from 6 2 a year earlier the external debt ratio or total outstanding debt as a percentage of gross national income measures solvency it grew to 19 9 at the end of september from 19 4 a year earlier indicating the country s sustained strong position to service offshore borrowings in the medium to long term karl angelo n vidal
sirisena wickremesinghe government could have explained the reality to the people more money for guns means less money for everything else by tisaranee gunasekara not only our actions but also our inactions become our destiny heinrich zimmer the king and the corpse on the night of january 2nd 2006 five students were killed in trincomalee shanmugarajah gajendran lohitharaja rohan thangathurai sivanantha yogarajah hemachandran and manoharan rajihar all of them either engaged in or about to engage in higher studies had gathered near the sea front to celebrate the new year a bomb was thrown at them from a passing three wheeler and the injured youth were gunned down allegedly execution style about 20 minutes later the authorities claimed that the young men were ltte operatives and died when the bomb they were carrying exploded the truth came out to thanks to the courage of the district medical officer dr gamini gunatunga dr gunatunga a sinhalese did the post mortem and testified that the victims had been shot to death at that point the rajapaksa administration had a choice ensure an impartial investigation protect the witnesses allow the courts to do their job it wasn t as if the political authorities were unaware of the truth according to a wikileaks cable in a conversation with the then american ambassador basil rajapaksa said we know the stf did it but the bullet and gun evidence show that they did not they must have separate guns when they want to kill someone the government had nothing to do with the murder but it had everything to do with the subversion of justice the political authorities took a political decision to banish law and install impunity in its stead as a result the suspected killers after a brief stint in remand roamed free while the families of the victims faced harassment and threats trinco 5 case was an early warning of what was to come the myth of a humanitarian operation with zero civilian casualties that myth was enabled by a consistent policy of banding every dead or injured tamil a tiger victim or a tiger that policy began in earnest with trinco 5 from then on impunity would be not partial as it was previously but absolute the result was a permissive environment in which even preventable crimes and avoidable mistakes became inevitable when the aid workers massacre in muttur happened in a few months later the uthr pointed out the connection one thing is certain about the acf killings they would not have happened if minimally timely disciplinary action had been taken against sp kapila jayasekere once his role in the five students outrage became widely known instead he was promoted to ssp in july 2006 ending impunity and bringing about justice was a key promise of the sirisena wickremesinghe administration but the steps taken in this regard were small and hesitant instead of prosecuting at least some of the crimes vigorously the government dragged its feet sent mixed signals and allowed a section of the defence establishment to blatantly ignore court orders as a result justice remains undone killers roam free and the foundation of future crimes are laid one of the most pernicious myths peddled by populist leaders is that justice can be compartmentalised that injustice can be rendered non contiguous the sinhala majority believed that the carte blanche given to war heroes would pose no threat to their own safety under rajapaksa rule indifference to injustice in the north and the east was turned into a patriotic duty but impunity cannot be dammed or guided as the abduction murder of two businessmen in ratgama demonstrates yet again had the victims been tamil they could have been called tigers had they been muslim they could have been called islamic fundamentalists since they were sinhala there are attempts to claim that they were members of the underworld a euphemism used during the rajapaksa years to justify extra judicial killing of sinhalese had the sirisena wickremesinghe administration acted decisively to bring justice to at least some victims of uniformed killers such as the 12 young men suspected to have been abducted and murdered by a for profit navy gang the ratgama crime might not have happened the lesson is clear so long as members of the armed forces and the police are placed above the law and attempts to prosecute them for crimes committed is depicted as acts of anti patriotism impunity will survive and claim its victims from anywhere in sri lanka from any ethnic or religious group any walk of life any profession including the military and the police the indivisibility of injustice during the fourth eelam war general parakrama pannipitiya headed the victorious eastern offensive against the ltte in early 2009 he was arrested by the police on a charge of treasure hunting the real reason for the arrest was his ongoing conflict with gen sarath fonseka in 2008 gen pannipitiya s security was withdrawn suddenly and he was forced to seek judicial intervention the supreme court overruling the objections of the ag issued an interim order allowing general pannipitiya to use his staff quarters and retain vehicles and escorts he was entitled to as commander of the security forces east in delivering the order justice nimal gamini amaratunga said over the media api wenuwen api is aired every half an hour but people like the petitioner don t even have themselves that was 2008 when the mahinda gotabhaya fonseka triumvirate ruled the roost post war the triumvirate fell apart reportedly for the same reasons gen fonseka developed an enmity towards gen pannipitya the division of spoils gen fonskea wanted his share of the glory and the rajapaksas were not in a sharing mood with himself out of favour gen fonskea was unable to keep gen pannipitiya incarcerated after all it was not he but the rajapaksa brothers who controlled the police and the ag s department in mid 2008 charges against gen pannipitiya were dropped and he was freed in a few months gen fonseka himself was jailed on spurious charges in february 2010 gen pannipitiya s wife in an interview with the state owned daily news revealed how her husband was persecuted by gen fonseka and called gen fonseka s own incarceration a retribution of kamma the real reason for both miscarriages of justice was impunity if the rule of law prevailed neither general would have been arrested for a crime he didn t commit sarath fonseka could persecute parakrama pannipity because the rule of law had been replaced by the law of the rulers the rajapaksa brothers could persecute sarath fonseka for the same reason lord acton s in his famous letter to bishop mandell creighton argued against bestowing immunity on men in power you say that people in authority are not to be snubbed or sneezed at i cannot accept your cannon that we are to judge pope and king unlike other men with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong the argument remains more valid than ever today especially in places in sri lanka beset by all too many sacred cows impunity corrodes morality and encourages crime eventually impunity saves none and can endanger all including those who once enjoyed its protection in 2012 minister mervyn silva s son malaka silva and his friend rehan wijeratne assaulted major chandana pradeep of the military intelligence eventually the major was forced to take the blame on himself because the rajapaksa brothers those crusaders for the safety and honour of war heroes opted not to back this particular war hero malaka silva s father was a favoured stooge and rehan wijeratne s mother was the chairperson of the ranjan wijeratne foundation which funded the book gota s war a similar outcome might be in the making today concerning the killing of a police inspector in borealla the suspects are all politically connected brats driving at breakneck speed when the case was taken up journalists were not allowed to enter the court an indication of political interference the president who has appointed himself as the guardian of the military and the police is yet to condemn this incident or to visit the bereaved family a similar silence prevails in the unp and the slpp in the end the family members of the inspector might find themselves in the same company as the family members of trinco 5 and innumerable other victims of impunity and injustice economic injustice lives on almost a decade after the war defence continues to claim the largest chunk of government expenditure for the year of 2019 defence has been allocated rs 393 billion while health gets 187 4 billion and primary and secondary education 105 billion to prevent a new southern insurgency sri lanka needs lower living costs and higher living standards better paying jobs and greater hope not more warships to prevent a new outburst of separatism sri lanka needs reconciliation and reconstruction and a workable political solution not more military helicopters spending more on defence when the priorities are clearly otherwise will not make us safer it will make us more unsafe sirisena wickremesinghe government could have explained the reality to the people more money for guns means less money for everything else education health a decent system of public transportation better roads and other basic infrastructure more research and development in a war situation such a trade off makes sense it is necessary in a time of peace it is criminally stupid in sri lanka there s no military industrial complex what is there is a military commercial complex that military commercial complex is as much of a bar to reducing military expenditure as the military industrial complex is in a country like the us when expensive military hardware is imported local agents and their political backers benefit and benefit enormously no wonder that we are buying helicopters instead of building houses in the north buying warships instead of upgrading education in the deep south economic justice was a top promise of the sirisena wickremesinghe admiistraiton the leaders spoke about the iniquitous system of taxation prevalent in sri lanka blamed the rajapaksas for imposing a proportionately greater tax burden on the poor and the middle classes than on the rich and promised to correct the imbalance under rajapaksa rule the ratio between indirect to direct taxes was a morally unacceptable and economically damaging 80 20 by reducing the purchasing power of a majority plurality of people such extreme levels of taxation undermines the prospects of small and medium scale enterprises and thereby economic growth and income and employment generation budget 2019 provided the government with a last chance to deliver a measure of fairness of justice in the all important realm of economics it failed and so long as that fundamental inequity remains unchanged the government will have no option but to impose more and more indirect taxes on people who are less and less able to absorb the resultant economic shocks in the fortnight since the budget was presented the prices of fuel and bread has gone up and the price of milk powder is slated to follow suit this is a path to greater inequality a path which will eventually veer away from democracy and carry sri lanka back to the autocratic past with the freely given consent of a majority of her people inequality is a choice as joseph stiglitz pointed out when open democracies fail to address or even acknowledge the gravity of inequality an antithetical narrative gains ground like now according to this narrative the rampant and persistent inequality many countries are afflicted by doesn t stem from hayek s triumph over keynes the codification of the washington consensus and the transformation of trickle down economics into an article of faith inequality this narrative claims is a result of policies which favour the other over us the solution is the enthronement of a tough leader who can pack off immigrants keep minorities in place and return the country to its real owners in sri lanka this trend is evident in the putative presidential campaign of gotabhaya rajapaksa his political platform is built on a carefully constructed narrative against liberal democracy rights are dismissed as counterproductive freedoms excoriated as dangerous and democracy ridiculed as soft flabby and ineffective complex problems are simplified depicted as solvable through the ruthless exercise of will by a powerful leader in this narrative warfare state is what a country needs to stay safe and get ahead if the war on terror is over there is always the war on crime on drugs on alien influences and gotabhaya rajapaksa reportedly chosen by brother mahinda as the slpp presidential candidate is definitely the man to drive us to that future of unending wars against eternal enemies

samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street taxes unpopular though they may be fund government services americans count on every day individual income taxes may be especially hated but they are also important accounting for 48 percent of federal tax revenue for the vast majority of states income taxes are also critical to governments balance sheets the result most americans pay income tax twice every year once to federal government and once to their state no two state tax codes are exactly alike however and there are a handful of states that manage to function without levying an individual income tax

my tax returns don t do these 10 common filing mistakes to avoid this year in the vast majority of states individual income taxes represent over 15 percent of annual tax revenue because income tax is such an important and reliable revenue source the states with no income tax make up for the lost potential revenue in other ways two states on this list for example have major tourist industries and raise revenue through higher than average sales taxes three other states that levy no income tax are rich in natural resources and are able to bring in additional revenue through taxes on mineral and gas extraction operations largely as a result despite the missed income tax revenue these states manage to balance their budget just as well as the average state and do not necessarily have higher

less revenue on a per capita basis than most other states the state collected just 2 028 per resident in fiscal 2016 about 840 less than the average across all states sales tax accounts for the largest share of government tax revenue at 40 5 percent followed by property taxes which account for 36 percent because it collects so little in taxes federal aid accounts for a larger than typical share of south dakota s revenue federal assistance is typically dispersed to supplement state funding and support projects determined to be of national interest in south dakota federal dollars account for approximately 35 1 percent of revenue compared to the average of 22 5 percent across all states 5 texas 2016 personal income per capita 45 823 21st lowest 2016 total state tax collections per

collected 3 4 billion in revenue from oil production and another 1 4 billion from natural gas production in its fiscal 2018 relatively high property taxes also help keep the texas state government funded homeowners in texas pay the equivalent of 1 7 percent of their property value in taxes per year more than in all but five other states partially as a result state and local governments collect the equivalent of 1 731 in property taxes per residents annually far more than the average of 1 518 per capita collection across all states 6 washington 2016 personal income per capita 50 640 14th

states additionally the state has the highest excise tax on gasoline and by far the highest excise tax on spirits of any state partially as a result 45 9 percent of state revenue comes from sales taxes the largest share of any state though washington does not have a corporate income tax either the state does levy a gross receipts tax on businesses collecting 0 47 percent of annual gross income of businesses in the state 7 wyoming 2016 personal income per capita 55 183 4th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 3 272 12th highest 2015 state debt per capita 1 424 5th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 36 7 percent of total much like alaska and texas part of the reason wyoming can afford not to levy an income tax is because of the revenue it generates from its natural resources energy related mining and mineral extraction is the largest industry in wyoming and the state government levied taxes on over 10 billion in oil natural gas coal and other mineral extraction in 2017 severance tax rates on those resources range from 2 percent to 7 percent companies paying the most in severance tax in wyoming include global conglomerates exxonmobil and british petroleum wyoming also has a relatively low sales tax rate and partially as a result property taxes account for 36 7 percent of state tax revenue the largest share of any revenue source 24 7 wall

press release march 15 2019 speech of senator loren legarda joint meeting of the region vi regional development council and the regional peace and order council boracay island malay aklan government leaders both national and local have the moral responsibility to work towards the achievement of inclusive equitable resilient and sustainable development for our nation and our communities the people expect and deserve good governance the world bank defines good governance as the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country s economic and social resources for development i believe that all of us public officials strive to govern well and lead our people towards progress but local government leaders being closest to the people have the special role of translating national policies plans and programs into concrete and visible actions for the people in 1998 when i first ran for public office i envisioned that by becoming a senator i would be able to contribute in providing solutions to the problems of society which i exposed and documented as a journalist through policy legislation twenty years into the job i have accomplished many laws with only the best intentions in mind i have done eight of the country s major environmental laws i also did laws on women empowerment children s protection health education job generation rural livelihood and msme promotion among many others oftentimes i get frustrated when i learn that some of these laws have low compliance rate the key is implementation on the ground when i became chair of the senate committee on finance i have discovered a challenge that has continuously plagued the government slow utilization and deliberate underspending have always been the scourge of the national budget for years it is unfair and unjust that billions of pesos are left unspent when many of our citizens and communities are in dire need of basic services and programs from government it is for this reason that in the proposed 2019 general appropriations act gaa we introduced a special provision that will ensure that local development plans are formulated based on a comprehensive consultation among the local development council ldc the local peace and order council and the local disaster risk reduction management council along with other local sectoral councils committees joint meetings shall be conducted to enable local government units to come up with plans that are responsive to existing and emerging challenges as well as to formulate joint strategies to address such challenges the output of the lgus shall be used by the national government agencies ngas as a way of strengthening nga lgu interdependence in shaping their future development roadmaps and annual budget proposal while we await the enactment of the 2019 gaa i would like to urge local governments of region 6 to start implementing this provision already allow me also to share my thoughts on how lgus can further improve performance on the core areas of governance and how you can work with the national government financial administration as chair of the senate committee on finance since 2015 i know how hard it is to manage the government s finances all agencies want to get big budgets but at the end of the year billions of pesos of unspent funds go back to the treasury instead of benefitting the people the problem is poor planning probably lack of research and study on proposed projects or lack of anticipation on possible challenges or lack of sense of urgency to get things done or all of the above understanding the needs of the people is the best way we can plan our programs local governments are in the best position to assess these needs and craft programs that would address the same that is why it is important that ldcs craft need based local projects which should be part of lgu planning to ensure that the needs of the people especially those that cannot be covered by the lgu are included in the programs of national agencies and are funded we should make our ldcs more efficient in accelerating economic and social growth and development at the local levels there should be seamless convergence between the ldcs the provincial development councils the regional development councils and the department of the interior and local government dilg which shall convey these local needs to other national government agencies for accurate planning of national programs that will be downloaded to lgus based on the proposals from the ldcs moreover with enhanced transparency and strengthened accountability on the use of public funds we can encourage improved management of our fiscal resources business friendliness and competitiveness relative to managing fiscal resources is improving ease of doing business in the country we need to attract more businesses for investments and employment and we can do so if we streamline the process of putting up businesses i have a proposed measure the innovation act which has been passed by the senate and the house of representatives and we hope this would be signed into law soon the measure aims to put innovation at the center of our national development policies and make innovation a major driver of economic development once enacted into law it will mandate all government agencies and lgus to improve efficiency in addressing public transactions that impact on innovation including reducing the number of days and costs of starting or expanding a business it will eliminate regulatory barriers and cut red tape to boost innovation efforts social protection in broadening access to social services especially the marginalized and most vulnerable in the community communication and convergence are the challenges more than funding we have so many programs available for access aside from the cash allowance given to poorest families under the pantawid pamilyang pilipino program 4ps of the dswd indigent filipino children now have the opportunity to finish their studies since tertiary education in state universities and colleges local universities and colleges and state run technical vocational institutions is already free because we have funded the universal access to quality tertiary education act health services are also free in government hospitals even for those who are non members of philhealth while livelihood opportunities are available through various government programs such as the dswd s sustainable livelihood program slp the department of labor and employment s dole tupad or tulong panghanapbuhay sa ating disadvantaged displaced workers program and kabuhayan program and the department of science and technology s dost community empowerment through science and technology cest the technical education and skills development authority tesda has training for work scholarship program twsp special training for employment program step and community based and livelihood programs under the barangay livelihood and skills training act while the department of trade and industry dti also has programs to help micro enterprises particularly the shared service facilities ssf and small business corporation s pondo para sa pagbabago at pag asenso the challenge is communicating the services that the government offers and helping prospective beneficiaries avail of these social services which were created for them there needs to be stronger convergence between national agencies and lgus to ensure that these services reach the intended beneficiaries peace and order meanwhile in protecting the community from threats to life and security we have supported this by doubling the base pay of military and uniformed personnel in the government we also supported improved law enforcement and monitoring capabilities of our policemen by increasing the budget for acquisition of body cameras closed circuit television cctv and helicopters among others disaster preparedness in the area of disaster preparedness it is not enough that we are ready for challenges posed by disasters we need to go beyond that by managing disaster risks and building resilience to climate change impacts this is especially crucial now because we have been warned by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the world s leading body assessing the science related to climate change that we need to work double time to limit global warming not to 2 degrees celsius but to the more ambitious 1 5 degrees celsius half a degree matters because it means survival of more individuals species and communities extreme weather events caused by the warming climate compel us to strengthen disaster risk management systems we must incorporate the sendai framework for disaster reduction s four priorities for action namely understanding disaster risk strengthening disaster risk governance investing in disaster risk reduction and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response and to build back better but i wish to stress that there won t be a need to build back better if we build stronger the first time we do it remember this every dollar spent on disaster risk reduction saves around seven dollars in economic losses environmental management building resilience to disasters and climate change is intrinsically linked to environmental management mangrove forests are both reliable protection against tsunami and storm surge and also serve as carbon sinks our protected areas such as the mount kanla on natural park aklan river watershed forest reserve northwest panay peninsula natural park and pan ay river watershed forest reserve to name a few are critical in biodiversity conservation biodiversity is essential for human existence as it provides for the many goods and services we need such as clean air fresh water and food products as well as the many other products like timber and fiber we need to manage our natural resources sustainably so that future generations may still inherit lush forests and natural springs and discover our endemic species of flora and fauna the management of our environment must be in line with our eight environmental laws namely clean air act clean water act ecological solid waste management act eswm renewable energy act environmental awareness and education act climate change act people s survival fund act and the national disaster risk reduction and management act the case of boracay island is a learning experience for all of us it stresses the need to protect critical biodiversity areas such as wetlands and the importance of implementing the ewsm law especially waste segregation recycling and establishing materials recovery facilities mrfs tourism culture and the arts optimizing tourism potential of our communities and enriching cultural heritage are likewise linked to environmental management going back to the case of boracay the rehabilitation of the island to address environmental concerns is a right step towards sustainable tourism our natural resources should never be compromised for the sake of development in promoting ecotourism we must preserve the pristine state of our natural tourist spots we should not build on protected areas or encroach critical biodiversity areas we should not use our islands seas bays and rivers as sewerage or garbage bins instead we must preserve our wetlands and forestlands which ensures the balance of our ecosystem cultural tours should also be developed as a way to promote tourism especially since each province and town in the country has a rich cultural history and historic spots that would be interesting sites for local and foreign tourists alike closing delivering well on these core areas of governance is a mark of good governance we must always remember that we need to bring government closer to the people our citizens must feel the presence of the national government through actual programs that benefit them this is the very crucial role of local government let us all work together to uplift the lives of our citizens let us all aim to build inclusive equitable resilient and sustainable communities thank you very much

samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street taxes unpopular though they may be fund government services americans count on every day individual income taxes may be especially hated but they are also important accounting for 48 percent of federal tax revenue for the vast majority of states income taxes are also critical to governments balance sheets the result most americans pay income tax twice every year once to federal government and once to their state no two state tax codes are exactly alike however and there are a handful of states that manage to function without levying an individual income tax to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed state level tax codes using tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax foundation after you file how long should i keep my tax returns don t do these 10 common filing mistakes to avoid this year in the vast majority of states individual income taxes represent over 15 percent of annual tax revenue because income tax is such an important and reliable revenue source the states with no income tax make up for the lost potential revenue in other ways two states on this list for example have major tourist industries and raise revenue through higher than average sales taxes three other states that levy no income tax are rich in natural resources and are able to bring in additional revenue through taxes on mineral and gas extraction operations largely as a result despite the missed income tax revenue these states manage to balance their budget just as well as the average state and do not necessarily have higher debt on a per capita basis to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed the tax code in each state using the latest tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax

oil and gas extraction companies and off individual residents because of the revenue it derives from some of the largest oil fields in the united states not only does alaska not have an income tax but also it does not levy a sales tax resource extraction covers much of the cost of government services and allows the state to pay residents a dividend every year last year alaskans were paid 1 600 each from the state s permanent fund with no income or sales tax a disproportionately large share of total tax revenue in alaska comes from property tax state and local governments derived 57 2 percent of

bridgetown barbados cmc the caribbean development bank cdb says despite projections of deceleration in global economic activity the 2019 economic outlook for its borrowing member countries bmc is positive cdb is projecting that real gdp gross domestic product growth will be 2 1 per cent as construction tourism and the extractive industries such as gold and oil are expected to expand the cdb said in the regional economic summary 2018 the expectation is that all but one of the bmcs will grow once again led by grenada the rate of growth will be higher in guyana as the country prepares for commercial oil production starting in 2020 the one exception is barbados where the level of activity will remain the same the region s premier financial institution in the summary the cdb said that economic performance in the caribbean is set against a background of slowing global economic growth and that the current international economic environment is characterised by escalating trade tensions volatile commodity markets and policy uncertainty with respect to both brexit and united states trade in spite of all these developments in 2018 most of cdb s bmcs recorded positive economic growth growth averaged 1 9 per cent an improvement on 0 5 per cent in 2017 the fastest growing economies were grenada 5 2 per cent antigua and barbuda 3 5 per cent and guyana 3 4 per cent for antigua and barbuda and some of the other bmcs that were affected by the 2017 hurricane season reconstruction efforts contributed to their upturn the cdb said headlines delivered to your inbox sign up for the gleaner s morning and evening newsletters in contrast real gross domestic product contracted in barbados despite modest gains in tourism one of its key sectors this contraction was attributed to the impact of fiscal consolidation and the fall in construction activity anguilla s economy also contracted due to an almost 40 per cent fall off in visitor arrivals following hurricane damage to the hotel stock in 2017 for the same reason the british virgin islands experienced a 50 per cent decline in visitor arrivals however real gdp grew by over two per cent as a result of buoyant business and financial services activity the cdb said that most other caribbean countries enjoyed increased visitor arrivals overnight visitor arrivals increased by 15 per cent in belize and by about 10 per cent in the cayman islands and in grenada in the commodity exporting countries higher oil production and prices drove increased growth in suriname and in trinidad and tobago the bank said buoyant gold prices also benefited suriname and growth in guyana was linked mainly to robust construction activity in advance of the beginning of commercial production of oil in 2020 rates of unemployment fell in some bmcs but rose in others in jamaica unemployment fell to a record low in 2018 on the back of greater macroeconomic stability and improvements in the doing business environment however across the region unemployment rates were generally higher for women than for men and the rate of youth unemployment remained worryingly high with about one in five young people seeking but unable to find employment the bank said fiscal performance varied across the region and that debt as a percentage of gdp decreased in 13 bmcs although the ratio continued to exceed the international benchmark of 60 per cent in 11 countries public finances in some bmcs continued to be affected by the impacts of the 2017 hurricanes tax revenues fell in anguilla while expenditure much of it related to recovery rose in antigua and barbuda rising public expenditure was accompanied by lower non tax revenues especially from the citizenship by investment cbi programme indeed it was only in st kitts and nevis that cbi revenues rose following the launch of a new fund in late 2017 in grenada the fiscal position continued to improve reflecting strengthened expenditure management and tax compliance sustained economic growth contributed to better fiscal performance in suriname and in trinidad and tobago the cdb noted that as part of the first stage of the economic recovery plan in barbados debt restructuring and fiscal restraint helped to achieve an increased primary surplus it said belize also recorded a primary surplus attributable to revenue enhancement measures taken to meet the targets agreed with creditors as part of its 2017 debt restructuring programme the cdb has issued the regional economic summary 2018 along with individual reports on the bmcs ahead of its annual board of governors meeting scheduled to take in trinidad and tobago june 5 6 it said solutions and strategies to drive economic and social transformation in the caribbean will feature prominently during the two day meeting
tackling fine dust requires faith in neighbors werksman seeing eye to eye on the cause of fine dust is the first step to forming an east asian partnership to tackle the issue according to jacob werksman the principal adviser to the head of the european commission s climate policy body it needs a shared understanding of what the problem is said werksman during his visit to korea for the launch of the european union korea climate action project on march 11 countries need to work together to solve problems but you cannot allow the collaboration to enable either country organization or government to avoid the responsibility he said there is a need to understand where fine dust is coming from and what activities are responsible on the either side of the border the eu delegation in korea recently launched a three year 2 4 million euro project to coordinate climate change policies among non state actors in the european union and korea as the south korean government announced a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent below their usual level by 2030 and the eu by at least 40 percent by 2030 the new project will focus on helping nongovernmental entities play their roles in implementing these goals i am delighted to launch the eu korea climate action project said eu ambassador to korea michael reiterer at the reception for the project s launch at the westin chosun hotel in central seoul on march 11 the need for action could not be more urgent in seoul it is said that parents consider emigrating so their children can escape the increasingly frequent high levels of fine dust in sweden and australia families flee wildfires in other regions fragile states see stress on natural resources contribute to conflict and mass migration although korea has seen rising levels of fine dust for several years this year and 2018 have been the worst the daily average level of pm2 5 particles in seoul hit a record on march 5 hitting 135 micrograms the highest since 2015 when data was first recorded this is more than five times the recommended daily exposure by the world health organization many koreans believe the spiking levels have to do with increased emissions from factories in china korea s ministry of environment recently released a study that said foreign pollutants and stagnant air were the major causes for severe pollution from 2015 to 2017 beijing s authorities have denied the allegation china s foreign ministry s spokesman lu kang raised doubts last week that the fine dust came from china saying that there s no proof and that the cloud of dust over seoul could have been caused by various factors since then hundreds of koreans have filed petitions with the blue house to speak directly with the chinese government on fine dust werksman who advises the european commission regarding international partnerships on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking other actions to combat climate change effects sat down for an interview with the korea joongang daily and the joongang ilbo on march 11 to discuss multilateral environmental projects and how korea and the eu can collaborate the following are edited excerpts from the interview this is part of the long run transboundary air pollution convention treaties they cover the european area and the united states and canada in different settings they have dealt effectively with transboundary air pollution in terms of acid rain and they have turned to particulates it is a relatively new protocol and they are setting national emission limits that are allocated across different countries again as with the fine dust issue in the korean peninsula and china it requires an understanding of science and movement of particulates so that you have an understanding of where the sources are and what their impacts are part of has to do with local air quality but also with climate change effects when these particles land in the arctic when particulates fall on snow they enhance the earth s capacity to absorb light and therefore more heat so increasingly there is a concern of black carbonates and their impact on the arctic the same sources of fine particulates are also significant sources of carbon dioxide with the obvious common criminal being coal so if you regulate carbon dioxide it can improve the air quality it s something that has driven a lot of ambition in china for example and we are hoping it will have the same effect in other countries where the middle class is beginning to take an interest in climate change because of the health effects it s having through the related emissions of fine particulates one of the challenges in any society is giving a shared sense of responsibility across the entirety of society as with any choices there can be costs that can be up front and some benefits come later i think part of the role of the government is to persuade people that the up front costs are worth the longer term benefits but what s unique to climate change and to air pollution is that they are collective action problems so you have to persuade everyone to contribute there are both progressive and regressive effects of climate policies so some may have a particular impact on poor people and adjustment and help need to be provided in the eu we have been trying to ensure that job creation that is resulting from progressive climate policies reach the same communities that might be being displaced by those policies and you can see governments putting incentives in many societies for example in making hybrids and electric powered vehicles cheaper and more affordable i m assuming those kinds of policies can also be available to the korean government and if you re looking at an urban environment that s building the infrastructure for car sharing and electric car sharing that s something that we are seeing in all europe that people of all incomes are finding it much cheaper to not own a car but to be able to have access to a car you don t have to pay for insurance parking spot you often don t have to pay for fuel but it needs the infrastructure available in order to make that happen like charging stations and parking spaces in the streets my understanding is that when our analysts look at the korean target they think there is a lot more that korea can do we were pleased when the new administration came in and began to rethink these targets and one of the ways in which they are rethinking is by shifting more of the effort domestically than internationally that has been part of the european experience as well in our first commitment in the kyoto protocol we enabled companies to reduce emissions by buying offsets overseas it took a lot of the pressure off the companies to act more domestically and we fell behind in driving towards a low carbon economy as a result of that so it makes sense to act first at home we think it is definitely feasible our long term strategy is to imagine us essentially deriving nearly all of our electricity from renewable sources there is an implied target to get to the renewable energy mix up to something like 80 percent by 2050 and our current targets set us on a pathway towards that by 2020 our target deadline is 20 percent and it is likely we will exceed that by 2030 the goal is to have at least 32 percent in the renewable energy mix it has been our experience in the eu that once these targets are set the industry responds and you get innovations that often drive down costs and allow governments to exceed targets by esther chung kang chan su
the democratic party is now a totalitarian communist party the green new deal is important evidence of this fact h res 109 recognizing the duty of the federal government to create a green new deal there are 90 co sponsors of this resolution and they are all democrats since there is not a single republican among them this resolution signals a clean and clear divide between the two parties there are 235 democrats in the house of representatives so 38 3 percent openly support the resolution this is a high number considering how radical the proposal is the green new deal requires government to extend its power dramatically over the entire economy it will have total control if supporting legislation is passed or even if the approach is piecemeal enactment over time this economic control entails a corresponding destruction of property rights that is such freedoms as freedom to contract freedom to create wealth freedom of exchange and freedom to consume freely made products total control of the federal government which suppresses capitalism and replaces it with a command and control economy justifies the term totalitarian the accompanying destruction of private property rights justifies the term communist the green new deal is open about its total communistic economic control free markets reflecting free consumer choices will no longer determine what industries have jobs to fill instead the government will create millions of good high wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the united states instead of a 5 year soviet style plan there will be a 10 year national mobilization again total control from washington a reminder 90 democrats are co sponsoring this resolution in addition the resolution calls for a massive targeted welfare program to promote justice and equity by stopping current preventing future and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples communities of color migrant communities deindustrialized communities depopulated rural communities the poor low income workers women the elderly the unhoused people with disabilities and youth referred to in this resolution as frontline and vulnerable communities there is much much more in this resolution and it all adds up to total control a totalitarian society accompanied by communist measures that eliminate free markets and private property the measures could not be implemented without large increases in taxation another concrete sign of total government control and destruction of private property although the green new deal is indeed madness nonetheless this is what democrats want they want totalitarian communism for america we have to assume that they mean what they say we haven t heard the other 145 members repudiate this mad policy meanwhile this is only one sign of the democratic soul others include medicare for all and as in the green new deal universal basic income i e universal welfare these too are clear communist measures no matter if they are imposed by a dictator or voted in by a legislature they can only be funded by a common pool of taxes and they can only be administered by government control over prices and services private healthcare disappears many americans and american media like to deny that the country has an important degree of socialism and communism already they hate to admit it by admitting it they would concede that such measures as the green new deal are in fact socialist and communist they don t want to admit this because they themselves favor more communism the totalitarian communism being built and advocated in america today doesn t use the same rhetoric as marx and engels and their followers did that proves nothing the essence is the same the russian revolution in october 1917 was a big jump from one system to another from a parliament to socialism america has no such big jump into socialism and this makes us different we have smaller discrete jumps and sometimes not so small like the new deal of fdr the results are spread over decades and hidden by the advances made by capitalism which supplies a big pool of wealth personal freedoms are not squashed as under lenin and stalin agriculture is not suddenly collectivized but it is manipulated and controlled the green new deal singles out agriculture and other industries for control our slower and more diffuse evolution toward communism allows leftist and blind intellectuals to laugh off the label of communism but that is the reality of our country today s democratic party could change its name to communist party without misleading anyone there already is a communist party usa and its ideology in many respects doesn t differ significantly from that of the democratic party among the points in the party s immediate program are a 15 hour minimum wage for all workers national universal health care and opposition to privatization of social security economic measures such as increased taxes on the rich and corporations strong regulation of the financial industry regulation and public ownership of utilities and increased federal aid to cities and states opposition to the iraq war and other military interventions opposition to free trade treaties such as the north american free trade agreement nafta nuclear disarmament and a reduced military budget various civil rights provisions campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns and election law reform including instant runoff voting 3 55 pm on march 17 2019 the best of michael s rozeff
samuel stebbins 24 7 wall street taxes unpopular though they may be fund government services americans count on every day individual income taxes may be especially hated but they are also important accounting for 48 percent of federal tax revenue for the vast majority of states income taxes are also critical to governments balance sheets the result most americans pay income tax twice every year once to federal government and once to their state no two state tax codes are exactly alike however and there are a handful of states that manage to function without levying an individual income tax to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed state level tax codes using tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax foundation after you file how long should i keep my tax returns don t do these 10 common filing mistakes to avoid this year in the vast majority of states individual income taxes represent over 15 percent of annual tax revenue because income tax is such an important and reliable revenue source the states with no income tax make up for the lost potential revenue in other ways two states on this list for example have major tourist industries and raise revenue through higher than average sales taxes three other states that levy no income tax are rich in natural resources and are able to bring in additional revenue through taxes on mineral and gas extraction operations largely as a result despite the missed income tax revenue these states manage to balance their budget just as well as the average state and do not necessarily have higher debt on a per capita basis to identify the states with no income tax 24 7 wall st reviewed the tax code in each state using the latest tax data compiled by tax policy research organization tax foundation personal income per capita for each state is for 2016 and came from the u s bureau of economic analysis all other data came from the tax foundation s facts figures 2018 how does your state compare report 1 alaska 2016 personal income per capita 51 079 11th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 405 the lowest 2015 state debt per capita 7 757 4th highest largest source of tax revenue property tax 57 2 percent of total alaska is one of seven states that does not levy an individual income tax a resource rich state alaska is in a unique position to shift tax burdens to oil and gas extraction companies and off individual residents because of the revenue it derives from some of the largest oil fields in the united states not only does alaska not have an income tax but also it does not levy a sales tax resource extraction covers much of the cost of government services and allows the state to pay residents a dividend every year last year alaskans were paid 1 600 each from the state s permanent fund with no income or sales tax a disproportionately large share of total tax revenue in alaska comes from property tax state and local governments derived 57 2 percent of total tax revenue from property tax in fiscal 2015 far more than 31 1 percent national average 2 florida 2016 personal income per capita 44 541 15th lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 822 2nd lowest 2015 state debt per capita 1 643 6th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 35 7 percent of total states with no individual income tax make up for the lost potential revenue source in other ways florida is one of the most visited states in the country and as a result tourism generates enough revenue to cover much of the difference florida levies a 6 0 percent sales tax a higher rate than most other states and that rate is applied to residents as well as to the more than 100 million tourists who visit the sunshine state each year florida collected 1 079 per resident in sales taxes in fiscal 2016 far more than the average per capita sales tax revenue collected across all states of 898 while sales taxes are a significant component of the state s balance sheet florida derives most of its tax revenue from property taxes property taxes in the state account for 35 7 percent of overall tax revenue while sales taxes account for 34 2 percent 3 nevada 2016 personal income per capita 43 972 12th lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 2 730 24th highest 2015 state debt per capita 1 160 3rd lowest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 39 7 percent of total due in large part to revenue generated by nevada s tourism industry state residents do not pay state income tax clark county home to las vegas drew over 42 million visitors in 2018 leading to over 10 2 billion in gaming revenue alone nevada levies a 6 9 percent sales tax a higher sales tax rate than all but six other states with the higher than average sales tax rates paid by visitors and residents alike nevada collected the equivalent of 1 451 per person in sales tax alone in fiscal 2016 all but two other states nevada also generates more revenue per capita in excise taxes those levied on certain goods and activities like gasoline and gambling than every state other than vermont 4 south dakota 2016 personal income per capita 52 855 5th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 2 028 9th lowest 2015 state debt per capita 3 828 16th highest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 40 5 percent of total with no state income tax south dakota generates far less revenue on a per capita basis than most other states the state collected just 2 028 per resident in fiscal 2016 about 840 less than the average across all states sales tax accounts for the largest share of government tax revenue at 40 5 percent followed by property taxes which account for 36 percent because it collects so little in taxes federal aid accounts for a larger than typical share of south dakota s revenue federal assistance is typically dispersed to supplement state funding and support projects determined to be of national interest in south dakota federal dollars account for approximately 35 1 percent of revenue compared to the average of 22 5 percent across all states 5 texas 2016 personal income per capita 45 823 21st lowest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 1 868 3rd lowest 2015 state debt per capita 1 756 9th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 42 0 percent of total texas is one of several resource rich states that do not levy a tax on personal income the lone star state is home to 40 percent of u s proved oil reserves and it is able to leverage the energy industry to partially offset potential income tax revenue the state collected 3 4 billion in revenue from oil production and another 1 4 billion from natural gas production in its fiscal 2018 relatively high property taxes also help keep the texas state government funded homeowners in texas pay the equivalent of 1 7 percent of their property value in taxes per year more than in all but five other states partially as a result state and local governments collect the equivalent of 1 731 in property taxes per residents annually far more than the average of 1 518 per capita collection across all states 6 washington 2016 personal income per capita 50 640 14th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 3 060 16th highest 2015 state debt per capita 4 495 12th highest largest source of tax revenue sales tax 45 9 percent of total washington compensates for missed income tax revenue with some of the highest sales and excise tax rates in the country the state levies a 6 5 percent general sales tax a higher rate than the vast majority of states additionally the state has the highest excise tax on gasoline and by far the highest excise tax on spirits of any state partially as a result 45 9 percent of state revenue comes from sales taxes the largest share of any state though washington does not have a corporate income tax either the state does levy a gross receipts tax on businesses collecting 0 47 percent of annual gross income of businesses in the state 7 wyoming 2016 personal income per capita 55 183 4th highest 2016 total state tax collections per capita 3 272 12th highest 2015 state debt per capita 1 424 5th lowest largest source of tax revenue property tax 36 7 percent of total much like alaska and texas part of the reason wyoming can afford not to levy an income tax is because of the revenue it generates from its natural resources energy related mining and mineral extraction is the largest industry in wyoming and the state government levied taxes on over 10 billion in oil natural gas coal and other mineral extraction in 2017 severance tax rates on those resources range from 2 percent to 7 percent companies paying the most in severance tax in wyoming include global conglomerates exxonmobil and british petroleum wyoming also has a relatively low sales tax rate and partially as a result property taxes account for 36 7 percent of state tax revenue the largest share of any revenue source 24 7 wall

over the last couple of weeks we discussed the wild swings in the market in terms of price movements from overbought to oversold and now back again the quote below is from two week s ago but is apropos again this week despite the underlying economic and fundamental data the markets have surged back to extremely overbought extended and deviated levels on virtually every measure markets are suggesting the fuel for an additional leg higher in assets prices is extremely limited just for visual sake the chart below compares the last three weeks of wild gyrations the chart below also shows the short term reversal of the market as well note how in just a few days the market went from overbought to oversold back to overbought importantly as i specifically noted last week this short term oversold condition and holding of minor support does set the market up for a bounce next week which could get the market back above the 200 dma the challenge at least in the short term remains the resistance level building at 2800 on that analysis we did increase equity exposure early last week in both our etf and equity portfolios in the ria pro version of this letter we gave specific recommendations to add exposure particularly to due to the recent sell off over concerns of medicare for all despite the rally the bounce is still largely at risk for the three following reasons 1 as noted previously the market has not reversed to levels which normally signals short term bottoms the red lines in the bottom four panels denote periods where taking profits and reducing risk has been ideal the green lines have been prime opportunities to increase exposure as you will note these indicators tend to swing from extremes and once a correction process has started it is usually not completed until the lower bound is reached important note this does not mean the market will decline sharply in price the current overbought conditions can also be resolved by continued consolidation within a range as we have seen over the last two weeks 2 the divergence between stocks and bonds still signals that smart money continues to seek safety over risk historically these bond market generally has it right 3 as discussed in the weekly chart below shows the s p 500 hitting an all time high last september before falling nearly 20 into the end of 2018 while the first two months of 2019 has seen an impressive surge back to its november highs the market is starting to build a pattern of lower highs and lower bottoms more importantly both relative strength and the macd indicators are trending lower and negatively diverging from the markets price action as john murphy noted last week for stockcharts the bull market that ended in march 2000 preceded an economic downturn by a year the october 2007 stock market peak preceded the december economic peak by two months the march 2009 stock upturn led the june economic upturn by three months historically stocks usually peak from six to nine months ahead of the economy which is why we look for possible stock market peaks to alert us to potential peaks in the economy that usually follow and we may be looking at one if you are a longer term investor these issues should be weighted into your investment strategy while we did add exposure to our portfolios early last week we are still overweight cash and fixed income in the ria pro equity model we bought boeing nyse on the initial plunge and added positions in jpmorgan chase co nyse apple nasdaq and ppl corporation nyse we bought boeing nyse on the initial plunge and added positions in jpmorgan chase co nyse apple nasdaq and ppl corporation nyse in the ria pro etf model we added healthcare health care select sector spdr nyse energy energy select sector spdr nyse and ishares gold etf nyse as always we start with trading positions which have very tight stop loss parameters if our thesis on the position is proved correct the position size is increased and is moved into a longer term holding status with widened safety protocols this is how we approach linking longer term views to short term opportunities managing a portfolio of investments is simply measuring risk and reward and placing bets when reward outweighs the potential risk tweaking exposure to risk over time improves performance tremendously over the long term the goldilocks warning lately there has been an awful lot of talk about a goldilocks economy here in the u s despite a rather severe slowdown globally it is believed currently the domestic economy is going to continue to chug along with not enough inflation to push the fed into hiking rates but also won t fall into recession it is a just right economy which will allow corporate profits to grow at a strong enough rate for stocks to continue to rise at 8 10 per year every year into eternity does that really make any sense particularly as we are looking at the longest expansion cycle in the history of the u s the problem is in the rush to come up with a bullish thesis as to why stocks should continue to elevate in the future they have forgotten the last time the u s entered into such a state of economic bliss you might remember this the fed s official forecast an average of forecasts by fed governors and the fed s district banks essentially portrays a goldilocks economy that is neither too hot with inflation nor too cold with rising unemployment wsj feb 15 2007 of course it was just 10 months later that the u s entered into a recession followed by the worst financial crisis since the great depression the problem with this oft repeated monument to trite is that it s absolute nonsense as john tamny once penned a goldilocks economy one that is not too hot and not too cold is very much the fashionable explanation at the moment for all that s allegedly good goldilocks presumes economic uniformity where there is none as though there s no difference between sausalito and stockton new york city and newark but there is and that s what s so silly about commentary that lionizes the fed for allegedly engineering goldilocks soft landings and other laughable concepts that could only be dreamed up by the economics profession and the witless pundits who promote the profession s mysticism what this tells us is that the fed can t engineer the falsehood that is goldilocks rather the fed s meddling is what some call goldilocks and sometimes worse not too hot and not too cold isn t something sane minds aspire to rather it s the mediocrity we can expect so long as we presume that central bankers allocating the credit of others is the source of our prosperity john is correct an economy that is growing at 2 inflation near zero and central banks globally required to continue dumping trillions of dollars into the financial system just to keep it afloat is not an economy we should be aspiring to but despite commentary the financial system has been put back together again then why are central banks acting via bloomberg led by the fed many central banks have either held back on tightening monetary policy or introduced fresh stimulus soothing investor fears of a slowdown fed chairman jerome powell says he and colleagues will be patient on raising interest rates again while european central bank president mario draghi has ruled out doing so this year and unveiled a new batch of cheap loans for banks elsewhere authorities in australia canada and the u k are among those to have adopted a wait and see approach china at its national people s congress this month signaled a willingness to ease monetary and fiscal policies to support expansion unfortunately today s goldilocks economy is more akin to what we saw in 2007 than most would like to admit job growth is slowing down along with economic growth and recession risks are rising sharply however it isn t just the economy that is reminiscent of the 2007 landscape as noted above the markets also reflect the same here are a couple of charts worth reminding you of notice that at the peaks of both previous bull markets the market corrected broke important support levels and then rallied to new highs leading investors to believe the bull market was intact however the weekly sell signal never confirmed that rally as the unseen bear market had already started currently relative strength as measured by rsi on a weekly basis has continued to deteriorate not only was such deterioration a hallmark of the market topping process in 2007 but also in 2000 the problem of suggesting that we have once again evolved into a goldilocks economy is that such an environment of slower growth is not conducive to supporting corporate profit growth at a level to justify high valuations it is true that the bears didn t eat goldilocks at the end of the story but then again there never was a sequel simple actions to take now you will appreciate later trim positions that are big winners in your portfolio back to their original portfolio weightings ie take profits sell underperforming positions if a position hasn t performed during the rally over the last three months it is weak for a reason and will likely lead the decline on the way down positions that performed with the market should also be reduced back to original portfolio weights hang with the leaders move trailing stop losses up to new levels review your portfolio allocation relative to your risk tolerance if you are aggressively weighted in equities at this point of the market cycle you may want to try and recall how you felt during 2008 raise cash levels and increase fixed income accordingly to reduce relative market exposure how you personally manage your investments is up to you i am only suggesting a few guidelines to rebalance portfolio risk accordingly therefore use this information at your own discretion see you next week

tackling fine dust requires faith in neighbors werksman seeing eye to eye on the cause of fine dust is the first step to forming an east asian partnership to tackle the issue according to jacob werksman the principal adviser to the head of the european commission s climate policy body it needs a shared understanding of what the problem is said werksman during his visit to korea for the launch of the european union korea climate action project on march 11 countries need to work together to solve problems but you cannot allow the collaboration to enable either country organization or government to avoid the responsibility he said there is a need to understand where fine dust is coming from and what activities are responsible on the either side of the border the eu delegation in korea recently launched a three year 2 4 million euro project to coordinate climate change policies among non state actors in the european union and korea as the south korean government announced a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37 percent below their usual level by 2030 and the eu by at least 40 percent by 2030 the new project will focus on helping nongovernmental entities play their roles in implementing these goals i am delighted to launch the eu korea climate action project said eu ambassador to korea michael reiterer at the reception for the project s launch at the westin chosun hotel in central seoul on march 11 the need for action could not be more urgent in seoul it is said that parents consider emigrating so their children can escape the increasingly frequent high levels of fine dust in sweden and australia families flee wildfires in other regions fragile states see stress on natural resources contribute to conflict and mass migration although korea has seen rising levels of fine dust for several years this year and 2018 have been the worst the daily average level of pm2 5 particles in seoul hit a record on march 5 hitting 135 micrograms the highest since 2015 when data was first recorded this is more than five times the recommended daily exposure by the world health organization many koreans believe the spiking levels have to do with increased emissions from factories in china korea s ministry of environment recently released a study that said foreign pollutants and stagnant air were the major causes for severe pollution from 2015 to 2017 beijing s authorities have denied the allegation china s foreign ministry s spokesman lu kang raised doubts last week that the fine dust came from china saying that there s no proof and that the cloud of dust over seoul could have been caused by various factors since then hundreds of koreans have filed petitions with the blue house to speak directly with the chinese government on fine dust werksman who advises the european commission regarding international partnerships on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking other actions to combat climate change effects sat down for an interview with the korea joongang daily and the joongang ilbo on march 11 to discuss multilateral environmental projects and how korea and the eu can collaborate the following are edited excerpts from the interview this is part of the long run transboundary air pollution convention treaties they cover the european area and the united states and canada in different settings they have dealt effectively with transboundary air pollution in terms of acid rain and they have turned to particulates it is a relatively new protocol and they are setting national emission limits that are allocated across different countries again as with the fine dust issue in the korean peninsula and china it requires an understanding of science and movement of particulates so that you have an understanding of where the sources are and what their impacts are part of has to do with local air quality but also with climate change effects when these particles land in the arctic when particulates fall on snow they enhance the earth s capacity to absorb light and therefore more heat so increasingly there is a concern of black carbonates and their impact on the arctic the same sources of fine particulates are also significant sources of carbon dioxide with the obvious common criminal being coal so if you regulate carbon dioxide it can improve the air quality it s something that has driven a lot of ambition in china for example and we are hoping it will have the same effect in other countries where the middle class is beginning to take an interest in climate change because of the health effects it s having through the related emissions of fine particulates one of the challenges in any society is giving a shared sense of responsibility across the entirety of society as with any choices there can be costs that can be up front and some benefits come later i think part of the role of the government is to persuade people that the up front costs are worth the longer term benefits but what s unique to climate change and to air pollution is that they are collective action problems so you have to persuade everyone to contribute there are both progressive and regressive effects of climate policies so some may have a particular impact on poor people and adjustment and help need to be provided in the eu we have been trying to ensure that job creation that is resulting from progressive climate policies reach the same communities that might be being displaced by those policies and you can see governments putting incentives in many societies for example in making hybrids and electric powered vehicles cheaper and more affordable i m assuming those kinds of policies can also be available to the korean government and if you re looking at an urban environment that s building the infrastructure for car sharing and electric car sharing that s something that we are seeing in all europe that people of all incomes are finding it much cheaper to not own a car but to be able to have access to a car you don t have to pay for insurance parking spot you often don t have to pay for fuel but it needs the infrastructure available in order to make that happen like charging stations and parking spaces in the streets my understanding is that when our analysts look at the korean target they think there is a lot more that korea can do we were pleased when the new administration came in and began to rethink these targets and one of the ways in which they are rethinking is by shifting more of the effort domestically than internationally that has been part of the european experience as well in our first commitment in the kyoto protocol we enabled companies to reduce emissions by buying offsets overseas it took a lot of the pressure off the companies to act more domestically and we fell behind in driving towards a low carbon economy as a result of that so it makes sense to act first at home we think it is definitely feasible our long term strategy is to imagine us essentially deriving nearly all of our electricity from renewable sources there is an implied target to get to the renewable energy mix up to something like 80 percent by 2050 and our current targets set us on a pathway towards that by 2020 our target deadline is 20 percent and it is likely we will exceed that by 2030 the goal is to have at least 32 percent in the renewable energy mix it has been our experience in the eu that once these targets are set the industry responds and you get innovations that often drive down costs and allow governments to exceed targets by esther chung kang chan su

market review recap over the last couple of weeks we discussed the wild swings in the market in terms of price movements from overbought to oversold and now back again the quote below is from two week s ago but is apropos again this week despite the underlying economic and fundamental data the markets have surged back to extremely overbought extended and deviated levels on virtually every measure markets are suggesting the fuel for an additional leg higher in assets prices is extremely limited just for visual sake the chart below compares the last three weeks of wild gyrations the chart below also shows the short term reversal of the market as well note how in just a few days the market went from overbought to oversold back to overbought importantly as i specifically noted last week this short term oversold condition and holding of minor support does set the market up for a bounce next week which could get the market back above the 200 dma the challenge at least in the short term remains the resistance level building at 2 800 on that analysis we did increase equity exposure early last week in both our etf and equity portfolios in the ria pro version of this letter we gave specific recommendations to add exposure particularly to healthcare due to the recent sell off over concerns of medicare for all despite the rally the bounce is still largely at risk for the three following reasons 1 as noted previously the market has not reversed to levels which normally signals short term bottoms the red lines in the bottom four panels denote periods where taking profits and reducing risk has been ideal the green lines have been prime opportunities to increase exposure as you will note these indicators tend to swing from extremes and once a correction process has started it is usually not completed until the lower bound is reached important note this does not mean the market will decline sharply in price the current overbought conditions can also be resolved by continued consolidation within a range as we have seen over the last two weeks 2 the divergence between stocks and bonds still signals that smart money continues to seek safety over risk historically the bond market generally has it right 3 as discussed in will the next decade be as good as the last the weekly chart below shows the s p 500 hitting an all time high last september before falling nearly 20 into the end of 2018 while the first two months of 2019 has seen an impressive surge back to its november highs the market is starting to build a pattern of lower highs and lower bottoms more importantly both relative strength and the macd indicators are trending lower and negatively diverging from the market s price action as john murphy noted last week for stockcharts the bull market that ended in march 2000 preceded an economic downturn by a year the october 2007 stock market peak preceded the december economic peak by two months the march 2009 stock upturn led the june economic upturn by three months historically stocks usually peak from six to nine months ahead of the economy which is why we look for possible stock market peaks to alert us to potential peaks in the economy that usually follow and we may be looking at one if you are a longer term investor these issues should be weighted into your investment strategy while we did add exposure to our portfolios early last week we are still overweight cash and fixed income in the ria pro equity model we bought boeing ba on the initial plunge and added positions in jpmorgan jpm apple aapl and ppl ppl we bought boeing ba on the initial plunge and added positions in jpmorgan jpm apple aapl and ppl ppl in the ria pro etf model we added healthcare xlv energy xle and gold iau as always we start with trading positions which have very tight stop loss parameters if our thesis on the position is proved correct the position size is increased and is moved into a longer term holding status with widened safety protocols this is how we approach linking longer term views to short term opportunities managing a portfolio of investments is simply measuring risk and reward and placing bets when reward outweighs the potential risk tweaking exposure to risk over time improves performance tremendously over the long term the goldilocks warning lately there has been an awful lot of talk about a goldilocks economy here in the u s despite a rather severe slowdown globally it is believed currently the domestic economy is going to continue to chug along with not enough inflation to push the fed into hiking rates but also won t fall into recession it is a just right economy which will allow corporate profits to grow at a strong enough rate for stocks to continue to rise at 8 10 per year every yearâ into eternity does that really make any sense particularly as we are looking at the longest expansion cycle in the history of the u s the problem is in the rush to come up with a bullish thesis as to why stocks should continue to elevate in the future they have forgotten the last time the u s entered into such a state of economic bliss you might remember this the fed s official forecast an average of forecasts by fed governors and the fed s district banks essentially portrays a goldilocks economy that is neither too hot with inflation nor too cold with rising unemployment wsj feb 15 2007 of course it was just 10 months later that the u s entered into a recession followed by the worst financial crisis since the great depression the problem with this oft repeated monument to trite is that it s absolute nonsense as john tamny once penned a goldilocks economy one that is not too hot and not too cold is very much the fashionable explanation at the moment for all that s allegedly good goldilocks presumes economic uniformity where there is none as though there s no difference between sausalito and stockton new york city and newark but there is and that s what s so silly about commentary that lionizes the fed for allegedly engineering goldilocks soft landings and other laughable concepts that could only be dreamed up by the economics profession and the witless pundits who promote the profession s mysticism what this tells us is that the fed can t engineer the falsehood that is goldilocks rather the fed s meddling is what some call goldilocks and sometimes worse not too hot and not too cold isn t something sane minds aspire to rather it s the mediocrity we can expect so long as we presume that central bankers allocating the credit of others is the source of our prosperity john is correct an economy that is growing at 2 inflation near zero and central banks globally required to continue dumping trillions of dollars into the financial system just to keep it afloat is not an economy we should be aspiring to but despite commentary the financial system has been put back together again why are central banks acting via bloomberg led by the fed many central banks have either held back on tightening monetary policy or introduced fresh stimulus soothing investor fears of a slowdown fed chairman jerome powell says he and colleagues will be patient on raising interest rates again while european central bank president mario draghi has ruled out doing so this year and unveiled a new batch of cheap loans for banks elsewhere authorities in australia canada and the u k are among those to have adopted a wait and see approach china at its national people s congress this month signaled a willingness to ease monetary and fiscal policies to support expansion unfortunately today s goldilocks economy is more akin to what we saw in 2007 than most would like to admit job growth is slowing down along with economic growth and recession risks are rising sharply however it isn t just the economy that is reminiscent of the 2007 landscape as noted above the markets also reflect the same here are a couple of charts worth reminding you of notice that at the peaks of both previous bull markets the market corrected broke important support levels and then rallied to new highs leading investors to believe the bull market was intact however the weekly sell signal never confirmed that rally as the unseen bear market had already started currently relative strength as measured by rsi on a weekly basis has continued to deteriorate not only was such deterioration a hallmark of the market topping process in 2007 but also in 2000 the problem of suggesting that we have once again evolved into a goldilocks economy is that such an environment of slower growth is not conducive to supporting corporate profit growth at a level to justify high valuations it is true that the bears didn t eat goldilocks at the end of the storyâ but then again there never was a sequel simple actions to take now you will appreciate later trim positions that are big winners in your portfolio back to their original portfolio weightings i e take profits sell underperforming positions if a position hasn t performed during the rally over the last three months it is weak for a reason and will likely lead the decline on the way down positions that performed with the market should also be reduced back to original portfolio weights hang with the leaders move trailing stop losses up to new levels review your portfolio allocation relative to your risk tolerance if you are aggressively weighted in equities at this point of the market cycle you may want to try and recall how you felt during 2008 raise cash levels and increase fixed income accordingly to reduce relative market exposure how you personally manage your investments is up to you i am only suggesting a few guidelines to rebalance portfolio risk accordingly therefore use this information at your own discretion see you next week market sector analysis data analysis of the market sectors for traders market sector analysis recommendations portfolio allocations client portfolio changes updates the real 401k plan manager a conservative strategy for long term investors there are 4 steps to allocation changes based on 25 reduction increments as noted in the chart above a 100 allocation level is equal to 60 stocks i never advocate being 100 out of the market as it is far too difficult to reverse course when the market changes from a negative to a positive trend emotions keep us from taking the correct action market rallies be patient as we have been discussing over the last several weeks the sharp rally in stocks has gone too far too quickly so just be patient here and wait for a correction consolidation to increase exposure the rally this past week was positive but remains very narrow in terms of participation the breakout of the recent consolidation range is bullish so you can increase exposure in portfolios modestly however the backdrop is not strong enough on a risk reward basis to take the portfolio allocation model back to 100 just yet also this rally remains concerning as i stated last week take a look at the chart above beginning in 2016 i drew a bull trend channel for the market in the chart above the dashed 45 degree black lines which have contained the bull market rally since the 2009 lows in january 2018 the market made as we stated then and unsustainable break above that upper trend line i add the horizontal black dashed line at that point and said that ultimately we would see a correction back the long term bull trend line since then exactly that has happened and rather than the market retesting the lower bullish trend line and then beginning a more normal advance the market rocketed higher in 2 months to hit and fail at the upper bullish trend line if the last decade provides any clues it is likely the market is going to remain range bound within this rising trend for now which suggests that waiting for a better entry point to increase exposure will be rewarded as we noted last week be patient and wait for a rally that rally ran faster than expected but broke above recent resistance if you are overweight equities take some profits and reduce portfolio risk on the equity side of the allocation however hold the bulk of your positions for now and let them run with the market take some profits and reduce portfolio risk on the equity side of the allocation however hold the bulk of your positions for now and let them run with the market if you are underweight equities or at target rebalance portfolios to model weights currently hold positions for now and increase allocations in modestly as needed to get towards target weights current 401 k allocation model the 401k plan allocation plan below follows the k i s s principle by keeping the allocation extremely simplified it allows for better control of the allocation and a closer tracking to the benchmark objective over time if you want to make it more complicated you can however statistics show that simply adding more funds does not increase performance to any

by reuters by trevor hunnicutt and ann saphir new york san francisco reuters only two things will really matter when federal reserve chairman jerome powell strides to the podium for his press conference on wednesday after the end of the u s central bank s latest two day policy meeting dots and bonds that powell and his colleagues will leave the fed s benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in a range of 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent and stick to their pledge of a patient approach to monetary policy is effectively a given the big reveal though will be whether policymakers will have sufficiently lowered their interest rate forecasts to more closely align their notorious dot plot a diagram showing individual policymakers rate views for the next three years in little blue shaded circles with that pledge of patience and just as importantly what new details will they share on a plan to stop culling the fed s holdings of nearly 3 8 trillion in bonds it s going to be new information for the market to trade whether it s the fed s intention or not said ben jeffery a strategist at bmo capital markets dissatisfaction with powell s remarks in december regarding the balance sheet threw markets for a spin and helped lead to the fed s pause on rates a month later since then the fed chief has explicitly said one of his aims is to avoid needless market disruptions traders currently expect there will be no rate hikes this year and are even building in bets for a rate cut in 2020 any gap between that view and the fed s could send markets lower so too could a sharp drop in policymakers rate hike expectations especially if coupled with a softer economic outlook graphic federal open market committee target rate projections wrong or confusing signals on either the rate forecasts or the fed s bond portfolio could upend the market calm the central bank in large part has engineered despite nosediving economic forecasts making powell s task even harder a jumble of economic data including a sharp slowdown in jobs growth last month that was accompanied by rising wages uncertainty on the outlook for the world economy and global trade as well as a sharp u s growth slowdown expected by a range of forecasters mean that markets are on a hair trigger for signals from the fed fed s guidance in january the fed pivoted from hiking rates quarterly to pledging patience before making more moves powell has also said the central bank could stop shedding bonds this year the central bank s last official policy statement offered no hint about whether rates will rise or fall the statement from the march 19 20 meeting is likely to do the same advertisement asked if they would support rate hikes this year fed policymakers have been offering less information patience is basically saying we re not going to give a lot of guidance to what we re expecting down the road because there s enough uncertainty that we just have to see how things evolve boston fed president eric rosengren told a national association of corporate directors chapter on march 5 but guidance is exactly what the fed offers in its summary of economic projections slated for release alongside the policy statement on wednesday that document could show the central bank expecting a rate hike if the economy delivers the strong 2019 growth most policymakers still forecast some fed officials voiced concern at the jan 29 30 policy meeting that the projections could send a misleading statement about what the central bank is doing according to the records from that meeting powell warned on march 8 against reading too much into the forecasts so far the fed s on guard and guarded communication has given markets new confidence a gauge of swings expected in u s government bond prices over three months hit its lowest levels in 17 years stock markets have reacted as well with the s p 500 index up more than 12 percent this year advertisement with little sign of an inflation pickup there would seem to be no urgency to raise u s borrowing costs and investors have all but written off the possibility of a hike this year especially with signs that slowing european and chinese growth might weigh on the united states balance sheet meanwhile the fed faces pressure to elaborate on piecemeal statements that it will stop cutting bond holdings this year the fed bulked up its books with bank reserves in order to buy trillions of bonds and further stimulate the economy once rates neared zero in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis to restore policy to normal the fed began shrinking its balance sheet in late 2017 by not replacing as many bonds when they mature advertisement now with the central bank ending that process fed policymakers face a number of questions some for instance have said they would not want the balance sheet policies which might tighten financial conditions to work at cross purposes with the more cautious rate policy graphic federal reserve bond holdings new york fed president john williams told reuters earlier this month that there is no clear answer to exactly how large the balance sheet needs to be investors will be looking for answers as soon as this week powell is likely to be pressed on the subject at his press conference on wednesday advertisement cliff corso executive chairman at investment manager insight north america llc said markets are looking for confirmation and comfort about their assumptions about the size and composition of the fed s assets any deviations around that might create a little bit of volatility he said

business energy page nigeria is no doubt very rich in mineral resources which have been largely untapped because of barriers to investment while the federal government believes it is on course to transform the country into a mining destination kingsley nwezeh looks at suggestions by the nigeria extractive industry transparency initiative neiti in its latest report on ways to improve the sector beyond oil and gas for which nigeria is highly ranked and known for globally huge deposits of solid minerals abound in the country such that there is hardly any state without the resource sufficient to power the economy if fully exploited owing to lack of attention by successive administrations to reactivate the sector and the full concentration on oil and gas the mining sector with a huge capacity to contribute to gross domestic product gdp has suffered untold neglect minerals in commercial quantities officially there are 44 different minerals found in commercial quantities in 450 locations across the country they include gold iron ore tin gemstones columbite topaz limestone uranium laterite gypsum and kaoline among others the extractive industry transparency initiative neiti in its latest report improving transparency and governance for value optimisation in nigeria s mining sector outlines three categories of minerals resources to include high value commodities like gold bulk commodities like iron ore and tin and gemstones these minerals can also be grouped into categories depending on their usage precious stones metallic minerals energy minerals industrial minerals and construction minerals it said a rich history of mining before the discovery of oil and the consequent decline in mining nigeria was a hub of mining activities dating back to 1902 with the first mining of tin ore by the royal niger company in 1905 gold was mined subsequently in the present kogi and niger states in 1914 and coal in present day enugu state in 1916 mining contributed to the development of a functional railway industry helping to transport mined coal from enugu to the seaport in port harcourt and to a power plant in oji river with tin ore mining and processing came the establishment of the largest smelter in africa makeri smelter in 1961 as well as a power plant in jos finally the establishment of industrial complexes and behemoths at the time of manufacturing came with iron ore including the ajaokuta steel mill with the capacity to produce 5 7 million tonnes of liquid steel delta steel plant with a capacity of 2 million tonnes of steel products and three inland mills in osogbo jos and katsina the report added low policy perception index after several decades of inactivity recent efforts have been put in place to revive the sector which is still grappling with low policy perception index a function of poor attention accorded the sector by government the neiti report identifies this snag as the reason for the absence of mining majors and minor and why nigeria is still not a mining destination but is considered a global haven for 54 unexploited mineral resources strewn across 22 states of nigeria given the review of nigeria s extensive and comprehensive mining regulations it is obvious that the country boasts of a regulatory framework that can measure up to some of the best in the world however it is obvious that efforts to give nigeria a world class regulatory architecture have not produced the kind of investor interest and patronage that was intended it is very probable though that with increased investor awareness of the continuous reforms to fine tune the process and address the gaps investors will come around to the emerging reality and begin to take advantage of the huge potential presented by the nigerian mining industry this potential is reflected in the globally referenced fraser institute annual survey of mining companies 2014 which also compared nigeria with other known global mining destinations such as chile australia united states of america usa and south africa the indices used by the institute are in relation to corporate tax the royalty payment regime financial incentives lease duration customs duty and ownership requirements the report said the report further noted that nigeria s corporate income tax rate of between 20 30 per cent compares favourably with those of south africa chile and australia and is much lower than that of the united states of america at 40 per cent the royalty regime of 3 5 per cent for metals gold copper iron ore and energy mineral coal also compares favourably with these countries and is much lower than the usa s regime of 4 10 per cent the tax holiday incentive of an initial period of three years from the commencement of operations is very attractive by global standards especially for a green and brown field exploration and mining destination while nigeria s efforts at attracting mining investors with the introduction of the ease of doing business policy initiative three years tax holiday among other incentives the sector remained largely unexploited the government policy of exemption from customs and import duties for mining equipment is also a major incentive as obtains in south africa and the usa this is unlike chile and australia that collect 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively and in some cases still collects additional import processing charges perhaps only chile which allows for an indefinite leasehold duration on mining leases could be said to be more attractive in comparison to nigeria s 25 years lease period in terms of ownership and foreign participation foreign companies are encouraged to incorporate local subsidiaries compared to these other destinations with varying percentages of permissible foreign acquisition while south africa allows for a maximum of 26 per cent ownership in australia this is limited to only 15 per cent however despite nigeria s extensive and globally competitive regulatory framework nigeria s mining industry is largely unexploited and contributes very little to the country s industrial output as at 2016 the mining index for nigeria was still comparatively the lowest at 84 1 per cent in comparison with that of the usa at 133 9 per cent australia at 131 per cent or even south africa at 98 per cent this is expected since these are known destinations with long tested mining cultures and consistency in the formulation government s position the present administration moving in the direction of reviving the ailing sector started by outlining a roadmap aimed at identifying the challenges facing the sector and moving to sanitise the sector by revoking thousands of dormant mining licenses and reallocating them to encourage artisanal miners n30 billion mining intervention fund was made available to enable miners overcome the near impossible interest rate placed on loans by banks in a recent interview minister of mines and steel development abubakar bawa bwari gave insights on government s efforts to revive the sector the road map we developed was in line with the mandate we were given and the mandate was to create jobs generate revenue and ensure that mining was done to the best standard practice so there was improved funding because of what was coming in here the budget for this ministry in 2015 was n1billion and they could hardly access n300 million so overtime based on our efforts there was improvement in budgetary allocation mr president approved n30 billion for us from the natural resources fund world bank also approved n150 million for us to develop the sector with that a lot of activities started picking up in the sector with that we were able to fund our mine officers all over the country provide logistics we are now able to monitor mining activities all over the country and suddenly things began to improve and we started the collection of royalty and so on with that we could also monitor the activities of illegal miners set up surveillance task forces with all the security agencies involved he said according to him the ministry was able to revive mineral resources management committees that helped in addressing issues of compensation land disputes and related issues within the local and mining communities so when we came in we realised that nigeria had minerals that minerals were all over the states and that in every local government you could identify one mineral or the other we realised that the potentials were there and that possibilities to achieve our objectives were there with improved funding we started exploration projects we also realised that there cannot be mining without data today we have improved data as a result of improved funding based on that a lot of activities have been generated in mining a lot is happening in the mining sector revenue has been improving steadily even under recession it kept growing and when you look at the statistics in the last three years mining revenue has been growing attracting investors the minister disagrees with the neiti report and argues that a high investment inflow has commenced as a result of efforts of government the minister who recently returned from a mining conference in south africa is presently in canada to showcase nigeria as a mining destination we had interactions with investors especially foreign investors at international mining conferences in south africa canada united kingdom and china among others before now nigeria was given little attention in terms of mining and this had to do with perception nigeria is perceived as oil and gas destination and not a mining destination ours was to change the perception and that has improved and today nigeria is on the lips of most investors we had the opportunity for the first time to sit at the london stock exchange to address them on the investment opportunities in nigeria we told them that we have the endowment we told them about the investment opportunities here and incentives available to prospective investors he said in spite of government s boisterous position the neiti report posits that more needs to be done to improve the perception issue and a general improvement in the state of mining in nigeria despite efforts at attaining a globally competitive regulatory and governance framework the policy perception index of nigeria is still comparatively one of the lowest in the mining world an index score of 30 54 10 63 is far below that of australia 76 61 70 47 chile 70 86 72 23 south africa 39 78 69 08 and usa 71 8 69 08 this perception will need to be worked upon by improving the indices of governance and consistency in policy execution the policy perception index is the outcome of surveys of investors working in the market the nigerian score reflects the absence of global mining majors and juniors however recently in their 2017 survey the mining magazine reports an improvement in the nigerian policy perception index this may have drawn largely from the implementation of the 2016 mining road map despite this the score is still comparatively low when compared with that of the major mining destinations it said neiti noted that nigeria s low score in policy perception index should be reversed through further removal of barriers to investment while efforts have been made by the current government to improve the ease of doing business score further attempts should be made to increase the ease of access to critical information not only about minerals deposits but even about ownership of mineral titles in the country mining policies should also guarantee predictability and consistency of application of rules
china needs better intellectual property protections the united states should have worked with allies to force change photo by vladislav klapin on unsplash after the first couple of articles i wrote people tried to guess my political affiliations my goal in these articles was not to share my political views but rather to share facts and background information that people would need to understand the nightly news i aim to make tariff and trade news more approachable the problem is we like labels we want to easily decide if we agree or disagree with someone based on the labels applied to them so many people reached out to accuse me of being for or against president trump s policies when i write that i do not think the tariffs are the right choice many people infer that i am anti trump when i say i support the administration s effort to strengthen intellectual property protection in china readers think i m pro trump some people that have read both feel these two viewpoints are contradictory i ve answered this question more than once i ve written an article explaining why i am anti tariff and pro trade war at this point but i ve clearly explained what the other options were or what a better plan would have been intellectual property example stronger intellectual property protection is imperative for further innovation most people understand that the technology sector is built on intellectual property these companies bring new innovative products to the market and eventually make money off the product sales but technology is not the only sector that depends on intellectual property and technological advances for their business to succeed advances in agriculture from breeding to processing to food storage have enabled humans to feed a growing population these ideas are patented or protected by trade secrets companies funnel money into research to invent a better product or process that they will eventually profit from these companies take risks learn and improve and ultimately sell the products or processes that are successful the rest are forgotten china does not uphold the same intellectual property rights and protections that other countries do in a global marketplace this is a huge problem for international trade commerce

sheet threw markets for a spin and helped lead to the fed s pause on rates a month later since then the fed chief has explicitly said one of his aims is to avoid needless market disruptions traders currently expect there will be no rate hikes this year and are even building in bets for a rate cut in 2020 any gap between that view and the fed s could send markets lower so too could a sharp drop in policymakers rate hike expectations especially if coupled with a softer economic outlook graphic federal open market committee target rate projections wrong or confusing signals on either the rate forecasts or the fed s bond portfolio could upend the market calm the central bank in large part has engineered despite nosediving economic forecasts making powell s task even harder a jumble of economic data including a sharp slowdown in jobs growth last month that was accompanied by rising wages uncertainty on the outlook for the world economy and global trade as well as a sharp u s growth slowdown expected by a range of forecasters mean that markets are on a hair trigger for signals from the fed fed s guidance in january the fed pivoted from hiking rates quarterly to pledging patience before making more moves powell has also said the central bank could stop shedding bonds this year the central bank s last official policy statement offered no hint about whether rates will rise or fall the statement from the march 19 20 meeting is likely to do the same asked if they would support rate hikes this year fed policymakers have been offering less information patience is basically saying we re not going to give a lot of guidance to what we re expecting down the road because there s enough uncertainty that we just have to see how things evolve boston fed president eric rosengren told a national association of corporate directors chapter on march 5 but guidance is exactly what the fed offers in its summary of economic projections slated for release alongside the policy statement on wednesday that document could show the central bank expecting a rate hike if the economy delivers the strong 2019 growth most policymakers still forecast some fed officials voiced concern at the jan 29 30 policy meeting that the projections could send a misleading statement about what the central bank is doing according to the records from that meeting powell warned on march 8 against reading too much into the forecasts so far the fed s on guard and guarded communication has given markets new confidence a gauge of swings expected in u s government bond prices over three months hit its lowest levels in 17 years stock markets have reacted as well with the s p 500 index up more than 12 percent this year with little sign of an inflation pickup there would seem to be no urgency to raise u s borrowing costs and investors have all but written off the possibility of a hike this year especially with signs that slowing european and chinese growth might weigh on the united states balance sheet meanwhile the fed faces pressure to elaborate on piecemeal statements that it will stop cutting bond holdings this year the fed bulked up its books with bank reserves in order to buy trillions of bonds and further stimulate the economy once rates neared zero in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis to restore policy to normal the fed began shrinking its balance sheet in late 2017 by not replacing as many bonds when they mature now with the central bank ending that process fed policymakers face a number of questions some for instance have said they would not want the balance sheet policies which might tighten financial conditions to work at cross purposes with the more cautious rate policy graphic federal reserve bond holdings new york fed president john williams told reuters earlier this month that there is no clear answer to exactly how large the balance sheet needs to be investors will be looking for answers as soon as this week powell is likely to be pressed on the subject at his press conference on wednesday cliff corso executive chairman at investment manager insight north america llc said markets are looking for confirmation and comfort about their assumptions about the size and composition of the fed s assets any deviations around that might create a little bit of volatility he said reporting by trevor hunnicutt in new york and ann

it was a mixed session for people who care about climate change and its effects the state secured some large scale wins but failed to advance measures that would diversify the electrical grid and support individual households in reducing their own carbon footprint and while measures to hold oil and gas companies accountable for violations of the oil and gas act passed there was little appetite among lawmakers for drawing more royalty money from an industry responsible for a billion dollar surplus this year the flagship win for democrats was the energy transition act sb 489 which commits the state to 100 percent carbon free power by 2050 that bill schedules a payment plan for closing the san juan generating station a coal fired power plant that supplies public service company of new mexico pnm major environmental groups endorsed it the utilities didn t vehemently oppose it and the governor championed it so it passed despite opposition from the city staff and elected officials from farmington who sought a delay in the bill so they could explore keeping the coal mine and power plant running the legislation overcame that request a senate filibuster and coal miners and power plant workers who traveled from the northwest corner of the state to fill meetings and line hallways as the bill moved through committees all of us have worked hard to move new mexico from a scarcity psychology to a new economic era of prosperity bold ideas and a bright economic future for all new mexicans rep antonio maestas d albuquerque said in a press conference after the session adjourned the energy transition act launches new mexico into not only the moral leader nationally with renewable energy but also tapping into the market that that renewable energy portfolio brings the rest of the successful legislation affecting electricity offered more tweaks than major transitions lawmakers added a new section to the public utility act that would order utilities to draft a plan to support electric vehicles through hb 521 the bill directs that plan to serve low income communities reduce greenhouse gases and match consumer choices for electric vehicles they also passed the solar energy improvement special assessment act hb 440 to adjust a 2009 program that allows counties and municipalities to work together to install solar energy then recover those costs through property taxes while there was support for requiring and helping utilities ramp up to using renewable power individual users and small groups saw initiatives wither that would have helped them with the costs of adding solar power on their own those misses included tax credits for installing solar panels on homes small businesses and farms sb 518 allocating 5 million annually to be doled out in one 6 000 credit at a time until jan 1 2029 the tax credit expired in recent years and a legislative efforts to revive it was vetoed by gov susana martinez this time around the bill cleared the senate but sat in the house until the end house speaker brian egolf said friday evening and saturday morning he might call the bill onto the floor but it never made it to the top of the agenda the community solar act hb 210 would have opened up solar power as an option for many more people including low income families renters homeowners with shady rooftops and even municipalities by allowing them to develop and cooperatively own solar arrays through subscriptions the bill passed the house only to stall out among senators the bill had been opposed by lobbyists from the state s major utilities pnm and el paso electric who said they appreciated the interest in more solar power but didn t think the approach was right for consumers republican lawmakers expressed skepticism about what subscribers would do for power when the sun didn t shine and argued these community solar arrays could leave utilities or other ratepayers shouldering the costs of maintaining or upgrading the grid on behalf of those projects other measures that would have transformed the process by which power is procured barely budged sb 456 would have required an independent evaluator oversee the bidding process when investor owned utilities determine where and how to purchase power the local choice energy act sb 374 would have allowed municipalities counties indian nations tribes or pueblos to combine the power requirements of several customers and take bids for meeting that demand it didn t even see a committee hearing oil and gas fared reasonably well some but not too much fairly well summarizes the majority democrats approach to oil and gas regulations this session lawmakers discussed updating some rules and regulations while avoiding strangling the golden goose that produced a 1 2 billion surplus for the state budget this year a last minute shuffle merged a bill originally written to regulate waste water from oil wells hb 546 with a bill written to restore the oil conservation division s authority to fine operators who break the oil and gas act sb 186 over the course of committee meetings those fines were lowered as was the trigger when a court was required to take a look at a fine after this session oil and gas companies will be asked to pay fees for drilling applications administrative hearings and surface waste management facilities a match to other states with an oil patch after passing sb 553 the fees are estimated to generate 1 9 million annually for the oil conservation division and that money will go toward upgrading the oil conservation division s information technology the division still requires drilling applications be submitted on paper the division s budget has dropped by 44 percent over roughly the same time that oil and gas production has increased by 400 percent according to the energy minerals and natural resources department the division has had to raid the oil and gas reclamation fund to pay agency salaries sb 361 amends the oil and gas act to reduce the division s reliance on the fund for that purpose by 2025 the division will only be able to use 15 percent of those dollars to cover salaries raiding of the reclamation fund has left the state division short of cash to pay for reclamation projects like the brine well in carlsbad lawmakers approved dedicating more than 40 million to that reclamation last year in hopes of repairing it before a sinkhole opens in town oil and gas companies and trade associations stood in support of these measures as increasing efficiency of the division lawmakers declined to advance bills that would have increased the royalty rate on state lands or halt hydraulic fracturing permits for four years a move that would have cost the state 3 2 billion in taxes royalties bonuses and land grant permanent fund distributions according to the fiscal impact report realize that that s the industry that s causing the wheels to turn in new mexico and to immediately ban that would be irresponsible and would have done great harm to the state minority leader james townsend r artesia said at a press conference after adjournment on the whole the oil and gas industry fared reasonably well under the conditions he said though he credits the work of his fellow republicans when you have an industry that s working so hard to fuel new mexico there ought to be a few friends in the legislature and that s what these guys and gals were they were friends to the industry he said
putting billionaires in their place america s billionaires have suddenly realized they just may be facing an existential crisis a good chunk of the american people they now understand would rather billionaires not exist every billionaire as a key aide of rep alexandria ocasio cortez has famously quipped on his popular twitter feed represents a policy failure the nation needs posits a recent new york times op ed to abolish billionaires our more pugnacious billionaires and their devoted admirers have greeted this new abolitionist thrust with predictable scorn national review columnist kevin williamson has tagged the case against billionaires as irredeemably stupid any attempt to tax billionaires out of existence suggests three comma investment banker ken moelis would surely crush the economy more sober defenders of the billionaires in our midst take care to acknowledge the widening and troubling gap between the fabulously wealthy and everyone else but then urge us all the same to think twice before seeking to flatten every tycoon it may seem counterintuitive adds washington post editorial page editor fred hiatt but billionaires can be good for democracy and a bulwark against tyranny bill gates the holder of the world s second largest fortune agrees the idea that there shouldn t be billionaires i m afraid if you really implemented something like that that the amount you would gain would be much less than the amount you would lose gates doesn t offer any evidence for that claim neither do hiatt or any of the more frothing foes of moves to level down the billionaire class in fact the only response to the billionaire abolitionist movement that bothers to offer up any statistical evidence on behalf of billionaires has come from a small group of daring conservative analysts these analysts are using the world s most egalitarian nations the nordics that conservatives typically love to hate to argue that life with billionaires can be incredibly sweet will wilkinson a self described recovering washingtonian who used to labor at the cato institute has penned the cleverest exposition of this billionaires make fine neighbors thesis wilkinson points out that the scandinavian nations that progressives regularly swoon over egalitarian pace setters like sweden and norway actually have more billionaires per capita than the billionaire packed united states so what s the problem asks wilkinson if there are billionaires in all the places where people flourish best why think getting rid of them will make things go better the american enterprise institute s james pethokoukis points to the united nations human development index a widely used metric for measuring social well being six countries he notes outrank the united states on this well being index and have more billionaires per capita these half dozen nations include the three most populous nordics norway sweden and denmark wilkinson and pethokoukis have not fudged any of these figures the scandinavian countries do have more billionaires per capita than the united states and the scandinavian countries do rate highly on all the standard measures of social well being as the british epidemiologists richard wilkinson and kate pickett have compellingly documented most recently in their new book the inner level how more equal societies reduce stress restore sanity and improve everyone s well being does all this mean as conservative analysts delightedly advise that americans have no reason to worry about our own billionaires no reason to flatten their fortunes not hardly counting up the number of billionaires in a nation can give us a vivid anecdotal sense of how concentrated a nation s wealth has become but to see how deep that concentration goes we need to look at more than the number of billionaires a nation may host we need to look at how many billions a nation s billionaires hold taking this step flips the nordic billionaire picture yes the nordics may have more billionaires per capita than the united states but those nordic billionaires have far fewer billions consider norway for instance the world s highest ranking nation on the un human development index the latest global billionaire census released earlier this week in china counts 10 dollar billionaires in norway down one from last year s hurun global rich list not one of these 10 norwegian billionaires ranks among the world s 100 richest billionaires an elite club that requires at least a 13 billion fortune to enter forbes magazine won t release its 2019 annual global billionaires tally until later this month last year s forbes list gave the largest norwegian private fortune to retailer odd reitan at 6 6 billion norway s billionaires the forbes figures indicate held a combined fortune of 39 1 billion by contrast 16 u s billionaires individually held more wealth than all of norway s billionaires combined american billionaires in other words stomp a much larger financial footprint than their norwegian counterparts in scandinavia overall economist gabriel zucman and his colleagues calculate the wealthiest 0 01 percent of households hold under 5 percent of their nations wealth the comparable figure in the united states just about 8 percent but figures like these researchers at the swiss bank credit suisse point out overstate the level of scandinavian inequality as average scandinavians experience it because scandinavians live in nations that work for working people in the united states average families are constantly feeling pressured to set aside limited paycheck dollars for college tuition or unexpected medical expenses or a home downpayment in scandinavia average families face no such pressure to slash daily living expenses and save why the difference in scandinavia credit suisse explains strong social security programs good public pensions free higher education or generous student loans unemployment and health insurance can greatly reduce the need for personal financial assets and public housing programs in scandinavia take the pressure off saving for a downpayment that leaves the middle and lower classes adds credit suisse with no pressing need for personal saving they can use more of their incomes instead to enrich the lives they and their loved ones lead the result less stress better health and longer lives than people enjoy in the united states where billionaires and the rest of the awesomely affluent have the wealth and power to rig the economy at the expense of average working families scandinavia s billionaires to be sure have some power too in norway a half dozen years ago a coalition government they supported ended the norwegian inheritance tax that move would assure billionaire status for the young norwegian woman who now ranks as the world s youngest billionaire the 22 year old heiress alexandra andresen a century ago norway and the other nordic nations rated as deeply unequal and unpleasant nations for most of their populations but mass social movements across scandinavia changed all that and forged societies that have flourished for almost all within them since the years of the great depression in today s deeply unequal world scandinavian activists readily recognize egalitarians can t take for granted what earlier generations achieved they need to work at protecting the equality those generations fought so diligently to forge billionaires even lowly ones make that work harder originally published by campaign for america s future
heading into 2020 there is much hand wringing by the corporate news media over what they perceive as a dangerous anti capitalist lurch to the left within the democratic party which these very well paid folks see as self destructive your view on any great battle is always going to be based on where you stand if your take of the current punditocracy yields six figures or better there s really no need to upend society s architecture clearly for you capitalism is working just fine for the corporate democrats the thought of socialists getting control of the party machinery is terrifying that s why the moderate democrat that comes to their mind is former vice president joe biden he actually knows some working class people speaks their language and knows how to take an amtrak train with them who else better to tame the excesses of capitalism than an elder statesman from delaware like biden who for decades blocked and tackled for the banking and credit card industry that rewarded him with massive campaign cash for his yeoman service as for righting the crime against humanity that was this country s racist war on drugs that s incarcerated a generation of people of color by criminalizing drug addiction who else better to fix it than uncle joe one of the framers of the pernicious policy and if you happen to be one of the middle aged parents with a millennial son or daughter in your basement whose future is shackled by college debt neither you nor your kid can ever pay back why uncle joe is sure to have the key after all he was the senator who made it impossible for college loans to be discharged by bankruptcy in the epic struggle between capital and labor there s been no better friend to capital than biden whose home state delaware is the favored stateside roost for vulture capitalists the state does such a great job hiding the beneficial ownership of limited liability corporations that both the major media corporations and the russian mob find it essential to domicile there so as to obscure their operations from public view such moderation would seem plausible if you were entirely blind to the ongoing deterioration in the circumstance of so much of america s working class where a few years of nickel and dime pay increases can t make up for decades of declining wages when wages were replaced with ever increasing household credit card debt without a ground up view from the broad base of america s wealth pyramid you won t fully appreciate just what 21st century capitalism has morphed into the violence that is evictions of families with children doesn t make the news unless somebody who is armed barricades themselves in their bedroom after all even in a wealthy city like new york city the tens of thousands of homeless there are just invisible from 10 000 feet the misery at the bottom is an abstraction shorthanded into bloodless statistics decades of depressed wages social disinvestment undiagnosed mental illness and a deepening housing affordability crisis are the legacy of a bipartisan neglect by a political class that up until very recently were entirely absorbed with their own re election and wealth accumulation and only the surreal buffoonery of a donald trump makes this professional political class look respectable keep in mind without the neglect of working class america by this bipartisan cadre of self dealing moderates you don t get a president trump you won t appreciate just how late it is for this country unless you are looking out for the particularly terrifying real life horror stories playing out in a place like the bronx where the united way reports 71 percent of the households struggle week to week for the basics and poverty defines the landscape two years ago this weekend fdny emt yadira arroyo a mother of five was murdered when she was run over with her own ambulance by a young homeless man who had commandeered her rig in the morris park section of the bronx emt arroyo 44 had 14 years on the job her kids ranged from 7 to 24 years old jose gonzales allegedly managed to slip into the driver s seat of the fdny ambulance after a struggle and threw the rig into reverse fatally hitting ms arroyo she was dragged for 15 feet as the suspect attempted to escape before he lost control jumping a curb and hitting a parked car arroyo who even with her overtime was making tens of thousands of dollars less than her fellow first responders who are cops and firefighters lived a life of selfless service but her colleagues in her ems union are largely women and people of color and new york city has had this first responder plantation system for so long even the progressive democratic mayor recently defended the glaring disparity arroyo s life was allegedly taken by a young man in his twenties who had gang affiliations and had serious run ins with the police his father told reporters he could not get his son to take his medication for his schizophrenia and depression he was living at a supportive shelter for the homeless arroyo s tragic violent death put a spotlight on what really is a national scandal when it comes to just how poorly compensated the nation s emergency medical services professionals are according to the department of labor s bureau of labor statistics the median pay for emts is 16 05 an hour with their median annual salary of 33 380 for the bottom 10 percent the pay is under 21 880 so this is how the so called free market is paying the people we task to respond to other human beings who could be on death s door in what clinicians call the golden hour that s that crucial time when how the patient is cared for determines if they live and what kind of life they get to live if they survive wouldn t it seem that if we really meant all that rhetoric about improving patient outcome and reducing health care costs we would treat these folks on the front end of the whole process better across the country emts have to work second and third jobs to make ends meet their job is already a stressful one that s compounded by the chronic economic insecurity that goes with their career choice as a consequence burnout and disabling injuries are common as is high turnover a 2016 research paper published in the journal of prehospital emergency care entitled death by suicide the ems profession compared to the general public reported that emts faced a significantly higher risk from taking their own life emts face high levels of acute and chronic stress as well as high rates of depression and substance abuse which increase their risk of suicide the report concluded as it turns out the sorry state of the nation s ems workforce maybe the best example of the 911 emergency working class americans are all grappling with now is not time for moderation that s how we got here
republicans tell university students come live in iowa s university cities but you don t get to vote there who can be surprised that republicans in the iowa legislature passed a bill out of committee that would restrict university students from voting in elections students have been a bane to republicans in iowa for decades probably since the nixon days as any good republican knows cheating is the best way to win elections most of us were waiting for laws suppressing student votes to be coming soon after voter suppression laws were passed so with no surprise here they are from iowapublicradio org republican senators advanced a wide ranging elections bill thursday ahead of a key statehouse deadline for legislation to remain eligible in this session it would block students at the university of iowa iowa state university and the university of northern iowa from voting early on campus that s one result of a proposed overall ban on hosting satellite voting stations in state owned buildings which would also include the iowa veterans home it s not only discriminatory but it s also a violation of voting rights said sen pam jochum d dubuque she noted students at private colleges in iowa could still have the opportunity to vote early on campus the bill would also require public university students to indicate on a new form if they will stay in iowa after graduation if they say they are leaving the state would cancel their voter registration this seems to be a way of removing them from the voter rolls said keenan crow of one iowa action and they may change their plans and have to re register we re not doing that to any other group so i m not sure why we re doing that to students if you are 18 and working in a crappy job the state of iowa is not going to ask you if you will be living in iowa in 4 or 5 years but they will if you are going to the public note not the private schools in iowa while you are a student at those schools you pay rent buy lots of stuff and pay gobs of taxes either directly or indirectly despite that you can t vote here looks pretty clear republicans don t want you to vote here because they don t like the way you might vote there is also another provision that will block using state buildings for early voting that seems to be aimed directly at the u of iowa hospital having early voting in the u of iowa hospital is a great convenience to doctors and nurses whose schedules are often so hectic that who knows what they will be doing on election day so it is a slap in the face to those professionals this one stinks to high heaven the only way to get it approved by the courts would be to change the way judges are picked now and make it extremely partisan and thank goodness that won t happen in iowa what you mean republicans are changing

smoke billows into the sky visible to nearby residents and motorists as a sign that something is burning in the alabama forest it s a prescribed fire at oak mountain state park which sometimes causes alarm because the smoke can be seen from interstate 65 or u s highway 280 but it ultimately promotes a healthy forest and better recreational opportunities for park visitors we want the public to know that there is such a thing as good fire said tasha simon chief of the natural resources section for the state parks division of the alabama department of conservation and natural resources adcnr prescribed fires simon said accomplish a number of critical objectives one of our objectives for using prescribed fire is to reduce excessive amounts of vegetative fuel on the ground and to decrease the risk of wildfire said simon who earned an ecology and evolutionary biology degree from the university of west florida prescribed fire is also used as a tool to control or manage invasive species to maintain biodiversity and to stimulate the growth of new vegetation that growth serves as valuable food for deer and creates a nesting habitat for turkey and quail prescribed fire is an important land and wildlife management tool used to restore and improve natural habitats throughout alabama s state park system for example a prescribed burn along the talmadge butler boardwalk trail at desoto state park in fort payne was conducted in 2021 to reduce an area of dense vegetation after the burn more sunlight was able to reach the ground which encouraged the return of the lady slipper a rare pink orchid to the landscape before a prescribed fire can occur simon must coordinate with various agencies to ensure the fire is properly managed specific weather conditions must also be present before it can start for instance one of the first prescribed burns of 2024 was scheduled for cheaha state park between jan 19 and march 1 an exact date of the fire could only be scheduled by evaluating numerous conditions including critical weather factors last year unfavorable weather conditions caused officials to postpone a prescribed fire at gulf state park until 2024 prescribed burns are also planned for desoto frank jackson lakepoint lake guntersville and oak mountain state parks this year funding state parks alabama state parks rely on visitor fees and the support of other partners like local communities to fund most of its operations that means the work performed by the state parks natural resources section depends on funding and manpower the state parks division budget is supplemented by revenues from alabamians purchase of an alabama state parks car tag and personalized boat decals which designates 80 of the tag s cost to the state parks system this additional revenue stream helps fund management activities such as prescribed fires it s important to remember that 100 of the day to day operational funding for our state parks is generated by user fees for lodging entrance golf campsites and other amenities paid by guests said chris blankenship adcnr commissioner every time someone chooses to buy a state parks car tag or boat registration personalized decal it helps our conservation efforts in fact this revenue stream has become vital for our state parks system to thrive i have a state parks tag on my truck in addition the alabama state parks foundation a non profit organization allows individuals and corporations to give directly to specific state parks or projects buffalo rock pepsi and the alabama power foundation are two recent examples of the corporate support aiding the alabama state park system donations can be made online at alabama state parks director greg lein said the additional revenue from car tag sales and the individual and corporate support provided through the foundation are crucial to continued conservation efforts and other improvements within the state parks system we are grateful to everyone who has purchased a car tag or made a donation through the foundation lein said their generous support helps us maintain and restore natural habitats within the parks as well as create new programs features and amenities for parks visitors without this additional funding many of these improvements to our natural resources trails and educational programs wouldn t be possible conservation efforts prescribed fires at alabama s 21 state parks often grab the public s attention but it s far from simon s lone responsibility we manage the land water soil plants and animals of alabama state parks said simon who is in her eighth year with the state parks system our mission is to safeguard the natural habitat and encourage responsible stewardship by doing so we create a tranquil environment offering our guests peaceful moments immersed in nature simon oversees the state parks division s conservation efforts which requires her to coordinate a wide variety of projects some days require simon to plan and execute prescribed fire other days are dedicated to managing efforts to control invasive species she also works to secure grant funding which paired with funding provided by car tag sales and the alabama state parks foundation enhances and expands all these efforts alabama s state parks feature more than 50 000 acres of land and water with parks in the foothills of the appalachian mountains the sandy beaches along the gulf of mexico and all points in between a state park is located within a short drive of virtually every alabamian alabama is one of the most biologically diverse states in the country and alabama s state parks system puts that biodiversity on full display a significant reason why the parks welcome millions of visitors every year alabama residents and visitors can enjoy the gorgeous scenery available alongside the state park system s picturesque cabins chalets and campgrounds reservations for overnight accommodations at alabama state parks can be made online at www alapark com working for healthy state parks the natural resources section also promotes the restoration of native habitats and species within state parks which includes managing invasive species a recent example of a successful public private partnership to reduce invasive plant species comes from chewacla state park in auburn where the all volunteer chewacla invasive plant working group is working to control chinese privet and tallowtree thorny olive wild taro water hyacinth kudzu and other non native plants simon helped secure a 20 000 hearts of stihl grant from stihl inc in 2022 which provided funding for the chewacla invasive plant working group s ongoing efforts she also secured another grant from the alabama association of resource conservation and development councils to support placing pollinator gardens at 12 state parks around the state starting this year additionally simon oversees lake management at alabama state parks in conjunction with the adcnr wildlife and freshwater fisheries division where she plays a key role in fostering recreational fishing this involves the preservation of suitable habitats upkeep of water quality and efficient control of invasive species simon also coordinates fish stockings to bolster the lakes overall ecological balance the aim of these efforts is to prevent population declines and support the

the wealthiest americans don t have to worry about how they will pay for groceries or a visit to a doctor when they re sick or heat for their homes during frigid weather they never have to think about whether their children will be able to afford to go to college or how they ll pay for summer programs to keep their children safe when school is out but tens of millions of americans are consumed with those worries and the budget president donald trump released last week decimates the very programs that help address the needs of the most vulnerable americans weingarten at a rally for public education in austin texas on march 11 photo by matthew jones budgets reveal priorities they reflect choices and trump whose lavish 2017 tax cuts for corporations special interests and the ultra wealthy exploded the deficit to perilous heights is making choices that are as heartless as they are reckless trump s budget eliminates funds for community schools preschools and after school and summer school programs in high poverty areas it cuts home energy assistance for seniors and people with disabilities the man who promised there will be no cuts to social security medicare and medicaid wants to cut all three programs proposing to slash more than 1 trillion from medicare and medicaid in the midst of the opioid addiction crisis trump s budget guts 12 4 billion from the department of health and human services even the administration s supposed priorities career and technical education and child care aren t funded in a meaningful way at a time when the soaring cost of higher education is saddling americans with record college debt and putting college out of reach for many people trump s budget would make higher education even less accessible he wants to eliminate public service loan forgiveness and divert 2 billion from pell grants which help students from lower income families it is no wonder trump plays so loose with the truth as it disguises the fact that by governing to favor america s elites he is hurting the very people who thought he would work for them it s not just this administration that has misplaced priorities twenty five states still spend less on k 12 public education than before the recession and 41 states still spend less on higher education the lack of appropriate investment is the root cause of every single one of the teacher walkouts that are roiling this country the center on budget and policy priorities found that the recent teacher strikes led to substantial increases in school funding in several states but that funding remains well below 2008 levels in those states and several have enacted only short term fixes after a decade of neglect and austerity in our country s schools the american people have had enough and want a reordering of the country s priorities to focus on things that make their families lives better and that starts with our children and sustainable investments in public schools colleges infrastructure and healthcare that is the aim of fund our future the aft s campaign to demand those in power invest in our public schools and in the resources students need to succeed particularly children of color children with special needs children who are vulnerable and children who live in poverty on the same day that trump and devos released their budget abandoning public schools and the families they serve i was with parents students and educators in texas for their fund our future kickoff rally texas has a 15 billion rainy day fund yet the state has cut public education spending by 2 5 billion over the past decade a dallas high school physics teacher at the rally said that if the school district gave her an extra 5 000 she d spend it on lab supplies and replace the broken chairs in her classroom in the first week of march alone there were 90 fund our future events nationwide with students parents and communities joining educators in demanding adequate investments in public schools and colleges in illinois they re fighting for a fair tax system in washington state they re calling for investments in community and technical colleges in philadelphia educators and allies are demanding safe learning environments in michigan and new mexico we re working with new governors whose priority is public education and in places like new york we re building on progress toward ensuring all not just some of our children have access to the public schools and colleges they deserve in an ideal world our elected leaders would use the country s economic resources to improve people s lives to make the american people healthier better educated and more secure to promote their potential and create opportunity where it has been denied and to make the vulnerable among us less so in reality we must elect and hold accountable leaders who are committed to funding our future
income inequality has soared in the united states over the past half century has educational inequality increased alongside in lockstep of course say public intellectuals from across the political spectrum as richard rothstein of the liberal economic policy institute puts it incomes have become more unequally distributed in the united states in the last generation and this inequality contributes to the academic achievement gap harvard political scientist robert putnam citing research by stanford sociologist sean reardon says rich americans and poor americans are living learning and raising children in increasingly separate and unequal worlds another well known political scientist charles murray argues that the united states is stuck with a large and growing lower class that is able to care for itself only sporadically and inconsistently the new upper class has continued to prosper as the dollar value of the talents they bring to the economy has continued to grow these analysts have good reason to express concern national competitiveness is at stake as education advocates have argued since the soviet sputnik launch inspired the national defense education act of 1958 economic productivity and growth are greater in countries where students perform better in math reading and science than in those that do not provide their youth the same opportunities to learn see education and economic growth research spring 2008 and while some might see income inequality as the result of adult life choices about matters such as how hard to work or where to live educational inequality seems unfair because the economic status of a child is outside the child s own control it is an inequality of opportunity that runs counter to the american dream despite the topic s importance surprisingly little scholarship has focused on long term changes in the size of the achievement gap between students from higher and lower socioeconomic backgrounds our new research presented here attempts to fill this void using data from four national assessments of student performance administered to representative samples of u s students over nearly five decades contrary to recent perceptions we find the opportunity gap that is the relationship between socioeconomic status and achievement has not grown over the past 50 years but neither has it closed instead the gap between the haves and have nots has persisted the stubborn endurance of achievement inequalities suggests the need to reconsider policies and practices aimed at shrinking the gap although policymakers have repeatedly tried to break the link between students learning and their socioeconomic background these interventions thus far have been unable to dent the relationship between socioeconomic status and achievement perhaps it is time to consider alternatives before drawing this conclusion though it is important to document the long term trends in the connection between socioeconomic background and school achievement press coverage of the subject typically mentions only the most recent shifts in achievement levels and gaps our study broadens the perspective by making full use of nearly 50 years worth of historical data available from four intertemporally linked assessments of achievement in math reading and science administered to nationally representative samples of adolescent students born between 1954 and 2001 by intertemporally linked we mean that the test makers in each of these assessments design the tests to be comparable over time by doing things such as repeating some of the same questions across different waves these testing programs also collect information on students socioeconomic backgrounds which we use to construct an index of socioeconomic status we report changes in the gaps in performance between students from more and less advantaged backgrounds over the past half century we find that the socioeconomic achievement gap among the 1950s birth cohorts is very large about 1 0 standard deviations between those in the top and bottom deciles of the socioeconomic distribution the 90 10 gap and around 0 8 standard deviations between those in the top and bottom quartiles the 75 25 gap these are very extensive disparities as 1 standard deviation is approximately the difference in the average performance of students in 4th and 8th grades or four years worth of learning but though these inequalities are large they have neither increased nor decreased significantly over the past 50 years it could be however that the picture is not as dismal as suggested if overall changes in society coupled with policy initiatives have proportionately lifted all boats at the same rate everybody might be better off even if gaps have not significantly changed using the same data as for the gap analysis we find gains in average student performance of about 0 5 standard deviations for students at age 14 or roughly 0 1 standard deviations per decade but surprisingly over the last quarter century those gains disappear for students by age 17 in other words there is no rising tide for students as they leave school for college and careers prior research the effects of family background on student achievement are well documented but few studies track changes in the relationship between demographic characteristics and student performance over time this scarcity of longitudinal analysis partly reflects measurement challenges family background and achievement there is little dispute that students performance in school is strongly affected by their family background james coleman and colleagues in their seminal 1966 study equality of educational opportunity found that parental education income and race are strongly associated with student achievement while school resources such as per pupil expenditures and class size are much less significant subsequent research has confirmed these early findings see how family background influences student achievement features spring 2016 a variety of mechanisms link socioeconomic status to achievement for instance children growing up in poorer households and communities are at greater risk of traumatic stress and other medical problems that can affect brain development college educated mothers speak more frequently to their infants use a larger vocabulary with their toddlers and are more likely to use parenting practices that respect the autonomy of a growing child higher income families have access to more enriching schooling environments and they generally do not face the high rates of violent crime experienced by those in extremely impoverished communities all these and other childhood or adolescent experiences contribute to profound socioeconomic disparities in academic achievement trends in the socioeconomic achievement gap des pite firm documentation of a strong connection between socioeconomic status and student achievement only two studies provide information on trends in the opportunity gap over time in an appendix table of a 1998 paper larry hedges and amy nowell report the relationship between student performance and several background characteristics across six nationally representative surveys administered between 1965 and 1992 among these variables parental education has the strongest correlation with student achievement and that connection endures over time the correlation between achievement and family income in the six surveys is weaker and declines over time in a second investigation published in 2011 sean reardon draws on data from 12 surveys that contain information on both student achievement and reports of parental income to estimate gaps in math and reading performance of students at the 90th and the 10th percentiles of the household income distribution in contrast to hedges and nowell he finds that the income achievement gaps among children born in 2001 are roughly 75 percent larger than the estimated gaps among children born in the early 1940s for those born after 1974 children in families at the median income were falling farther behind those at the 90th percentile leading reardon to conclude that the 90 50 gap appears to have grown faster than the 50 10 gap during the 1970s and 1980s reardon s study and its conclusions have been widely cited by both academics and in the general media and the idea that income related achievement gaps have dramatically increased has become contemporary conventional wisdom in a 2012 article the new york times asserts that while the achievement gap between white and black students has narrowed significantly over the past few decades the gap between rich and poor students has grown substantially during the same period another times piece quotes reardon as saying the children of the rich increasingly do better in school relative to the children of the poor this has always been true but is much more true now than 40 years ago differences between the findings reported in the two studies may be owing to the focus of hedges and nowell on overall correlations between socioeconomic status and achievement while reardon discusses disparities between the extremes of the income distribution they could also reflect the fact that reardon s analysis makes use of twice as many surveys as the earlier study including data on more recent cohorts we however explore a third possibility methodological limitations common to both studies both estimate trends from data collected by different surveys that are administered to students of varying ages and use disparate methods of estimating achievement levels and socioeconomic characteristics as federal reserve economist eric nielsen points out when data sources have income and achievement measures that do not map easily across surveys they add an additional layer of complexity and uncertainty to the analysis it is this uncertainty that we seek to mitigate by relying on surveys that allow for consistent intertemporally linked measures of both student achievement and socioeconomic status method we draw data from four testing programs two that are part of the national assessment of educational progress naep the long term trend and main naep the trends in international mathematics and science study timss and the program for international student assessment pisa see sidebar for details we include all tests administered to students age 14 or thereabouts and at age 17 for convenience we identify all those tested at ages 13 to 15 as 14 years old all told we compile observations of achievement levels and gaps from 46 tests in math 40 in reading and 12 in science or a total of 98 intertemporally linked tests over a 47 year period across this time span achievement data are available for 2 737 583 students to measure these students socioeconomic status we use indicators of parental education and home possessions as reported by students to construct an index similar to one designed by pisa the choice of indicators is determined by the fact that all four assessments collect information on family background directly from students themselves young people are thought to be aware of their parents level of educational attainment but to have only an imperfect knowledge of their parents earned income as a classic study investigating this question puts it income is a matter of speculation for many students and thus inaccurately reported for this reason the surveys collect economic information by asking students about household items such as the number of durable goods and educational items present in the home students are likely not to have seen their family s tax return these same students though are well aware of whether they sleep in their own bedroom or share one they also know whether their home includes a dishwasher or a computer our analysis thus differs from reardon s study which excludes assessments that do not ask students or their parents a direct question about household income we use our constructed index to estimate two disparities for each test 1 the difference in achievement between the highest and lowest deciles of the socioeconomic distribution the 90 10 gap and 2 the difference between the highest and lowest quartiles the 75 25 gap we then fit simple quadratic trend lines through these points in order to document how if at all the magnitude of these disparities has changed over time achievement gaps as can be seen in figure 1 the disparities in achievement between students from the highest and lowest socioeconomic status groups are strikingly persistent throughout the time period the socioeconomic achievement divide hardly wavers over this half century in the 1954 birth cohort the achievement gap between the average of those in the top and bottom deciles of the socioeconomic distribution stood at slightly less than 1 2 standard deviations for those born in 2001 the gap is only slightly less about 1 05 standard deviations that is the most disadvantaged students have made the same gains in achievement over the decades as those realized by the most advantaged students the disparity between students in the top and bottom quartiles of the socioeconomic distribution was about 0 9 standard deviations for the 1954 birth cohort this 75 25 gap falls slightly during the next two decades settling at barely below 0 8 for the cohort born in 2001 trends are similar for math and reading separately the gap in math achievement particularly for the 90 10 comparison shows a little movement over the period narrowing in the early years but returning to a position below the initial level in recent decades the 75 25 math gap narrows slightly over time in reading the pattern appears essentially flat for the entire period to see whether an alternative measure of socioeconomic status yields similar results we estimate the gap between students who are eligible for the federal school lunch program and those who are not as reported on the main naep the one assessment that contains this information the federal program provides free lunch to extremely poor students from households below the poverty line while a reduced price lunch is available to moderately poor students with somewhat higher incomes 1 85 times the poverty line the gap between the extremely poor students and other students in the 1982 birth cohort is a sizable 0 73 standard deviations figure 2 when the extremely poor are combined with the moderately poor the gap for this cohort is nearly as large over the next 20 years the gap between the extremely poor and students from families above the eligibility line narrows by just 0 02 standard deviations while the gap between ineligible students and all those eligible for participation in the program widens by 0 01 in sum this alternative measure of the achievement gap between students from higher and lower socioeconomic backgrounds also shows only minuscule change over the course of the past two decades figure 2 also shows the white black achievement gap while this is not accurately thought of as a socioeconomic gap because of the improvements in black incomes it represents another potential dimension of continuing societal disparities as figure 2 shows there is a sizable shrinking of the racial gap in the early period but little change across the last two decades some have hypothesized that the lack of success in diminishing the size of the socioeconomic gap is due to changes in the racial and ethnic composition of the school population it is true that the ethnic makeup of the school age population has changed dramatically over the past half century with the share that is white declining from about 75 percent to 55 percent however these changes do not seem to have materially affected trends in performance gaps the 90 10 socioeconomic achievement gap among white students born in 1954 was one standard deviation by the middle of the period the divide had declined by about 0 2 standard deviations but it then rose again by a commensurate amount trends for the 75 25 socioeconomic achievement gap among whites are much the same confirming that changes in the ethnic composition of student cohorts do not account for the unwavering divide between the haves and have nots in sum our results confirm reardon s finding of large gaps in academic performance between students at the extremes of the socioeconomic distribution the average 90 10 income achievement gap across the surveys suggested by the reardon analysis is very similar to the 90 10 socioeconomic achievement gap we identify we are however unable to replicate reardon s finding that achievement differentials have risen by as much as 75 percent over the past 50 years his results may be a function of a reliance upon cross sectional studies that use disparate methods for collecting both income and achievement information whatever the reason the trends estimated in his analysis differ markedly from the gaps we observe by using a uniform measure of socioeconomic status and data from intertemporally linked surveys administered to students of the same age rising tides we might feel differently about these persistent achievement gaps if we found that all achievement was rising and thus suggesting improved economic futures for all to place the achievement gaps in context we describe changes in the average level of achievement among students at age 14 and age 17 for students born between 1954 and 2001 figure 3 shows a significant upward trend in the average achievement level for all adolescent students of approximately 0 3 standard deviations over the course of the past half century or approximately 0 06 per decade this trend differs by the age of the student however students at age 14 show an overall increase of about 0 43 standard deviations or approximately 0 08 per decade but gains among students at age 17 amount to only about 0 10 standard deviations or 0 02 per decade further we see no improvement in the performance of older students after the 1970 birth cohort trends in average levels of achievement do differ in magnitude by subject but the overall patterns are quite similar in math the younger adolescents register average gains of 0 9 standard deviations while the older ones show a shift upward of only 0 25 at both ages the reading gains are less the trend among younger adolescents amounts to just 0 20 standard deviations over the half century and among older ones the trend is flat showing no upward trend at all the differences in trend lines for students at different ages presents a puzzle for which we have no easy answer even setting aside the oldest students in our data we see that the average improvement in test performance among 13 and 14 year olds who take the naep tests and the timss is larger than that registered by 15 year olds on the pisa tests this may reflect differences in test design or it may suggest that the fade out in gains begins in the early years of high school the lack of a positive trend among 17 year olds for the past quarter century also suggests that high schools do not build upon gains achieved earlier a signal perhaps that the high school has become a troubled institution in any event there is no sign of a rising tide that lifts all boats at age 17 when these students are going into further schooling or into the labor force importantly the age anomaly that we see in the trends in achievement levels is not found in the performance gaps constant social gaps are found across all age groups discussion the achievement gap between haves and have nots in the u s remains as large as it was in 1966 when james coleman wrote his landmark report and the nation launched a war on poverty that made compensatory education its centerpiece that gap has not widened as some have suggested but neither has it closed the question remains why has the gap remained constant the tempting answer is that nothing significant enough has happened to alter its size but this would ignore a wide variety of factors that have shifted over the years it is more likely that some changes within families and within schools have worked to close the socioeconomic achievement gap while other changes have widened it with these factors largely offsetting one another families in terms of family background there is the widening differential in household income that motivated reardon s work socioeconomic differences in the age of the mother at the birth of the child have also increased in the past 50 years the incidence of single parent households has increased and is likewise concentrated at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum each would tend to exacerbate socioeconomic achievement gaps but these negative factors could be offset by other countervailing demographic changes most importantly differences among children in their parents level of educational attainment have narrowed as overall education levels have climbed so have differences in the number of siblings in the household both factors are important determinants of student achievement the balance among all these factors may well have left the family contribution to the achievement gap at much the same level today as it was for cohorts born in the 1950s schools similarly there may be opposing forces within the educational system that have offset one another on the one side over the past 50 years the federal government has enacted compensatory education programs for school age children and the head start program for students at ages three and four brown v board of education and the civil rights act of 1964 accelerated school desegregation particularly in the south the individuals with disabilities education act funded school services for students with disabilities a group disproportionately composed of children from low income families states systematically changed their funding of local schools often in response to court orders leading to more equal funding between rich and poor school districts overall school funding increased dramatically on a per student basis quadrupling in real dollars between 1960 and 2015 and finally states have introduced measures holding schools accountable for student performance as required by the 2002 no child left behind act accountability mandates were disproportionately directed toward schools serving low income students each is aimed at closing gaps on the other hand the quality of the teaching force a centrally important factor affecting student achievement may well have declined over the course of the past several decades women have greater access to opportunities outside the field of teaching teachers performance on standardized tests has slipped along with other indicators of selectivity teacher salaries have declined relative to those earned by other four year college degree holders and are currently low relative to comparable workers in other occupations see do smarter teachers make smarter students features spring 2019 these changes affecting the quality of the teaching force are likely to have had a disproportionately adverse effect on disadvantaged students collective bargaining agreements and state laws have granted more experienced teachers seniority rights leaving disadvantaged students to be taught by less effective novices in other words a growing disparity in teacher quality across the social divide may have offset the impacts of policies designed to work in the opposite direction conclusion two surprises emerge from this analysis of long term trends in student achievement levels and gaps across the socioeconomic distribution first gaps in achievement between the haves and have nots are mostly unchanged over the past half century second steady gains in student achievement at the 8th grade level have not translated into gains at the end of high school because cognitive skills as measured by standardized achievement tests are a strong predictor of future income and economic well being the unwavering achievement gap across the socioeconomic spectrum sends a discouraging signal about the possibilities of improved intergenerational social mobility perhaps more disturbing programs to improve the education of disadvantaged students while perhaps offsetting a decline in the quality of teachers serving such students have done little to close achievement gaps these steadfast disparities suggest the need to reconsider the current direction of national education policy two areas for further exploration seem especially critical first researchers have uniformly found that teacher effectiveness is a predominant factor affecting school quality while there has been ample commentary on teacher recruitment and compensation policies few programs and policies at scale have directly focused on enhancing teacher quality particularly for disadvantaged students second the achievement gains realized by students at age 14 fade away by age 17 yet policymakers have left high schools like the achievement gap itself in many ways untouched eric a hanushek is the paul and jean

percent to 2 50 percent and stick to their pledge of a patient approach to monetary policy is effectively a given the big reveal though will be whether policymakers will have sufficiently lowered
