what s new a neglected banking crisis in libya is coming to a head just as forces under field marshal khalifa haftar are trying to capture tripoli a protracted conflict will hinder efforts to reunify the divided banking system fuelling prospects of a financial implosion and economic war alongside the military one why did it happen the looming crisis is a direct consequence of a four year split between the central bank in tripoli and its eastern branch dating from the broader political divide that emerged in 2014 haftar s desire to seize control of the central bank and state assets possibly contributed to the timing of his offensive why does it matter should the central bank freeze the operations of two key commercial banks because of falling reserves the move could destabilise the east based government and interrupt funding for haftar led forces this would deepen the political divide between competing authorities in east and west and produce severe economic blowback throughout the country what should be done in addition to a ceasefire libya s warring sides should at a minimum reach agreement on standardising commercial banking operations in the east and work toward the central bank s reunification libya s foreign partners should offer expert advice and prioritise resolving the financial crisis in negotiations executive summary as forces loyal to east based military commander khalifa haftar battle armed groups in western libya nominally loyal to the tripoli based government a neglected and possibly explosive banking crisis could further destabilise the country in april the tripoli based central bank of libya started enforcing restrictions on several eastern state owned commercial banks which together cover 30 per cent of libya s commercial banking needs such restrictions loomed prior to haftar s offensive which may partly have been inspired by a spiralling banking feud rooted in libya s 2014 political split if the central bank further tightens restrictive measures this would compromise the east based government s ability to pay employees and haftar s forces this in turn could prompt haftar to cut oil exports from areas he controls and ignite an economic war averting such a crisis requires a settlement between the central bank in tripoli and its eastern branch in benghazi operating autonomously since 2014 on how to account for commercial bank transactions libya s international partners should work toward that goal the battle for tripoli has already caused at least 300 deaths and displaced tens of thousands in a month of fighting haftar s libyan national army s lna offensive which began in early april so far has foundered on the capital s periphery in the face of fierce resistance from armed groups aligned with the un backed government of national accord both sides project confidence that they will prevail with military and financial support from their respective foreign sponsors they have also rejected mediation by external neutral parties such as the un all signs point to a prolonged highly destructive stalemate against the backdrop of ongoing fighting the authorities in tripoli evince little appetite for responding to the imminent banking crisis they know they have the advantage of exclusive access to state funds accruing from oil sales and that a concession from their side would save the very banks that have helped bankroll the military forces now besieging them the tripoli authorities may indeed be tempted to let the banking crisis come to a head or even take additional measures such as interrupting salary payments to east based civil servants currently on tripoli s payroll in order to halt funding streams to the east thereby hamstringing the lna s ability to carry on the fight such a strategy could make military sense but it would also compound libya s lingering economic crisis by orders of magnitude with grave social economic and political repercussions for the entire country the commercial banks growing troubles could cause mass panic aggravate an existing liquidity crisis and impede service delivery as key state companies and private firms which hold accounts with these banks may no longer be able to process payments or issue letters of credit to import the essential goods on which libya is highly dependent a financial squeeze in the east could also reignite fighting over libya s sole source of revenue its oil in the short term haftar could ask his wealthy regional backers mainly the united arab emirates uae and saudi arabia to bankroll his war effort but as the battle wears on the east based government could decide to shut down the country s oil fields and export terminals most of which are under lna control this would deepen the de facto split between east and west including the rift in the banking sector and possibly become a prelude to partition all these developments would vastly complicate efforts to reach a political settlement to the libyan conflict overall to prevent such a catastrophic scenario libya s competing military coalitions in the east and west should urgently agree to a ceasefire and then promptly launch negotiations between the central bank s rival governors to settle the dispute over how to account for financial transactions in the east outside actors should press the parties to embark on this course of action and offer expert advice the u s in particular should use its historical leverage over libya s financial and oil sectors and its newly declared sympathy for haftar to usher the parties toward a financial settlement this is an essential step that should support simultaneous political and military to military negotiations over reunifying governing institutions including reconsolidating the central bank and appointing new bank governor ultimately only the reunification of libya s rival governments and state institutions including its financial ones can bring the stability that its citizens crave reunification by military means on which haftar and his backers appear to be betting is likely to backfire the promise of a financial settlement might make the difference libyan parties need to agree to a ceasefire and put political negotiations back on track tripoli benghazi brussels 20 may 2019 i introduction the making of a banking crisis in 2014 libya suffered a political crisis that split the country into two rival parliaments and governments the interim government headed by prime minister abdullah al thinni in the east which enjoyed international recognition until december 2015 and a tripoli based government subsequently in the december 2015 un brokered skhirat agreement libyan negotiators established a government of national accord in tripoli with a presidency council headed by faiez serraj to which the un security council extended international recognition nevertheless the thinni government continued to operate in the east backing the libyan national army lna forces of field marshal khalifa haftar the 2014 political crisis also triggered a rift in the central bank between governor siddiq elkebir in tripoli and his deputy ali al hibri who proceeded to operate the bank s benghazi branch autonomously the rift in the central bank prompted a dispute between libya s two power centres tripoli and benghazi over how state revenues mainly from oil sales are allocated three related developments escalated this disagreement the first was the central bank s 2014 decision to disconnect the benghazi branch from its automated electronic payment system which prompted the latter to resort to a parallel manual accounting system the central bank has declared it does not recognise the benghazi branch s parallel accounting system but the parliament based in the eastern city of tobruk has said it does and east based authorities consider transactions conducted through it as valid under libyan law the second was the east based government s decision to authorise the benghazi branch to expand the bank s monetary base by printing cash and putting into circulation money funded through bonds and treasury bills not backed by actual capital without the central bank s approval in order to pay public sector salaries and make other payments in areas under their control including for the lna such payments have amounted to approximately nine billion dinars 6 4 billion a year since 2015 to make these payments the east based government has used commercial banks that have their headquarters and most of their branches in the east from where they can cater to the east based government s newly recruited employees and security forces three banks in particular the state owned national commercial bank and the wahda bank and the small private commerce and development bank process the bulk of these payments which together account for 30 per cent of libya s commercial banking needs as a result of such operations these banks have accumulated reserves and credits with the central bank s benghazi branch which the central bank in tripoli does not recognise haftar s ongoing attempt to capture the capital by force is providing tripoli based authorities with a justification to let the financial crisis unfold the third development was the october 2018 introduction by the tripoli government of financial measures that liberalised the purchase of foreign currency throughout the country at a new higher rate this drained these three above mentioned banks reserves with the central bank which debited their accounts in local currency cumulatively these three developments are dipping the east based commercial banks into an acute crisis as their deposited reserves with the central bank have dropped close to the minimum required by law 20 per cent of their total deposits if they were to go below it as appears imminent or may have happened already the central bank could impose restrictions on them mainly on foreign currency purchases that would limit their ability to make payments or it could even let their reserves completely run out at which point the banks by default would be unable to operate in late april central bank officials in tripoli imposed limitations and special control mechanisms on foreign currency transactions on the wahda bank and commerce and development bank as well as two smaller banks the central bank claimed the measures constituted due diligence to prevent fraudulent transactions but representatives of one of the targeted banks and the officials of the central bank s benghazi branch argue they are retaliatory measures singling out eastern banks specifically those whose reserves with the central bank in tripoli are drying up the restrictions already imposed and additional ones expected to follow including on other banks such as the national commercial bank would block these banks from bankrolling the east based authorities and also affect their operations in the rest of the country the gathering banking crisis has yet to garner much public attention but some officials in the central bank its eastern branch and the three affected commercial banks first sounded the alarm in march given the timing of haftar s advance on tripoli which kicked off in early april it is quite possible that financial pressures helped motivate his decision to launch the offensive he may have bet on a quick march into the capital to gain control of the central government and reconsolidate the central bank under his control such an outcome would have forced the central bank to accept all the liabilities of its eastern branch which has openly supported the offensive and given haftar continued access to state funds it also would have satisfied some of haftar s foreign backers who accuse the central bank in tripoli of bankrolling militias and islamist groups they oppose if haftar s offensive fails however he may have little choice but to call on his foreign backers to bankroll public finances in the east in the meantime haftar s ongoing attempt to capture the capital by force is providing tripoli based authorities with a justification to let the financial crisis unfold and possibly even take additional steps to curb all domestic funding streams to those attacking tripoli this report is based on scores of interviews with libyan banking and government officials based in eastern and western libya in the first quarter of 2019 it also builds on crisis group s research into the financial aspects of the libyan political crisis ongoing since 2014 ii from political to financial rift a divided banks the origin of the financial crisis lies in the september 2014 decision by the house of representatives hor which had installed itself in tobruk in august after contested general elections two months earlier to appoint the central bank s former deputy governor ali al hibri as interim governor replacing siddiq elkebir in reality hibri became the head of the central bank s branch in benghazi now operating autonomously while elkebir remained in office in tripoli consequently the competing governments in east and west began operating separate and conflicting monetary and fiscal policies the central bank retaliated in october 2014 disconnecting its eastern branch from its automated clearing system real time gross settlement or rtgs which all libyan commercial banks use to manage their accounts with the central bank prior to 2014 the central bank had three operating branches in tripoli benghazi and sebha of these tripoli and benghazi were linked to the rtgs this meant that the two branches could process and clear both government and private payments to ministries companies and individual account holders with commercial banks the central bank took this step to prevent east based authorities from accessing government accounts and funds both reserves and oil revenues the tripoli based parliament general national congress gnc elected in 2012 viewed the newly elected hor as illegitimate the decision to cut benghazi off from the rtgs predates the november 2014 ruling of the tripoli based supreme court in effect declaring the june 2014 hor election unconstitutional this subsequently gave the central bank cover to treat the hor backed government in the east as illegitimate and consider all hor decisions related to banking including its requests for budget disbursements null and void the central bank s decision was especially aimed at preventing the disbursement of funds to haftar s incipient lna which the hor backed but the tripoli authorities deemed illegal however the central bank kept on its payroll all public sector employees hired before the 2014 political crisis including many in the east and kept commercial banks including those in the east connected to the rtgs system the suspension of the benghazi branch from the central bank s automated clearing system continues until this day giving rise to parallel yet overlapping financial systems in eastern and western libya despite being deprived of state financing and access to oil revenues which accrued solely to the coffers of the internationally recognised central bank in tripoli authorities in the east continued to operate with the hor s support and found other ways to fund themselves initially they were able to obtain loans from libyan commercial banks and later in 2015 bonds or treasury bills underwritten by the interim government s ministry of finance and the central bank s eastern branch east based authorities offset some of this debt by printing and putting into circulation ten billion dinars 7 billion worth of banknotes throughout 2015 2018 independently from the central bank in tripoli the funding stream to the east based authorities continued even after the 2016 installation of the government of national accord gna in tripoli which the un security council but not the hor recognised the suspension of the benghazi branch from the central bank s automated clearing system continues until this day giving rise to parallel yet overlapping financial systems in eastern and western libya see appendix b b parallel financial systems the aforementioned bonds and treasury bills written out between 2015 and 2018 created an east based public debt not authorised by the central bank in tripoli amounting to 35 billion dinars 25 billion or almost nine billion dinars 6 billion a year the east based government uses approximately 65 per cent of its funds to finance its operations including the salaries of employees it hired after the 2014 political crisis who are not included in the tripoli budget as well as employees hired before the crisis but cut off from the tripoli payment system for technical and political reasons after 2014 it uses another 30 per cent to cover the lna s operational costs and salaries most of which are not covered by the tripoli budget the central bank s benghazi branch calculates the breakdown of its civilian versus military expenditures between 2015 and 2018 as follows figure 1 interim government based in eastern libya expenditure 2015 2018 in millions lyd source central bank of libya benghazi branch march 2019 unpublished source the full breakdown of the figures is available in appendix c of this report throughout this same period the tripoli based government s budget averaged 36 billion dinars slightly over 25 billion a year oil revenues are the tripoli government s main source of income but due to a shortfall in hydrocarbon production and exports tripoli has also faced a budget deficit which has oscillated averaging fifteen billion dinars 10 billion a year in early 2019 the central bank indicated that the tripoli government s total cumulative outstanding debt to it was 62 billion dinars 44 billion the breakdown of the tripoli government s expenditures which shows that over half of its disbursements go toward salary payments is as follows figure 2 expenditure of the tripoli based government 2015 2018 in millions lyd source central bank of libya economic bulletin 4th quarter 2018 table 29 the full breakdown of the figures is available in appendix d of this report the tripoli government s budget covers most public sector employees including many civil servants and some lna and other security officers in eastern libya who were already on the public payroll prior to the 2014 crisis the government makes its salary payments by issuing electronic checks via the rtgs which it processes through commercial banks across libya these payments like all other transactions through electronic payment systems including wire transfers are first transferred from the tripoli government s main account to the deposit accounts that commercial banks keep with the central bank this is not the case for the east based government s expenditures after 2014 the central bank s benghazi branch acting autonomously writes out manual checks to government offices or companies but they are cleared by commercial banks where customers have their accounts and pass through escrow parallel accounts that do not communicate with the automated electronic clearing system used in tripoli the result is a parallel system to account for commercial bank credits and debits with the central bank s eastern branch all libyan commercial banks with branches in the east therefore operate two parallel systems rtgs for legal transactions sanctioned by the central bank in tripoli and a manual one for other transactions which tripoli considers rogue operations with the eastern branch according to siddiq elkebir the central bank governor referring to the december 2015 libyan political agreement that brought to power the government of national accord all of this is illegal because it was not envisaged in the skhirat agreement moreover he said the central bank does not recognise the manual clearing procedure adopted in the east bank managers say that according to libyan banking law they cannot refuse to process the manually issued checks from the central bank s eastern branch or from commercial banks ali al hibri the eastern branch s governor agrees all commercial banks including libya s largest bank jumhuriya bank headquartered in western libya have had to keep manual accounts with the central bank s eastern branch however two banks in particular the state owned national commercial wahda banks and a third smaller private bank the commerce and development bank have processed the bulk of the east based government s payments by virtue of being headquartered in the east and having the greatest number of branches and clients in that region this explains why these banks in particular are affected by the dual payment clearing system they must operate with the central bank and its eastern branch using rtgs in tripoli and manual in the east the processing of the east based government s payments and other commercial transactions has resulted over time in an accumulation of growing financial obligations by the central bank s eastern branch to these commercial banks the key consequence of this is that these commercial banks have amassed reserves and deposits with the central bank s eastern branch while simultaneously carrying out other transactions through the central bank in tripoli where their reserves and deposits dwindled over time as a result of this dual payment clearing system commercial banks maintained their primary deposit reserves with the central bank in tripoli and carried out many transactions with it while also doing business with the central bank s eastern branch and accumulating other reserves credit with the latter these two sets of commercial bank credits and deposits appear to be very similar with one critical difference the government in tripoli and by extension international institutions recognise the central bank s reserves but not the eastern branch s this means that they also do not recognise the credits commercial banks have accumulated in the east in practice the tripoli government has no oversight of the eastern branch s reserves and those funds reflect the eastern government asserting its authority to sell treasury bills and print currency without tripoli s permission over time commercial banks accumulated 21 billion dinars 15 billion worth of credit with the eastern branch 65 per cent of it belonging to the three aforementioned banks table 1 shows the latter s accounts in detail as these stood in august 2018 table 1 commercial bank deposits with central bank in tripoli and its eastern branch in million lyd as of 31 august 2018 and required legal deposits with cbl tripoli in million lyd as of 31 december 2018 source central bank of libya benghazi branch march 2019 unpublished the unusual dual clearing system reflects the complex side effects of libya s political crisis but from a financial point of view it was not an immediate problem as long as the commercial banks were able to maintain the legally required minimum deposits 20 per cent of each bank s total deposits with the central bank which they did table 1 required deposits table in fact even as these banks accumulated reserves with the central bank s eastern branch their deposits with the central bank itself remained relatively stable between 2015 and 2018 staying above the 20 per cent threshold this suggests that the dual clearing system could have continued without affecting the commercial banks overall operations iii toward climax the september 2018 financial measures the discrepancy in the commercial banks accounts with the two branches of the central bank worsened when the tripoli government adopted an economic reform package it referred to as financial measures in september 2018 in an effort to liberalise access to letters of credit which the central bank had capped since 2014 reduce black market transactions and improve liquidity in the banks the main component of these measures was the imposition of a hefty 183 per cent service fee on top of the official exchange rate for all foreign currency purchases involving commercial and personal transactions while the official exchange rate remained at 1 39 dinar to the dollar the imposition of the fee in effect created a second official exchange rate of 3 90 dinars to the dollar this measure came into effect in october 2018 when the central bank started authorising letters of credit requests the east based authorities initially applauded the financial measures adopted by tripoli because they had long called for a more open system to award letters of credit and for devaluing the dinar to reduce the black market exchange rate which had reached seven dinars to the dollar prior to these reforms most libyans and small traders could only access foreign currency through the black market for the east based government it was the sole means to access foreign currency since the central bank s eastern branch did not hold any when eastern banks started sounding the alarm bells in early 2019 the tripoli authorities did not pursue any preventive measure and refused even to acknowledge the problem publicly however these measures but especially the new fee accelerated the problems derived from the dual settlement system and triggered an unanticipated backlash they put an immediate strain on commercial banks accounts with the central bank the country s only repository of foreign currency even an east based bank has to draw on its reserves with the central bank to acquire foreign currency commercial banks were affected to different degrees but the national commercial bank and the wahda bank were hit hardest because of the volume of their transactions in hibri s words had kept the previous exchange rate for the purchase of foreign currency the problem would have taken three years to surface but with the financial measures introduced in october the depletion of commercial banks reserves in tripoli accelerated the extra cost for letters of credit purchased between october and december 2018 caused a sudden reduction in these banks deposits up to 50 per cent for some banks according to the central bank s benghazi branch placing them below or very close to the required minimum normally when commercial banks reserves go below the required minimum the central bank can decide in the first instance to restrict their transactions for example limiting foreign currency trading or reducing to a minimum the amount of funds that can be transferred if funds are depleted completely it could suspend all of the banks operations should the central bank decide to help prevent a commercial bank from going bust however it could lend it funds to increase its reserves similar to a bail out or reduce the required minimum deposits when eastern banks started sounding the alarm bells in early 2019 the tripoli authorities did not pursue any preventive measure and refused even to acknowledge the problem publicly instead it allowed the commercial banks reserves to drop further the drain on reserves continued after january 2019 when the banks processed other authorised foreign currency transactions whether letters of credit or family allowances and money allocated for personal use exact figures for these transactions total costs are not available but are likely considerable the wahda bank alone stated that it has received 500 million almost 700 million dinars worth of requests from its clients for family allowances because of these and other transactions the bank s deposits with the central bank have declined further compared to the estimated figures at the end of 2018 as of mid march 2019 they stood between one to two billion dinars while its reserves with the central bank s eastern branch increased to between five and six billion dinars in the same period the national commercial bank s reserves with the central bank also dipped but by how much is contested according to the central bank s benghazi branch they stood between two to three billion dinars in march 2019 while its reserves with the benghazi branch remained high approximately nine billion dinars for their part national commercial bank managers in tripoli claim that its reserves with the central bank were just over four billion dinars despite the discrepancy these figures suggest that the two banks are coming dangerously close to the legally required minimum which could prompt the central bank to take action against them likely in the form of limitations on foreign currency transactions or restrictions on wire transfers central bank and government officials in tripoli either minimise the problem with the commercial banks and their reserves or deny that there is one yet central bank published data reflect the fact that there has been a sudden dive in the total volume of commercial banks reserves in tripoli since the implementation of the financial measures in 2018 in the three months between october and december 2018 commercial banks total actual deposits with the central bank dropped by over 10 per cent from 101 billion dinars in september to 93 billion dinars at year end as seen in table 2 table 2 total commercial bank deposits in millions lyd source central bank of libya economic bulletin 4th quarter 2018 classification of commercial banks deposits table 8 the drop in dinar deposits is linked to an increase in the purchase of foreign currency and the transfer of funds abroad for every u s dollar a commercial bank purchases from the central bank the latter debits the bank s accounts the equivalent in libyan dinars based on the exchange rate set by the central bank this is not limited to banks in the east banks in western libya are also purchasing high volumes of foreign currency to cover imports of consumer goods and relocate capital abroad but the eastern banks are affected more because a higher proportion of their reserve deposits is held in the central bank s benghazi branch which tripoli does not recognise data for the first three months of 2019 are not yet publicly available but when and if released they are likely to show a further drop in overall reserve deposits with the central bank with the start of ramadan in early may the demand for letters of credit increased because people shop more during the festivities putting a further strain on commercial banks accounts with the central bank in mid march 2019 marai al barasi chairman of the wahda bank began to ring the alarm bells we will face a real problem very soon the demand for foreign currency is high and our reserves with the central bank are low in about one month the problem will become more apparent and we will reach a point where we will not be able to cover any further requests the depletion of our deposits in tripoli might even affect salary payments and what happens then i really don t know iv staving off an all out banking crisis sharply restricting the two commercial banks foreign currency transactions could have grave repercussions how the crisis will unfold is unclear in part because no specialist has seriously looked into the problems affecting these banks much less tried to tackle them yet a consensus is emerging among the few who follow the looming banking crisis that it could worsen libya s already severe liquidity problems again raise the black market foreign exchange rate and in turn spur inflation service delivery is likely to be affected as well because many state owned companies such as the electricity company or the east based agoco oil company and private companies that have accounts with these banks might be unable to process imports including of spare parts or fulfil payments of service contracts for the maintenance of their infrastructure such a development would affect the entire banking sector especially if there is a rush on banks across the country an open question is whether this will also affect salary payments for government employees speaking in mid march just weeks before haftar led forces launched their offensive on tripoli hibri painted an apocalyptic picture of what might happen a state of panic is possible there could even be a second revolution here he said referring to a possible uprising against tripoli he also warned that if no solution is found for these banks the lna is likely to react suggesting that this could lead to another showdown at libya s oil terminals and oil fields or even accelerate an lna advance toward tripoli an official working with the central bank s governor in tripoli acknowledged that citizens might panic if the commercial banks operations were restricted a cut in the east s funding streams would most likely force eastern authorities to seek external funding to bankroll the public sector if the banks fail the political and military implications would be equally grave as this would dramatically reduce the eastern government s funding stream and by extension the lna s this could add to the confrontational narrative against the authorities in tripoli with haftar supporters accusing it not only of funding islamist armed groups but of intentionally bankrupting the east based government the lna and private companies actions they say would retroactively justify the assault on the capital in the short term a cut in the east s funding streams would most likely force eastern authorities to seek external funding to bankroll the public sector the most probable financiers would be saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae riyadh appears to have already lent some financial support to the lna to kick start the offensive on tripoli but not for lna or eastern government personnel salaries or operational costs which the east based government continues to pay but if the commercial banks that have helped bankroll the eastern government were to face restrictions as expected the eastern authorities might call on their external backers to cover all public sector expenditures alternatively they could opt to print more cash to increase the money supply though this would accelerate inflationary pressures but these are short term solutions that would do little to address the banking crisis nor reconcile the dual payment clearance system local commercial banks would still be prevented from processing international payment orders as long as their reserves with the central bank remained under the legal threshold the lna s siege on tripoli has also hardened positions in the capital where officials increasingly are talking about taking all possible measures to curb the lna s financial resources including by removing lna military officers from the tripoli payroll and even stopping paying the salaries of civil sector employees in the east speaking in late april the interior minister in tripoli said we have the database of all public sector employees and we can suspend salary payments to all those based in the east and we should let them understand the consequence of their actions the immediate impact of such punitive measures would be to increase the east based government s disbursement requirements well beyond the current level of its expenditures approximately 6 billion a year in the long term if the deep military and political rift continues without a major shift on the ground the east based government may place its bets on seeking access to libya s oil revenues and connecting the east based banks including the central bank s benghazi branch to the international banking system whether it can do so is questionable as both oil trading and access to swift the international wire transfer system used across the world are highly dependent on u s approval over the years washington has repeatedly reaffirmed the principle that libya s financial institutions should remain undivided and that its government should be reunified u s officials never legitimised the eastern government or the central bank s benghazi branch the u s treasury only has maintained contact with the tripoli based central bank governor in many respects the u s s firm stance on this matter has ensured that libya s oil revenues would solely accrue to the central bank in tripoli and thus to the un backed government over the past years but with u s president donald trump signalling his support for haftar in mid april thus aligning the u s s position with that saudi arabia the uae and egypt a change of policy vis à vis libya s finances and oil sector has become conceivable before the lna s offensive two controversial approaches were floated to resolve the banking crisis the first strongly backed by the east based government would be to persuade the central bank to recognise the credit commercial banks have accrued with its eastern branch this means that the central bank would absorb all or part of the east based government s debts approximately 35 billion dinars and possibly also reconnect the central bank s eastern branch to the automated payment settlement system such a proposal would face fierce resistance in tripoli the central bank s governor siddiq elkebir is on record as stating no way no amount of screaming will get it done referring to both recognising the east based government s debt and reconnecting the benghazi branch to the central bank s clearing system elkebir is refusing to do so because he neither trusts the sources of funds in the east nor the accuracy with which they are being reported given the central bank s lack of oversight over the manual accounting system the launch of the assault on tripoli can only have hardened his position yet without immediate steps to rectify the situation the commercial banks are bound to fail another alternative extreme and only vaguely mooted approach would be to have the banks face the consequences of their actions let them fail this remains a conjecture for now but could quickly turn into de facto policy if the central bank continues not to take action and the lna military offensive continues openly supported by the central bank s benghazi branch but all the parties concerned are aware that this could trigger serious social unrest and precipitate a profound economic crisis with political and even military repercussions for almost everyone including in western libya prior to the offensive the east based government proposed a third middle ground solution it consists of changing how to account for foreign currency transactions rather than debiting the commercial banks reserves with the central bank for these transactions entire cost at the 3 90 dinars to the dollar exchange rate they propose splitting this into two separate portions one equivalent to the official 1 4 dinar to the dollar rate to be debited to the commercial banks reserves with the central bank and the other with the fee added to be debited to the credit these banks have accrued with the central bank s eastern branch they argue that when the tripoli authorities imposed the additional fee they intended to use revenues accrued from it to cover the 63 billion dinar government debt with the central bank now they say the government of national accord should use these funds to cover the eastern debt as well in order to slow the rate at which the commercial banks reserves with the central bank are depleting while also drawing down on the reserves these banks have accrued with the central bank s eastern branch so far the authorities in tripoli have ignored such proposals to the contrary on 20 march 2019 before the offensive the tripoli government decided to use fifteen billion dinars 11 billion generated from foreign currency fees to cover one third of its 2019 budget the same day it also ordered that another five billion dinars 3 5 billion generated from foreign currency fees be used to pay back a portion of its accumulated debt with the central bank and yet another five billion dinars 3 5 billion to finance future development projects that the tripoli based presidency council will oversee there has been no mention of allocations for eastern debt repayment since the start of the military offensive in early april the central bank has allocated a gargantuan two billion dinars 1 4 billion to support the war effort of tripoli government allied forces although informed of the risks and implications of the problems affecting the commercial banks even prior to haftar s march on tripoli neither the central bank governor nor his advisers have offered a concrete proposal on how to prevent a full fledged banking crisis international actors who track libya s economic woes have remained either largely oblivious to this specific problem or were unable to persuade the central bank and finance ministry in tripoli to address it yet without immediate steps to rectify the situation the commercial banks are bound to fail and the dispute over the allocation of oil revenues will come back with a vengeance prolonging the war with a decisive victory by either side unlikely outside actors especially the warring sides respective foreign backers should persuade the two rival governments to accept a ceasefire in place and kick start negotiations to settle their financial dispute as an immediate priority currently there is strong opposition to this inside libya both sides view the fighting around tripoli as an existential fight and have refused to even consider a cessation of hostilities or external mediation the lna is adamant it wants to seize the capital and place the state s financial institutions under its control likewise tripoli aligned forces say they are determined to push the lna back to eastern libya and undermine the east s financial standing these positions point to a possible protracted expensive stalemate that could precipitate further external involvement and continued violence on multiple fronts across the country the two sides are taking a serious risk letting the crisis the lna s military offensive and the central bank s punitive measures unfold in the current circumstances could redound negatively to both of them it could devastate urban areas and severely harm the economy increase liquidity problems send prices skyrocketing and give a boost to black market trading the prime beneficiaries would be military actors and black market traders while hardest hit will be ordinary libyans across the country in the long term it could give way to a much broader financial and resource war without a nudge from washington authorities in tripoli are unlikely voluntarily negotiate a financial compromise foreign capitals and the un should press the parties toward a ceasefire to this end haftar s backers in the gulf should make it clear they do not intend to bankroll the east based government if its accounts run dry as appears possible let alone give further financial support to the offensive this could provide the necessary incentive for the lna to halt its assault on tripoli and agree to negotiate similarly european capitals and regional backers of the tripoli coalition need to pressure serraj to agree to a ceasefire at the same time the u s should exercise its leverage over the central bank in tripoli with which it has a preferential relation to persuade it to resolve the banking problems affecting eastern libya without a nudge from washington authorities in tripoli are unlikely voluntarily negotiate a financial compromise this would require washington to return to a more even handed approach to the libyan conflict rather than signalling military support for haftar and ambivalent political recognition of serraj the trump administration with technical advice from the u s treasury should use its political capital and financial leverage to press the two sides toward a settlement of the banking crisis the un and international financial institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf should also offer expert advice clearly such a financial negotiation cannot happen in isolation it will have to go hand in hand with political and military talks aimed at bridging the rifts across the country but the offer of a financial track would increase the chances of persuading the parties to accept a ceasefire moreover any future negotiations risk being pro forma if there is no attempt to also redress the financial imbalances that are a key driver of both the political and military conflict in libya to this end several steps should be taken the rival governors of the central bank and its benghazi branch should reaffirm their commitment to an external audit of the bank as they had promised to the un special envoy in august 2018 the un should urgently work to overcome technical delays that have held up this process in the meantime the un should convene a technical meeting of the rival governors officials from the parallel finance ministries and libyan financial experts the goal would be for them to sketch out technical solutions to both the banking crisis and the host of problems that have accumulated since the 2014 split of the central bank including how to standardise commercial banking operations in the east this meeting should take place in the presence of specialists from the world bank the imf and the u s treasury and possibly also of other european or regional financial institutions with relevant expertise the un should consider seeking the technical guidance of a senior and respected former central bank governor to help lead this process those negotiating a solution to the libyan crisis also should establish a new procedure to select a consensual central bank governor to overcome the deadlock in the process envisioned in the libyan political agreement this point should be covered by any future political talks v conclusion finding a solution to libya s looming banking crisis is necessary and urgent today s predicament is the product of the 2014 political crisis and the increasingly polarised relations between west and east that flowed from it which have soured and deepened since then it is also the direct consequence of policy decisions that further entrenched political military and financial divides the central bank s 2014 decision to cut off its benghazi branch from the automated payment settlement system was aimed at preventing authorities in eastern libya from tapping into the country s financial assets tripoli achieved its objective but in doing so it triggered a profound split inside the central bank and unleashed a powerful sense of disenfranchisement in the east it also prompted tripoli s rivals to find other means through which to bankroll themselves and to expand their claims of sovereignty this polarised the political scene further deepened the military rift between east and west exacerbated libya s economic crisis and contributed to the current war in the capital similarly attempts to address liquidity problems and the black market s distortionary effects prompted the 2018 financial measures especially the imposition of a hefty fee on foreign exchange transactions this financially sensible move had unintended and unanticipated consequences the rapid depletion of reserve deposits that banks headquartered in eastern libya hold with the central bank in tripoli the primary victims of the banking crisis would be account holders but also the broader economy remedial steps are both possible and necessary but this would require that the warring parties with the active support of international partners agree to a ceasefire this in turn would make negotiations on a financial settlement possible yet a ceasefire is less likely if alongside necessary political and military talks foreign stakeholders in the libyan crisis fail to propose and pledge support for a solution to the financial crisis failing to address the banking crisis would not only likely prolong the war it also would have severe repercussions for libya as a whole the primary victims of the banking crisis would be account holders meaning ordinary citizens but also the broader economy which had started to emerge slowly from a six year downturn only earlier this year moreover the warring parties foreign supporters might find that they would be asked to bankroll their proxies especially in the east allowing the fight to drag on without a decisive winner this of course would have disastrous implications for libya s ability to finally extricate itself

all international monetary fund imf programmes come with very high social costs of elevated poverty and unemployment the moral of the fund s structural reforms implemented around the world is the same you need political capital to see the imf programme through it is hard to find imf s success stories if the benchmark for success is to step out of the spiral of debt bailout debt then one such example is of india india approached the imf seven times during the 1980s and 90s however after the last package in 1993 it stepped out of the cycle and averaged a gdp growth rate of 6 61 per cent the imf projects its growth rate will be 7 5pc in 2020 what does india have that pakistan does not india is a success story because it has political continuity said veteran economist dr hafeez pasha in

pakistan s political elite without the imf s conditionality says s akbar zaidi the imf styles itself a saviour of sorts mandated to protect countries in severe financial troubles unable to pay international bills its role is of crisis resolution with a key objective of reforms that provide crisis prevention in the future but the question remains have countries in need of the fund s support benefitted from it currently the fund has 36 lending arrangements of which the largest borrowers are argentina 57 billion ukraine 17bn and egypt 12bn at 6bn pakistan s bailout is considerably smaller

washington consensus the imf s funding did not always come with numerous strings attached since the 1990s after the latin american crisis the imf implemented the washington consensus that demands

president donald trump s use of the most vicious aspects of economic warfare prompt another examination of the politics of starvation after george w bush s administration presidents barack obama and donald trump lessened bush s aggressive war policies and leaned to economic warfare sounds harmless when compared to exploding bombs but it is not economic warfare can crush an adversary without firing a shot gone to its extreme economic warfare has the force of a neutron bomb it disables the nation s infrastructure and debilitates its population isolation from the international financial system material embargos and other sanctions reduce living standards and bring populations close to starvation the most serious aspects of economic warfare are major crimes and a form of terrorism iran cuba north korea and iraq endured the most punishing sanctions from the united states results of sanctions against these countries models for the effects of sanctions show that sanctions have rarely accomplished their stated purposes and their intentions may be for other reasons stalling economic progress weakening challenges to antagonistic actions advancing dominance and promoting regime change iran disturbed with the rule of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and infuriated by the hostage taking of 52 of u s embassy personnel by extreme islamic students and militants president jimmy carter froze several billions of dollars in iranian bank deposits gold and other properties and followed with a 1980 embargo on trade with and travel to iran these punitive actions accomplished nothing for the united states strengthened the ayatollah s authority and hardened the student demands for releasing the captured embassy officials president reagan who partially owed his climb into the executive office to the hostage crisis showed contempt for iran s resolution of the problem driven by the unproven assertion that iran was involved in the 1983 bombing of a marine barracks in beirut and favoring saddam hussein s iraq in the iraq iran war the u s president imposed additional sanctions on the islamic republic and in 1987 banned all imports from iran duriing the clinton administration the iran libya sanctions act ilsa penalized all foreign companies that provided investments over 20 million for the development of petroleum resources iran s entrance into the atomic age provoked a series of new sanctions economic warfare soon reached full scale by subduing iran s earnings from its most precious resource and export oil the u s congress passed unilateral sanctions that targeted iran s energy and banking sectors sanctions did not halt iran s nuclear activities or prevent it from signing contracts with foreign firms to develop its energy resources exports slowly grew to an estimated 82 billion in 2012 with liberated iraq and independent china filling the gap as trading partners nevertheless economic warfare affected iran s industries and welfare in october 2012 iran s currency the rial fell to a record low against the us dollar losing about 80 per cent of its value in one year lack of spare parts and inability to replace planes affected aviation safety real growth rate in gdp at a steady six per cent a year during the first decade of the twenty first century fell to two per cent in 2011 2012 one report citing officials from the u s departments of state and energy concluded that gasoline imports in the shah s former kingdom declined from 130 000 barrels a day in 2009 to 50 000 barrels a day in 2011 machinery wears and the costs and time for repairs rapidly increased a nation of educated professionals who depended upon access to foreign technology and scientific cooperation had their access to knowledge severely curtailed in a october 5 2012 report to the un general assembly un secretary general ban ki moon summarized effects of sanctions on iran s population the sanctions imposed on the islamic republic of iran have had significant effects on the general population including an escalation in inflation a rise in commodities and energy costs an increase in the rate of unemployment and a shortage of necessary items including medicine the embargoes have also hampered humanitarian operations as the imposed restrictions on iran s banking system have halted the imports of medicines needed for treating diseases like cancer and heart and respiratory conditions the obama administration eventually eased restrictions on the sale of medicines to iran and after the joint comprehensive plan of action in which iran halted and downsized its uranium enrichment the un lifted sanctions in a following year iran gdp increased 15 percent on may 8 2018 u s president donald trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the iran nuclear deal and u s sanctions came into effect again in november 2018 president trump articulated his plan for renewed sanctions as to bring iran s oil exports to zero and remove a main source of revenue for the regime trump imposed the ultimate harm afforded by economic warfare starve the people and have them revolt against the regime that has not happened nor is predicted to occur world bank statistics from indicate a severe slowing of the economy and steady rise of inflation as shown in the charts oil production and gdp growth dropped monotonicallyandseverely currency value suffered an initial shock and had some recovery inflation was up 40 especially in food up 60 a suffering economy a suffering people and no political gain for the u s cuba immediately after the 1960 cuban revolution the united states imposed an embargo against cuba fifty plus years of sanctions have not succeeded in accomplishing the purposes for which the united states proposed the sanctions compensation to u s firms nationalized by cuba and the overthrow of the castro regime the only result of the embargo has been deprivation of the cuban people although the united nations general assembly on november 2 1995 voted 117 to 3 to recommend an end to the u s embargo against cuba president clinton on march 12 1996 signed into law the misnamed cuban liberty and democratic solidarity act this act imposed penalties on foreign companies doing business in cuba permitted u s citizens to sue foreign investors who make use of american owned property seized by the cuban government and denied foreign investors in cuba s industry to enter the u s the world health organization who complimented pre 90 s cuba for its public health system which had been credited with eliminating hunger and malnutrition and wiping out infectious diseases a tightened embargo reinforced cuba s suffering after russia withdrew subsidies and soon cuba of the mid 90 s portrayed another image the american association for world health and the american public health association ascertained that the embargo caused significant deterioration in cuba s food production and health care cuba was banned from purchasing nearly 1 2 of new drugs on the market physicians had access to only 890 medications down from 1 300 in 1989 deterioration of water supply increased water borne diseases daily caloric intake dropped by 33 between 1989 and 1993 in 2000 the clinton administration finally allowed cuba to have some relief from an aggressive economic warfare the administration allowed the sale of agriculture and medicine to cuba for humanitarian purposes according to the usda s foreign agricultural service u s agricultural exports to cuba reached 380 million in 2004 however after hitting a peak of 710 million in 2008 u s food sales to cuba declined over 50 percent by the year 2011 reasons for the decline were largely economic lack of foreign currency and better financial terms being offered by other countries dollars and sense 2009 the costs of the embargo by margot pepper representatives of a dozen leading u s business organizations including the u s chamber of commerce signed a letter in december urging barack obama to scrap the embargo the letter pegs the cost to the u s economy at 1 2 billion per year the cpf s estimates are much higher up to 4 84 billion annually in lost sales and exports the cuban government estimates the loss to cuba at about 685 million annually thus the blockade costs the united states up to 4 155 billion more a year than it costs cuba after a period of harsh policy toward cuba under president george w bush president obama announced in late 2014 that washington and havana would begin normalizing relations to that end the obama administration achieved three pillars of normalization 1 the removal of cuba s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism which allowed cuba to access international finance 2 the reestablishment of diplomatic relations and 3 relaxed restrictions on travel and trade through executive action the embargo remained in place in 2017 the trump administration reversed some of the changes made under president obama but the vast majority remained u s policy despite some tighter trade sanctions and limitations on authorized travel there are still legal pathways for americans to export and travel to cuba on the list of new sanctions is allowing americans to sue foreign companies in cuba that are profiting from or using properties that were seized during the cuban revolution from cbs news may 11 2019 havana the cuban government announced friday it is launching widespread rationing of chicken eggs rice beans soap and other basic products in the face of a grave economic crisis commerce minister betsy díaz velazquez told the state run cuban news agency that various forms of rationing would be employed in order to deal with shortages of staple foods díaz blamed the hardening of the u s trade embargo by the trump administration economists give equal or greater blame to a plunge in aid from venezuela where the collapse of the state run oil company has led to a nearly two thirds cut in shipments of subsidized fuel that cuba used for power and to earn hard currency on the open market another suffering economy suffering people and no political gain for the u s north korea the proud and impoverished nation of north korea has been continually subjected to sanctions threats of economic sanctions and hastily withdrawn sanctions the media is peppered with the words u s lifts sanctions u s recommends sanctions south korea wary of sanctions it s difficult to know if north korea is being sanctioned or being forced into being sanctioned after its 2006 claim of conducting a nuclear test the dprk democratic people s republic korea leaders responded to intended sanctions by labeling them as a declaration of war the dprk has suffered from economic warfare which includes restrictions on trade and financial transactions export of sensitive dual use items items that have both military and non military uses have at times been prohibited during march 2012 the politics of starvation entered the situation angered by an intended north korea missile test the u s suspended food aid to the hermit kingdom washington reuters the united states has suspended planned food aid to north korea as pyongyang vows to push ahead with a plan to launch a long range missile in defiance of international warnings u s military officials said on wednesday under president obama sanctions increased as a policy of strategic patience the us waited for north korea to change its bad behavior before engaging with the state as a result trade between north korea and china increased and sanctions did not encourage kim jong an to discuss de nuclearization on september 21 2017 president donald trump as part of his administration s maximum pressure campaign allowed severing from its financial system and or freezing assets of companies businesses organizations and individuals who traded in goods services or technology with north korea u s negotiations with north korea have a built in error they request de nuclearization in exchange for improved relations and reduction in sanctions not considered is that north korea s development of a nuclear arsenal was a response to its regard of u s actions in the korean peninsula as a direct threat to its regime and the developments had no relation to sanctions therefore the dprk will not trade de nuclearization for relief of sanctions and that approach is a non starter sanctions intended to collapse the north korea regime have not halted its development of nuclear weapons and guided missile delivery systems they have collapsed the economy and harmed the north korean people starvation during droughts have occurred although some international assistance has been provided to north korea the intensive economic warfare waged against the hermit kingdom has exacerbated its problems without any apparent benefit to its principal antagonist the united states iraq if iraq were pompeii then the us would be mt vesuvius the sanctions against iraq began august 6 1990 four days after hussein invaded kuwait and featured a near total financial and trade embargo resultant suffering has been outlined in a un report on the current humanitarian situation in iraq submitted to the security council march 1999 due to the length of the report only significant features are mentioned before the gulf war before 1991 iraq s social and economic indicators were generally above the regional and developing country averages up to 1990 the food and agricultural organization fao cited iraq as having one of the highest per capita food availability indicators in the region according to the world health organization who prior to 1991 health care reached approximately 97 of the urban population and 78 of rural residents a major reduction of young child mortality took place from 1960 to 1990 with the infant mortality rate at 65 per 1 000 live births in 1989 1991 human development report average for developing countries was 76 per 1 000 live births unicef indicates that a national welfare system assisted orphans and children with disabilities and supported the poorest families before 1991 southern and central iraq had well developed water and sanitation systems composed with two hundred water treatment plants wtp s for urban areas and 1200 compact wtp s to serve rural areas as well as an extensive distribution network who estimates that 90 of the population had access to an abundant quantity of safe drinking water from sanctions after the gulf war economist intelligence unit estimates that iraqi gdp may have fallen by nearly 67 in 1991 and the nation had experienced a shift from relative affluence to massive poverty and had infant mortality rates that were among the highest in the world the united nations population fund unfpa estimated the maternal mortality rate increased from 50 100 000 live births in 1989 to 117 100 000 in 1997 the under five child mortality rate increased from 30 2 1000 live births to 97 2 1000 during the same period the united nations department of economic and social affairs desa calculates that the infant mortality rate rose from 64 1000 births in 1990 to 129 1000 in 1995 the human development report set the average infant mortality rate for least developed countries at 109 1000 low birth weight babies less than 2 5 kg rose from 4 in 1990 to around a quarter of registered births in 1997 due mainly to maternal malnutrition calorie intake fell from a pre war 3120 to 1093 calories per capita per day in 1994 95 the prevalence of malnutrition in iraqi children under five almost doubled from 1991 to 1996 from 12 to 23 acute malnutrition in center south rose from 3 to 11 for the same age bracket the world food program wfp estimated that access to potable water decreased to 50 of the 1990 level in urban areas and 33 in rural areas school enrollment for all ages 6 23 declined to 53 according to a field survey conducted in 1993 as quoted by unesco in central and southern governorates 83 of school buildings needed rehabilitation with 8613 out of 10 334 schools having suffered serious damages the same source indicated that some schools with a planned capacity of 700 pupils actually have 4500 enrolled in them substantive progress in reducing adult and female illiteracy ceased and regressed to mid 1980 levels more families are forced to rely on children to secure household incomes figures provided by unesco indicate that drop outs in elementary schools increased from 95 692 in 1990 to 131 658 in 1999 sanctions and its toll on the iraqi people continued until the u s invasion of iraq in 2003 excerpts from invisible war the united states and the iraq sanctions joy gordon harvard university press 2010 describe the extent of irrational economic warfare conducted by the united states against a defenseless iraq while the united states consistently justified its policies in terms of preventing iraq from developing weapons or threatening its neighbors the u s policy went well beyond any rational concern with security there was an elaborate architecture of policies that found a dozen other ways to simply do gratuitous harm that had not the least relation to the threat iraq might have posed to its neighbors or to anyone else for thirteen years the united states unilaterally prevented iraq from importing nearly everything related to electricity telecommunications and transportation blocked much of what was needed for agriculture and housing construction and even prohibited some equipment and materials necessary for health care and food preparation as the criticism grew there is no sign that anyone in the u s administration and only a tiny handful within congress actually took it to heart actually questioned the sanity and legality of reducing an entire civilization to a preindustrial state of bankrupting an entire nation for the purpose of containing one tyrannical man on may 12 1996 madeleine albright then u s ambassador to the united nations appeared on the cbs program 60 minutes commentator lesley stahl asked we have heard that half a million children have died i mean that s more children than died in hiroshima is the price worth it madeleine albright replied we think the price is worth it is that an expected response from a normal human being the u s 2003 invasion of iraq accomplished what sanctions failed to accomplish push iraq to total ruin a question why war if had sanctions or why sanctions if need to go to war conclusion as shown sanctions never accomplished their stated purposes and gravely harmed populations the economic warfare had equivalents to military war the country that took the offensive became the aggressor as in any war and the destruction to the defending state was equally brutal in the one sided engagement the civilian population of the defending nation suffered greatly and the aggressor country suffered few losses the economic wars never achieved the results that the offended party desired and no peace treaties were signed the struggles remained an open issue a limited form of economic warfare may at times have a legitimate purpose a complete economic war that invades all aspects of a country s life and continues until it debilitates the population cannot be accepted in a military campaign atrocities and human rights violations are often committed although no shots are fired and battlefields are not identifiable economic warfare cannot camouflage its atrocities and disguise its human rights violations dan lieberman is the editor of alternative insight a web based newsletter

a man walks past the pboc headquarters in beijing china reuters china s central bank cb will use foreign exchange intervention and monetary policy tools to stop the yuan weakening past the key 7 per dollar level in the near term three people familiar with the central bank s thinking said at present rest assured they will certainly not let it break 7 a source told reuters a defence of the 7 level could help boost confidence in the currency and soothe investor fears about a sharp depreciation in the yuan or renminbi even as souring trade relations with washington make competitive devaluation a compelling option for beijing breaking 7 is beneficial to china because it can reduce some of the effects of tariff increases but the impact on our renminbi confidence is negative and funds will flow out the source said the yuan fell to its weakest level since december on friday and to within striking distance of the 7 mark last seen during the 2008 financial crisis it has weakened 3 per cent in the past month on fading hopes of a deal being struck in the long running trade war between beijing and washington the latest flare up in those tensions saw us president donald trump increase tariffs on chinese imports provoking a similar tariff rise from china although a weaker yuan would support chinese exporters the decline would need to be significant to offset the impact of higher us tariffs such a fall could in turn fuel capital flight and undermine china s economic stability policy insiders said the source told reuters that china s issue of central bank bills in hong kong this week was a clear indication the people s bank of china s wanted to soak up offshore yuan to discourage investors from short selling it the pboc did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment on friday a second source familiar with the pboc s thinking said the monetary authority might tolerate the yuan weakening to 7 on fundamental factors but would act to prevent speculative short selling of the currency a stable currency is imperative for china as it seeks to balance its investment driven economy attract more portfolio inflows and push for global equity and bond index inclusions the tightly managed currency fell heavily in 2018 and before that in 2015 when the pboc devalued the currency the stakes are much higher now said bryan carter head of emerging market fixed income at bnp paribas asset management in london a rapid devaluation would shake confidence in the local market and among domestic investors proving counterproductive carter said before reuters reported source comments on pboc china s balancing act goes beyond maintaining domestic confidence as the country s current account is seen swinging from a decades long surplus toward a deficit the yuan s exchange rate is expected to become more volatile a majority of more than 12 money managers traders and economists reuters spoke over the past week expected pboc to defend the renminbi while china primarily used direct dollar selling intervention in 2015 it switched to more unconventional methods such as tightening yuan funding costs and using swaps as the currency fell in 2018 the pboc re introduced a counter cyclical factor a secret component it uses in adjusting the daily reference point for the yuan s trading band in august last year market participants say it has been using that factor to temper depreciation expectations in the past week by setting a firmer benchmark for yuan than implied by the moves of global currencies i don t believe we will rely on yuan depreciation to boost exports the yuan is not only for facilitating foreign trade but it could also affect capital flows one of the sources said barring any sharp rise in the dollar the possibility for a near term dip in the yuan below 7 is relatively small going against this thinking is market positioning which points to further weakness in the offshore markets the currency s value one year out had weakened to 6 9770 per dollar on friday slipping from 6 8482 a week ago just before trump raised tariffs a sharp change in the risk reversal measures in the yuan options market which indicates the bias towards the currency also showed investors were betting the currency will weaken however even with these dynamics there are firmer expectations the pboc won t tolerate a sharp selloff liam spillane who manages 11 5 billion in emerging market debt for aviva investors told reuters he was positioning his portfolio a little bit more defensively following renewed escalation in the trade war as a result spillane has cut exposure in indonesian government bonds and south african debt while adding small long dollar positions against the turkish lira and taiwanese dollar at the same time he is overweight the renminbi reuters

analysis register here the japanese yen and swiss franc rallied against their major trading partners in early trade as anxiety from the latest escalation in the trade war saw the prospects of the trade deal fall deeper into the summer safe havens gave back most of their gains and commodity currencies recovered some of their losses after lunch the latest decision from white house to block us companies from buying foreign made telecommunications equipment from huawei will likely see strong retaliation from china google intel qualcomm xilinx broadcom and infineon all froze supplies of critical software and components to the giant chinese telco and tech stocks are down sharply today the potential response from china could be an apple ban and that would reverberate across all technology stocks us stocks closed lower with the nasdaq leading the way with a 1 46 decline fed speak standard comments from clarida bullard harker bostic and williams powell tonight brexit one last stab for may oil higher on expected continuation of opec cuts gold limited gains despite strong safe haven session bitcoin 8 000 remains key fed fed watchers heard from five members of the federal reserve but gain little insight to what would be the next move with interest rates many market participants are waiting to see the fed deliver a big shift that will have them join the bond markets in signaling a rate cut will be in the near future federal reserve vice chairman richard clarida noted that unemployment in the us may be able to decline further without triggering excessive inflation the unemployment rate in april dropped to 3 6 a 49 year low and the strength of the labor market has made it difficult for the fed to offer further accommodation the fed s bullard a dove and voter stated he would consider pushing for a rate cut if core inflation were persistently low the fed s preferred index for inflation was at 1 6 for the year ending in march just below the fed s 2 target federal reserve bank of atlanta president raphael bostic provided no new insights noting that the scales for the next move a hike or a cut are equally likely he added there are a lot of risks out there and if the economy weakens a rate cut might be appropriate federal reserve bank of philadelphia president patrick harker advocated against policy rules being followed robotically he is not a voter this year and did not have much to say on the economy or outlook on policy the fed s williams a voter spoke at an event in new york he added the fed wants to sustain this expansion the bond markets are still pricing in a rate cut as the next move and as this trade war drags on the data dependent fed will have an easy choice in cutting rates the question is not will they deliver a shift but when fed powell speaks tonight and on wednesday we will get the release of the fomc meeting minutes brexit prime minister may is revising her latest brexit deal to appease labour which would have new proposals to uphold eu standards of workers rights and environmental protection a tighter customs relationship will do little to win over members who are requiring a confirmatory referendum while may has been extremely resilient throughout the entire brexit period it appears her time is coming to an end brexit will most likely have a new face and current bookmaker s favorite is boris johnson regardless of who wins it appears brexit will go on much longer and that is why the british pound will struggle to muster up any significant gains oil crude prices rose as constructive production cut talk from opec nations and allies outweighed global growth concern fallout from the intensification of the trade war over the weekend talks from jeddah showed opec members excluding russia who did their best not give any clear signal are on board to continuing production cuts throughout the rest of year albeit if conditions warrant it geopolitical risks remain plentiful and for the time being that will provide support on any trade war selloffs we see until we see spare capacity exceed output at risk crude should be supported the opec meeting over the weekend did not yield any surprises with the most important comments coming from russia the most important non opec partner in the coalition hinting they could reduce production cuts if the market needs more crude oil the base case is for opec and its partners to announce an extension of production cuts especially if global growth concerns grow russian could decide to argue they do not want to take part with further cuts or they might just say they will cut production but just no comply gold gold prices rose slightly as the us china trade war dealt another blow to global economy the huawei story is reverberating across many markets and this could be the beginning of talks deteriorating further the next step is likely to be the china s response which could deliver a major risk off move for equities and other risk assets gold bulls are trying to stabilize their market but if gold can t recapture 1 300 in the short run especially with all the demand for safey we could see downside momentum target last year s lows

such examples of intertwined relationships between government and business figures in india are so frequent that a book by financial times journalist james crabtree the billionaire raj a journey through india s new gilded age has become a bestseller modi has been accused of favouritism toward his friend and political ally anil ambani a multi millionaire at the head of reliance a 1 7 billion dollar firm in 2015 ambani formed reliance defence limited which bypassed the mandated procedures to obtain a deal with french defence company dassault for the sale of 36 rafale fighters for 8 billion euros ambani s company won the contract over the government owned hal and the deal reportedly pushed up the price of the aircraft by more than 40 yet ambani s firm was not a defence specialist india s general elections kicked off on april 11 and run until may 19 with the ruling bharatiya janata party facing off against the main opposition force the indian national congress one of the main issues opposing the two are charges of crony capitalism against prime minister narendra modi as epitomised by the ongoing rafale scam in 2002 the latest year for which figures are available 30 of the 245 members of the upper house the rajya sabha were from business this involvement of business directly in politics is common in france 21 senators are listed as being heads of enterprises in the united states two notable if very different examples are the current president donald trump and the former mayor of new york 2001 2013 michael bloomberg as pointed out by paul a baran of stanford and paul m sweezy of harvard it is rare for politicians to be open with voters about their business dealings does business mean development most such politicians describe their approach as business friendly or connections as progress which in hindi is translated as vikas the word has been at the heart of narendra modi s campaign since 2014 yet the country faces serious economic and development issues the table below is based on selected indicators from world bank and other sources and is important for understanding the background to the statistics being bandied for example when inflation was running at above 10 during 2009 2012 it was a serious election issue but today it is not because inflation is down to 5 data indicate that in india poverty levels have fallen from 40 to 20 but with a population of 1 4 billion people the 20 figure means that 280 million of the country s population is living in poverty the combined total population of the biggest four or five european countries certainly india s gross national income per capita has quadrupled but has only tripled in purchasing power parity terms this means that the currency is devalued against the us dollar and the real progress is significantly less gdp growth rates have been as high as 10 in a few years and given that the poverty ratio is reduced part of this seems to have trickled down as can be seen from the world bank data for example almost all indian villages have now been electrified even though this may mean that only a small number of people actually have electricity also read indian markets are worried of election bolt from the blue on 23 may an unequal access to progress this unequal access to progress is disturbing as indicated by india s gini coefficient a measure of inequality a gini coefficient of 0 shows perfect equality while 1 indicates maximal inequality a recent oecd working paper shows that income inequality is higher in emerging economies including india where it is almost 0 5 than those in developed countries the gini coefficient is usually looked at in terms of income or wealth income is a flow concept of what one earns over a year while wealth is a stock concept of the assets one owns at a point in time the gini coefficient of wealth inequalities are much higher than gini coefficients of income inequalities even in the oecd for example the wealth gini of france would be 0 70 and that of the united states and most scandinavian countries would be over 0 80 however for emerging countries the data required to calculate these is not available and other proxies must be used for example credit suisse reports that wealth inequality in india is second only to russia the top 1 and the top 10 control more than 50 and 70 respectively of the country s wealth decline of the industrial world one of the reasons for such disparities is the tendency of capitalism to limit wages and increase profits this is enhanced by mergers and acquisitions that increase monopoly power this in turn leads to the rise of the happy few who concentrate and aggregate wealth stock options and companies however there is a limit to what these few people can consume as a result aggregate demand falls limiting growth and pushing into poverty greater numbers of those who need to consume but do not have the purchasing power they in term search the cheapest solution which is often to purchase chinese made goods in china growth is fuelled by global demand economies of scale and high productivity of its workers in india however the share of industry seems to be rapidly declining unable to compete with imports some observers such as dani rodrik amrit amirapu and arvind subramanian consider that it is unlikely that industrialisation will return to india and that the country still relies heavily on its software services the table above shows that the value added by agriculture and industry has reduced to 16 and 27 of gdp respectively however these sectors still employ a lot of people 43 and 24 respectively during the elections the votes of farmers and industry workers remained important and politicians have to appeal to the two sectors as much as to services whose share has grown to 33 of the occupational structure the working class in india are no longer the traditional voters of the waning communist parties which now rule only in the southern most kerala state the other major state is west bengal where the working class brought them to power two decades ago but have now changed their support to the regional party trinamool congress headed by mamata banerjee this partly explains why the farmers remain the core of support for several political parties for example the congress party has promised a farm loan waiver during the ongoing elections it has also pushed its nyuntam aay yojanan nyay scheme which would assure minimum income to all farmers also read indians are addicted to cheap coal power and it s killing them day to day development left out many in india feel that the basic infrastructure has improved the digital divide remains a major problem for those who do not have electricity to charge phones or get internet primary education has taken a great leap forward but secondary education has still a long way to go nevertheless the secondary enrolment rate has increased by over 60 in the 15 year period reported from 45 to 74 the life expectancy has increased very little 68 years in india compared to 80 in developed countries indicating that public and private investments in health have not kept up at the same time pollution has doubled since 2000 as indicated by the co 2 emissions according to a recent statement by greenpeace 22 of the world s most polluted cities are in india unemployed youth a demographic time bomb unemployment today in india is only 6 7 considerably below that of france and many developed countries but 80 of the jobs are vulnerable or within the informal sector this represents a demographic time bomb as most of those who fall victim to unemployment are men and women between 15 and 24 years as indicated in the table their unemployment rate in 2015 was 10 4 almost three times the overall figure of 3 5 the impact of youth unemployment is particularly severe as recent studies have demonstrated that it can create or increase substance abuse issues and mental problems but with india s gdp growing at 8 per year the impact on politics has been considerable many indian voters seem willing for the moment to overlook the everyday struggles they may face hoping that the trickle down effect of a business friendly government will help the overall economy arvind ashta professor finance and control burgundy school of business and amarendra sahoo economist srm

the chinese us trade war intensified on monday as huawei s suppliers stopped doing business with the telco giant the fallout could really accelerate risk off flows as china s response is expected to be to suspend business with all suppliers who agreed to halt supplying huawei european indexes are all selling off on the trade war angst and the us markets are all expected poised to open down with the nasdaq being hit the hardest safe haven flows are driving the japanese yen and swiss franc higher while gold prices struggle to breakout higher oil prices were supported by this weekend s comments from jeddah five key stories for monday huawei iran tech stock blood bath oil opec hints at keeping cuts fed speak powell clarida and broadbent may hint at dovish tilt aussie and indian elections markets like election outcomes gold and bitcoin cryptos behaving more like a safe haven huawei iran risk aversion flows were the dominant theme to start the trading week as the trade war between the two largest economies saw the ripple effect on the us restrictions that were put on huawei the white house decision on huawei is expected to see a chinese response and this could drive us stocks below last week s low according to bloomberg google intel qualcomm xilinx broadcom and infineon all froze supplies of critical software and components to the giant chinese telco the trade war is getting uglier and even if we do see some framework agreement reached by the middle of summer the damage will be done to global growth figures for the second quarter all current trade talks appear to be halted and we could see continued selling until we a de escalation with this protectionist showdown the other wildcard for risk aversion is the growing tensions between iran and the us over the weekend iran fired a rocked into the heavily fortified green zone in baghdad just 0 3 miles away from the us embassy president trump tweeted if iran wants to fight that will be the official end of iran never threaten the united states again iran s foreign minister zarif dismissed trump s taunts and we should not be surprised to see iran step down from its recent behavior if we see continued military threats by iran we could see this escalate into war something markets have not really considered to price in oil crude prices initially rose sharply after both opec indicated they want to stick to the current plan of production cuts for the rest of the year and tensions remained elevated between the us and iran the saudi led coalition discussed production levels the iran situation and how much further they could drive down inventory levels saudi s al falih stated that saudi arabia will take an additional month of observing production cuts in july to observe the situation hoping their colleagues will do the same the physical market remains tight opec compliance was last at 168 but global growth demand is being dealt a blow by global trade wars and it will be hard to imagine other countries will be content with saudi arabia taking up all the loss oil from iran the path for oil is still likely higher due to supply risks from iran venezuela and libya but we will likely see volatile moves until both the trade war is resolved and oil markets price in the risk that the opec could fall apart if russia decides to ease production cuts fed speak most analysts expect fed speakers this week to stay consistent and maintain the stance that interest rates remain on hold recent developments however with the trade war and global weakness could allow the fed to deliver a fresh dovish tilt that could allow them to catch up to the market fed fund futures are currently only showing a 9 5 chance of a rate cut at the june 19th meeting and a coin flip at the september 18th meeting markets will closely listen to vice chair clarida s 1 05pm et and fed chair powell s 7 00pm comments today the data dependent fed may need to see trade talks collapse before cutting but with the recent actions taking place with the huawei situation growth will be weaker globally and the data will be much weaker in the second quarter thus warranting a cut at the end of summer elections au in morrison and modi victories are delivering a nice boost to australian and indian stock markets the bigger surprise was from australia election analysts got another election wrong mirroring the surprise we saw with brexit and trump as pollsters were calling for morrison s right leaning coalition to lose for months australian s chose to ignore turmoil that saw morrison s coalition go through three prime ministers in six years his promise for lower energy costs help for first time homeowners and criticism of labor s initiatives and the effects on the budget appeared enough to win over voters tax relief is expected to be implemented early as next month markets are loving australian assets today and the a could have a key bottom in place if we do not see a complete catastrophic outcome from the us china trade war india s exit polls saw prime minister narendra modi s set for a decisive victory in india s general election an impressive victory during a time when unemployment is off the charts and the rural sector continues to struggle it appears modi will now be able to move forward on infrastructure investments assistance for farmers and policies that appeal to hindu nationalists the rupee is 0 7 firmer against the dollar but off its session highs gold bitcoin gold prices are slightly firmer despite an overall risk off start to the trading week disinflationary conditions persist and until the fed confirms what the markets are heavily pricing in we could see the yellow metal struggle bitcoin is up 8 5 in early volatile trade displaying better safe haven appeal than gold prices the bubbly asset has had an amazing rally in recent weeks but many are calling the recent moves similar to what we saw in 2017 before things collapsed momentum could see

from doctor s salaries to prescription drugs photo mario villafuerte getty images think about how much your income would go up if you didn t have to pay for healthcare at all that would begin to close the gap between productivity and wages for the first time in a generation by les leopold executive director the labor institute pundits and politicians repeatedly warn us that the country cannot afford costly social services they caution about the perils of a rising national debt the supposed near bankruptcy of medicare and social security and the need to sell public services to the highest bidder in order to save them we must tighten our belts sooner or later they tell us rather than spend on social goods like universal health care free higher education and badly needed infrastructure to many americans this sounds all too true because they are having an incredibly tough time making ends meet according to the federal reserve four in 10 adults in 2017 would either borrow sell

the wealth of nations as we can see clearly the productivity trend has been ever upward today the average worker is nearly three times as productive per hour of labor as he or she was at the end of wwii and the workforce is more than three times as large that means we are a colossal economic powerhouse but unless you are an economic elite it doesn t feel that way to understand why we need to look at the blue line average real worker wages from wwii to the late 1970s or so as productivity rose so did the average real wage of nearly all american workers year by year most working people saw their standard of living rise for every one percent increase in productivity about two thirds went to labor and the remaining one third went to capital investment and profits after the late 1970s however the story changes dramatically real wages stall for more than 40 years while productivity continues to climb had wages and productivity continued to rise in tandem the average weekly earnings of the american worker would be almost double what it is today rising from today s average of 746 per week to 1 377 per week what happened where did all the money go that once went to working people the fatalistic story sold to us by elite funded think tanks is that the rise of international competition and the introduction of advanced technology crushed the wages of those without the highest skill levels the typical worker it is claimed is now competing with cheap labor from around the world and hence sees his or her wages stall and even decline and since there really isn t much anyone can do about globalization or automation there s nothing we can do about the stalling wages such a convenient story to justify runaway inequality the real story is far more complex and troubling yes globalization and automation contribute to stagnant wages but as the international labor organization shows in their remarkable 2012 study only about 30 percent of this wage stagnation can be attributed to technology and globalization the main cause is the neo liberal policy agenda of deregulation of finance cuts in social spending and attacks on labor unions and within that mix the biggest driver of wage stagnation can be attributed to financialization the deregulation of wall street which permitted for the first time since the great depression the rapacious financial strip mining of workers students families and communities put simply the neo liberal model ushered in by thatcher and reagan and then intensified by clinton and blair moved the wealth that once flowed to working people to financial and corporate elites for a more thorough account see professor william lazonick s profits without prosperity how much money are we losing more than we can imagine here s a back of the envelope estimate for just the most recent year on the chart 2017 the gap between the productivity wage and the current average wage is 631 per week that is if the average weekly wage continued to rise with productivity it would be 631 higher than the current average wage in 2017 there are 103 million of these workers so the total amount of lost wages that flowed to economic elites is a whopping 3 4 trillion 103 million x 631 x 52 weeks and that s just for one year here s how to pay for medicare for all current estimates for a single payer system come in at about 3 trillion per year americans already are paying 1 9 trillion in payroll and income taxes that go to medicare medicaid and other government health programs so we would need to raise another 1 1 trillion to provide universal healthcare and prescription drugs with no co pays no deductibles and no premiums in the name of fairness that additional 1 1 trillion to pay for medicare for all should be raised by taxing back a portion of the 3 4 trillion in wealth that has flowed to the super rich instead of to working people after all working people have not had a real wage increase in more than forty years as economic elites have siphoned away tens of trillions of dollars of income that once went to working people the gap between the two lines wouldn t it be more than fair to ask the superrich to pay the 1 1 trillion needed for medicare for all there are numerous ways for these economic elites pay their fair share financial transaction tax on stock bond and derivative transactions wealth tax on those with over 50 million in wealth minimum corporate tax of 35 percent on all corporations with over 100 million in profits who now pay little or nothing like amazon did this past year raise the marginal tax bracket to 70 on all income over 10 million per year increase the inheritance tax on the super rich to prevent the creation of a permanent oligarchy and so on the point is to give americans what they have been long denied high quality universal healthcare and a real wage increase by providing medicare for all with no co pays no deductibles and no premiums think about how much your income would go up if you didn t have to pay for healthcare at all that would begin to close the gap between productivity and wages for the first time in a generation wait shouldn t working people pay something for health care coverage we already are we pay payroll taxes for medicare and a portion of our regular taxes go to fund medicaid and other public health programs for veterans native americans and public health related research and regulation so next time you hear someone say we can t afford a public good that we need to tighten our belts and get used to austerity think about all that wealth that has flowed to the very top think about that big fat gap between productivity and real wages think about how runaway inequality has allowed the wealth of the richest nation in history to be hijacked by the super rich it s time the american people got a real wage increase and medicare for all would deliver just that originally published by common dreams 04 23 2019 under the terms of

ayn rand and the cruel heart of neoliberalism ayn rand and the cruel heart of neoliberalism trump is in most ways a rand villain a businessman who relies on cronyism and manipulation of government yet he praises the fountainhead it relates to business beauty life and inner emotions the book relates to everything in 2018 tech writer douglas rushkoff met with a handful of hedge fund billionaires to talk about the future of technology but they were actually most interested in enlisting his help in filling in the details for their vision of the dystopian future or rather for their own high tech vision of a galt s gulch style escape from it writing in medium rushkoff described their questions about future apocalypse the event was their euphemism for the environmental collapse social unrest nuclear explosion unstoppable virus or mr robot hack that takes everything down they knew armed guards would be required to protect their compounds from the angry mobs but how would they pay the guards once money was worthless what would stop the guards from choosing their own leader the billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers if that technology could be developed in time they were preparing for a digital future that had a whole lot less to do with making the future a better place than it did with insulating themselves from a very real and present danger of climate change rising sea levels mass migrations global pandemics nativist panic and resource depletion asking these sorts of questions while philosophically entertaining is a poor substitute for wrestling with the real moral quandaries associated with unbridled technological development in the name of corporate capitalism these unnamed hedge fund honchos may have read atlas shrugged but even those who hadn t would likely have been familiar with john galt and the producers utopia he created far from the collapsing world by 2018 ayn rand and her novels had become widespread cultural reference points among wealthy bankers ceos tech moguls and right wing politicians rand s philosophy had its roots in nineteenth century classical liberalism and in her impassioned rejection of socialism and the welfare state in the twentieth century her anti statist pro free market stances went on to shape the politics of what came to be called libertarianism or sometimes anarcho capitalism during a period of rapid expansion in the 1970s the rise of neoliberalism has a parallel history and much overlap with libertarianism but these formations nonetheless have distinct trajectories rand s influence floats over all of them as a guiding spirit for the sense of energized aspiration and the advocacy of inequality and cruelty that shaped their worldviews by the 2018 meeting with rushkoff however the billionaires could no longer be called optimistic their plans differ from galt s intention to return to save the world the contemporary billionaires are only hoping to escape and survive the ruin in high tech style ayn rand bitterly rejected libertarians as right wing hippies in the 1970s but her views and those of her objectivist followers melded substantially with the emerging libertarian movement young enthusiasts were joining older libertarian warhorses to create new organizations publications and institutions libertarian rads split from conservative trads in young americans for freedom in 1969 and went on to help found the new libertarian party in 1971 the new york times magazine featured a major story that january tracking these developments the new right credo libertarianism during the 1970s chapters of organizations like the society for individual liberty proliferated along with popular publications such as reason magazine a yearly libertarian studies conference the center for libertarian studies and the journal of libertarian studies established a foothold in academic life the influential cato institute was originally opened as the libertarian charles koch foundation in 1974 the libertarians who clashed on a wide range of issues ranged from countercultural left libertarians to pragmatic advocates of a minimal state minarchists to a fiery right wing of adamantly anti state anarcho capitalists objectivists were prominent in all of their activities reading rand s novels became a rite of passage for many rand herself disapproved of the lack of philosophical discipline among the motley crew of young libertarians however announcing that if such hippies hope to make me their marcuse it will not work rand just got crankier and crankier as the years went by she continued giving a few public lectures and publishing short essays on current events she was interviewed by phil donahue she began work on a television script for atlas shrugged that was never produced her health began a long decline when her lifetime of heavy smoking resulted in a diagnosis of lung cancer in 1974 though she denied the connection between smoking and cancer to the end she alienated nearly all her friends and colleagues one by one over the years leaving only her heir philosopher leonard peikoff and a few others at her death in 1982 objectivism meanwhile lived on both in the loyal band of followers associated with the ayn rand institute founded by peikoff in 1985 and in those who split off feeling freer to branch out into more heterodox formations after rand s death as libertarianism spread and rand withdrew a new political economic formation began to take center stage becoming organized in the late 1940s with the establishment of the mont pelerin society mps neoliberal thinkers accumulated power and influence over the decades to the point of seizing state power by the 1980s hard to define and largely hidden from view in the early years the term was first used in 1925 neoliberalism was just one thread in the wild and woolly fabric of right wing politics in the united states and europe the founding of the mps helped define it as a distinct tendency among the classical liberals burkean traditionalists libertarians anarcho capitalists religious conservatives right wing racial nationalists and fascists organized primarily by economist friedrich hayek the more than one thousand economists journalists policy makers and other thinkers who eventually gathered under the mps umbrella formed what philip mirowski has called a neoliberal thought collective an intellectual political intervention that eventually defined a new era of capitalism although neoliberalism was never monolithic the neoliberal project was focused on the need to develop a new liberalism to replace the outmoded concepts of nineteenth century classical liberalism the primary goal remaking the infrastructure of states and markets in the post great depression and post second world war world did not comport with the laissez faire capitalism of an earlier era the neoliberals set out to retool the state in relation to the market values of property rights and corporate hegemony while their public propaganda efforts emphasized the keyword freedom and linked so called free markets with free minds they set out via activist interventions in state policy to create a decidedly planned version of laissez faire this gap between the public face and the relatively hidden political planning of neoliberals has been described by david harvey as a contrast between the utopian theory of neoliberal freedom and the practical class project of installing oligarchical elites at the center of economic and state power neoliberalism is often misunderstood through its utopian propaganda as an effort to shrink the state and free the natural operations of the market but neoliberals redirect state efforts rather than diminish them the neoliberal thought collective combined with the various allied political policy centers of neoliberal action might be understood as a global anti left social movement nancy maclean has traced the planning of various neoliberal forces through foundations think tanks research centers and private funders to create new barriers to democratic decision making in the interests of corporate power she describes how charles koch was introduced to the thinking of russian revolutionary vladimir lenin by anarcho capitalist murray rothbard always learning from the left koch drew from lenin s thinking to develop plans for well trained cadres that could prevail over a majority in the political arena today lenin s adherents on the right include former breitbart editor and trump adviser steve bannon neoliberalism was initially centered in europe and the united states focused on attacking the influence of john maynard keynes and the welfare states his thinking helped establish the point of neoliberal effort was to free capitalism from the mixed economies that emphasized limited forms of social security financial regulation empowerment of labor social services and public ownership the slow motion collapse of the fordist economies of secure employment with relatively high wages and benefits opened the door to new macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policies advocated by the neoliberal thought collective including privatization of public services re regulation of corporate operations and erosion of consumer and workplace protections though this process of neoliberalization was represented as race blind many of the ideas and policies evolved out of resistance to the civil rights movement in the united states via what nancy maclean has called property supremacy opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 was often articulated as a defense of private property against government interference rather than as racial animus claims were made for the freedom of private property owners to discriminate against anyone for any reason during massive resistance to civil rights in the u s south the creation of private segregation academies sometimes displaced support for public schools a model for later neoliberal strategies for privatization of education but the critique of government institutions did not extend to legislative efforts to suppress voting rights and law and order police suppression of political dissent in those circumstances state action was required to defend property rights from democracy as well as disorder in 1980 neoliberal politicians ronald reagan and margaret thatcher ascended to become heads of state in the united states and united kingdom in subsequent years neoliberal politics and policies moved social democratic parties unevenly toward neoliberalism all across europe during the 1990s the neoliberal washington consensus took form and the 1992 maastricht treaty founded the european union on neoliberal principles but the neoliberal political project was pursued far beyond europe and the united states fundamentally neoliberalism was a global extension of european colonialism on the nonterritorial u s imperial model during the mid twentieth century former colonies throughout the global south declared independence new postcolonial states in asia africa the middle east latin america and the caribbean instituted a range of strategies to establish growth and autonomy restrictions on foreign investment replacement of imports with local production the redistribution of land and the launching of ambitious public projects and social supports global neoliberalism was engineered to erode those strategies violence was a central method for the imposition of neoliberalism in the global south the 1973 coup in chile and the 2003 invasion of iraq were both followed by foreign investment resource extraction and privatization of public assets but the primary means for reestablishing the economic exploitation and political domination that are key to racial capitalism was the trap of debt through lending to impoverished postcolonial states financial institutions based in the global north especially the international monetary fund were able to impose structural adjustment requirements on debtor nations in the south after the 1989 fall of the ussr neoliberalism entwined with various forms of postsocialist governance in states of the former russian empire neoliberal policies also reshaped late twentieth century china more recently forms of authoritarian neoliberalism mixed with right wing populism are in ascendance in india the philippines and elsewhere neoliberal influence has been culturally deep as well as geographically wide drawing on the work of michel foucault a multidisciplinary group of scholars have described the reach of neoliberal modes of governance into the conduct of everyday life to counter the solidarity economies and social cooperation of organized workers public spirited officials and professionals neoliberals have promoted the entrepreneurial self who competes in the aspiration society everyone invests in their own personal and familial human capital and all are responsible for their own risk taking and rewards or the lack of them according to these conceptions the poor are not a class but a collection of individual failures the rich are not exploitive parasites on the labor of the majority but the very source of wealth and a boon to society except that as margaret thatcher noted society as such does not exist the social is the context for individual striving it is also the scene of the neoliberal theater of cruelty through which feelings of resentment fear anger and loathing are enacted against the weak who are a drain on the worthy cracking down on welfare cheats illegal immigrants and homeless vagrants can become a form of public satisfaction but the everyday life of neoliberalism a template for living as well as governance is not always so dramatic neoliberal cultures are multiple and include soft multicultural inclusive and self help infused versions bill clinton and tony blair barack obama and angela merkel represent a range of softer versions they have steered clear of the open air theater of cruelty approach while also busying themselves with stripping away the social safety net and backing the investor class bill clinton abolished welfare as we know it and obama put wall street bankers in charge of dealing with the economic crisis in 2008 under both soft and hard versions everyday life is infused with the nuts and bolts preoccupations of neoliberalism more than with the spectacular arranging medical care purchasing insurance checking credit scores going to the gym paying student loans worrying about housing costs getting kids into schools the reorganization of the infrastructure of political and economic life has reached deeply into daily living erasing many of the boundaries between the market and the body the family emotional life everyday preoccupations in neoliberal times center on surviving a precarious employment landscape and investing in the skills and traits needed to keep moving rather than on building the solidarity that might underwrite a broad remaking of political and economic infrastructure as a bus stop advertisement for new york university recently put it i am the ceo of me inc then in 2007 and 2008 it looked like it all might come tumbling down the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the united states reverberated through global financial institutions then infected markets and industries well beyond banking and housing losses were deep and broad neoliberal strategies of privatization deregulation especially of finance and minimization of social services lost support in the short run but their supporters soon recovered their nerve and zombie neoliberalism stalked the land as fredric jameson and others have argued economics is a story more than a science and the story the neoliberal thought collective told in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis was more and better neoliberalism is the cure for not the cause of economic crisis more tax cuts less regulation intensified theaters of cruelty in philip mirowski s phrasing more everyday sadism those losing their homes are to blame for their bad mortgages immigrants are to blame for citizens job losses and precarity everyone should be responsible for their own healthcare and in an especially tricky twist the groups calling for neoliberal remedies for neoliberal crises like the tea party posed as outsiders fight the power identifying the power became the crux of the problem during the decade since the crisis of 2008 politics have increasingly polarized in volatile ways around the world the center of neoliberal consensus seems to be progressively collapsing despite the strenuous efforts and significant successes of the zombies left activism and right wing mobilization have expanded rapidly in this polarized landscape ayn rand pops up as a kind of avatar of capitalist freedom from a figure admired largely on the margins of u s politics she moved into the political center in the decades after 1980 or rather the center moved toward her ayn rand s popularity has had four significant high points 1 from the publication of the fountainhead to the appearance of atlas shrugged 1943 1957 2 among newly ascendant neoliberals during the 1980s 3 among the new tech tycoons of silicon valley during the 1990s and after and 4 during and after the 2008 crash the link between the first two periods can be traced through the career of alan greenspan greenspan became a regular at rand s collective meetings during the 1950s accompanying his first wife joan mitchell at first quiet and circumspect greenspan slowly waded into debates with rand who called him the undertaker he was a math whiz a logical positivist a committed empiricist technocrat when he encountered objectivism but then he explains in his memoir the age of turbulence rand persuaded me to look at human beings their values how they work what they do and why they do it and how they think and why they think this broadened my horizons far beyond the models of economics i d learned she introduced me to a vast realm from which i d shut myself off his work and reputation as an economic consultant took off during the 1960s when he delivered lectures at the nathaniel branden institute and published in the objectivist in 1974 as neoliberal thinking began to move increasingly away from pure forms of libertarian philosophy and toward the project of reshaping state power greenspan moved into a new post on president gerald ford s council of economic advisors rand and frank o connor accompanied him to the swearing in in his new location at the center of administrative power he abandoned his advocacy of the gold standard and opposition to central banks in 1987 he was appointed by president reagan to be chairman of the federal reserve from there until his retirement in 2006 greenspan presided over the deregulation of the u s based financial system alan greenspan thus became one of the most important neoliberal policy makers in world history his rise to this position required compromises and shifts from his earlier purist objectivist views rand herself clung tightly to her integrated uncompromising philosophy she was thus not exactly a neoliberal herself she shunned the negotiations required to retool the economic and political infrastructure as neoliberals aspired to do she remained a propagandist an objectivist purist and a drama queen presiding over her fictional theaters of cruelty providing templates plot lines and characters for the everyday fantasies of the neoliberal era she promoted the entrepreneurial self attacked solidarity and socialism and posed as the ultimate rebel the icon of capitalist freedom in this she stood alongside rather than within the neoliberal project her spirit certainly guided major neoliberal institutions and publications including the cato institute directed from 2012 to 2015 by objectivist and ayn rand institute board member john allison and reason magazine founded in 1968 to support the randian project of free minds and free markets rand acolytes were spread throughout the world of business during the 1980s and 90s but the tech gurus of silicon valley have been an especially rich source of ayn rand fandom as nick bolton explains in a 2016 issue of vanity fair perhaps the most influential figure in the industry after all isn t steve jobs or sheryl sandberg but rather ayn rand jobs s co founder steve wozniak has suggested that atlas shrugged was one of jobs s guides in life for a time kalanick s twitter avatar featured the cover of the fountainhead peter thiel is also a self described rand devotee at their core rand s philosophies suggest that it s o k to be selfish greedy and self interested especially in business and that a win at all costs mentality is just the price of changing the norms of society as one start up founder recently told me they should retitle her books it s o k to be a sociopath and yet most tech entrepreneurs and engineers appear to live by one of rand s defining mantras the question isn t who is going to let me it s who is going to stop me the randian ethos of the heroic individual entrepreneur as alpha white male and sometimes female genius fits the self mythologizing self image of silicon valley tech startups particularly well it might have been expected that the bursting of the 1990s dot com bubble and the early twenty first century financial crisis would have pulled the plug on some of these hot air balloons even alan greenspan admitted during a 2008 congressional hearing that yes i found a flaw in the ideology underpinning his deregulating fervor as chair of the federal reserve but ayn rand rose with the zombies after 2008 with a big sales surge for atlas shrugged tea partiers and others saw the financial collapse and economic crisis as following the plotline of that novel john galt to the rescue meant time for more and better neoliberalism the election of donald trump in 2016 would seem on the surface to constitute a repudiation of randism trump is in most ways a rand villain a businessman who relies on cronyism and manipulation of government who advocates interference in so called free markets who bullies big companies to do his bidding who doesn t read his personal and public corruption mirror her character sketches of sellouts and dirtbags trump draws from nationalism in his rhetoric and some of his policies and panders to religious conservatives both ideologies rand found odious yet he praises the fountainhead it relates to business beauty life and inner emotions the book relates to everything his cabinet and donor lists are full of rand fans the question arises with the election of trump and the success of far right nationalism and populism around the world are these still neoliberal times are the zombies reinforcing their infrastructure and deepening their hold with policies like the u s tax cut bill the appointment of neoliberal judges the extended privatization of healthcare and education the gutting of environmental regulations that businesses oppose or is neoliberalism collapsing are we seeing the rise of security states and fascist parties that might replace neoliberal hegemony with something new something terrifying or might we see socialist organizing reach toward something more egalitarian and inclusive something exciting the reign of the cruel optimism of mean girl ayn rand is one barometer rand cannot be a presiding spirit for right wing nationalism or for socialism she is the avatar of capitalism in its militant form as market liberalism if neoliberalism crashes and burns in public acceptability so does she what can we all do organize of course as so many on the global feminist antiracist anti neoliberal left are now doing but also expose the cruelty at the heart of neoliberalism and build on the social solidarity she worked so hard to discredit and destroy reject ayn rand after all she rejects you excerpted from mean girl ayn rand and the culture of greed by lisa duggan published by the university of california press 2019 by the regents of the university of

us china trade war remains a dominant theme in the global financial markets today words from both sides continued to indicate hard line stances it doesn t quite matter how much close to facts are their rhetorics what matters most is that neither the us or china is going to back down for now more importantly after trump s double efforts to isolate huawei global tech companies are starting to halt supplies to the chinese telecom giant those companies include intel qualcomm broadcom germany s infineon and even google is said to halt support on its android platform us china tension will only get worse nevertheless while risk aversion is seen in europeans stocks while us futures point to lower open the currency markets shrug it off australian dollar remains the strongest one for now as lifted by election results over the weekend new zealand and canadian dollars follow as next strongest there is no apparent strength in yen for today instead dollar euro and yen are so far the weakest technically while yen is mildly lower today there is now sign of bottoming in yen crosses yet we d still expect more decline in usd jpy eur jpy and gbp jpy ahead 109 02 in usd jpy 122 08 in eur jpy

china hit back on trump s claim that there was very strong deal a good deal that the formed changed leading to higher tariffs on chinese imports foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said we don t know what this agreement is the united states is talking about perhaps the united states has an agreement they all along had extravagant expectations for but it s certainly not a so called agreement that china agreed to lu also criticized that the us tried to achieve unreasonable interests through extreme pressure and from the start this wouldn t work he also reiterated china u s economic and trade consultation can only follow the correct track of mutual respect equality and mutual benefit for there to be hope of success eu businesses saw forced technology transfer in china persisted at double rate in a survey the european union chamber of commerce in china eu companies are generally sceptical on whether china will release open up market assess european businesses continued to witness sustained support for state owned enterprises higher incidences of unfair technology transfers and the strengthening of the communist party s role in business it s also noted that one of the more significant shortcomings of china s reform agenda is that certain high level promises to improve its business environment for international companies have failed to translate into concrete action more importantly european chamber vice president charlotte roule complained that our members have reported that compelled technology transfers not only persist but that they happen at double the rate of two years ago and it is unacceptable that this practice continues in a market as mature and innovative as china here are some highlights of the survey results optimism on growth over the next two

will meet japanese economy minister toshimitsu motegi to resume trade negotiations trump declared auto imports as threat to national security last week and lighthizer will have 180 days to complete the trade agreement otherwise trump might start imposing tariffs on autos and parts from japan kenji wakamiya chairman of the lower house of parliament s foreign affairs committee said he expected trump would not be as tough on japan as it had been on china he added us could demand japan set targets on us productions by their automakers however he warned that it would be difficult for the japanese government to tell carmakers what they should do they have their ideas and shareholders so it won t be easy separately the claim of auto imports as national security threat to us infuriated japanese maker toyota motor toyota said in a statement last friday that trump s proclamation sends a message to toyota that our investments are not welcomed and the contributions from each of our

japan s economic fundamentals remain sound supported by strong domestic demand which is continuing up trend also employment and income environments have improved while corporate profits are high though the government will watch the impact of trade tensions carefully exports are already slowing and output remains weak due to china s economic slowdown some manufacturers are also delaying capital spending leading to decline in capital expenditure australian dollar rebounds on election results upside capped by rba and trade australian dollar spikes higher today after the central right

many market participants believe the commodities super cycle is all but over yet others opine it is merely taking a break to return with the next cycle led by natural resources of a different sort needed in the drive towards electrification of human mobility and a low carbon economy whichever side of the argument you happen to be on there is likely to be agreement that china drove the commodities market either side of the global financial crisis following the assetization of commodities that occurred towards the end of the last millennium or to be precise in the final four decades of the last millennium this millennium any commodity value experiencing double digit inflation adjusted price growth on an annualized basis can be deemed to be in a super cycle courtesy of china s own double digit growth until a recent cooling of its economy a plethora of commodities both soft and hard experienced such growth between january 1 1998 and june 30 2008 it led people to opine that a commodities super cycle was occurring forget double digits the price of oil rose 1 062 and that of copper rose 487 over the said period according to bloomberg data then a u s sub prime mortgage crisis became a full blown global financial crisis halting that super cycle but in a bid to minimize the effects of the global slowdown on its economy china announced a 4 trillion yuan 586 billion economic stimulus package on november 9 2008 centered on infrastructure and social development commodity price growth initially limped and in subsequent years jumped upwards but fast forward to 2019 and it s a changed macroeconomic landscape china s economy is making a transition from being manufacturing led to a services driven model unable to match double digit growth the commodities market has grown accustomed to in recent decades since commodity prices are informed by marginal costs subject to intermittent deflationary or inflationary disruptive forces this expected maturing of the chinese economy is troubling in 2017 18 when china s perceived economic adjustment was clear for all to see commodities ended up as the worst performing asset class crude oil the sphere s poster natural resource ended 2018 down 18 though not entirely down to chinese demand while natural gas ended 3 lower on an annualized basis however neither was the worst performing commodity that dishonor fell to lithium 30 despite it being central to a rising need for rechargeable high performance batteries from mobile phones to electric vehicles a manufacturing segment where china leads in volume terms that s because alongside being a top consumer of lithium china also happens to be a top producer of the silver white alkali metal it is only behind australia and chile in terms of output and the world leader in terms of proven reserves that neutered the scope for it factoring in china s still decent appetite for metals unlike copper which has seen an upturn fortunes since 2016 lows 70 but china s overall commodity consumption is nothing like it was in the last decade beijing is also currently embroiled in a trade spat with u s president donald trump involving tariff salvos that have implications well beyond bilateral trade between u s china a recent poll of economists surveyed by bloomberg suggests china s 2019 gdp growth will be lowered by 0 3 percentage point by the rise in u s tariffs on 200 billion of imports from china following the latest escalation by trump if more tariffs are slapped by the u s president to cover all chinese goods then a 0 6 percentage point drop in the 12 months thereafter appears to be the median figure given by those polled however even before the latest escalation of the ongoing trade spat began data had been pointing to lower economic activity according to china s national bureau of statistics the country s april industrial output came in at 5 4 on an annualized basis down from 8 5 in march april retail sales growth came in at 7 2 versus 8 7 in march and fixed asset investment at 6 1 versus 6 3 in march kit juckes head of fx at société générale said china s activity data has surprised on the downside looking through the monthly volatility china is still on track of stabilization but the recovery is probably not going to be as strong as some are hoping for while an economic stimulus from beijing is imminent its nature would be very different from 2008 back then an infrastructure focused stimulus supported not just copper and iron ore prices but also those of zinc lead nickel and fossil fuels the stimulus measures expected in 2019 will still offer significant support to the chinese economy but will feel different according marie diron head of asia pacific middle east africa sovereigns at moody s speaking at the rating agency s emerging markets summit in london on thursday may 16 diron said market expectations are that beijing s move will be more skewed towards tax cuts whether it would be as effective as previous initiatives remains to be seen moody s predicts china s gdp growth in 2019 of just above 6 accompanied by a significant tightening in credit and the ongoing trade spat while negative for the u s carries bigger problems for china given trade imbalances as it exports more goods to the u s rather than the other way around that s why beijing s reaction to each escalation by trump via retaliatory tariffs of its own is lower in dollar terms chinese companies will be negatively impacted whether you take direct u s action into account or domino effects on the supply chain all at a time when corporate leverage remains a risk said gary lau head of north asia ex japan corporates at moody s and with trump in the white house the issue is not going away anytime soon juckes of socgen added china will remain a bone of contention whether the current trade dispute is resolved or not and the president might turn his attention to what many in washington view as overvalued dollar that might open another can of worms for the commodities trade given such variables selective commodities might fare better than others for instance the commodity that outshone others in 2018 was uranium 20 3 but the uptick albeit from a low base had little to do with china the price rise came because the supply and demand equation for uranium has resulted in a tightening of the market following japan s fukushima nuclear tragedy in 2011 countries began to shy away from nuclear power generation in tandem with a short term surplus of japanese uranium stockpiles the perceived nuclear switch off meant the number of mining companies declaring interest in uranium fell by 90 then dwindling japanese stockpiles uptick in favor for nuclear power generation and lack of resource mining plays sent the uranium price soaring last year quite like uranium there will be other winning commodity plays but a holistic china driven commodities super cycle is unlikely to materialize source forbes
cnn 1 yuan alert the yuan just hit its lowest level against the dollar since november 2018 that could make the trade war between china and the united states even more complicated one us dollar bought 6 92 yuan on friday the chinese currency has weakened by almost 2 7 this month and is now uncomfortably close to the symbolically important level of 7 to the dollar last breached during the 2008 financial crisis what happens next is important china has a vested interest in stabilizing the currency as does the united states president donald trump has long argued that china devalues its currency to make the country more competitive but beijing is in a tough spot currency depreciation could help china by canceling out the impact of new us tariffs and keeping its exports affordable in america but a big drop in the yuan could spark an outflow of money from china and hurt economic stability at the same time the chinese government may be hesitant to prop up its currency since doing so could open beijing up to further criticism from washington china is caught between a rock and a hard place said miguel chanco senior asia economist at pantheon macroeconomics china may be tempted to use its currency as a weapon against the united states bank of america merrill lynch analysts athanasios vamvakidis and claudio piron said in a note to clients on friday letting the yuan depreciate would be a softer option than targeting us businesses or investments in china they said veteran hedge fund manager mark yusko thinks china could do this without causing its own economy too much pain typically as the yuan weakens china would have to worry about an exodus of money from the country as investors lose confidence and swap yuan for assets in dollars and other currencies yusko argues that s not a problem for beijing which could enforce capital controls that doesn t mean such a strategy is without risks the yuan falling below 7 to the us dollar could trigger further selloffs pushing it still lower chanco said that would likely be unattractive to beijing he added letting the yuan weaken could also boost chinese inflation that s a risk at a time when the economy is already showing signs of weakness with retail sales cooling significantly another big question is whether china chooses to sell us treasuries at a more rapid pace in turn buying yuan and shoring up its value china reduced its holdings of us debt in march to 1 12 trillion in us treasuries the lowest level in almost two years chanco sees dumping us government debt as the nuclear option while yusko thinks china will absolutely speed up sales of treasuries if a resolution isn t reached soon i think it s very likely he said 2 annual meetings amazon s annual shareholder meeting is on wednesday and this

china struck a more aggressive tone in its trade war with the united states suggesting a resumption of talks between the world s two largest economies would be meaningless unless washington changed course the tough talk capped a week that saw beijing unveil fresh retaliatory tariffs u s officials accuse china of backtracking on promises made during months of talks and the trump administration level a potentially crippling blow against one of china s biggest and most successful companies chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang asked about state media reports suggesting there would be no more trade negotiations said china always encouraged resolving disputes with the united states through dialogue and consultations but because of certain things the u s side has done during the previous china u s trade consultations we believe if there is meaning for these talks there must be a show of sincerity he told a daily news briefing cnbc citing sources said the trade talks had stalled and the next round of discussions was in flux the united states raised beijing s ire this week when it announced it was putting huawei technologies co ltd the world s biggest telecoms equipment maker on a blacklist that could make it extremely hard to do business with u s companies the u s commerce department may soon scale back restrictions on huawei by issuing a temporary general license to allow time for companies and people who have huawei equipment to maintain reliability of their communications networks and equipment a department spokeswoman said the possible general license would not apply to new transactions the spokeswoman said and would last for 90 days china has yet to say whether or how it will retaliate although its state media is sounding an increasingly strident note the ruling communist party s people s daily published on friday a front page commentary that evoked the patriotic spirit of the country s past wars the trade war can t bring china down it will only harden us to grow stronger it said global stocks which rebounded this week on the prospect of another round of u s china talks suffered a fresh bout of selling and china s yuan slid to its weakest against the u s dollar in almost five months prices of u s government debt were trading higher the increasingly acrimonious trade dispute has rattled investors who fear that the countries are careening dangerously down a track that will badly damage global supply lines and put the brakes on an already slowing world economy the south china morning post citing an unidentified source reported that a senior member of china s communist party said the trade war could reduce china s 2019 economic growth by 1 percentage point in the worst case scenario both sides might need some prodding but we ve had a very clear opportunity for one side or the other to say this isn t going to work and neither side did said derek scissors an expert on sino u s economic relations at the american enterprise institute think tank who put the chance of a deal this year at over 50 50 auto tariffs u s president donald trump who has embraced protectionism as part of an america first agenda aimed at rebalancing global trade has accused china of backing out of a deal earlier this month that would have ended the 10 month dispute earlier this month reuters reported china had backtracked on commitments to change its laws to resolve core u s complaints about theft of intellectual property forced technology transfers and other practices trump punctuated two days of talks in washington last week with a decision to raise tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent the negotiations ended in a stalemate on monday beijing said it would raise its tariffs on a revised list of 60 billion in u s goods effective june 1 trump in turn said he is considering slapping tariffs on the remaining 300 billion in chinese imports to the united states the u s president also continues to dangle the possibility of imposing tariffs of up to 25 on imported cars and parts a move that could be devastating for a number of u s trading partners including japan and germany the white house said on friday that trump s decision on auto tariffs would be delayed by up to six months to allow more time for trade talks with the european union and japan trump faced a saturday deadline to make a decision it added however that the u s president agreed with findings by the u s commerce department that imported vehicles and parts can threaten u s national security a designation likely to anger some u s allies automakers have strongly opposed the tariffs saying they would hike prices and threaten thousands of u s jobs there is also strong opposition in the u s congress with many prominent members of trump s republican party rejecting the idea u s senate minority leader chuck schumer a democrat praised the administration s decision to delay the auto tariffs positive step the pressure must be strong on china not on our allies who we should encourage to join us in confronting china schumer tweeted the united states and canada also announced on friday a deal to remove tariffs on canadian steel and aluminium in exchange for new curbs to keep dumped metals from china and other nations out of the u s market the mexican president s office later said mexico had reached a similar deal with the united states the metals tariffs were an aggravation for the canadian and mexican governments and had been a major hurdle to enacting the u s mexico canada agreement the deal that would replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement source reuters reporting by ben blanchard and gao liangping in beijing and david shepardson in washington

information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if the fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations preferred securities high yield securities corporate bonds government bonds municipal bonds and senior loans are subject to credit risk call risk income risk interest rate risk inflation risk and prepayment risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that a mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities

gold mmt fiat money inflation in france modern monetary theory mmt is a heterodox macroeconomic framework that says monetarily sovereign countries like the u s u k japan and canada are not operationally constrained by revenues when it comes to federal government spending in other words such governments do not need taxes or borrowing for spending since they can print as much as they need and are the monopoly issuers of the currency investopedia of course governments are not constrained by revenues they have always been able to print as much as they need modern monetary theory is not modern far from it in the late eighteenth century france was deeply in debt a general lack of capital and confidence had taken its toll and the economy was lacking in signs of activity growth was stagnant the conditions were such that it would be reasonable to expect a return to better times without interference by government unfortunately that would require patience and restraint by the politicians most politicians cannot resist the cries of do something even if the cries are non existent the government will hear them a finance committee in the national assembly in 1790 said that the people demand a new circulating medium the circulation of paper money is the best of operations it is the most free because it reposes on the will of the people it will bind the interest of the citizens to the public good and what better way to encourage support for printing worthless paper money than to appeal to the french people s patriotism let us show to europe that we understand our own resources let us immediately take the broad road to our liberation instead of dragging ourselves along the tortuous and obscure paths of fragmentary loans rather than exercising patience and restraint the french government was headed in the opposite direction a call to action had been sounded there was strong resistance to this effort but it was not enough to stem the tide of enthusiastic support for it fundamental economics and historical experience were ignored in favor of the rallying cries of politicians and others the first issuance of paper money in france under its constitutional government was announced in april 1790 the supposed backing or security for the paper money was based on confiscated property of the french national church in addition the notes paid interest of 3 per annum as such they were expected to soon be considered better than the coin now hoarded coin meaning gold initial effects of the paper money were quite positive and any ill effects would likely not have been felt to the degree that befell france and exacerbated the effects of a very bloody revolution just a few years later if the government had left well enough alone but after spending the proceeds the government again found itself in dire straits and another issue of paper money was thought necessary plaintive cries of resistance were countered with a sophisticated oratory that emphasized the stability and security of the proposed currency also at this time there were predictions that paper currency would be more desirable to hold than gold and that gold would soon lose all its value a bill authorizing the issuance of another version of paper notes was passed in september 1790 only five months after the initial issuance this time the notes bore no interest the security of land backing was considered highly adequate the circulation of the new notes was expected to handily outclass its supposedly inferior competition i e gold and silver oh and by the way this particular issue of new notes was twice as large as the first a third issue was approved in june 1791 and a fourth followed in decmeber of that same year both issues were approved quickly and with much less fanfare and very little obvious opposition part of the reason for less outspoken resistance to the new issues of paper money can be likened to the response of a first time user of drugs once the pleasing effects have been felt and then subside and disappear the desire for another fix becomes stronger also the effects of subsequent fixes do not yield the same quantifiable benefits as before hence it requires more of the drug or money credit to yield similar results as previously recognized this is exactly why governments and central banks find it impossible to back away from creating more inflation so the cycle continues until outright rejection occurs or the addict dies from the cumulative negative effects another reason for the relative ease that accompanied further new issues of paper money by the french government was that the lack of patriotism imputed to opponents became synonymous with treason the threat of the guillotine may have deterred noticeable opposition to the new issues but it did not stop the deleterious effects that descended on france as a result of the deluge of paper money prices of everything became enormously inflated in less than five years basic necessities such as flour to cook with and wood to heat your home increased in price by more than one hundred fold and in some specific cases as much as two hundred fifty or more there was one thing though that did not reflect anything close to a proportionate increase in price the wages of laborers by the summer of 1792 were no higher than they were four years earlier makers of manufactured goods stopped producing and laid off workers fundamental economic activity weakened and became non existent the price of gold in francs went up by a multiple of 288 that is the equivalent of gold going from 1300 00 per ounce currently to more than 370 000 00 per ounce by the end of 2023 the issues of paper money continued speculation and trade in real property and specie gold and silver was rampant there were however brief periods of time when the value of the french currency rose the long term decline of the u s dollar over the past century is marked by similar periods of stability and an increase in value but they do not last in an effort to support the value of its worthless paper currency and force the desired economic activity and responses the french government levied progressively higher taxes against the wealthy the wealthy were married and unmarried men with various levels of income deemed to be excessive sound familiar some of the rich hid their wealth or fled the country fines imprisonment in irons and death awaited those who refused to accept the worthless paper money in trade or for repayment of existing debts price fixing was attempted too remember wage and price controls imposed under president nixon and mobs threatened shopkeepers and store owners by demanding and taking what they wanted and the mobs targeted anyone who had anything to do with money all the while the french government continued to proclaim the soundness of the worthless paper by pointing out that it was backed by the security of confiscated lands how often have we been told that the national debt is not a problem because we owe it to ourselves or that the u s dollar is backed by our productive economy france had experimented with paper currency seventy years earlier and it had failed miserably those in favor of this new walk on the wild side pointed to the backing of the confiscated lands and also the support of the people under its new constitutional government as factors which would prevent a similar failure they were wrong and when the folly was finally recognized officially various attempts were made to correct the errors a new paper money fully secured and as good as gold was authorized the new money would not be backed by gold however it was secured by public real estate the connection to gold was made by claiming that the new paper money had a value that was fixed at a specific percentage of gold the claim was meaningless and ineffective the amount of the new paper was equal to the total of all previous issues all issues circulated side by side both old and new money sank to about two percent of their original nominal value the u s dollar today is worth two percent of its former value of one hundred years ago the french government in the 1790s eclipsed the value of their paper money by a similar percentage in only five years paper money has a history of dismal failure at every turn whether it was france in 1720 or 1790 or the united states in our country s early history or the southern confederacy during the civil war we have seen its flaws and failures made clear in germany in the 1920s and more recently in zimbabwe and venezuela the definition of mmt above seems to distinguish between the money borrowed by government as contrasted with money printed there is no difference when the u s treasury borrows money it issues securities that are i o u s printed on paper those treasury bonds and notes are just as worthless and irredeemable as paper currency itself the bonds and notes become part of the circulating medium of money and purchasing power as soon as they are issued they are accepted as collateral for new loans of digital money that continue to inflate the supply of money and credit and the money that is received by the government in exchange for the treasury securities that it issues is spent almost immediately and is back in circulation in short order the continual issuance of treasury securities by the united states government meets the definition of inflation inflation is the debasement of money by government and the practice of fractional reserve banking exacerbates and compounds the debasement inflation never stops the debasement of money by governments and central banks is ongoing and non stop governments act and administer according to their own need for survival they act in conjunction with their central banks in their own self interest today s intentional destruction of the u s dollar has been in motion since the inception of the federal reserve in 1913 and it won t stop until the currency is completely worthless regardless of how long it takes the end result is an economic depression the effects of that depression will be proportionate to the harm inflicted by the paper currency and will reflect the extent to which fundamental economics have been ignored and abused the reason that the end place of all paper money currency government bonds and notes and digital electronic equivalents of the same is the scrap heap is because all paper currencies have no inherent or intrinsic value all of them are substitutes for real money i e gold historical facts cited in this article are taken from the book fiat money inflation in france by andrew dickson white kelsey williams is the author of two books inflation what it

over the past quarter century no economist has worked harder than joseph stiglitz to keep the democratic party from moving to the center to prevent democrats from going gaga over free markets and the supposed glories of globalization along with a handful of other slighted seers of the left such as former labor secretary robert reich stiglitz was concerned early on about the eroding safety net for the middle class income inequality and the financialization of the economy as chairman of bill clinton s council of economic advisors and later the chief economist at the world bank in the 1990s stiglitz argued passionately and unsuccessfully against opening up global capital flows too rapidly he also spoke out against again without results repealing the glass steagall act which regulated financial institutions and separated commercial from investment banking
by reicelene joy n ignacio reporter the country s balance of payments bop a summary of the philippines economic transactions with the rest of the world for a given period registered a surplus for the sixth month in a row in april due to inflows from the central bank s foreign exchange operations and income from its investments abroad that were partially offset by state foreign debt payments the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp reported on monday latest available central bank data show that bop turned around to a 467 million surplus in april from a 270 million deficit a year ago taking the year to date tally to a 4 265 billion surfeit against a year ago 1 497 billion gap the surplus may be attributed partly to remittance inflows from overseas filipinos and net inflows of foreign portfolio investments during the first quarter of the year and net inflows of foreign direct investments in first two months of 2019 the bsp said in a press release on its web site the reported bop position reflected the final gross international reserves gir level of 83 88 billion as of end april 2019 it noted at this level the gir represents a more than ample liquidity buffer and is equivalent to 7 4 months worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income such gir level is also equivalent to five times the country s short term external debt based on original maturity of up to a year and 3 5 times based on residual maturity short term foreign debt falling due in up to one year plus principal payments on medium and long term loans of the public and private sectors falling due in the next 12 months bsp said bop marked 2018 with a 2 306 billion gap and is now projected by bsp at a 3 5 billion deficit this year nicholas antonio t mapa ing bank n v manila s senior economist said in an e mail to reporters we expect the philippines to continue to see months of surplus with the external position less vulnerable in 2019 as the philippines looks to see heavier reliance on the financial account even as the current account remains in deficit softening foreign demand amid simmering trade tensions between the world s two biggest economies the united states and china made philippine merchandise exports fall for a fourth month in april fueling the trade in goods gap and consequently the bop s current account deficit to grow even more the bop s financial account consists of foreign direct and portfolio investments as well as other forms of investment sought for comment security bank chief economist robert dan j roces said that the ample international reserves serve as a good standby fund to help the economy stay afloat during an exchange crisis such as those that may be caused by the trade war or in times of national emergency at the same time mr roces added the good numbers in terms of of overseas filipino remittances form part of the current account may not be enough to cover for the trade gap on a positive note our high capital account means we have enough forex reserves to stabilize the peso hence mr roces said notwithstanding potential headwinds as long as economic fundamentals stay robust we are seeing a sustained surplus for the year also sought for comment michael l ricafort economist of the rizal commercial banking corp said in a mobile phone message that the bop surplus may reflect improvement in the gir as well at 2 5 year highs amid improvement in investment income due to gains in bond prices in the united states and developed markets along with net foreign portfolio investment inflows of at least 200 million for the month net foreign direct investments growth in remittances and business process outsourcing revenues and foreign tourism receipts proceeds from foreign borrowing also added to the bop surplus narrowing trend in monthly trade deficits net imports would also help improve bop data in the coming months

s resolve not to let the yuan fall too fast and breach the 7 per dollar level given some evidence beijing has been selling u s treasury bonds in favor of gold many are wondering if china will use a weaker yuan both as a bargaining chip and a means to offset higher tariffs on its exports but weaponizing the yuan has its downside aside from capital flight and the hit to local banks a yuan plunge will undermine the goal of promoting global yuan use and luring foreign investors to chinese stocks and bonds the 3 yuan plunge so far in may is already putting investors to flight the institute of

trade and tariffs get no mention in fed statements and chairman jerome powell didn t dwell on them in his latest post meeting address but minutes of the april 30 may 1 meeting due on wednesday could

in this week s monday briefing mei experts randa slim gerald feierstein zubair iqbal marvin g weinbaum mirette f mabrouk robert s ford and rauf mammadov provide analysis on recent and upcoming events including the escalating tensions between the united states and iran with iraq caught in between jared kushner s economic development plan for palestinians the imf s bailout deal with pakistan political turmoil ahead of the afghan presidential election developments in the egyptian media landscape following recent constitutional amendments debate over how to approach elections in algeria and the impact of us iran tensions on the oil market iraq back in the eye of the storm randa slim senior fellow director of conflict resolution and track ii dialogues program iraq is back in the eye of the storm this time it is the evolving crisis between the united states and iran yesterday a katyusha rocket landed inside baghdad s green zone a mile away from the u s embassy compound there was no damage or serious injuries this was a controlled escalation with the objective of sending a warning shot to the american administration no one claimed responsibility leaders of the major pro iranian militias the badr brigade kataeb hezbollah and asaib ahl al haq promptly put out messages saying a military escalation between the united states and iran that is waged on iraqi soil is not to the benefit of any party most of all iraqis iraqi officials are seriously concerned about the prospects of a military escalation on iraqi soil decisions by the u s administration and exxonmobil to withdraw staff from iraq exacerbated apprehensions among iraqi officials and the iraqi public that there is a looming conflict for which iraq will pay a heavy price while leaders of iraqi pro iran militias publicly say they are interested in keeping iraq outside the firing zone privately they tell their interlocutors that if current tensions between the united states and iran turn violent they cannot guarantee they can stay out of the fight during his may 7 visit to baghdad secretary of state mike pompeo asked his iraqi counterparts to convey warnings to tehran about the consequences of targeting military assets in iraq iraq s foreign minister has now offered to act as a mediator between its two allies the united states and iran with the aim of de escalating the crisis domestically there are reports that hadi al amiri the head of al binaa parliamentary coalition who was appointed by the iraqi prime minister as basra czar to tackle that city s myriad problems announced he was no longer interested in the job there could be a number of reasons for this including that the recent geopolitical tensions may require his attention more than running basra one other explanation could be that even al amiri has come to the conclusion that fixing a city like basra where different powerful parties including his opponents in parliament have entrenched economic and political interests is unlikely to be either easy or successful rmslim kushner s economic development plan for palestinians gerald feierstein senior vice president the white house has confirmed plans to co host with the government of bahrain an economic workshop for palestinians in manama june 25 26 the workshop is intended to demonstrate the investibility of the region and will focus on four pillars infrastructure industry empowering and investing in people and governance reforms according to an unnamed u s official the administration indicated that a second component of its deal of the century the political plan will be unveiled at a later as yet unspecified date the palestinian authority s spokesman nabil abu rudeineh quickly dismissed the kushner plan as futile in a discussion of his upcoming peace proposal at the washington institute for near east policy winep on may 2 kushner asserted that he launched his effort with an assessment phase to study why previous attempts at resolving the israeli palestinian conflict had failed the team determined that a lot of the disagreement seems to be about high level concepts which apparently include questions of a one state or two state solution while acknowledging that these core issues need to be resolved kushner then explained that his team started building an economic vision because the people want to have better lives and everybody wants to live with dignity but of course he failed to appreciate or acknowledge that proposals built around offering palestinians better economic lives and investment and prosperity as a substitute for their political rights have been put on the table for decades these initiatives have also failed because they have not addressed the fundamental demand of the palestinian people for the right to self determination and the freedom to build their own state out from under the thumb of israeli occupation kushner fairly argues that people shouldn t judge his plan until its unveiled but based on what he s revealed of it so far it s difficult to see how his deal of the century won t end up in the same scrap heap as its predecessors j_feierstein pakistan reaches imf bailout deal zubair iqbal mei scholar for the 13th time in the last 30 years pakistan sought imf financial support to address its deepening economic and financial difficulties a staff level agreement was reached last week on a comprehensive adjustment program that will be supported by imf assistance of around 6 billion over a period of about three years it is expected that this agreement will be considered by the imf s executive board for approval early next month pakistan s approach to the imf was necessitated by the worsening over the past two years of external and budgetary deficits a precipitous drawdown of external reserves and a sharp buildup of external and domestic public debt these developments threatened economic growth heightened inflationary and unemployment pressures enhanced market uncertainty and encouraged capital outflows financial support from certain friendly countries increased but was insufficient to fill the growing gap in particular the newly elected government recognized somewhat belatedly that it needed to undertake fundamental economic reforms and seek international financial support to address the deepening economic pressures the adjustment program agreed with the imf staff calls for a number of policy reforms ahead of the final agreement prior actions and aims at a dramatic reduction in fiscal and external current account deficits through higher taxation and subsidy cuts which would also help reduce public debt market determination of the exchange rate and likely higher interest rates to contain monetary growth and inflation major structural reforms including in particular public sector enterprise reforms will be undertaken to underpin sustained growth with improved equity the arrangement critically depends on enhanced financial support by major friendly countries and international financial institutions to supplement imf financing implementation of these reforms in the current political environment in pakistan will not be easy the coalition government will have to seek the cooperation of opposition parties the social costs of reform measures will be high in particular reform of state enterprises will be resisted and may add to inflationary pressures while reducing employment opportunities for a rapidly growing population political turmoil ahead of afghan presidential election marvin g weinbaum director for afghanistan and pakistan studies on may 22 afghanistan will find itself with either a national unity government holding an extended judicially sanctioned mandate or as some contend an illegitimate regime unconstitutionally hanging on to power a presidential election scheduled for last april was delayed until july and is now planned for september president ashraf ghani s political enemies who have been demanding he step down in favor of a caretaker government accuse him of planning to stay in office by indefinitely delaying the election afghanistan has a history of electoral processes that have repeatedly failed to choose presidents or parliaments on time and uncontested only this month have the final results of last october s parliamentary election been announced and a new legislative body convened already three years late incompetent indecisive and corrupt management as well as controversy resulting from massive fraud have marred national elections the independent election commission iec has been accused of a lack of adequate preparation in the training of election workers and balloting procedures the move last week by the government appointed members of the iec to reverse a decision to employ a biometric system for voter identification has a drawn bitter response from opposition parties without a civil registry and reliable statistics many doubt a free and fair election is possible elections especially in weak democratic states like afghanistan are almost always deeply politically divisive and disruptive some have questioned in light of poor security across the country the wisdom of trying to hold presidential and provincial council elections iec officials have conceded the impossibility of opening polling stations in the taliban controlled as well as strongly contested districts turnout elsewhere is certain to be depressed by the taliban s denunciation of the election and threats against voters a weak security environment would also seem to create greater opportunities for electoral corruption but while another hotly disputed presidential contest could further undermine already fading popular support for the political process failure to secure a renewed democratic mandate may be even more delegitimizing either way domestic political turmoil profits the taliban mgweinbaum egypt politics intrudes on daily life in an unexpected way mirette f mabrouk senior fellow director of egypt program last month s referendum on constitutional amendments in egypt passed with a huge majority almost 90 and little fanfare despite the far reaching ramifications of the amendments and their direct implications for the country s democratic development there was never really any doubt that they would pass there were myriad reasons for this among them the fact that the primary concerns of the majority of egyptians are the economy and security the fact that the current government has managed to pull enough economic and social support rabbits out of the hat to retain its popularity among a diminished but still solid base and the fact that many people were unclear about how the amendments and a new status quo would relate to their daily lives the start of ramadan provided an oblique but illustrative example television viewing peaks during ramadan viewers spend much of the year looking forward to the ramadan soap operas and advertisers in turn sink over 30 of their annual budgets into one month in 2016 advertising spending was over le750 million distributed across almost 30 different programs if you weren t part of the estimated 95 of the population glued to the screen then you caught up over youtube where the media companies that produced the soap operas uploaded the episodes on a daily basis this year however there were no catch up episodes available online this was where the new status quo came in more than half the programs screening this season are produced by a single company synergy it s owned by tamer morsi who also heads egyptian media group which is run by eagle capital an affiliate of the general intelligence service gis eagle capital owns nearly half of egypt s major satellite channels and is part of united group for media services the latter also owns d media which is directly controlled by gis head abbas kamel and a number of other satellite channels as of the beginning of ramadan the state represented by the gis decided to further monetize the programs by restricting them to a streaming service called watch it for those who swallowed the insult and paid their fees injury was heaped on when the new streaming service was hacked and failed to operate properly in an obvious attempt to rectify matters last thursday the platform was offered for free through the end of the month and any unsatisfied customers were promised reimbursement the issue however goes beyond entertainment it demonstrates the extent of the state s grasp over media over the past few years the gis has moved away from arguing with uncooperative or troublesome television hosts to simply buying out their employers the resulting near monopoly may make for a friction free media landscape but it also further minimizes an already shrinking space for expression the majority of egyptians may not be politically active but increasingly they may find that politics will intrude on their daily lives in ways they hadn t counted on mmabrouk algeria election or dialogue first robert s ford senior fellow sunday may 19 was the last day to file candidacies for the planned july 4 presidential election large national street protests took place again on may 17 for the 13th consecutive friday and across algeria protesters denounced the election that they expect will only prolong the existing discredited government system holding the july 4 election appears increasingly difficult if not impossible national machinery operating under the interior ministry churns forward but dozens of municipalities in central algeria have promised not to administer the election and a judges association pledged its members will not oversee the election process as legally required no major political figure has filed to run many political and civil society figures urge the election be postponed in favor of a dialogue between the government and the protest movement and opposition political parties perhaps in the form of a national conference on may 20 three prominent but long retired political figures including a retired general and a former foreign minister with ties to algeria s islamists called for the army leadership to come out from behind the president and prime minister and talk directly with the protest movement three months on however the protest movement still lacks leadership and how the army would negotiate with it is unclear nor has the army leadership shown willingness to compromise one indication of its flexibility would be halting official discussion of the july 4 election president abdelkader bensalah notably did not mention it in an official political statement to algerian students on may 18 another confidence building measure would be release of a leftist opposition leader detained on may 9 on charges of plotting to overthrow the government fordrs58 rising tensions and the oil market rauf mammadov mei scholar an escalation in tensions between the united states and iran has continued to send oil prices higher they were already hovering above 70 a barrel after the trump administration decided against extending a waiver of the economic sanctions it had granted to the main buyers of iranian oil including china and india news of sabotage that damaged oil tankers in fujairah and drone attacks on saudi arabia s pipeline infrastructure put even more upward pressure on prices although the attacks did not disrupt global supply they roiled a market that focuses largely on expectations on top of these developments the decision by the u s state department and exxonmobil to evacuate staff from iraq added to the commotion in the market which was already alarmed about potential supply cuts arising from libya s civil war and the crisis in venezuela with the u s sanctions waivers eliminated iran s oil exports plummeted to half a million barrels a day from 2 7 million a year ago meanwhile an opec committee met sunday to discuss the policy directions the full organization might take at its next meeting in late june in vienna the discussions revealed that moscow and riyadh have a different take on the next step russia thinks opec should boost production by a combined 400 000 barrels per day while saudi arabia is hesitating to commit to an increase in general the market has not panicked over the developments in the middle east this is largely due to riyadh s commitment to adding supply if the market experiences losses oil analysts worry that the protracted civil war in libya the continuing crisis in venezuela and the failure of opec to reach a new production agreement could reduce world supply to a level that is beyond saudi arabia s capacity to offset raufnmammadov photo ahmad al rubaye afp getty images

s resolve not to let the yuan fall too fast and breach the 7 per dollar level given some evidence beijing has been selling u s treasury bonds in favor of gold many are wondering if china will use a weaker yuan both as a bargaining chip and a means to offset higher tariffs on its exports but weaponizing the yuan has its downside aside from capital flight and the hit to local banks a yuan plunge

this is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated chicago thank you thank you so very much i stand here as your mayor humble and hopeful honored to be the 56th mayor in the history of this great city we are a proud city with a proud history in this moment i cannot help but look at all of you and think about what lies ahead and what we can be together i m looking ahead to a city of safe streets and strong schools for every child regardless of neighborhood or zip code a city where people want to grow old and not flee a city of sanctuary against fear where no one must hide in the shadows a city that is affordable for families and seniors and where every job pays a living wage a city of fairness and hope and prosperity for the many not just for the few a city that holds equity and inclusion as our guiding principles chicago is not where my story began but from the moment i arrived in hyde park to attend law school and begin my career this city felt like where i belonged it s where i met the love of my life my wife amy it s where our daughter vivian was born and where she s growing up into the kind curious and spirited young woman i always knew she would be for me this has been a city of opportunity it s been a city of hope as i stand here today i can t help but think of where i came from and i know in my heart that a story like mine of a kid from a working class family growing up to realize the dreams of my father and mother through education hard work and sheer determination needs to be the story of possibility in every neighborhood kids who look like me and come from families like mine shouldn t have to beat the odds to get an education pursue their passions or build a family black and brown kids low income kids every kid in this city should grow up knowing they can pursue anything they can love anyone that s my chicago dream i know we re just a little bit closer to that dream as i stand here today inaugurated as chicago s first black woman and first openly gay mayor i know we re a little bit closer as we celebrate that for the first time in the history of chicago women of color now hold all three of our city wide elected offices i congratulate you city clerk anna valencia and city treasurer melissa conyears ervin on your inaugurations your victories and on all you ve overcome to reach this historic moment i also congratulate the aldermen of the chicago city council in particular the 12 aldermen who are taking their seats for the first time i thank mayor emanuel for his dedication and service to our city which was exemplified by the attention and time that he and his staff devoted to making this transition as smooth as possible i also commend amy rule for her contributions to the city join me in wishing them both well as they head off into the next chapter of their lives i also acknowledge and thank the other leaders here today governor jb pritzker lieutenant governor juliana stratton senator dick durbin senator tammy duckworth our illinois congressional delegation cook county board president toni preckwinkle representatives from our state legislature and every other elected official here today thank you for your continued service most importantly thank you to the people of chicago who had the courage to put their faith in a newcomer and the optimism to join this moment we stand today at a time of great hope and possibility and i can t help but feel the spirit of the great mayor harold washington here with us this morning now there s one person you are about to meet who laid the foundation for everything that i am today i want to introduce you to a former elected official with us today a one time school board member from my hometown of massillon ohio she s my role model my champion the woman whose dreams and high expectations for me propelled me through life my mother ann lightfoot my mom is 90 years old forgive me for that one mom and doesn t travel much these days but nothing could keep her or my siblings derrick angela brian and stacey from being here today my mother and my late father elijah gave us the best they could in the segregated ohio steel town where we grew up even when they had almost nothing left to give as parents they led by example they instilled in me a clear set of values loyalty to family friends and community and the importance of hard work education and integrity and mom most importantly you and dad told me that i could be anything i wanted to be that i could not be held back by my race gender or family financial status that i should hold my head high and not let anyone else dictate the course of my future that no goal was out of reach that no victory was too unlikely to pursue i feel dad s presence with us today my gratitude to you both has no limit just like when i was a little girl i m working hard to make you proud to honor your sacrifice to live by the values you instilled in me to make sure that families like ours don t have to struggle like we did i look out today and see a proud city with a proud history here in chicago right here our people invented the skyscraper and the ferris wheel here our people invented our own chicago blues our people generations of industrious hardworking people who built one of the greatest cities to ever grace god s earth i stand here today as your mayor humble and hopeful and i make one solemn promise to the generations who came before us and to the generations who come after us we will continue to build this great city and leave it better stronger fairer and more prosperous than we found it the challenges we face today did not arise overnight and they will not be solved overnight and they certainly won t be solved by one mayor acting alone in this important moment let us remember the powerful words of chicago s poet laureate gwendolyn brooks we are each other s harvest she said we are each other s business we are each other s magnitude and bond folks we are and must be in this together our challenges can only be solved if we face them together we cannot fail we will not fail we are chicago i also remember so many people i ve met in this city who can t be here today the big guy who came to hear me speak and then followed outside on a cold blustery day on the southeast side and pleaded lori just bring us jobs just bring us jobs we want to work the teenagers i met on the south side kicked out of their homes and left on the streets at night in the bitter cold with no food and no shelter just because they are gay or trans the father on the west side who told me he was scared scared to death every time his three daughters left the house those girls are his whole world and he s worried somebody is going to gun them down the countless number of people whose daily fear is that ice would come for them as they took their kids to school stood as day laborers or just walked in their neighborhoods we should never forget that these are the people who put us here we are each other s business and standing up for them is our business our only business there are four stars on chicago s flag each standing for a point in our history the construction of fort dearborn the great expositions of 1893 and 1933 and the reconstruction of our city following the great chicago fire each star stands for building and rebuilding today we proudly reinterpret these four stars new meaning for a new century with new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead guiding our city and guiding our new administration as we move forward and rebuild again today we reimagine the first star standing for safety in every neighborhood people cannot and should not live in neighborhoods that resemble a war zone enough of the shootings enough of the guns enough of the violence let s unite in our response to the biggest challenge we face the epidemic of gun violence that devastates families shatters communities buries dreams and holds children hostage to fear in their own homes it inflicts life long trauma that spreads through our communities like a virus when we hear of a random bullet cutting a life short people across the city from all ages and all walks of life begin to wonder if chicago is a place where they can continue to live and raise their children some have already answered the question by moving away particularly from the hardest hit communities the mass exodus we have seen particularly in the black community saps the vitality of our great city we must reverse the exodus by creating the reality of safety in every neighborhood public safety must not be a commodity that is only available to the wealthy what this means for me is that there is no higher calling than restoring safety and peace in our neighborhoods we will develop a new proactive strategy in partnership with the communities hit hardest by the scourge of gun violence all of our stakeholders must be committed to this work this is not a challenge that can be solved by law enforcement alone nor will we ever place the blame on people in communities who are under siege no this greatest challenge demands all of us united together and i promise you the city will lead and we ve already begun this work to lead the citywide response we are creating a mayor s office of public safety to be led by a deputy mayor that office will be charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive violence prevention strategy that will connect efforts across city government other aspects of the public sector and nonprofit philanthropic education recreation business and faith communities it will seek to mobilize the entire city behind a unified strategy to prevent violence and promote public safety and while we will specifically address gun violence we will not limit our efforts there the devastation of violence is far and wide which is why we will also reach out and support the growing community of victims and witnesses we must recognize the importance of providing a transition for our returning citizens and we will accelerate the development of a trauma informed city starting with repairing our broken mental health safety net we will also continue the hard but essential work of forging partnerships between police officers and the community premised on mutual respect accountability and a recognition that the destinies of police and community are inextricably intertwined one simply cannot succeed without the other and to all of our brave first responders we will not leave you behind either you deserve not only our respect but our commitment to train you better provide the best quality supervision available and wellness support to address the trauma that you face every day these are critical pieces of police reform and accountability we are each other s business we are each other s neighbors and together we will work tirelessly to bring peace to this city our second guiding star is education we cannot attract families to chicago and keep families here without providing a quality public education for every child and that means every single child as a city we make promises to our children as well most of all we promise them an education a safe relevant and challenging education that prepares them for meaningful work civic engagement and life long learning but whether we deliver on that promise often depends on where you happen to live it s time to give every child and young person a good education to prove through our schools that we believe in them that we support them no matter who they are or where they live that every child gets a quality education that s our business no matter what someone said to me recently that children are a product of the adult ecosystem around them and she was 100 percent right our words our values how we meet our commitments and rise to the occasion it all matters we re shaping the future leaders of our city and when we put equity first in our education system when we make good on a promise that every kid matters it will instill within our children the values we seek to foster in our city as a whole that promise must begin early that s why we will work to expand early childhood education and extend the promise of a good education through high school and college and to every kid no matter their path forward every student should have the option to pursue vocational and technical training we will work with businesses and unions to set up apprenticeships for those who want to learn a trade we will then connect chicago s employers with our job ready students while they re in school so they can get to work the day they graduate and we will support our great teachers counselors librarians nurses and other support personnel who are essential to creating the safe and nurturing environment necessary for our children to grow learn and thrive let me also say that i m thrilled to see so many young people in the audience my next few words are for you and all of your peers across the city you have the most at stake in the city s future just as the city s future most depends on you we need your energy creativity intelligence and dedication there s hard work ahead of us but we will do that work because we believe you and in the vast still untapped potential of this great city our goal is simple starting in our schools we will create a citywide workforce as the pipeline for jobs of today and tomorrow that will be the envy of the world we are each other s business and we must meet our educational challenges together the third of our guiding stars is stability to be true to the notion of stability we must start with getting our fiscal house in order over many many years chicago dug itself into a giant financial hole we have an outsize structural deficit a persistent and growing pension debt and other costs that that threatens our financial stability we are spending a significant percentage of every dollar just to service our pension debt alone and too much of that money is being sent to banks and wall street bond firms instead of going to our rebuild our neighborhoods reduce our property taxes and revitalize our transportation system we must tackle this problem head on my team has already been the necessary work of measuring the size and depth of our fiscal challenges as well as working on a range of possible solutions once that analysis is complete we will lay out a plan to put chicago on the path to solvency no doubt some hard choices will have to be made and none of this is going to be easy but we will do the hard work with transparency integrity and a determination to put our pensions on a true path to solvency and make our government work more efficiently and without balancing budgets on the backs of low wage and working class chicagoans and we will get there because we must stability also means that we must build housing that is affordable for more people including families long term residents whether homeowners or renters should not be forced out of their neighborhoods when it goes through a period of transformation and developers can no longer skip their responsibilities by taking tax dollars but leaving it to someone else to solve our affordable housing crisis here too the city must lead we need to cut the red tape and obstacles and instead promote the building of new units and have flexibility in our building code so that innovative housing forms can come on line we must also have a plan for expanding home ownership and converting vacant lots and abandoned buildings into new vibrant communities growth of housing that is affordable all over this city will be the charge of the new housing department under new leadership stability also means support for our business community large and small strong businesses growing businesses new businesses mean jobs for people and stability for the city we need fairness which means paying as much attention to our neighborhood businesses as we do to the businesses downtown our neighborhoods have been neglected for too long they cannot be anymore still we should never settle for dividing up a shrinking pie or pitting one part of this city against another chicago is the economic engine of illinois and the whole midwest as with everything we are each other s business we need to grow and grow and grow together our fourth star must be integrity i know i know putting chicago government and integrity in the same sentence is well a little strange but that s going to change it s got to change for years they ve said chicago ain t ready for reform well get ready because reform is here i campaigned on change you voted for change and i plan to deliver change to our government that means restoring trust in our city s government and finally bringing some real integrity to the way this city works it means making sure we have a government that actually works for people not a powerful few it s about the real harm done to our families and businesses when those with power and money cash in at our expense when public officials cut shady backroom deals they get rich and the rest of us get the bill when some people get their property taxes cut in exchange for campaign cash they get the money and sure enough we get the bill the family with the bungalow the lady who runs the hair salon the guy who owns the store on the corner they aren t big or powerful or well connected but they end up paying these practices have gone on here for decades this practice breeds corruption stopping it isn t just in the city s interest it s in the city council s own interest no official in the city of chicago elected or appointed should ever profit from his or her office never ever this requirement that people must give more to get access to basic city services must end and it will end starting today later this afternoon i will sign an executive order to end the worst abuses of so called aldermanic privilege this does not mean our aldermen won t have power in their communities it does not mean our aldermen won t be able to make sure the streetlights are working or the parking signs are in the right place or any of the thousands of good things they do for people every day it simply means ending their unilateral unchecked control over on every single thing that goes on their wards alderman will have a voice not a veto it s time for a new era of trust between the people of chicago and the government that serves them when our poet said we are each other s bond that s what she meant as i stand here today georgia is also on my mind as is alabama and every other state that is enacting laws intended to deprive women of our rights me must stand with women all across our country who fear for their basic rights and feel powerless in the face of the hateful legislation designed to control our bodies our choices we cannot go back not in chicago not as a nation we will join together and we will fight and there s something else we must do for ourselves and our posterity we will establish a new social compact here in chicago based on a simple principle shared by every major religion in the world it goes by many names in buddhism it says hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful in the quran it says whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind it is in the torah and again in the new testament it is called the great commandment love thy neighbor as thyself today too many of our people lack decent housing and far too many end up on our streets today too many of our people feel isolated and alone and as our senior population increases we must meet the needs of those without family or friends for support today as we prepare to enter the third decade of the twenty first century one out of every five children in chicago still lives in poverty addressing the problems of housing isolation and poverty in our great city is just as important as anything else we may do and far harder to solve but tackle these problems we must i heard a century old hymn in church the other day a song that i know from my youth of so many sundays sitting in church listening to the working class people in my congregation who toiled in factories kitchens or outside and came to the church for a respite from their otherwise hard days we sang this song pass me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling do not pass me by in that moment it was our plea to god to shine his light on us and relieve us from our heavy labors as i reflect on this day and what lies ahead it means that we must not forget or ignore the plight of so many for whom joy often does not come in the morning whether it is the homeless people living with mental illness those desperate for love and recognition we will not pass them by as we pursue our new stars this will be our guiding light to those who are alone we are with you to those who need a home we will shelter you for those who have little we will do much we see you we hear you we are your neighbors and so help me we will not pass you by i stand before you representing tens of thousands of people from all over the city who daily contribute their time talent and resources in the cause of making a difference not just to day but if we are bold our collective efforts will resonate for years to come our people friends and neighbors known and unknown at the block level in our places of worship in our community organizations and just individuals who want to make a difference have stepped up and contributed mightily to what is the greatness of the city i will have the privilege of leading but clearly a single leader cannot heal all the ails us a single leader cannot by herself conquer all of the challenges that would be present on day one we all have to be part of that solution we all must make the sacrifices necessary to identify problems and forge solutions and my friends we must not merely depend on the politicians the preachers the police the teachers the activists and others to show us the way we can no longer continue to cede control of our destiny to someone else each of us needs to ask what can i do what contributions can i make you may not be the richest the smartest or even the most able but ask yourself are you ready to serve in some way because our city surely needs you what has been the most amazing and humbling part of the experience in a journey that i have traveled particularly over these last few months is the tremendous hope and optimism that i am feeling from people all over the city my friends it is that message of hope and possibility that should get all of us up in the morning start us on our way and bring all of us together with the excitement and promise born of harnessing our collective energies to move forward together our challenges are great there s no mistaking that but if we follow these four stars safety schooling stability and integrity we can once again become a city that families want to move to not run away from no matter who you are no matter where you live no matter your circumstance in life chicago is now on a mission to include you to join hands with you to share power with you and to give you reason to believe that we can all pull in the same direction to make chicago better together and if we follow the great commandment together as neighbors our great city will shine god bless you and god bless chicago

file photo argentina s former president cristina fernandez de kirchner waves to supporters after the presentation of her book sinceramente at the buenos aires book fair in buenos aires argentina may 9 2019 reuters agustin marcarian file photo by cassandra garrison buenos aires reuters argentine markets rattled during recent months by rising political uncertainty could get a reprieve after the populist ex leader seen as challenger no 1 in this year s presidential elections said she would instead run on someone else s ticket cristina fernandez de kirchner a former president who has an ardent support base but is unloved by global investors surprised locals and international observers alike on saturday by saying she would run as vice president alongside former cabinet chief alberto fernandez a veteran political operator who has both backed and criticized her in the past economists said the move could temper the self styled populist s more contentious policies even if it was also a clever ploy to return to power after struggling to win over the more moderate wing of the broad peronist opposition that would likely be a balm for markets ahead of elections in october the reemergence of the divisive ex president who had been climbing in the polls as incumbent mauricio macri stumbled over a biting recession and high inflation had hammered the peso currency and caused bond yields to spike i think the market will react well because this is basically a recognition of weakness on the part of cristina kirchner said ilya gofshteyn a senior emerging markets strategist at standard chartered bank in new york she wouldn t be running as a vice president if she thought she could win as president cristina fernandez is considered by investors to be a riskier prospect because of her past populist policies she introduced currency controls and tax increases on farm exports while in office between 2007 and 2015 alberto fernandez criticized her management after he resigned from her administration in 2008 and forged ties with other factions of peronism opposed to her ruling party j p morgan said in a note that past criticism could actually help the running pair if it assuaged people s fears that the lower profile alberto fernandez would simply be a figurehead with his deputy holding the real power in a government it is the president who makes the decisions alberto fernandez told local media on saturday responding to suggestions he would be a puppet of the former leader who still commands raucous crowds others however said that if markets sensed a political upheaval even one without cristina fernandez at the helm it could create volatility there will be some negative reaction with an upward exchange rate and some stocks and bonds dropping said argentine economic analyst gustavo neffa at research for traders however the election race is still very open so there can be changes the unexpected ticket could also win support from more moderate peronists who may not have voted for cristina fernandez herself and with annual inflation at above 55 job losses mounting and a tumbling peso hard hit voters are open to change is aiming to capture that more moderate segment that does not approve of macri s management mariel fornoni a political analyst for argentinian consultancy management and fit told reuters macri a free market advocate has worked to boost economic activity in the previously closed economy but is struggling to reverse an economic crisis he negotiated a 56 3 billion financing deal with the international monetary fund last year the crisis has contributed to uncertainty among investors who feared political upheaval if macri lost to cristina fernandez opening the door to defaults and debt restructuring gofshteyn said there was still time for a strong third candidate to emerge but he didn t believe investors would give the same weight to cristina fernandez s vice presidential candidacy as they would to her as a potential president there is this idea that you can somehow transfer your popularity to another candidate but that s just not the way it works name recognition matters a lot he said reporting by cassandra garrison additional reporting by gabriel burin and nicolas misculin editing by adam jourdan and daniel wallis

the latest janus henderson global dividend index underlying growth of 7 5 followed the same trend as large special dividends were offset by negative exchange rate effects global dividends shrugged off concerns over global economic growth rising 7 8 to a first quarter record of us 263 3bn underlying growth was 7 5 with the impact of large special dividend payments offset by exchange rate moves janus henderson global dividend index rose to a record 190 1 no change in 2019 forecast as higher special dividends are offset by the strength of the us dollar janus henderson expects a record us 1 43 trillion in payments this year up 4 2 in headline terms or 5 2 on an underlying basis the janus henderson global dividend index rose to a record 190 1 meaning that dividends are now almost twice the level they were a decade ago when the index started at the end of 2009 all time quarterly records were broken in the united states and canada which are less affected by seasonal payment changes growth in north america was the fastest in the world on an underlying basis and its seasonally large weighting in the first quarter meant it made a significant contribution to overall global dividend growth in the us dividends totalled a record us 122 5bn up 8 3 on a headline basis with underlying growth even better at 9 6 us growth has exceeded the global average 70 of the time over the last five years as company profits have benefitted from a robust economy and favourable tax changes almost nine tenths of us companies in our index raised their dividends with the largest increases coming from the banking sector the first quarter sees relatively few dividends paid in europe seasonal patterns mean switzerland and spain are overrepresented while france and germany make only a small contribution headline growth of 9 2 in europe was boosted by special dividends underlying growth of 5 3 was in line with 2018 performance in the uk underlying growth of 4 4 lagged the global average in q1 but was in line with the uk s long run trend asia pacific ex japan has seen the world s strongest dividend growth since 2009 thanks to rising profits and expanding payout ratios the q1 total of us 18 1bn was up 14 7 year on year on a headline basis breaking the record for first quarter payouts though this was mainly due to one offs in a seasonally quiet quarter for dividends underlying growth was a more modest 3 8 with hong kong leading the way while australia lagged behind income investors in japan have enjoyed growth far ahead of the global average over the last five years as more japanese companies have embraced a dividend paying culture dividends are 70 higher than in 2014 compared to 25 for the rest of the world this strong performance continued in the first quarter with underlying growth of 8 7 emerging markets were weaker than their developed counterparts as they were the first to feel the effects of tighter us monetary policy and global trade concerns both in their exchange rates and in company profitability underlying growth was 2 2 due largely to strong performance from india at the sector level pharmaceutical stocks were the largest payers contributing us 1 of every us 8 paid globally the sector delivered an all time record of us 30 1bn though its underlying growth rate was lower than the global average the much smaller leisure sector also delivered a record level of payments boosted by a large special dividend from the uk s intercontinental hotels on an underlying basis financial dividends grew fastest thanks in particular to us banks and real estate companies while oil dividends also bounced back up by a tenth year on year thanks to higher oil prices for the full year janus henderson expects global dividends to reach a record us 1 43 trillion up 4 2 in headline terms and 5 2 on an underlying basis higher special dividends than originally expected janus henderson s base case assumes each year that they revert to the longer run average are

2019 this reflects a continuation of the robust growth witnessed in 2018 rather than necessarily setting the tone for another above trend year in 2019 market expectations for corporate earnings have moderated in recent months as global economic momentum has slowed and forecasts may yet come down a bit further dividends are a lagging indicator of company health so a reduction in their rate of increase is a normal consequence of slower earnings growth nevertheless we do not yet feel the need to make changes to our dividend forecast for 2019 we have already allowed for a slowdown in growth this year and would highlight that dividends are far less volatile than earnings this is one of the major benefits for income investors a diversified portfolio of equities can provide a stable flow of dividends that can grow over the long term even when earnings and financial markets are experiencing some volatility we believe investors can therefore look forward to dividend growth of around 4 5 in 2019 and another record year for dividend payments notes to editors methodology each year janus henderson analyses dividends paid by the 1 200 largest firms by market capitalisation at 12 31 before the start of each year dividends are included in the model on the date they are paid dividends are calculated gross using the share count prevailing on the pay date this is an approximation because companies in practice fix the exchange rate a little before the pay date and converted to usd using the prevailing exchange rate where a scrip dividend is offered investors are assumed to opt 100 for cash this will slightly overstate the cash paid out but we believe this is the most proactive approach to treat scrip dividends in most markets it makes no material difference though in some particularly in european markets the effect is greater spain is a particular case in point the model takes no account of free floats since it is aiming to capture the dividend paying capacity of the world s largest listed companies without regard for their shareholder base we have estimated dividends for stocks outside the top 1 200 using the average value of these payments compared to the large cap dividends over the five year period sourced from quoted yield data this means they are estimated at a fixed proportion of 12 7 of total global dividends from the top 1 200 and therefore in our model grow at the same rate this means we do not need to make unsubstantiated assumptions about the rate of growth of these smaller company dividends all raw data was provided by exchange data

life my wife amy it s where our daughter vivian was born and where she s growing up into the kind curious and spirited young woman i always knew she would be for me this has been a city of opportunity it s been a city of hope as i stand here today i can t help but think of where i came from and i know in my heart that a story like mine of a kid from a working class family growing up to realize the dreams of my father and mother through education hard work and sheer determination needs to be the story of possibility in every neighborhood kids who look like me and come from families like mine shouldn t have to beat the odds to get an education pursue their passions or build a family black and brown kids low income kids every kid in this city should grow up knowing they can pursue anything they can love anyone that s my chicago dream i know we re just a little bit closer to that dream as i stand here today inaugurated as chicago s first black woman and first openly gay mayor i know we

feel the spirit of the great mayor harold washington here with us this morning now there s one person you are about to meet who laid the foundation for everything that i am today i want to introduce you to a former elected official with us today a one time school board member from my hometown of massillon ohio she s my role model my champion the woman whose dreams and high expectations for me propelled me through life my mother ann lightfoot my mom is 90 years old forgive me for that one mom and doesn t travel much these days but nothing could keep her or my siblings derrick angela brian and stacey from being here today my mother and my late father elijah gave us the best they could in the segregated ohio steel town where we grew up even when they had almost nothing left to give as parents they led by example they instilled in me a clear set of values loyalty to family friends and community and the importance of hard work education and integrity and mom most importantly you and dad told me that i could be anything i wanted to be that i could not be held back by my race gender or family financial status that i should hold my head high and not let anyone else dictate the course of my future that no goal was out of reach that no victory was too unlikely to pursue i feel dad s presence with us today my gratitude to you both has no limit just like when i was a little girl i m working hard to make you proud to honor your sacrifice to live by the values you instilled in me to make sure that families like ours don t have to struggle like we did i look out today and see a proud city with a proud history here in chicago right here our people invented the skyscraper and the ferris wheel here our people invented our own chicago blues our people generations of industrious hardworking people who built one of the greatest cities to ever grace god s earth i stand here today as your mayor humble and hopeful and i make one solemn promise to the generations who came before us and to the generations who come after us we will continue to build this great city and leave it better stronger fairer and more prosperous than we found it the challenges we face today did not arise overnight and they will not be solved overnight and they certainly won t be solved by one mayor acting alone in this important moment let us remember the powerful words of chicago s poet laureate gwendolyn brooks we are each other s harvest she said we are each other s business we are each other s magnitude and bond folks we are and must be in this together our challenges can only be solved if we face them together we cannot fail we will not fail we are chicago i also remember so many people i ve met in this city who can t be here today the big guy who came to hear me speak and then followed outside on a cold blustery day on the southeast side and pleaded lori just bring us jobs just bring us jobs we want to work the teenagers i met on the south side kicked out of their homes and left on the streets at night in the bitter cold with no food and no shelter just because they are gay or trans the father on the west side who told me he was scared scared to death every time his three daughters left the house those girls are his whole world and he s worried somebody is going to gun them down the countless number of people whose daily fear is that ice would come for them as they took their kids to school stood as day laborers or just walked in their neighborhoods we should never forget that these are the people who put us here we are each other s business and standing up for them is our business our only business there are four stars on chicago s flag each standing for a point in our history the construction of fort dearborn the great expositions of 1893 and 1933 and the reconstruction of our city following the great chicago fire each star stands for building and rebuilding today we proudly reinterpret these four stars new meaning for a new century with new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead guiding our city and guiding our new administration as we move forward and rebuild again today we reimagine the first star standing for safety in every neighborhood people cannot and should not live in neighborhoods that resemble a war zone enough of the shootings enough of the guns enough of the violence let s unite in our response to the biggest challenge we face the epidemic of gun violence that devastates families shatters communities buries dreams and holds children hostage to fear in their own homes it inflicts life long trauma that spreads through our communities like a virus when we hear of a random bullet cutting a life short people across the city from all ages and all walks of life begin to wonder if chicago is a place where they can continue to live and raise their children some have already answered the question by moving away particularly from the hardest hit communities the mass exodus we have seen particularly in the black community saps the vitality of our great city we must reverse the exodus by creating the reality of safety in every neighborhood public safety must not be a commodity that is only available to the wealthy what this means for me is that there is no higher calling than restoring safety and peace in our neighborhoods we will develop a new proactive strategy in partnership with the communities hit hardest by the scourge of gun violence all of our stakeholders must be committed to this work this is not a challenge that can be solved by law enforcement alone nor will we ever place the blame on people in communities who are under siege no this greatest challenge demands all of us united together and i promise you the city will lead and we ve already begun this work to lead the citywide response we are creating a mayor s office of public safety to be led by a deputy mayor that office will be charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive violence prevention strategy that will connect efforts across city government other aspects of the public sector and nonprofit philanthropic education recreation business and faith communities it will seek to mobilize the entire city behind a unified strategy to prevent violence and promote public safety and while we will specifically address gun violence we will not limit our efforts there the devastation of violence is far and wide which is why we will also reach out and support the growing community of victims and witnesses we must recognize the importance of providing a transition for our returning citizens and we will accelerate the development of a trauma informed city starting with repairing our broken mental health safety net we will also continue the hard but essential work of forging partnerships between police officers and the community premised on mutual respect accountability and a recognition that the destinies of police and community are inextricably intertwined one simply cannot succeed without the other and to all of our brave first responders we will not leave you behind either you deserve not only our respect but our commitment to train you better provide the best quality supervision available and wellness support to address the trauma that you face every day these are critical pieces of police reform and accountability we are each other s business we are each other s neighbors and together we will work tirelessly to bring peace to this city our second guiding star is education we cannot attract families to chicago and keep families here without providing a quality public education for every child and that means every single child as a city we make promises to our children as well most of all we promise them an education a safe relevant and challenging education that prepares them for meaningful work civic engagement and life long learning but whether we deliver on that promise often depends on where you happen to live it s time to give every child and young person a good education to prove through our schools that we believe in them that we support them no matter who they are or where they live that every child gets a quality education that s our business no matter what someone said to me recently that children are a product of the adult ecosystem around them and she was 100 percent right our words our values how we meet our commitments and rise to the occasion it all matters we re shaping the future leaders of our city and when we put equity first in our education system when we make good on a promise that every kid matters it will instill within our children the values we seek to foster in our city as a whole that promise must begin early that s why we will work to expand early childhood education and extend the promise of a good education through high school and college and to every kid no matter their path forward every student should have the option to pursue vocational and technical training we will work with businesses and unions to set up apprenticeships for those who want to learn a trade we will then connect chicago s employers with our job ready students while they re in school so they can get to work the day they graduate and we will support our great teachers counselors librarians nurses and other support personnel who are essential to creating the safe and nurturing environment necessary for our children to grow learn and thrive let me also say that i m thrilled to see so many young people in the audience my next few words are for you and all of your peers across the city you have the most at stake in the city s future just as the city s future most depends on you we need your energy creativity intelligence and dedication there s hard work ahead of us but we will do that work because we believe you and in the vast still untapped potential of this great city our goal is simple starting in our schools we will create a citywide workforce as the pipeline for jobs of today and tomorrow that will be the envy of the world we are each other s business and we must meet our educational challenges together the third of our guiding stars is stability to be true to the notion of stability we must start with getting our fiscal house in order over many many years chicago dug itself into a giant financial hole we have an outsize structural deficit a persistent and growing pension debt and other costs that that threatens our financial stability we are spending a significant percentage of every dollar just to service our pension debt alone and too much of that money is being sent to banks and wall street bond firms instead of going to our rebuild our neighborhoods reduce our property taxes and revitalize our transportation system we must tackle this problem head on my team has already been the necessary work of measuring the size and depth of our fiscal challenges as well as working on a range of possible solutions once that analysis is complete we will lay out a plan to put chicago on the path to solvency no doubt some hard choices will have to be made and none of this is going to be easy but we will do the hard work with transparency integrity and a determination to put our pensions on a true path to solvency and make our government work more efficiently and without balancing budgets on the backs of low wage and working class chicagoans and we will get there because we must stability also means that we must build housing that is affordable for more people including families long term residents whether homeowners or renters should not be forced out of their neighborhoods when it goes through a period of transformation and developers can no longer skip their responsibilities by taking tax dollars but leaving it to someone else to solve our affordable housing crisis here too the city must lead we need to cut the red tape and obstacles and instead promote the building of new units and have flexibility in our building code so that innovative housing forms can come on line we must also have a plan for expanding home ownership and converting vacant lots and abandoned buildings into new vibrant communities growth of housing that is affordable all over this city will be the charge of the new housing department under new leadership stability also means support for our business community large and small strong businesses growing businesses new businesses mean jobs for people and stability for the city we need fairness which means paying as much attention to our neighborhood businesses as we do to the businesses downtown our neighborhoods have been neglected for too long they cannot be anymore still we should never settle for dividing up a shrinking pie or pitting one part of this city against another chicago is the economic engine of illinois and the whole midwest as with everything we are each other s business we need to grow and grow and grow together our fourth star must be integrity i know i know putting chicago government and integrity in the same sentence is well a little strange but that s going to change it s got to change for years they ve said chicago ain t ready for reform well get ready because reform is here i campaigned on change you voted for change and i plan to deliver change to our government that means restoring trust in our city s government and finally bringing some real integrity to the way this city works it means making sure we have a government that actually works for people not a powerful few it s about the real harm done to our families and businesses when those with power and money cash in at our expense when public officials cut shady backroom deals they get rich and the rest of us get the bill when some people get their property taxes cut in exchange for campaign cash they get the money and sure enough we get the bill the family with the bungalow the lady who runs the hair salon the guy who owns the store on the corner they aren t big or powerful or well connected but they end up paying these practices have gone on here for decades this practice breeds corruption stopping it isn t just in the city s interest it s in the city council s own interest no official in the city of chicago elected or appointed should ever profit from his or her office never ever this requirement that people must give more to get access to basic city services must end and it will end starting today later this afternoon i will sign an executive order to end the worst abuses of so called aldermanic privilege this does not mean our aldermen won t have power in their communities it does not mean our aldermen won t be able to make sure the streetlights are working or the parking signs are in the right place or any of the thousands of good things they do for people every day it simply means ending their unilateral unchecked control over on every single thing that goes on their wards alderman will have a voice not a veto it s time for a new era of trust between the people of chicago and the government that serves them when our poet said we are each other s bond that s what she meant as i stand here today georgia is also on my mind as is alabama and every other state that is enacting laws intended to deprive women of our rights me must stand with women all across our country who fear for their basic rights and feel powerless in the face of the hateful legislation designed to control our bodies our choices we cannot go back not in chicago not as a nation we will join together and we will fight and there s something else we must do for ourselves and our posterity we will establish a new social compact here in chicago based on a simple principle shared by every major religion in the world it goes by many names in buddhism it says hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful in the quran it says whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind it is in the torah and again in the new testament it is called the great commandment love thy neighbor as thyself today too many of our people lack decent housing and far too many end up on our streets today too many of our people feel isolated and alone and as our senior population increases we must meet the needs of those without family or friends for support today as we prepare to enter the third decade of the twenty first century one out of every five children in chicago still lives in poverty addressing the problems of housing isolation and poverty in our great city is just as important as anything else we may do and far harder to solve but tackle these problems we must i heard a century old hymn in church the other day a song that i know from my youth of so many sundays sitting in church listening to the working class people in my congregation who toiled in factories kitchens or outside and came to the church for a respite from their otherwise hard days we sang this song pass me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling do not pass me by in that moment it was our plea to god to shine his light on us and relieve us from our heavy labors as i reflect on this day and what lies ahead it means that we must not forget or ignore the plight of so many for whom joy often does not come in the morning whether it is the homeless people living with mental illness those desperate for love and recognition we will not pass them by as we pursue our new stars this will be our guiding light to those who are alone we are with you to those who need a home we will shelter you for those who have little we will do much we see you we hear you we are your neighbors and so help me we will not pass you by i stand before you representing tens of thousands of people from all over the city who daily contribute their time talent and resources in the cause of making a difference not just to day but if we are bold our collective efforts will resonate for years to come our people friends and neighbors known and unknown at the block level in our places of worship in our community organizations and just individuals who want to make a difference have stepped up and contributed mightily to what is the greatness of the city i will have the privilege of leading but clearly a single leader cannot heal all the ails us a single leader cannot by herself conquer all of the challenges that would be present on day one we all have to be part of that solution we all must make the sacrifices necessary to identify problems and forge solutions and my friends we must not merely depend on the politicians the preachers the police the teachers the activists and others to show us the way we can no longer continue to cede control of our destiny to someone else each of us needs to ask what can i do what contributions can i make you may not be the richest the smartest or even the most able but ask yourself are you ready to serve in some way because our city surely needs you what has been the most amazing and humbling part of the experience in a journey that i have traveled particularly over these last few months is the tremendous hope and optimism that i am feeling from people all over the city my friends it is that message of hope and possibility that should get all of us up in the morning start us on our way and bring all of us together with the excitement and promise born of harnessing our collective energies to move forward together our challenges are great there s no mistaking that but if we follow these four stars safety schooling stability and integrity we can once again become a city that families want to move to not run away from no matter who you are no matter where you live no matter your circumstance in life chicago is now on a mission to include you to join hands with you to share power with you and to give you reason to believe that we can all pull in the same direction to make chicago better together and if we follow the great commandment together as neighbors our great city will shine god bless you and god bless chicago related stories incoming chicago mayor has path to historic police reforms lightfoot rewards reform and old guard alderman in council

by hope yen and calvin woodward associated press washington ap president donald trump is using treason rather lightly as he assails unidentified u s officials for investigating operatives of his campaign in 2016 there s no allegation or even suggestion that they committed this punishable by death crime if any crime at all trump s hyperbolic characterization echoed at the end of a week of unsupported assertions by the president on trade the economy drug prices and more meantime russian president vladimir putin declared inaccurately that no traces of collusion between his country and trump s 2016 campaign were found in the exotic special counsel investigation by robert mueller a recap russia investigation trump my campaign for president was conclusively spied on nothing like this has ever happened in american politics a really bad situation treason means long jail sentences and this was treason tweet friday and retweet saturday the facts it wasn t treason indeed his officials have said they have no specific evidence that anything illegal was done when the trump campaign came under fbi surveillance that was approved by a court treason only occurs when a u s citizen or a non citizen on u s territory wages war against the country or provides material support to a declared enemy of the united states nothing of that sort has been alleged let alone anything illegal in the surveillance fbi director chris wray told congress this month that he did not consider the fbi surveillance to be spying and that he has no evidence the fbi illegally monitored trump s campaign during the 2016 election wray said he would not describe the fbi s surveillance as spying if it s following investigative policies and procedures his comments irritated trump attorney general william barr has said he believed spying did occur but he also made clear at a senate hearing last month that he had no specific evidence to cite that any surveillance was illegal or improper the fbi obtained a secret surveillance warrant in 2016 to monitor the communications of former trump campaign aide carter page the new york times also reported that the fbi used a woman posing as a research assistant to approach ex trump campaign adviser george papadopoulos who had earlier been told by a maltese professor that russia had dirt on democrat hillary clinton in the form of stolen emails putin however exotic the work of special counsel mueller was i have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between russia and the incumbent administration which we said was absolutely fake remarks tuesday before a private meeting with secretary of state mike pompeo in sochi russia the facts putin is wrong about the mueller report in regards to its findings of collusion the mueller report and other scrutiny revealed a multitude of meetings between trump associates and russians among them donald trump jr s meeting with a russian lawyer who had promised dirt on hillary clinton on collusion mueller said he did not assess whether that occurred because it is not a legal term he looked into a potential criminal conspiracy between russia and the trump campaign and said the investigation did not collect sufficient evidence to establish criminal charges on that front mueller noted some trump campaign officials had declined to testify under the fifth amendment or had provided false or incomplete testimony making it difficult to get a complete picture of what happened during the 2016 campaign the special counsel wrote that he cannot rule out the possibility that unavailable information could have cast a different light on the investigation s findings california wildfires trump on california gov gavin newsom talking about forests clean up your forests you won t have forest fires clean them up he blames it on global warming i said no try cleaning the floor of the forest a little bit so you don t have four feet of leaves and broken trees that have sit there for 25 years it s called forest management remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts both nature and humans share responsibility for california s devastating wildfires but fire scientists say forest management is not the main contributor and most of california s forests are controlled by the federal government not the state nature provides the dangerous winds that have whipped the fires and human caused climate change over the long haul is killing and drying the shrubs and trees that provide the fuel that s not to say california is blameless urban development encroaching on wildlands also is a factor but about 19 million or 57 percent of california s 33 million acres of forests are managed or owned by the federal government according to the university of california last year s wildfire that incinerated the northern california town of paradise and surrounding areas was the single deadliest such blaze in california history another recent major fire in southern california burned through shrubland not forest it s not about forest management said university of utah fire scientist philip dennison at the time these aren t forests the dean of the university of michigan s environmental school jonathan overpeck said western fires are getting bigger and more severe he said it is much less due to bad management and is instead the result of our baking of our forests woodlands and grasslands with ever worsening climate change wildfires have become more devastating because of the extreme weather swings from global warming fire scientists said the average number of u s acres burned by wildfires has doubled from 30 years ago drug prices trump drug prices down for first time in 51 years soon will drop much further tweet sunday trump drug prices have gone down for the first time in 51 years they ve gone down first time in 51 years remarks may 13 at white house dinner the facts he s making an outdated boast trump appeared to be referring to recent decreases in the labor department s consumer price index for prescription drugs but the index was updated this month before trump s latest claims and it showed an increase of 0 3 in april for prescription drug prices when compared with the same month last year the index tracks a set of medications both brand drugs and generics other independent studies point to increasing prices for brand name drugs as well and more overall spending on medications an analysis of brand name drug prices by the associated press showed 2 712 price increases in the first half of january compared with 3 327 increases during the same period last year however the size of this year s increases was not as pronounced both this year and last the number of price cuts was minuscule the information for the analysis was provided by the health data firm elsevier an analysis by altarum a nonprofit research and consulting firm found that in 2018 spending on prescription drugs was one of the main factors behind a 4 5 increase in u s health spending spending on prescription drugs grew much faster than in 2017 according to the study economist paul hughes cromwick of altarum said he expects drug prices will continue to creep up i would be quite surprised if by july the annual rate doesn t return to a more normal 2 4 growth said hughes cromwick jobs trump and after years of stagnation wages are rising fast with the quickest growth for blue collar workers the best statistic of all and people don t know the blue collar worker has the biggest percentage increase of anybody these things didn t just happen by accident they happened because we are taking out this power out of washington remarks to real estate group friday the facts he s claiming credit for a trend of rising wages for lower income blue collar workers that predates his presidency some of the gains also reflect higher minimum wages passed at the state and local level the trump administration opposes an increase to the federal minimum wage with the unemployment rate at 3 6 the lowest since december 1969 employers are struggling to fill jobs despite all the talk of robots and automation thousands of restaurants warehouses and retail stores still need workers they are offering higher wages and have pushed up pay for the lowest paid one quarter of workers more quickly than for everyone else since 2015 in march the poorest 25 saw their paychecks increase 4 4 from a year earlier compared with 3 for the richest one quarter trump our economy is setting records with more people employed today than at any time in u s history tweet sunday trump we have the most people working today than at any time in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts yes but the record workforce is driven by population growth a more relevant measure is the proportion of americans with jobs and that is still far below record highs according to labor department data 60 6 percent of people in the united states 16 years and older were working in april that s below the all time high of 64 7 percent in april 2000 though higher than the 59 9 percent when trump was inaugurated in january 2017 trade trump we ve been losing for many years anywhere from 300 billion to 500 billion a year with china and trade with china we can t let that happen remarks tuesday at the white house trump we lost 180 billion with the european union remarks to national association of realtors on friday the facts this is not how almost any economist would describe what is happening the united states does have a huge trade deficit with china totaling 378 7 billion last year as well as a 109 billion trade deficit with the eu that means china and the eu exported far more to the united states than vice versa but in return u s businesses and consumers received goods and services with that money economists compare trump s take on trade deficits to a shopper going to a store and complaining they lost money with what they bought most trade experts see trade deficits or surpluses between two specific countries as economically meaningless china s deficit with the united states is large in part because many goods particularly electronics that used to be made in different countries typically in asia are now sent to china for final assembly even though many key parts are still manufactured in countries such as japan south korea and taiwan that has lowered the u s trade deficit with those countries over the years while increasing the gap with china trump our economy is fantastic china s is not so good we ve gone up trillions and trillions of dollars since the election they ve gone way down since my election remarks tuesday the facts there s not much truth to this the u s economy hasn t done as well nor has china done as badly as trump says the u s economy has grown at a healthy pace since trump s inauguration in january 2017 but not by trillions and trillions u s gross domestic product the broadest measure of the country s growth has increased by just over 1 trillion to 18 9 trillion in the past two years those figures are adjusted for inflation china has seen its rate of economic growth tick down slightly from 6 7 in 2016 to 6 6 last year according to the international monetary fund that is more than twice the u s growth rate in 2018 of 2 9 although mature economies such as america s typically grow more slowly than developing countries such as china trump we re taking in right now hundreds of billions of dollars we re taking in billions of dollars of tariffs and those tariffs are going to be tremendously if you look at what we ve done thus far with china we ve never taken in 10 cents until i got elected remarks may 13 with hungary s prime minister the facts he s wrong the notion that the u s suddenly has revenue coming in from tariffs thanks to his trade dispute defies history that goes back to the founding of the republic president george washington signed the tariff act into law in 1789 the first major act of congress and duties from imports were a leading source of revenue for the government before the advent of the modern tax system early in the 20th century tariffs on goods specifically from china are not remotely new either they are simply higher in some cases than they were before tariffs are a decidedly modest portion of revenue in modern times and trump has not changed that with the escalation of his trade fight with china customs and duties generated 41 3 billion in revenues last year up from 34 6 billion in 2017 far more than 10 cents that 6 7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president s tariffs but it amounted to just 0 16 of federal spending moreover tariffs are taxes paid largely by u s business and consumers not foreign countries taxes trump we have the biggest tax cut bill in the history of our country remarks to real estate group friday the facts his tax cuts are nowhere close to the biggest in u s history it s a 1 5 trillion tax cut over 10 years as a share of the total economy a tax cut of that size ranks 12th according to the committee for a responsible federal budget president ronald reagan s 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed world war ii post reagan tax cuts also stand among the historically significant president george w bush s cuts in the early 2000s and president barack obama s renewal of them a decade later ___ find ap fact checks at follow apfactcheck on twitter

in march at least 31 4 percent of argentine voters said they would support kirchner while only 27 3 percent said they would favour macri who is widely blamed for the nation s economic woes as well as his cooperation with the international monetary fund imf the fund is quite unpopular in argentina but some economists see no alternative to its programmes unless argentina wants to repeat the peronist economic policies most recently championed by none other than kirschner herself it is not clear that there are alternatives to austerity and the imf program for argentina and this move may confirm that the main moderate peronist candidates see it that way too hasnain malik of capital markets advisory tellimer in dubai said it s also unclear whether the centre left citizens union led by the fernández fernández duo will gain more popularity or if it ll dip in polls read more argentine pilots launch strike oppose hiring of foreigners by national airlines the general perception of alberto fernández is quite favourable in argentina although he s somewhat of a less recognisable figure than his female partner fernández is seen as less decisive and radical than kirchner and some analysts say he could actually attract more votes among the undecided moderate audience who would otherwise support macri despite all his unpopular moves
by cassandra garrison buenos aires reuters argentine markets rattled during recent months by rising political uncertainty could get a reprieve after the populist ex leader seen as challenger no 1 in this year s presidential elections said she would instead run on someone else s ticket cristina fernandez de kirchner a former president who has an ardent support base but is unloved by global investors surprised locals and international observers alike on saturday by saying she would run as vice president alongside former cabinet chief alberto fernandez a veteran political operator who has both backed and criticized her in the past economists said the move could temper the self styled populist s more contentious policies even if it was also a clever ploy to return to power after struggling to win over the more moderate wing of the broad peronist opposition that would likely be a balm for markets ahead of elections in october the reemergence of the divisive ex president who had been climbing in the polls as incumbent mauricio macri stumbled over a biting recession and high inflation had hammered the peso currency and caused bond yields to spike i think the market will react well because this is basically a recognition of weakness on the part of cristina kirchner said ilya gofshteyn a senior emerging markets strategist at standard chartered bank in new york she wouldn t be running as a vice president if she thought she could win as president cristina fernandez is considered by investors to be a riskier prospect because of her past populist policies she introduced currency controls and tax increases on farm exports while in office between 2007 and 2015 alberto fernandez criticized her management after he resigned from her administration in 2008 and forged ties with other factions of peronism opposed to her ruling party j p morgan said in a note that past criticism could actually help the running pair if it assuaged people s fears that the lower profile alberto fernandez would simply be a figurehead with his deputy holding the real power in a government it is the president who makes the decisions alberto fernandez told local media on saturday responding to suggestions he would be a puppet of the former leader who still commands raucous crowds others however said that if markets sensed a political upheaval even one without cristina fernandez at the helm it could create volatility there will be some negative reaction with an upward exchange rate and some stocks and bonds dropping said argentine economic analyst gustavo neffa at research for traders however the election race is still very open so there can be changes the unexpected ticket could also win support from more moderate peronists who may not have voted for cristina fernandez herself and with annual inflation at above 55 job losses mounting and a tumbling peso hard hit voters are open to change is aiming to capture that more moderate segment that does not approve of macri s management mariel fornoni a political analyst for argentinian consultancy management and fit told reuters macri a free market advocate has worked to boost economic activity in the previously closed economy but is struggling to reverse an economic crisis he negotiated a 56 3 billion financing deal with the international monetary fund last year the crisis has contributed to uncertainty among investors who feared political upheaval if macri lost to cristina fernandez opening the door to defaults and debt restructuring gofshteyn said there was still time for a strong third candidate to emerge but he didn t believe investors would give the same weight to cristina fernandez s vice presidential candidacy as they would to her as a potential president there is this idea that you can somehow transfer your popularity to another candidate but that s just not the way it works name recognition matters a lot he said reporting by cassandra garrison additional reporting by gabriel burin and nicolas misculin editing by adam jourdan and daniel wallis

shadows a city that is affordable for families and seniors and where every job pays a living wage a city of fairness and hope and prosperity for the many not just for the few a city that holds equity and inclusion as our guiding principles chicago is not where my story began but from the moment i arrived in hyde park to attend law school and begin my career this city felt like where i belonged it s where i met the love of my life my wife amy it s where our daughter vivian was born and where she s growing up into the kind curious and spirited young woman i always knew she would be for me this has been a city of opportunity it s been a city of hope as i stand here today i can t help but think of where i came from and i know in my heart that a story like mine of a kid from a working class family growing up to realize the dreams of my father and mother through education hard work and sheer determination needs to be the story of possibility in every neighborhood kids who look like me and come from families like mine shouldn t have to beat the odds to get an education pursue their passions or build a family black and brown kids low income kids every kid in this city should grow up knowing they can pursue anything they can love anyone that s my chicago dream i know we re just a little bit closer to that dream as i stand here today inaugurated as chicago s first black woman and first openly gay mayor i know we re a little bit closer as we celebrate that for the first time in the history of chicago women of color now hold all three of our city wide elected offices i

great hope and possibility and i can t help but feel the spirit of the great mayor harold washington here with us this morning now there s one person you are about to meet who laid the foundation for everything that i am today i want to introduce you to a former elected official with us today a one time school board member from my hometown of massillon ohio she s my role model my champion the woman whose dreams and high expectations for me propelled me through life my mother ann lightfoot my mom is 90 years old forgive me for that one mom and doesn t travel much these days but nothing could keep her or my siblings derrick angela brian and stacey from being here today my mother and my late father elijah gave us the best they could in the segregated ohio steel town where we grew up even when they had almost nothing left to give as parents they led by example they instilled in me a clear set of values loyalty to family friends and community and the importance of hard work education and integrity and mom most importantly you and dad told me that i could be anything i wanted to be that i could not be held back by my race gender or family financial status that i should hold my head high and not let anyone else dictate the course of my future that no goal was out of reach that no victory was too unlikely to pursue i feel dad s presence with us today my gratitude to you both has no limit just like when i was a little girl i m working hard to make you proud to honor your sacrifice to live by the values you instilled in me to make sure that families like ours don t have to struggle like we did i look out today and see a proud city with a proud history here in chicago right here our people invented the skyscraper and the ferris wheel here our people invented our own chicago blues our people generations of industrious hardworking people who built one of the greatest cities to ever grace god s earth i stand here today as your mayor humble and hopeful and i make one solemn promise to the generations who came before us and to the generations who come after us we will continue to build this great city and leave it better stronger fairer and more prosperous than we found it the challenges we face today did not arise overnight and they will not be solved overnight and they certainly won t be solved by one mayor acting alone in this important moment let us remember the powerful words of chicago s poet laureate gwendolyn brooks we are each other s harvest she said we are each other s business we are each other s magnitude and bond folks we are and must be in this together our challenges can only be solved if we face them together we cannot fail we will not fail we are chicago i also remember so many people i ve met in this city who can t be here today the big guy who came to hear me speak and then followed outside on a cold blustery day on the southeast side and pleaded lori just bring us jobs just bring us jobs we want to work the teenagers i met on the south side kicked out of their homes and left on the streets at night in the bitter cold with no food and no shelter just because they are gay or trans the father on the west side who told me he was scared scared to death every time his three daughters left the house those girls are his whole world and he s worried somebody is going to gun them down the countless number of people whose daily fear is that ice would come for them as they took their kids to school stood as day laborers or just walked in their neighborhoods we should never forget that these are the people who put us here we are each other s business and standing up for them is our business our only business there are four stars on chicago s flag each standing for a point in our history the construction of fort dearborn the great expositions of 1893 and 1933 and the reconstruction of our city following the great chicago fire each star stands for building and rebuilding today we proudly reinterpret these four stars new meaning for a new century with new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead guiding our city and guiding our new administration as we move forward and rebuild again today we reimagine the first star standing for safety in every neighborhood people cannot and should not live in neighborhoods that resemble a war zone enough of the shootings enough of the guns enough of the violence let s unite in our response to the biggest challenge we face the epidemic of gun violence that devastates families shatters communities buries dreams and holds children hostage to fear in their own homes it inflicts life long trauma that spreads through our communities like a virus when we hear of a random bullet cutting a life short people across the city from all ages and all walks of life begin to wonder if chicago is a place where they can continue to live and raise their children some have already answered the question by moving away particularly from the hardest hit communities the mass exodus we have seen particularly in the black community saps the vitality of our great city we must reverse the exodus by creating the reality of safety in every neighborhood public safety must not be a commodity that is only available to the wealthy what this means for me is that there is no higher calling than restoring safety and peace in our neighborhoods we will develop a new proactive strategy in partnership with the communities hit hardest by the scourge of gun violence all of our stakeholders must be committed to this work this is not a challenge that can be solved by law enforcement alone nor will we ever place the blame on people in communities who are under siege no this greatest challenge demands all of us united together and i promise you the city will lead and we ve already begun this work to lead the citywide response we are creating a mayor s office of public safety to be led by a deputy mayor that office will be charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive violence prevention strategy that will connect efforts across city government other aspects of the public sector and nonprofit philanthropic education recreation business and faith communities it will seek to mobilize the entire city behind a unified strategy to prevent violence and promote public safety and while we will specifically address gun violence we will not limit our efforts there the devastation of violence is far and wide which is why we will also reach out and support the growing community of victims and witnesses we must recognize the importance of providing a transition for our returning citizens and we will accelerate the development of a trauma informed city starting with repairing our broken mental health safety net we will also continue the hard but essential work of forging partnerships between police officers and the community premised on mutual respect accountability and a recognition that the destinies of police and community are inextricably intertwined one simply cannot succeed without the other and to all of our brave first responders we will not leave you behind either you deserve not only our respect but our commitment to train you better provide the best quality supervision available and wellness support to address the trauma that you face every day these are critical pieces of police reform and accountability we are each other s business we are each other s neighbors and together we will work tirelessly to bring peace to this city our second guiding star is education we cannot attract families to chicago and keep families here without providing a quality public education for every child and that means every single child as a city we make promises to our children as well most of all we promise them an education a safe relevant and challenging education that prepares them for meaningful work civic engagement and life long learning but whether we deliver on that promise often depends on where you happen to live it s time to give every child and young person a good education to prove through our schools that we believe in them that we support them no matter who they are or where they live that every child gets a quality education that s our business no matter what someone said to me recently that children are a product of the adult ecosystem around them and she was 100 percent right our words our values how we meet our commitments and rise to the occasion it all matters we re shaping the future leaders of our city and when we put equity first in our education system when we make good on a promise that every kid matters it will instill within our children the values we seek to foster in our city as a whole that promise must begin early that s why we will work to expand early childhood education and extend the promise of a good education through high school and college and to every kid no matter their path forward every student should have the option to pursue vocational and technical training we will work with businesses and unions to set up apprenticeships for those who want to learn a trade we will then connect chicago s employers with our job ready students while they re in school so they can get to work the day they graduate and we will support our great teachers counselors librarians nurses and other support personnel who are essential to creating the safe and nurturing environment necessary for our children to grow learn and thrive let me also say that i m thrilled to see so many young people in the audience my next few words are for you and all of your peers across the city you have the most at stake in the city s future just as the city s future most depends on you we need your energy creativity intelligence and dedication there s hard work ahead of us but we will do that work because we believe you and in the vast still untapped potential of this great city our goal is simple starting in our schools we will create a citywide workforce as the pipeline for jobs of today and tomorrow that will be the envy of the world we are each other s business and we must meet our educational challenges together the third of our guiding stars is stability to be true to the notion of stability we must start with getting our fiscal house in order over many many years chicago dug itself into a giant financial hole we have an outsize structural deficit a persistent and growing pension debt and other costs that that threatens our financial stability we are spending a significant percentage of every dollar just to service our pension debt alone and too much of that money is being sent to banks and wall street bond firms instead of going to our rebuild our neighborhoods reduce our property taxes and revitalize our transportation system we must tackle this problem head on my team has already been the necessary work of measuring the size and depth of our fiscal challenges as well as working on a range of possible solutions once that analysis is complete we will lay out a plan to put chicago on the path to solvency no doubt some hard choices will have to be made and none of this is going to be easy but we will do the hard work with transparency integrity and a determination to put our pensions on a true path to solvency and make our government work more efficiently and without balancing budgets on the backs of low wage and working class chicagoans and we will get there because we must stability also means that we must build housing that is affordable for more people including families long term residents whether homeowners or renters should not be forced out of their neighborhoods when it goes through a period of transformation and developers can no longer skip their responsibilities by taking tax dollars but leaving it to someone else to solve our affordable housing crisis here too the city must lead we need to cut the red tape and obstacles and instead promote the building of new units and have flexibility in our building code so that innovative housing forms can come on line we must also have a plan for expanding home ownership and converting vacant lots and abandoned buildings into new vibrant communities growth of housing that is affordable all over this city will be the charge of the new housing department under new leadership stability also means support for our business community large and small strong businesses growing businesses new businesses mean jobs for people and stability for the city we need fairness which means paying as much attention to our neighborhood businesses as we do to the businesses downtown our neighborhoods have been neglected for too long they cannot be anymore still we should never settle for dividing up a shrinking pie or pitting one part of this city against another chicago is the economic engine of illinois and the whole midwest as with everything we are each other s business we need to grow and grow and grow together our fourth star must be integrity i know i know putting chicago government and integrity in the same sentence is well a little strange but that s going to change it s got to change for years they ve said chicago ain t ready for reform well get ready because reform is here i campaigned on change you voted for change and i plan to deliver change to our government that means restoring trust in our city s government and finally bringing some real integrity to the way this city works it means making sure we have a government that actually works for people not a powerful few it s about the real harm done to our families and businesses when those with power and money cash in at our expense when public officials cut shady backroom deals they get rich and the rest of us get the bill when some people get their property taxes cut in exchange for campaign cash they get the money and sure enough we get the bill the family with the bungalow the lady who runs the hair salon the guy who owns the store on the corner they aren t big or powerful or well connected but they end up paying these practices have gone on here for decades this practice breeds corruption stopping it isn t just in the city s interest it s in the city council s own interest no official in the city of chicago elected or appointed should ever profit from his or her office never ever this requirement that people must give more to get access to basic city services must end and it will end starting today later this afternoon i will sign an executive order to end the worst abuses of so called aldermanic privilege this does not mean our aldermen won t have power in their communities it does not mean our aldermen won t be able to make sure the streetlights are working or the parking signs are in the right place or any of the thousands of good things they do for people every day it simply means ending their unilateral unchecked control over on every single thing that goes on their wards alderman will have a voice not a veto it s time for a new era of trust between the people of chicago and the government that serves them when our poet said we are each other s bond that s what she meant as i stand here today georgia is also on my mind as is alabama and every other state that is enacting laws intended to deprive women of our rights me must stand with women all across our country who fear for their basic rights and feel powerless in the face of the hateful legislation designed to control our bodies our choices we cannot go back not in chicago not as a nation we will join together and we will fight and there s something else we must do for ourselves and our posterity we will establish a new social compact here in chicago based on a simple principle shared by every major religion in the world it goes by many names in buddhism it says hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful in the quran it says whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind it is in the torah and again in the new testament it is called the great commandment love thy neighbor as thyself today too many of our people lack decent housing and far too many end up on our streets today too many of our people feel isolated and alone and as our senior population increases we must meet the needs of those without family or friends for support today as we prepare to enter the third decade of the twenty first century one out of every five children in chicago still lives in poverty addressing the problems of housing isolation and poverty in our great city is just as important as anything else we may do and far harder to solve but tackle these problems we must i heard a century old hymn in church the other day a song that i know from my youth of so many sundays sitting in church listening to the working class people in my congregation who toiled in factories kitchens or outside and came to the church for a respite from their otherwise hard days we sang this song pass me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling do not pass me by in that moment it was our plea to god to shine his light on us and relieve us from our heavy labors as i reflect on this day and what lies ahead it means that we must not forget or ignore the plight of so many for whom joy often does not come in the morning whether it is the homeless people living with mental illness those desperate for love and recognition we will not pass them by as we pursue our new stars this will be our guiding light to those who are alone we are with you to those who need a home we will shelter you for those who have little we will do much we see you we hear you we are your neighbors and so help me we will not pass you by i stand before you representing tens of thousands of people from all over the city who daily contribute their time talent and resources in the cause of making a difference not just to day but if we are bold our collective efforts will resonate for years to come our people friends and neighbors known and unknown at the block level in our places of worship in our community organizations and just individuals who want to make a difference have stepped up and contributed mightily to what is the greatness of the city i will have the privilege of leading but clearly a single leader cannot heal all the ails us a single leader cannot by herself conquer all of the challenges that would be present on day one we all have to be part of that solution we all must make the sacrifices necessary to identify problems and forge solutions and my friends we must not merely depend on the politicians the preachers the police the teachers the activists and others to show us the way we can no longer continue to cede control of our destiny to someone else each of us needs to ask what can i do what contributions can i make you may not be the richest the smartest or even the most able but ask yourself are you ready to serve in some way because our city surely needs you what has been the most amazing and humbling part of the experience in a journey that i have traveled particularly over these last few months is the tremendous hope and optimism that i am feeling from people all over the city my friends it is that message of hope and possibility that should get all of us up in the morning start us on our way and bring all of us together with the excitement and promise born of harnessing our collective energies to move forward together our challenges are great there s no mistaking that but if we follow these four stars safety schooling stability and integrity we can once again become a city that families want to move to not run away from no matter who you are no matter where you live no matter your circumstance in life chicago is now on a mission to include you to join hands with you to share power with you and to give you reason to believe that we can all pull in the same direction to make chicago better together and if we follow the great commandment together as neighbors

by reuters by cassandra garrison buenos aires reuters argentine markets rattled during recent months by rising political uncertainty could get a reprieve after the populist ex leader seen as challenger no 1 in this year s presidential elections said she would instead run on someone else s ticket cristina fernandez de kirchner a former president who has an ardent support base but is unloved by global investors surprised locals and international observers alike on saturday by saying she would run as vice president alongside former cabinet chief alberto fernandez a veteran political operator who has both backed and criticized her in the past economists said the move could temper the self styled populist s more contentious policies even if it was also a clever ploy to return to power after struggling to win over the more moderate wing of the broad peronist opposition that would likely be a balm for markets ahead of elections in october the reemergence of the divisive ex president who had been climbing in the polls as incumbent mauricio macri stumbled over a biting recession and high inflation had hammered the peso currency and caused bond yields to spike i think the market will react well because this is basically a recognition of weakness on the part of cristina kirchner said ilya gofshteyn a senior emerging markets strategist at standard chartered bank in new york she wouldn t be running as a vice president if she thought she could win as president cristina fernandez is considered by investors to be a riskier prospect because of her past populist policies she introduced currency controls and tax increases on farm exports while in office between 2007 and 2015 alberto fernandez criticized her management after he resigned from her administration in 2008 and forged ties with other factions of peronism opposed to her ruling party j p morgan said in a note that past criticism could actually help the running pair if it assuaged people s fears that the lower profile alberto fernandez would simply be a figurehead with his deputy holding the real power in a government it is the president who makes the decisions alberto fernandez told local media on saturday responding to suggestions he would be a puppet of the former leader who still commands raucous crowds others however said that if markets sensed a political upheaval even one without cristina fernandez at the helm it could create volatility there will be some negative reaction with an upward exchange rate and some stocks and bonds dropping said argentine economic analyst gustavo neffa at research for traders however the election race is still very open so there can be changes the unexpected ticket could also win support from more moderate peronists who may not have voted for cristina fernandez herself and with annual inflation at above 55 job losses mounting and a tumbling peso hard hit voters are open to change is aiming to capture that more moderate segment that does not approve of macri s management mariel fornoni a political analyst for argentinian consultancy management and fit told reuters macri a free market advocate has worked to boost economic activity in the previously closed economy but is struggling to reverse an economic crisis he negotiated a 56 3 billion financing deal with the international monetary fund last year the crisis has contributed to uncertainty among investors who feared political upheaval if macri lost to cristina fernandez opening the door to defaults and debt restructuring gofshteyn said there was still time for a strong third candidate to emerge but he didn t believe investors would give the same weight to cristina fernandez s vice presidential candidacy as they would to her as a potential president advertisement there is this idea that you can somehow transfer your popularity to another candidate but that s just not the way it works name recognition matters a lot he said reporting by cassandra garrison additional reporting by gabriel burin and nicolas misculin editing by adam jourdan and daniel wallis

recently a debate has opened up regarding the denunciation by the former minister elías jaua of the arrest of 10 communards who had occupied and reclaimed the social ownership of the state company arroz del alba in the portuguesa state in west venezuela arroz del alba s assets had been turned over to be managed by the private company agroinlaca the la tabla blog noted on twitter that in addition to the turning over of the plant in portuguesa in 2015 the aba feed mill belonging to corporación venezolana de alimentos sa cval had already been handed over to this same private company whose owners would have obtained sufficient profits to build or acquire real estate such as a luxury headquarters in the industrial zone ii of barquisimeto and an apartment of more than one million dollars in miami returning to the arrest of the communards elías jaua explained the reasons for the occupation of the company by the agua de dios commune what does the agua de dios commune demand in the exercise of its legal powers in the communal sphere that the social property be respected that the legal conditions under which national assets are delivered to a private entity be explained that the stability and working conditions of the workers are guaranteed that the rice production of the area is received and that a percentage of the distribution be sold in the community the operating capitalist fulfills none of these demands at the moment en los últimos dos años agroinlaca y sus propietarios han experimentado un crecimiento que les ha permitido construir o adquirir inmuebles como una sede de lujo en la zona industrial ii de barquisimeto y un condominio de más de 1 millón de dólares en miami pic twitter com yqojgyhpq5 la tabla latablablog april 15 2019 as we can see those occupying the property were only responding to the plundering of the capitalists who divert production for export amass fortunes and acquire property all on the backs of the workers and peasants who are the ones that are actually producing the wealth it was only after the case provoked a scandal among the chavista left and when the communards had been in detention for 70 days that they were released isolated case or state policy unfortunately the aforementioned case is not isolated but is part of an increasingly evident policy that under the argument of private sector participation advances towards the partial or total privatisation of companies that were nationalised or inaugurated during the bolivarian revolution in addition this process of reverting acquired gains to private hands not only occurs in the industrial sector but also covers everything from land to tourism from rubbish collection to the change in the shareholding composition of strategic hydrocarbon companies one of the greatest conflicts over property since the beginning of the bolivarian revolution has been that of land ownership the coup d état of april 2002 had among its motivations the reversal of the land law promulgated in 2001 by president chávez using enabling powers this law allowed a process of socialisation and turning over of non productive land to peasants today an inverse process is taking place dispossessing the peasants and communards of their land to hand it over to the big landowners these terrófago land thieving actions take place under the protective shadow of the new minister who coined the term revolutionary bourgeoisie the dispossession of the peasants is done in favour of former landowners who can pay for it but also in favour of bureaucrats civilian and military close to the tsar of the land for this reason all kinds of means are used to expel the peasants from pressure and institutional besieging to intimidation by the military paramilitary and hired assassins all this motivated a group of peasants from portuguesa state to undertake what would be called the peasant march a journey on foot from portuguesa to caracas in order to meet with the president and present their problems this march mobilised a great deal of solidarity from the left all over the country but nevertheless the peasants were received by the armed forces days after their arrival in caracas the peasants managed to meet with the president who listened to them on national television and made all kinds of promises but since then there have been few advances made and the deaths have continued reaching a toll of 19 peasant leaders killed to date along with the killings there have also been arbitrary arrests and eviction attempts during which houses and schools in the peasant communities have been burned for example in mérida 32 peasants including 11 women one of them nursing an infant were arrested for the alleged invasion of la magdalena farm where according to la tabla they came with permission from the national land institute inti another example of arbitrary arrests is the case of wiston olivero the spokesman for land recovery in gavilán la chaqueta portuguesa olivero was arrested with nine other peasants who had upon whom shotguns and military uniforms were planted to make them look like paramilitaries meanwhile in the same state in the peasant council guasimal los caribes in the papelón municipality armed gangs burned several houses a tractor and destroyed the community s crops the industrial sector has also been advancing towards this policy of privatisation accompanied by the persecution of workers an emblematic case of this was the arrest by the cicpc of three trade union leaders from the lácteos los andes company in february last year the workers of this company nationalised by chavez in 2008 reported that more than 80 percent of the plant in cabudare was paralysed due to corruption and lack of investment in raw materials according to the workers this corresponds with the rerouting of resources destined for the company in order to provide a justification for placing it in private hands in café fama de américa the story is not much different nationalised in 2009 as part of a fight against monopolies fama de america and café madrid controlled 80 percent of the market it remained under the workers control for a short time now controlled by the bureaucracy the company often goes without raw materials the workers in this case also denounce the company s bankruptcy process because while products labeled gourmet are in the warehouse there is no supply of green coffee unroasted coffee beans the man in charge of the transportation invoices is colonel josé alfredo mora president of the venezuelan coffee corporation the communes have also been targeted by attacks of the bureaucracy and in this matter the latter have outdone themselves in their cynicism the el maizal commune is a clear example of how the greater the success of the popular organisation the greater the viciousness of the bureaucracy for example president nicolás maduro recently announced on twitter the reactivation of the pig farm josé leonardo chirinos located in the iribarren municipality of lara state which was one of the four plants from the porcinos del alba mixed company reactivamos la granja porcina josé leonardo chirinos en el municipio iribarren del estado lara es una alianza con el sector privado para la cría de cerdos bebes que producirá para diciembre de 2019 un total de 6 millones de piezas de pernil fuerza productiva nacional pic twitter com 4ycr2huess nicolás maduro nicolasmaduro april 18 2019 it s no secret to anyone that this mixed company was never productive in the hands of the bureaucracy regardless of the size of the investments made to lift production their facilities were converted into pig cemeteries until one of their plants also in the lara state was occupied by the maizal communards in conjunction with the workers to increase production under a system of social ownership in january 2018 the success of the commune was demonstrated when various regions of the country were protesting demanding the christmas hams promised by maduro which never arrived and the neighbouring communities could acquire them at solidarity prices from the maizal commune as we pointed out before the successes of the commune are unacceptable for the bureaucracy because they not only demonstrate the bureaucracy s uselessness but also expose the lies that are used as excuses for privatisation for this reason the bureaucracy laid siege to this experience denying the food needed to keep the pigs alive as was reported by one of the leaders of the ángel prado commune when it was announced that the pigs would be sold to the peasants to prevent them from starving to death we are not going to hand over our farm that was bankrupted by the poor management of porcinos del alba leaving a cemetery of animals as it is known and it s even worse in times of crisis with the workers and the organised communities we will take over the company with them we will rise up and with them we will move forward but never give in this is just one of the many attacks the communes have suffered but it clearly shows the cynicism with which one speaks of recovering a company when in reality they have been ruined by the bureaucracy suffocating every successful experience of workers control with the end goal of handing the companies over to the capitalists the strategic alliances with the bourgeoisie are not limited to the turning over of nationalised companies to the new capitalist friends of the government but also include multinationals from all over the world from canadian gold reserve whom chávez expelled from the country to turkish and chinese companies known for corruption in their respective countries in most cases the government has tried to keep up appearances knowing that chávez was against privatisations in venezuela the bureaucrats are trying to lift all of those decrees that during chávez s government put a maximum margin of 40 percent participation of foreign capital in the shareholding composition of mixed companies in this sense the foreign investment law sanctioned by the national constituent assembly has been a severe blow to national sovereignty since it not only puts the venezuelan people at the mercy of vultures and multinationals but also allows looting via royalties this is without mentioning the agreements against double taxation already signed by the government that exempt foreign companies from paying taxes to the country in the case of the gold reserve the maduro government has agreed to pay compensation of 1 032 billion dollars in recompense for the expropriation carried out under chávez with this maduro would get the company to invest in the construction of two plants to extract gold and copper one of them worth 295 million dollars much less than what we are paying through the creation of a mixed company in which 45 percent would belong to the canadian company in the turkish case for example the commercial exchange has grown rapidly going from 803 6 million dollars in the period 2013 17 to 892 4 million dollars in the first five months of 2018 an amount that was divided into 52 2 million for venezuelan imports in flour wheat rice pasta soap marble and construction materials and 834 2 million of exports in diamonds precious metals iron steel and pearls regarding china the most recent agreements include converting the ferrominera del orinoco into a mixed company granting 9 9 percent of the shares of petrosinovensa a mixed company in the oil sector to china which would increase the shareholding in asia to 49 9 percent violating laws introduced by president chávez agreements on gas extraction with the national corporation of china s gas exploitation cnodc gold mining with the yankuang group and iron with the railway engineering corporation as well as agreements for the extraction and processing of coltan the problem for the government is that this new opening up of the economy has not managed to attract large investments for the development of the productive forces but has concentrated on the extractivist industry which is why they represent a turning over of natural resources to save the dying rentier model the words of the right in the mouths of the bureaucracy to try to justify this policy it is not uncommon to hear from the right that workers control does not work that industry in the hands of the state fails and that it must be in private hands so that the market can work in a balanced way during chávez s life many bureaucrats who still hold positions today thought this way but faced with the growth of the masses and workers struggles they kept quiet which did not prevent them from torpedoing all attempts at workers organisation and management already in 2012 taking advantage of the medical treatment of president chávez in cuba the bureaucracy destroyed workers control in the companies of the cvg dismissing the workers presidents of sidor and alcasa now these cowards who spent years acting as a fifth column in the revolutionary process are taking advantage of a crisis situation that strengthens them to be able to voice their arguments they talk about recovering unproductive or paralysed companies hand in hand with the private sector while openly pointing out that workers control was a failure however for any person whose conscience is not numbed by the propaganda of these charlatans a fairly logical question would come to mind why are these companies that were producing when they were nationalised now paralysed surely we will be told that the workers were to blame or even worse they will allude to a supposed venezuelan culture that makes us lazy by nature however none of these cultural myths correspond to an analysis of the facts these prejudicial arguments do not withstand the slightest scrutiny the workforce is now and has always been the source of all value in society whether their companies are state owned or private as we saw in the case of lacteos los andes or fama de américa one cannot blame the debacle of these companies on the workers when not only do they have no say over administration but they are also the ones who are denouncing the dubious manoeuvres of the bureaucrats in charge moreover it can be demonstrated with facts and figures that all the companies that were nationalised and under workers control produced more than under private control yet quickly encountered difficulties when the bureaucracy crushed the organs of workers control and replacing them with management by bureaucrats mostly from the military during two days various social organisations promoted the twitter hashtags privatizarestraicionar privatisation is betrayal and libertadparaloscomuneros freedom for the communards which trended for a few hours here we could see the mentality of the bureaucrats who in many cases shielded by the anonymity of social networks took the opportunity to show which side they are on in the class struggle government bots launched another hashtag empresasmixtasconchinayrusia mixed companies with china and russia which shows how sensitive the bureaucracy is to criticism and how weak they are in the debate over ideas it is necessary to expose their true ideas and the damage they are doing to the socialist cause a darle duro a esta etiqueta pues empresasmixtasconchinayrusia para tumbar el bodrio de la etiqueta privatizarestraicionar ceroguabineo alealex78 april 15 2019 the fundamental reason for the privatisations is quite obvious it has nothing to do with the needs of the people because as mentioned food which the bureaucrats and capitalists regard as merchandise does not go toward domestic consumption it also has nothing to do with state needs because the wealth generated does not go to the government the real motive behind the privatisations is personal interest profit derived from the sale or concession of state property we welcome elías jaua s clear and courageous intervention in the case of arroz del alba what is incredible is that if it were not for him publicising the case two months after it happened no one would have known about it the bureaucracy acts in a shady and treacherous manner because it knows that its actions would be rejected widely if they were known however elías jaua does not draw all the necessary conclusions his proposal of a mixed economy between capitalism and socialism does not and cannot work as we responded to elías directly a mixed economy model within the framework of the development of capitalism in venezuela is nothing more than another form of state transfer of oil revenues through different means corruption subsidies imports monetary overvaluation etc in favor of the ruling classes clearly tied to the backwardness and underdevelopment of our country what we see is precisely the consequence of not taking the revolution to its ultimate end not expropriating the bourgeoisie and not having destroyed the bourgeois state returning to a progressive past is not only impossible under the current condition of capitalist crisis but means stepping into the ring of history to receive a knockout from bureaucrats to the bourgeoisie a transition based on plunder we are facing a total bureaucratic degeneration in the political leadership of the bolivarian republic something that cannot be described in any other way than as a betrayal of the bolivarian revolution this is not the product of some leader s malignant plan but a product of the objective conditions and class interests of those in power during the stagnation of the revolution a widespread paraphrase of spinoza used by trotsky reads neither weep nor laugh but understand let us then understand how we have arrived at this point chávez himself reported on several occasions that even during the constituent national assembly of 1999 there were representatives that altered the wording of laws and the constitution that had been discussed in the chamber to favour the interests of the capitalists the current labour law which certainly contemplates progress for the working class as does the constitution also shows how the bureaucracy was creating a legal framework to use it with an employer mentality by restricting the right to strike interposing the request for a permit as if one must have authorisation to exercise a democratic right the greatest demonstration of this link between the bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie is the scourge of corruption that eats away at venezuelan society and is aggravated by the disgusting rentier model that the government insists on safeguarding the bribes that are paid for a good contract fall into the pockets of the bureaucracy and come out of the wallets of companies like odebrecht a win win relationship in which the venezuelan workers lose out so far we have seen the essence of the bureaucracy and the material conditions under which it is strengthened but what happens when bribes no longer fit in their pockets due to the opacity of the privatisation process and the impossibility in many cases of tracking the characters that are behind a large number of front businesses for now measuring the amount of shares companies and land directly in the hands of the bureaucracy is a difficult task however history shows us that given the conditions of revolutionary stagnation and bureaucratic strengthening the tendency is for the bureaucracy and those close to it to try and take ownership of the means of production that they manage in venezuela although the bourgeoisie was not expropriated in its entirety as was done in russia and cuba there was a process of nationalisation in which the bourgeoisie were compensated pushed by the rise of the masses this gives the bureaucracy quite distinctive characteristics since the state maintained its bourgeois character but in turn the bureaucracy had a fairly large economic power state enterprises were at the head of various sectors of the economy monopolising some hydrocarbon or being a competitor in others banking insurance agro industry services etc thus the bureaucracy has developed from simple parasitism in which it favoured the interests of the bourgeoisie and appropriated the rent through bribery and kickbacks to strengthening and expropriating political power as a result of the crisis and the ebb of the mass movement the bureaucracy is now moving towards an open privatisation policy which is clearly counterrevolutionary and from which it is possibly profiting directly although for now this is in marginal areas of the economy the weakness of the venezuelan bureaucracy and the particular characteristics of rentier capitalism have shaped the privatisation process in this way we observe that in the strategic sectors of the extractivist industry the bureaucracy has not been able to confront foreign capital so privatisations are made in favour of its strategic allies while in sectors of medium scale industry the small national capitalists grouped in fedeindustria are favoured however it is in the distribution of the land where the bureaucracy civil and military has led this process of appropriation we must remember that government policy even since chávez has been to try to create a patriotic bourgeoisie through the financial support of sectors of medium scale industry in order to develop the productive forces unfortunately this has not served the people but has only served to enlarge bourgeois sectors related to the bureaucracy as well as bureaucrats who decided to set forth on their own and take advantage of their political power we witness how the process of expropriations is paralysed replaced by an occupation procedure in which property still belongs to the capitalist but is administered by the bureaucracy when the capitalists decide to close their business this the capitalists advance on the land of peasants and communards on companies that operate under social production or state enterprises and on the country s natural resources defend our conquests and fight for socialism on many occasions chávez warned about the counterrevolutionary role of the bureaucracy and their behaviour as a fifth column within the bolivarian revolution however today this bureaucracy has lost its fear of the masses although in some cases it continues to use pseudo socialist demagogy it advances decisively against our conquests implementing albeit gradually a bourgeois programme some time ago in our polemic with elías jaua we posed three questions what is the general direction of the government is there still the possibility that the governing leadership could take a turn to the the left and if not why are we waiting to form a powerful left tendency that poses socialism as a strategic possibility and a genuine defence of the interests of the workers and the oppressed in general on the general direction of the government we already see a trend towards reversing the conquests of the revolution and making increasing concessions to the bourgeoisie to maintain itself in power then again is worth mentioning the words of jaua himself who pointed out that sections of the bureaucracy are now bourgeois and that they have great political power and pretend to behave like the old bourgeoisie denying any progress even gradual towards socialism expecting a revolution headed by counterrevolutionaries would be like waiting for pears from an elm tree all this leads us to answer the final question it is time to move towards the construction of a revolutionary alternative certainly venezuela is not in the best condition the bureaucracy has been given great power over the lives of the masses and has tied them up in a thousand and one clientelist knots meanwhile it has economically weakened the vanguard of the working class be it through the reduction of purchasing power or through the diversion of resources and the boycott of communal enterprises however even with all these blows we see that the popular movement is far from suffering a definitive defeat on the contrary it is determined to carry on fighting at present there is an urgent need to build a revolutionary alternative that denounces the counterrevolutionary shift of the government and struggles against the current process of privatisation for workers control of all nationalised companies this alternative also needs to be capable of articulating these struggles with the demands of the oppressed and exploited decent wages quality services and security to move towards a socialist programme given the current situation of imperialist aggression we observe a certain tendency to close ranks even by sections that are critical of the government or some of its policies our position is clear we reject and fight the attempted coup of trump guaidó but without suspending our criticism of the government this is necessary since the government s policies of concessions to the bourgeoisie and of dismantling the conquests of the revolution do not serve to confront imperialism on the contrary by undermining the revolution and emptying it of its content the government prepares the ground for the victory of the imperialist counterrevolution some even say that anyone who criticises the government is a fifth columnist trying to silence the growing clamour against defeatist policies such as privatisations and attacks on peasant communes we respond in a besieged fortress who is the fifth column is it the one that criticises the generals who open gaps in the wall and hand over turrets to the enemy or is it those who denounce these traitorous acts today it is more necessary than ever to begin the process of building a revolutionary alternative this starts with understanding that imperialism can only be fought with revolutionary measures jail for guaidó dissolution of the national assembly of coup plotters arming of the militias and expropriation of the properties and assets of the coup leaders under workers control secondly we must build a common front of all revolutionaries in defence of the conquests of the revolution against privatisations of the land and the communes and that fights for decent wages but ultimately we must move from a defensive to an offensive struggle we must recover the legacy of chávez who in his last speeches raised the need to advance to a socialist economy and pulverise the bourgeois state the imt and lucha de clases venezuela are committed to this struggle and in this common front we will defend our position that only with the expropriation of the bourgeoisie and with a democratic plan of production under the control of the working class can we begin to resolve the pressing problems we face defend our conquests fight for socialism down with bureaucracy and reformism to build a revolutionary alternative to privatise is to betray recover and defend the legacy of chávez notes this process was carried out through several methods granting land directly to peasants cooperatives and more recently social production companies linked to the communes this article was originally published on 25 april at

the commodity futures trading commission determined not to stand in the way of a rule amendment by ice futures u s to impose speed bumps on certain orders entered in two futures contracts traded on the exchange two commissioners raised concerns that the rule amendment might be anticompetitive separately the futures industry s joint audit committee reiterated prior guidance that a futures commission merchant may not guarantee customers against losses or pay out funds from any individual account of a customer where the payout would leave the aggregate of accounts of the customer at the fcm undermargined moreover jac strongly suggested fcms take certain immediate actions to comply with its guidance with the implicit suggestion or else as a result the following matters are covered in this week s edition of bridging the week memory lane and cftc staff declines to halt rollout of ice futures u s speed bumps two commissioners raise concerns includesand arts and science futures industry self regulators warn fcms against limiting losses of customers and not combining accounts for aggregate margin call calculations includes compliance weeds and more because of the us memorial day holiday on may 27 the next regularly scheduled edition of bridging the week will be june 3 2019 article version briefly cftc staff declines to halt rollout of ice futures u s speed bumps two commissioners raise concerns the commodity futures trading commission decided not to object to a new rule amendment by ice futures u s authorizing the exchange to implement delays or speed bumps in the time between when new aggressor orders might otherwise execute against resting passive orders the rule amendment was self certified by ifus with a representation that its so called passive order protection or pop functionality would initially be applied solely in the exchange s gold daily and silver daily futures contracts and involve speed bumps of three milliseconds however the language of the actual rule amendment does not reference any specific futures contracts or speed bump time periods notwithstanding in recommending non objection of ifus s amended rule by the cftc the commission s division of market oversight indicated that its views were limited to ifus s implementation of pop functionality only for gold and silver contracts and using a three millisecond speed bump according to dmo staff does not view the certification of the ice rule as establishing a precedent with respect to the legal and policy merits of speed bump functionalities generally dmo expects potential application of pop functionality to any other ifus listed futures contracts to be preceded by separate self certifications under pop a trader entering an order e g an offer and letting it rest in ifus s central limit order book could cancel the order if another order was entered into the marketplace that otherwise would match against the resting order e g a bid the trader with the resting order would have up to the time of the speed bump to assess the new order e g a last look and pull the resting order prior to execution against the new order if the resting order was pulled the new order would remain in the marketplace pursuant to the amended relevant rule the pop functionality could be activated at any time in ifus s sole discretion click here to access ifus february 1 2019 self certification of amendments to its rule 4 56 according to ifus the purpose of its new pop functionality is to encourage additional market participants who may not otherwise trade certain exchange markets due to a latency disadvantage to participate in trading such products the exchange claimed that attracting more market participants would increase liquidity particularly in those markets where price discovery takes place in a related market rather than or in addition to the exchange futures contracts and latency arbitrage is common ifus indicated that its speed bumps were solely intended for futures contracts with de minimis liquidity when it was proposed many commentators objected to ifus s amended rule in one comment letter for example fia ptg argued that ifus s proposed speed bumps effectively gave liquidity providers an unfair opportunity to review pending orders and cancel or widen their quotes in response fia ptg expressed concern that llowing market participants that post resting quotes to pull their quotes allow certain participants to display quotes that they do not intend to execute whil also fostering a misleading impression of liquidity in the product click here

9 mr berkovitz likewise questioned how speed bumps which he claimed were a material anticompetitive burden for at least some market participants helped promote responsible innovation and fair competition among market participants which he claimed was an obligation of the cftc to consider in evaluating new dcm rules contrariwise commissioner dawn stump spoke in support of ifus s self certification of its amended rule saying that under the commission s self certification regime ifus in the first instance must determine that its proposal complies with applicable law because no reliable data or empirical analysis supports a contrary conclusion she believed it was appropriate for the cftc not to object to ifus s self certification in recommending non objection of ifus s amended rule dmo acknowledged that speed bump functionalities might impact marketplaces both negatively and positively as a result it indicated that staff would monitor the impact of the use of pop functionality on liquidity price discovery competition and the potential for manipulation and disruptive trading ifus has not announced when it will implement its pop functionality in june 2016 the securities and exchange commission approved the investors exchange llc as a national securities exchange in announcing its approval the sec noted that an automated quotation system like iex would

designation as a dcm in may 2009 to trade us treasury futures contracts elx futures filed a request with the cftc for approval of a rule authorizing participants on the exchange to transact exchange of futures for futures transactions although the proposed rule was drafted in generic terms the purpose was to enable elx market participants to establish us treasury futures positions on elx while simultaneously liquidating functionally equivalent futures positions on the chicago board of trade or similarly to establish positions on cbot while concurrently liquidating functionally equivalent positions on elx the us treasury futures contracts on both elx and cbot were materially the same except those at elx cleared through the options clearing corporation while those at cbot cleared through the cme clearinghouse although the cftc did not agree with cbot s claim that elx s eff transactions constituted impermissible wash trades because each exchange s contract cleared through a different clearinghouse it did uphold the legitimacy of cbot s prohibition against use of eff s claiming that it was not an unreasonable restraint of trade or a material anticompetitive burden on

painting style than some of mr pollock s more spontaneously inspired creations but viewing it nevertheless made me reflect more on ms peirce s warning last week brian quintenz a cftc commissioner invoked the introduction to kurt vonnegut jr s satirical science fiction fantasy harrison bergeron in criticizing ifus s amended new rule that would permit speed bumps for the first time for us traded futures contracts he feared that the exchange s passive order protection functionality would negate speed innovation by certain traders and thus going forward might discourage innovation in futures markets generally he paralleled this to mr vonnegut s vision of a dystopian make believe america of 2081 where in the interest of equality those with natural advantages of any kind e g intelligence beauty physical strength are artificially handicapped with techniques and physical impediments e g techniques to scramble thoughts mandatory masks mandatory weights to neutralize their superiority mr

indicated that an fcm would not comply with the cftc s prohibition of guaranteeing a customer against loss if it included a limited or nonrecourse clause in a customer or non customer agreement jac indicated that an fcm must have the absolute right at all times to look to funds in all accounts of beneficial owner including accounts that are under different control as well as the right to call beneficial owner for funds this requirement said jac would preclude an fcm from restricting its ability to look for funds in different accounts of a beneficial owner that might be under different discretionary control or from agreeing not to call a beneficial owner for more funds in an account than the owner may have allocated to a manager for that account additionally jac noted that all accounts of a single beneficial owner for the same account classification must be viewed together when considering margin funds available for distribution to any individual account jac indicated that an fcm may determine to call individual accounts of a beneficial owner managed by different account controllers separately however when paying out individual accounts fcms must ensure that such

beneficial owner except in compliance with industry rules and regulations this includes requiring all accounts of a beneficial owner to be reviewed before paying out any individual account to ensure that the payout will not cause an aggregate margin deficiency and to maintain evidence of such review and determination it s important that fcms take steps to follow jac s guidance timely more briefly

lebanon s prime minister saad al hariri addresses his supporters during a commemoration ceremony marking the 13th anniversary of the assassination of his father in beirut lebanon february 14 2018 reuters mohamed azakir files by tom arnold london reuters lebanon s impasse in agreeing a credible fiscal reform plan and deteriorating global market conditions means it may struggle to refinance key foreign currency debts coming due this year unnerving overseas investors outright default can likely be averted in the short term by a government financing manoeuvre involving the central bank and local banks the main holders of its debt but this is only likely to be a stopgap and many foreign funds contacted said they would be reluctant to delve into new lebanese eurobonds until they assess reforms lebanon s cabinet talks will convene again on monday after about a dozen sessions so far without a deal against a backdrop of protests by public sector workers and retired soldiers over concerns about wage and pension cuts the government in february promised difficult and painful reforms to control spending prime minister saad al hariri has said this may be the most austere budget in lebanon s history at stake is investor support for new debt sales needed to help meet maturing eurobonds this week and again in november access to international markets has been compounded by fresh turbulence on emerging markets as the trade row between the united states and china blew up again and geopolitical tensions involving iran heightened lebanon with one of the world s highest public debt burdens has been buffeted by political paralysis and fallout from conflict in syria and iraq which has weighed on regional trade investment and travel a small open economy it has also been hit by a fall in money flowing in from its scattered diaspora which traditionally helped fund a large chunk of its financing needs the government is not even able to get its act together to deliver a comprehensible transparent budget nor did it present or formulate a credible medium term fiscal adjustment plan that strikes the right balance between the imperative of growth and fiscal consolidation said alia moubayed managing director at jefferies an international finance firm without a clear medium term economic and fiscal policy framework that addresses large external imbalances and given high levels of corruption and state capture investors will not be convinced to buy lebanon risk as donors will look with extra scrutiny before committing further funding the protracted budget process has pushed up the cost of insuring lebanon s debt in recent days to its highest level since jan 22 when it was struggling to form a government lebanon should be able to muddle through to find a solution to its most immediate debt headache a 650 million eurobond maturing on may 20 lebanon can pay back investors in this bond drawing on a foreign exchange transaction with the central bank a source familiar with the matter said the government has used the same unconventional approach to financing its deficit in the past the central bank would likely discount dollar denominated certificates of deposits for the banks to subscribe to in return for them buying long term domestic bonds said one banker familiar with the situation in parallel the central bank would do a swap with the finance ministry the issuer of the international debt the finance minister had previously said the government aimed to issue eurobonds in the range of 2 5 bln to 3 bln on may 20 to cover this maturity and lebanon s other maturing principle for 2019 a 1 5 billion issue due in november a source familiar with the matter told reuters on tuesday that lebanon might wait until emerging market investors have more appetite and the government has approved its budget the government is targeting international investors for around 20 percent of the new issue the government says it is committed to pay all maturing debt and interest payments on predetermined dates eurobond maturities this year would be met by issuing further eurobonds said garbis iradian chief mena economist at institute of international finance iif first they have to send a strong signal to the market by approving strong fiscal measures nassib ghobrial chief economist at lebanon s byblos bank said there was no risk to lebanon s foreign currency financing for this year because the central bank was committed to covering the hard currency needs but lebanon s economic challenges remain hefty its fiscal deficit ballooned to 11 2 percent of gross domestic product gdp last year from 6 1 percent the year before and its international reserves fell to 39 7 billion enough for 13 months of import coverage lebanon s cabinet made important progress on sunday in its debate over the draft budget which will have a deficit of 8 3 of gdp or less lebanon s finance minister ali hassan khalil said still that rebalancing could be tricky to achieve with anaemic economic growth jpmorgan forecasts recently revised its growth forecast down to 1 3 percent in 2019 warning of significant downside risks surrounding fiscal reforms while cabinet formation has supported sentiment delays in the execution of much needed reforms could dent confidence against the background of large fiscal and external deficits and high debt giyas gokkent of jpmorgan securities wrote in a note deep seated fiscal reforms including improving the business climate and fighting corruption could help accelerate growth and unlock the 11 billion in funding pledged by the international community at a special conference in april 2018 according to the iif that money hinges on such reforms qatar also said in january it will invest 500 million in lebanese government dollar bonds it is unclear whether that support has materialised still some prospective investors remain unconvinced we are underweight lebanon said sergey dergachev senior portfolio manager at germany based union investment there s very few items that make us feel confident about increasing our position as the problems haven t been solved on the ground and the long term plan remains quite weak dergachev said it would be tough for lebanon to issue at the moment given uncertainty over the u s china trade spat additional reporting by tom perry in beirut editing by toby

in life we decide things emotionally and then we try to justify them intellectually this is the best explanation that i can make for those people like myself who have worried about the consequences for america of a trade war with china i myself have recently faced the fact that if we re talking about facts china has very little leverage against united states in a trade war america will be the clear cut winner in this war and it won t be close we have been told for so long by the nexus of washington and wall street that a trade war would result in disaster for the united states that we have come to believe that it s true without critically thinking about it as a confirmed free trade guy i ve had to come to grips slowly that perhaps a trade war with china is the only way to restore true free trade the amount of business that china will lose in a trade war is indisputably larger than the u s we have understood this by existing well known facts and figures but there are still other arguments that worry ardent free traders a standard argument has been that since china is the largest foreign creditor with 1 trillion worth of u s treasury securities the united states cannot afford to make our foreign banker angry often referred to as the nuclear option the trade war chicken littles think that china could resort to wholesale dumping of u s treasury securities thereby raising u s interest rates and depressing the demand for u s government debt the consequent rapid increase in interest rates would be a shock to the u s economy and would send it into a recession the naysayers say that argument might have been true eight years ago or even six years ago or even four years ago but the world has changed a lot in just for years and those changes have changed my thinking the most substantial change is that donald trump is now president and barack obama is not the u s no longer needs to sacrifice its foreign policy and its economy in order to keep its banker happy the u s economy is still expanding and expanding at a faster rate under trump than it was under obama the dollar is stronger and the u s government bond market is in demand currently the yield on the 10 year u s treasury is 2 37 thanks to the beginnings of normalization of interest rate policy by the federal reserve the higher interest rates do not reflect actual demand for u s treasury securities instead they reflect a strong organic economy not dependent on quantitative easing or artificially low interest rates much of the world cannot say the same thing by contrast interest rates on the 10 year hong kong treasury note is 1 36 in singapore it s 2 13 in more developed countries like germany and japan the 10 year government notes are yielding negative interest rates as of friday in short if you want to buy government bonds the united states is the best value out there so regardless of what the chinese do with their u s debt there will still be buyers for united states treasury securities because 1 u s treasuries have high relative value compared to other countries 2 the dollar is strong and 3 the u s economy is strong even without super low interest rates besides the high relative value u s treasuries offer there are other reasons why china lacks leverage as a foreign banker the federal reserve has reduced their balance sheet by about 1 trillion since quantitative easing under obama it reached a high of about 5 trillion since the end of quantitative easing that position has been reduced to about 4 trillion if the chinese were to sell 1 trillion worth of u s government securities the federal reserve could buy them at any price china asks maybe the fed wouldn t want to buy them but consider this imagine a tweet where trump asks america if they want the federal reserve to buy back 1 trillion of american debt from china thereby 1 reducing our foreign debt and 2 guaranteeing a chinese loss on the debt by their own actions democrat heads would explode the chinese would be apologetic europe would condemn trump economists would huff and say harumpf but the mass of people would be with him and in this you can see what i meant people decide these things emotionally but it this case trump s argument is also backed up by facts and under any circumstances i can imagine intellectually i see america coming out a winner john ransom is politics and economics writer editor with offices in washington dc singapore you can find him on facebook here and here
g edward griffin the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve 5th edition american media 2010 see here to purchase the book g edward griffin enrolled in the college of financial planning in denver and received a certified public planner cfp designation in 1989 he is affiliated with the conservative john birch society and has served as the contributing editor of its new american magazine this book criticizes the federal reserve system here are some items a as griffin notes bankers make money from interest and this occurs when they lend money out interest accumulates on the debt and is paid to the bankers but there are problems with banks loaning out a lot of money for one the money that they are lending out is other people s savings if there is ever a run on the bank and depositors are demanding their money right then and there the bank will not be able to give it to them as george bailey said in it s a wonderful life the money is not stored in a safe but has been loaned out to other people second banks take a risk when they loan out money namely that it will not be paid back according to griffin one motive behind the creation of the federal reserve was to enable banks to loan out money with more impunity thereby allowing bankers to make more money from interest more reckless banks can be bailed out by the federal reserve which receives money from all of the member banks the government can also bail the reckless banks out or if the debtors fail to pay off their debts the federal reserve can print out more money and lend that out to the debtors b the problem that occurs when the federal reserve prints more money or releases more money into the system is inflation the already existing dollars become debased griffin acknowledges that as he writes the united states is not experiencing hyperinflation he believes that is due to foreigners taking american dollars out of the system when americans buy their products and foreigners buying up american debt if this were to cease hyperinflation would occur c historically griffin argues bankers have profited from war because they get to loan out money to both sides in the conflict ultimately griffin contends their desire is for a one world government griffin refers to documents that appear to promote a one world government griffin prominently features an enigmatic 1966 document entitled the report from iron mountain this document rhapsodizes about how war has historically consolidated nations and the author is looking for a different way to control people as griffin acknowledges nobody knows who wrote this or if the author was being serious griffin believes it comes from within the government establishment griffin also refers to environmentalist documents that lament the existence of humanity and promote a worldwide redistribution of wealth griffin doubts that the rich and powerful promoters of environmentalism seriously care about the environment they invest in industries that pollute the environment in the case of gorbachev he presided over the soviet union s horrible environmental policy for griffin they are merely using the environment as an excuse for moving towards a one world government if people fear environmental disaster they will support a global government to redress the problem d griffin responds to standard historical scenarios against the charge that the federal reserve was created to add stability and to prevent the sorts of panics that preceded its creation griffin contends that many banks prior to the federal reserve were behaving irresponsibly by printing out money and further detaching its value from metals they were moving in the opposite direction from the sound money system that griffin supports in short moreover financial disasters have continued to exist even after the creation of the federal reserve against the charge that prominent wall streeters feared and opposed the creation of the federal reserve griffin contends that this was all for show for prominent financiers helped to create the federal reserve according to griffin teddy roosevelt and j p morgan shared more common ground than people think griffin challenges conventional explanations for why financiers financed the bolshevik revolution e g to help one country over another in world war i showing that the financiers were inconsistent in that case griffin seems to think that financiers supported the bolsheviks to create a formidable international enemy which would result in wars and higher defense budgets bankers would provide the money for that the communists meanwhile accept capitalist money for the sake of their own survival but they hope to hang the capitalists with the rope that the capitalists provide griffin provides quotes to that effect against the charge that easy credit was necessary to finance the early economic development and expansion of the u s griffin speculates that this could have occurred through economically responsible means had they been tried griffin also offers some civil war revisionism some of that resembled contemporary defenses of the confederacy that through tariffs the north was trying to reduce the south to economic servitude and dependence on the north that the south invested a lot of capital in slavery and that the south did not really want slavery anyway since people who are paid to work are more motivated griffin is far from being pro confederacy however for he states that bankers were also financing the confederate cause some of them supported the creation of a southern empire that would unite with latin american nations napolean also gets a cameo as a rebel against the financial establishment albeit for self serving reasons e griffin also responds to what is considered to be conventional knowledge for example the conventional view is that the imf and world bank pressure countries to embrace free market capitalism and austerity in government spending griffin observes however that they have lent to communist countries and he notes that these lenders give to governments such a policy contributes to statism not a free market f griffin is critical of various proposals to redress the problems that he discusses one proposal is to eliminate the federal reserve and to have the federal government itself print the money there are also the proposals of milton friedman and supply side economists which try to limit the money supply but still presume that the government should print out money the balanced budget amendment will not work because the congress can circumvent it in case of an emergency whatever it defines that to be what griffin seems to advocate is a privatized money system as people trade in the money that they choose he thinks people should trade in metals however as that provides more stability griffin also offers a solution as to how banks can store up money while also lending some out for business development griffin is not overly optimistic that his plans will be effected for the establishment fiercely guards its power but he thinks that reform can come sometime down the road people can throw out the big spenders from congress and they can store up metal coins in case of an emergency g there were parts of this book that were difficult for me to understand since i can improve my knowledge of economics one point that griffin reiterates is that debt backs up today s money and if that debt were repaid the money supply would vanish therefore bankers do not really want the debt to be repaid i did not entirely follow that h there are some indications in griffin s book that things are more complex than his overall scenario indicates he acknowledges that the federal reserve wants to limit inflation since bankers do well when the economy does well he states that a significant amount of the federal debt is owed not to the federal reserve but to americans who have bought bonds to default on that would hurt their savings that differs somewhat from his scenario in which the fed prints out a bunch of money for the government and would rather that money not be paid back i i have been watching robert shiller s yale class on financial markets the 2011 one shiller states that prior to the fdic there really was no insurance of banks griffin argues however that people will naturally gravitate towards banks that are insured without the government stepping in griffin is highly optimistic about the ability of laissez faire capitalism to resolve problems j this is the fifth edition it has new sections on the 2008 financial crisis much of the book focuses on the 1980 s however plus there is one part of the book in which saddam hussein is presumed to be in power in iraq and griffin doubts that will end anytime soon some may have a problem with this format as it is chronologically disjointed i had no problem with it but i cite it as something to remember in reading this book in conclusion this book is interesting and well documented griffin does well to argue that there are people who act for their self interest and influence policy to do so he did not successfully explain however how a one world government would serve these financial interests the book has a lot of the typical john bircher tropes but goes deeper and provides more nuance each chapter ends with a lucid summary which is helpful i checked out this book from the library my review is honest
sara megan walsh swalsh theledger com lakeland the nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis and lakeland is not an exception brenda petty moore said she was shocked when she was forced to confront the reality of the city s apartment rental market last year she and her brother charles moore were given an eviction notice forcing them to move out of swan cove apartments last may after a leaky roof caused significant mold issues the notice kicked off a frustrating hunt for an affordable two bedroom apartment priced at 950 a month or less it took more than four months to find a relatively reasonable place to move to and rent petty moore said it s a bad situation in lakeland i couldn t believe it but as i talked to more people i discovered it is a common problem the city is experiencing a shortage of quality affordable housing for its residents because of several market issues and the city has little to no influence over many of those forces mayor bill mutz admitted we don t have control he said key factors include a shortage of housing supply skyrocketing development costs and a growing population according to a study produced for the city by lakeland based kimley horn associates during the past two years in the study a household was considered affordable if the total cost of rent or mortgage payments taxes utility fees and insurance made up no more than 30 of the household s gross income there are national challenges and there are these local challenges senior project manager william roll of kimley horn associates said the national challenges are orders of magnitude bigger than the local challenges wages vs rent in lakeland and across the country workers wages have not kept pace with increasing land and construction costs theresa maio the city s planning and housing manager calculated an employee needs to earn a minimum wage of 17 90 an hour to afford a one bedroom apartment or make at least 22 10 for a two bedroom apartment in lakeland assuming a 40 hour work week however the median income is only 39 706 per year or a little more than 19 an hour for petty moore her search for an apartment was complicated because she was semi retired out of work and recovering from a hip replacement surgery her brother is employed full time by sykes enterprises but the rental rates of 1 100 to 1 300 a month would have financially stressed their budget i had to ask when did lakeland reach that point of asking so much for a two bedroom one bathroom apartment petty moore said i was not expecting those inflated prices the cost of renting an apartment is rapidly rising nationwide the city s study found the total number of housing units priced at 800 a month shrank by 2 while there was a 97 increase in apartments rented for 2 000 or more a month in 2017 petty moore who is a senior citizen like 52 7 of the city s households said she considered moving into a senior housing development to find a lower priced apartment or condominium however she said many restricted communities already have a waiting list of a year or more lack of affordability we built 64 apartments in wauchula and it filled up the day that we got the sticker of occupancy said gene strickland a real estate broker for developers and former lakeland city manager it had a list from here to the parking lot of people waiting it was pathetic strickland worked with fort lauderdale based green mills group on aida palms a 96 unit north lakeland affordable housing complex that opened in july 2017 the complex was fully leased upon its grand opening they never even saw the apartments they were getting said amanda steuwe community manager for aida palms steuwe said the complex had a waiting list of more than 800 individuals seeking to rent a unit and each day it continues to increase since 2017 she d only had a handful of people move out and a few evictions we have a 100 renewal rate she said there are 27 complexes offering more than 3 200 affordable apartments for rent in polk county to low income families and seniors in 2018 these units were 98 2 occupied according to data compiled by the florida housing finance corp a nonprofit created by the state legislature roughly 35 years ago to help provide affordable housing opportunities for residents the organization estimates more than 9 700 additional apartments are needed to provide adequate housing for the county s low income residents we don t do market studies anymore the day we finish construction it s filled strickland said aida palms is the only apartment complex of five units or more to be completed within the city since 2016 the city doesn t track apartment buildings of less than five units mutz has said he hopes to see 500 new units built by 2023 the proposed 305 unit mirrorton development by the tampa based framework group is awaiting its final permits from the city the 80 unit east parker street development proposed by green mills could help the city meet its goal if construction moves forward making the leap renter to owner another factor compounding issues in the apartment rental market is florida s record low homeownership rate it s estimated only 64 1 of residents owned their homes in 2017 slightly above the national average but still down from the state s 66 3 average during the past 34 years according to figures released by the state in september apartments now capture more revenue than they ever have and homeownership is at the lowest level in 50 years affordability is at the heart of that said bob adams owner and president of highland homes the lakeland based builder with more than 40 years experience said he has seen first time buyers squeezed out of the market because of increasing home prices and the federal government gradually increasing interest rates jeff bagwell one of the founders of the keystone challenge fund said while home costs are a factor it s more a matter of financially burdened renters being able to save a few dollars and cents the biggest issue with low and moderate income people is down payment assistance and closing costs he said they are used to paying rent they can pay 800 a month rent bagwell said he meets an increasing number of individuals financially buried under student debt people come in here all the time with 20 30 or 40 000 in student loans and i ask did you get your degree he said they tell me no bagwell said potential homeowners who are trapped with a large monthly student loan payment and spending up to 50 of their income on rent often rely on federal or state assistance to help bridge the gap housing a priority the keystone challenge fund receives money indirectly from the state filtered through polk county and the city of lakeland to offer low to moderate income families with down payment assistance and closing costs the funds come from the state housing initiatives partnership program the keystone challenge fund and lakeland s community redevelopment agency are out of assistance funds for the current fiscal year and its future ship funding is still being calculated maio said lakeland is slated to receive funding from the u s department of housing and urban development of 935 111 in community block development grants down 4 4 from 2018 that can be used for property acquisition housing rehabilitation or to benefit a public service in addition the city will receive 362 966 in home investment partnership program funds down 13 from last year to offer aid to low income households through down payment assistance or rehabilitation the city held a public meeting may 13 to solicit input from residents on how these federal funds would be best spent the state s doc stamp tax raised more than 335 million for the sadowski trust fund but lawmakers approved only about 200 million will be used for affordable housing as was the fund s original intent half of the state funding has been set aside to help hurricane michael victims with another 8 million solely for workforce housing in jacksonville the remaining cities and counties across florida including lakeland have to figure out how to split the remaining 77 million fairly maio said it is unclear exactly how much lakeland will receive but she hopes it will be a slight increase from roughly 150 000 in 2018 if there s no funding that hurts my entry level buyers they can t save up the down payment bagwell said if i can t put them into entry level houses they are staying in apartments longer which of course causes a crunch priced out it s not that there aren t homes being built in lakeland in 2018 the city issued more than 400 permits for construction of single family homes according to jason wiley lakeland s business development manager wiley said that s more than double the city s yearly average despite this construction there s a shortage of houses for sale on the market sending the average sale price higher in january 2019 approximately 300 homes were sold according to wiley out of approximately 900 that are on the market that s enough to meet three months of demand by comparison he said there were approximately 1 800 houses on the market five years ago what is a concern is the lack of inventory he said there s not many opportunities we are in a very competitive sellers market buyers are seeing fewer choices and the demand has caused the average price of a lakeland home to rise above 200 000 it s a number we haven t seen before wiley said lakeland s options mayor mutz said he recognizes that lakeland s study states the city has little to no direct control over many of the factors controlling housing affordability one of its first recommendations was for the city to conduct a study and reassess its impact fees or a charge to developers for improvements the city needs to make to roadways sidewalks or other structures due to the new construction tom wodrich the city s chief planner for community and economic development said the city already reviews its impact fees every five years and a study is currently underway the commission unanimously decided at its may 7 planning meeting to commit 250 000 each year starting in fiscal year 2020 to help address the city s housing issues everyone says affordable housing is something we should do but you have to build a plan around it mutz said looking within maio said lakeland community redevelopment agency has whittled a list of more than 700 properties down to a group of 116 parcels totaling 40 acres that could be suitable for housing projects the majority of the 116 properties are less than 1 acre in size each according to maio and zoned for single family housing we hear a lot of criticism around the community about how much land the city owns and we re sitting on this stock commissioner scott franklin said i really hope we can set some aggressive goals to get this property off our roll and into constructive uses maio said city staff believes some of the sites could be combined into larger plots that may be attractive to developers she said it provides an opportunity to create housing for what s called the missing middle like townhouses that provide an incremental step between moving from multi family apartments to a larger single family lot maio presented a draft concept for olive street townhouses that proposes eight 1 500 square foot townhomes be built side by side to provide transitional missing middle housing lakeland commissioners have not yet decided how the 250 000 they agreed to set aside each year to address housing affordability will be spent maio suggested the city could set it up as a revolving loan fund or offer some type of affordable housing incentive the city will hold a june 28 workshop on its affordable housing policies and goals for the 2020 fiscal year we do everything else well mutz said we bring in new companies but if we don t bring places for people who are in the workforce to live then we haven t finished our job sara

update global politics remain at the fore into tuesday s session with brexit indian elections and us china trade all prominent market driving factors on the brexit front pm may is expected to meet with her cabinet on tuesday to discuss options to break the current brexit impasse with limited expectations for may s withdrawal agreement bill to pass the early june house of commons vote cabinet ministers are expected to explore alternative options with the potential for a fresh round of indicative votes meanwhile the hunt for may s successor appears to be in full swing with boris johnson leading the conservative party polls while a change of leadership could inject some energy into the process may s replacement is expected to be of the euro sceptic hue which would be seen as elevating the odds of a no deal outcome the perceived risk of a no deal brexit has probably risen in the past few weeks there s a kind of acceptance that there will be a new prime minister who will probably be a eurosceptic wrote developed markets economist james smith with such levels of political uncertainty the sterling s continued to decline against major peers with little on the horizon to suggest a reversal in sentiment in the near term meanwhile in india stocks recorded their strongest intr day rally in over three years following further exit polls pointing to a bharatiya janata party led coalition victory the indian rupee also strengthened 1 1 versus the us dollar the outperformance of indian markets and the currency since february reflects increased investor confidence of the incumbent staying in power said economist prakash sakpal at ing elsewhere us china tension looks set to continue following washington s crackdown of chinese telecomms giant huawei advertisement in response to president trump s continued tweets in which he blamed china stating they had a deal but china changed it chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang denied that china had agreed to anything lu kang said we don t know what this agreement is the united states is talking about perhaps the united states has an agreement they all along had extravagant expectations for but it s certainly not a so called agreement that china agreed to the dollar s relative safe haven status saw it climb to a two week high on tuesday incumbent scott morrison managed to secure a majority government in the australian election indian leader modi also managed to hold on to power trump delays tariffs on japan and the eurozone but the matter is far from settled the markets are off to a quite start to the week which is perhaps a welcome change given the last two mondays have been extremely volatile due to flare ups in the us china trade war stock markets are generally flat as are most currencies with the stand out being the australian dollar which is higher after the weekend election which saw the incumbent prime minister scott morrison secure a majority government exit polls suggested the labor party could win for the first time in six years but morrison pulled ahead and won over the necessary 76 seats for a majority leading to the resignation of labor leader bill shorten currencies tend to respond well to majority governments especially conservative ones and the aud is higher by around 1 however with several rates cuts expected this year it will be hard for aud to make any sustained move higher staying with politics the exit polls in the indian election also show the incumbent modi is likely to win elsewhere there are more elections to look forward to in austria after vice chancellor strache from the far right fpö party resigned over a corruption scandal yet these events aren t likely to drive global markets which are still very much focused on the escalations in the trade war last week saw many risk markets recover as president trump tried to strike a positive tone on china and also side stepped a fresh front to the war with japan and the eurozone for now the us china trade tension seems to be quite enough for president trump with a delay of at least 180 days the us has avoided a further escalation of the trade war on the japanese and european fronts despite this delay however tariffs are still possible if negotiations between the us eu and japan fail the conflict may well escalate again reported ing 180 days is plenty time for the markets to focus on other matters and recover but this issue is a challenge to all concerned and could come back to trouble the markets if it weren t for the break down in talks with china president trump may have been much tougher and imposed tariffs straight away here s ing with more insight currently trade negotiations are at an impasse the us is demanding access to the eu and japanese agricultural markets which has been met with resistance japan is demanding a similar advantage to the us in return this would be an unlikely compromise for the us since the white house views the current terms of trade with japan as unfair the eu has stated that access to its agricultural market is not part of the negotiations as it doesn t have a mandate from its member states to negotiate access to the agri food market it is hard to imagine that the eu will budge on this issue as agriculture has also proved to be one of the most sensitive and difficult topics in the abandoned ttip negotiations if the china matter is resolved when the 180 days are up japan and the eurozone could be next in line and the euro in particular could fall heavily politics continues to be one of the main drivers of gbp and while brexit news has lessened in recent weeks the conservative labour talks look to have collapsed and have taken sterling with it gbp fell to its weakest level since february and eurgbp is comfortably back above 0 87 theresa may promised to make a bold offer and set out a new and improved brexit deal as she tries to pass her eu withdrawal treaty at the fourth attempt in early june although the new offer is said to include improvements on workers rights labour leader jeremy corbyn is widely quoted as being sceptical of any deal passing and hence a june agreement is already facing headwinds on previous occasions the gbp would rally mildly on the news of a change in the impasse and this could very well happen again in the coming week however overall we remain skeptical reported danske bank
over the short run the aud usd could get a boost from the election results but gains are likely to be limited and prices could fall further because of the weakening economy and the expected rate cut the australian and new zealand dollars took big hits last week as bearish traders increased their bets for a rate cut by the reserve bank of australia rba and the reserve bank of new zealand the catalyst for most of the selling pressure was a rise in the australian unemployment rate strengthening u s economic data and increased concerns over u s china trade relations also pressured the aussie and the kiwi last week the aud usd settled at 6868 down 0 0131 or 1 87 and the nzd usd finished at 6514 down 0 0085 or 1 29 australian dollar last week s trade centered on the australian labor market the wage price index came in at 0 5 falling below the 0 6 forecast the employment change showed the economy added 28 4k in april well above the 15 2k estimate the prior month was revised higher to 27 7k the unemployment rate rose to 5 2 up from the upwardly revised 5 1 traders were looking for a reading of 5 0 although the economy added more jobs than expected the aud usd plunged last month because part time jobs represented most of the gains while full time jobs fell furthermore the unemployment rate rose to its highest level in eight months this data cemented views the rba may be forced to lower rates soon to stimulate the economy in other news australian home loans fell 2 5 percent well below the forecast for a 2 2 increase the prior month was also revised lower to 1 4 this report indicates that the weakening economy is having a negative effect on australian housing demand westpac consumer sentiment also fell from 1 9 to 0 6 indicating consumers are turning soft on the economy there were no major reports out of new zealand last week but producer inflation input and output came in well below the forecasts positive reports from the u s and steady tone by most fed speakers also weighed on the aussie and kiwi in the u s the key positive developments were a jump in the empire state manufacturing index from 10 1 to 17 8 a surge in the philly fed manufacturing index from 8 5 to 16 6 and better than expected housing starts data weekly unemployment claims also showed a strengthening jobs market coming in at 212k lower than the 220k forecast story continues the biggest drag on the aussie and kiwi was the unexpected rise in consumer sentiment according to the university of michigan consumer sentiment jumped to 102 4 soundly beating the 97 8 forecast this helped reduce the chances of a u s recession and a rate cut by the fed weekly forecast over the week end australia s prime minister scott morrison swept his conservative liberal coalition to victory he also vowed to get straight back to work after a shock win saw him re elected for three more years according to bloomberg the australian dollar is set to strengthen against the greenback after the nation s center right government clung to power in a surprise election victory at the weekend the news is potentially bullish because it takes the labor party s tax proposals off the table this should give some relief to the housing market furthermore with the incumbent government being viewed as stronger economic managers business sentiment is expected to improve according to andrew ticehurst sydney based rate strategist at nomura holding inc it s a net positive for the equity market and the australian dollar will likely bounce he added mid to longer term outlook over the short run the aud usd could get a boost from the election results but gains are likely to be limited and prices could fall further because of the weakening economy and the expected rate cut but let s assume that a rate cut has been nearly priced into the market traders just aren t sure if it will come in june july or august in its recent monetary policy statements the rba has said that a lack of improvement in the labor market would warrant a rate cut so last week s data is likely to be of great concern to them traders are now placing a 50 50 chance of a cut in june the data has increased the risk the reserve bank of australia rba will cut the cash rate in june earlier than our call of july said kaixin owyong sydney based economist at national australia bank in other news investors will be keeping an eye on u s china trade relations which apparently came to a standstill on friday according reports reports said the two economic powerhouses basically shut down trade talks after the u s basically hit hauwei with new sanctions with the election results added to the equation traders should look for volatility and a two sided trade the news isn t likely to sway the rba from raising rates but it does bring hope to the economy according to the election results this article was originally posted on fx empire more from fxempire
china s possibility of dumping its massive holdings of u s debt has long been considered a nuclear option to force the united states to capitulate in the ongoing trade war despite the threat this has an almost zero change of happening news analysis a may 13 tweet by the editor of a state run chinese newspaper set off speculation that china may stop buying u s debt and begin selling treasurys hu xijin chief editor of the hawkish newspaper global times said in a tweet on may 13 that chinese scholars are discussing the possibility of dumping u s treasuries and how to do it specifically china s possibility of dumping its massive holdings of u s debt has long been considered a nuclear option to force the united states to capitulate in the ongoing trade war some believe that a massive sale could trigger a sudden increase in u s interest rates and hurt the u s economy despite the threat this has an almost zero chance of happening it would have little impact on the u s economy and would only be counterproductive for china partially driving the ongoing angst is that china s stockpile of u s treasurys has actually been decreasing china s holdings as of the end of march fell by 10 billion its first drop since november 2018 to a two year low of 1 12 trillion according to data released by the u s treasury department on may 15 while 10 billion sounds high it s actually quite small it s a less than 1 percent change from the prior month large demand for us paper in theory china can increase the u s government s borrowing costs by dumping treasurys china is the biggest holder of u s treasurys since replacing japan over 10 years ago japan is currently no 2 with 1 08 trillion held china has been one of the biggest consumers of u s debt and an enabler in washington s recent ramp up of debt issuances and last year when beijing officials threatened to halt treasury purchases the bond markets were temporarily spooked the biggest risk conceptually is that the united states is staring down 1 trillion in annual budget deficits and if china suddenly stops being such a willing lender borrowing costs could rise but some analysts have ignored the fact that while china trimmed its holdings in march other foreign ownership actually increased japan increased its net holdings by 10 billion and overseas investors overall snapped up about 88 billion in march the buying activity is no doubt buoyed by the fact that treasurys overall rallied during march due to volatility in the equity markets with the 10 year benchmark touching a 2019 low point of 2 34 percent at one point bond price moves inversely with yield selling would prove counterproductive that s one of the biggest deterrents to china s fire sale of treasurys there is nowhere else for china or other countries to store their money u s bonds are the highest yielding in the developed world especially considering the near zero risk of default and it has a deep and liquid market the two biggest rivals to u s treasurys are german bonds and japanese government bonds but both of those papers lack the depth of market and variety of terms and perhaps the biggest limitations are their negative yields for terms less than 10 years gold is an alternative for china and it has been slowly increasing its allocation but gold is far less liquid and has high carrying costs in addition there simply isn t enough gold supply for china to quickly replace a sizable portion of its 1 12 trillion in treasurys and if mainstream economists are correct that the u s economy is in its late cycle then treasury prices will rise over the next few years should a recession hit in other words if china chooses to become a large seller there should be more than enough potential willing buyers what about the exchange rate dumping treasurys would put downward pressure on the u s dollar a weaker dollar would make u s corporations more productive internationally and lower costs of u s goods potentially decreasing the effectiveness of china s tariffs on american made products if china does go through with its threat even assuming few other foreign buyers the federal reserve alone should be able to mitigate its impact a study of the fed s quantitative easing following the last financial crisis its systematic purchases of treasurys produced some salient data points each purchase of treasurys amounting to 10 percent of gdp produced a 50 basis point 0 5 percent decrease in the 10 year treasury bond yields according to a 2016 research report by the peterson institute for international economics in other words purchases of treasurys by central banks equating to 1 percent of gdp would typically cause a 5 basis point decrease in bond yields assuming the same dynamic applies to selling bonds quantitative tightening we can predict the impact of a chinese bond sale liquidating all its treasury holdings amounts to selling bonds worth almost 6 percent of u s gdp based on the above this would increase treasury yields by around 30 basis points or 0 3 percent and that quantum is well within the ability of the fed to cure it would simply swing into quantitative easing mode and snap up the bonds
imposing tariffs on china and other nations trying to send their goods to the u s not only raises the prices of those products for americans it also gives targeted nations an incentive to develop markets and long term trade ties in other countries at the same time those foreign nations can retaliate by cutting purchases of american goods or by slapping retaliatory tariffs of their own on american products making them less competitive gerald f seib u s risks overusing its economic weapons wall street journal may 14 2019 trump might believe that he can bully beijing into accepting a one sided enforcement mechanism under which the united states is allowed to impose retaliatory tariffs in case of a dispute while china is not that simply isn t going to happen nor will china agree to stop subsidizing industries asians have subsidized capital intensive industries since japan s 1868 meiji restoration and that won t change any time soon forced technology transfers to china are for the most part mythical the reality is that america s largest technology companies from intel to boeing are lining up to hand their technology to china in the context of their strategy for china s domestic market the emerging consensus is that trump isn t fooling anyone at the end of the day he wants a deal as much as do the chinese david p goldman buy chinese stocks on the dip may 6 2019 it s a classic conflict battle between cycles geocosmic and technical studies and fundamentals many of the world s stock indices bottomed early last week after 2 3 weeks of tumultuous declines these same equity markets then rallied nicely into the end of the week before starting to pullback by the close on friday the entire period was bookended by the sun uranus conjunction of april 22 and the venus uranus conjunction of may 17 when uranus is prominent financial markets often become chaotic and unstable the dramatic turns in equity markets often mirror the dramatic reversals in political and economic thinking fundamentals thus we have a condition where the studies of cycles and technical analysis indicate a correction should be over and a huge rally consistent with the geocosmic placement of jupiter in sagittarius should resume yet at the same time the prominence of uranus has investors on edge because of the sudden reversal in trade talks especially between the u s and china but also between the u s and europe and maybe other nations this is exacerbated further by the president as he puts into action new tariffs which are akin to taxes on the u s consumer which in turn wipes out much of the economic gains that were initiated with his december 21 2017 tax reform act the two things we must constantly remind ourselves of from the geocosmic perspective is this jupiter in sagittarius november 8 2018 through december 2 2019 is theoretically a time when world trade increases trade deals would normally naturally be unfolding and worldwide economic growth would normally be expanding secondly at the same time jupiter is in a three passage series of a waning square aspects to neptune january september 2019 the waning square is arguably the most difficult of all aspects to navigate easily through under such a combination one must be careful not to believe anything you read or hear for jupiter tends to exaggerate especially in sagittarius and neptune tends to distract and veer far away from facts or truth when one believes what is written or spoken there is a risk of being misled a setup for a major disappointment when things don t go the way you were led to expect it is a time of disillusionment false hopes and futile wishes thus financial markets like stocks rally because the investment community believes a trade deal is imminent and then when it is suddenly alleged that one side has broken a promise typical allegation under jupiter neptune and trade talks fall apart the markets hemorrhage and a mini crisis erupts that is what happened april 22 may 17 we saw this sudden reversal characteristic of uranus erupt in bitcoin too since april 22 a primary cycle bottomed on april 26 at 4983 right in the middle of saturn and pluto also turning retrograde then in classical uranus fashion especially in the money sign of taurus bitcoin exploded to a 9 month high of 8390 on may 16 by friday may 17 just one day later it fell over 20 to 6620 the uncertainty and confusion in the political and economic realm also buoyed treasury prices higher as a safe haven location for investors to park monies until the trade dispute clears up the ten year notes are near 125 approaching their highest level since late 2017 usually when t notes go up interest rates come down the u s dollar goes down but not this time not under hard uranus signatures where the norm no longer applies the dollar is going up and combined with the chinese cessation of buying soybeans from the u s as a result of the u s increased tariffs on chinese goods led to soybean prices falling below 8 00 bu last week something not seen in over 10 years the president says that the tariffs on chinese goods will be used to subsidize farmers going broke but the problem is that farmers don t want to make money through government subsidies while their crop is wasted they want to sell their crop they worked hard to produce when american farmers lose their markets other nations will establish ties with china and other countries and u s farmers may not regain their market share for a long time short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts we recommend that as you continue to negotiate new trade deals with our allies you pursue the endgame goal of zero tariffs you have said on several occasions that your objective is not protectionism but to create a level playing field on trade you have even suggested to our allies that both sides drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies your council of economic advisors report the average american tariff is 3 5 while the average eu rate is 5 and china is nearly 10 we also believe that securing zero for zero trade deals would result in an expansion of global commerce that would reduce poverty and add trillions of dollars to the global economic output it will help make the u s and world economies great again steve forbes fred smith stephen moore and arthur laffler of the committee to unleash prosperity mr president it s time for zero tariffs wall street journal october 18 2018 and quoted in the forecast 2019 book foreign ministry spokesman lu kang laid out conditions for a return to negotiations first principles that means there has to be mutual respect equality and mutual benefit second good faith one must match words with actions lin zhu china plays down u s trade talks wall street journal may 17 2019 last week s column elicited a lot of response from trump supporters questioning whether i think the u s and the white house should let china just run over americans i think the point i am making was missed i am entirely for the white house negotiating in good faith for the best and fairest deal it can make to help americans and i believe the chinese should and will do the same my intent is much simpler it is to alert readers to the consequences danger of using tariffs as a weapon to force the other side s hand in negotiations the history of doing so is not a pretty one it was a major cause that led the world into the great depression and by extension world war ii when the tariffs first started in early 2018 when soybeans were trading over 30 higher many commentators stated it would not lead to a trade war this column warned otherwise indeed it is a trade war now and it just keeps escalating remember you cannot believe what you read and hear under jupiter square neptune promises made are not usually kept and now we are approaching the heart of the jupiter neptune square june 9 24 a time when many anticipate that the two leaders china and the u s will meet at the next g 20 meeting and work out a deal again it is the major aspect of the year and it pertains to disillusionment and grandiose false hopes and perhaps announcements that will likely not be deliverable upon critical examination i am not sure if a more inopportune cosmic time could have been chosen for an agreement to be made that will hold up over time but let s briefly switch gears to the shorter term cosmic outlook the venus uranus conjunction ends this weekend concurrent with the full moon in scorpio venus and scorpio are money indicators venus and taurus rule the accumulation saving of monies as well as agreements with uranus it is hard to come by an agreement because uranus is a maverick a rebel and not prone to agreeing to anything that it views as restrictive to its independence to do whatever it wishes scorpio pertains to the leveraging debt process of dealing with finances the debt continues to escalate in the u s and is becoming a greater concern again not to mention that china owns much of that debt via its u s treasury holdings because they act like taxes and taxes are also a scorpio matter the tariffs are front and center on investors minds right now however the turbulence of markets may start to calm down shortly as developments of resuming trade talks are announced until we get to june 9 24 the sun and mercury both enter the intellectual and talkative sign of gemini this week on may 21 this is followed by a new moon in gemini on june 3 4 this implies many discussions taking place a lot of new and innovative ideas developed to solve problems if only the thinkers could reflect a moment and focus on each of these ideas fully and not be tempted to dismiss them for more new ideas before seriously considering those that are already on the table the danger is that negotiators and leaders become too scattered too restless and unfocused creating a sense of nervousness and inability to come to a solid plan before the dung hits the fan june 9 24 and then it is back to square one again with all the hurried activity present may 21 june 4 investors are vulnerable to being duped into believing that a deal is ready to be cemented only to be disappointed again because it hasn t been well thought out june will probably be the month where we see who really wants and needs a deal the most who is most desperate for a deal and who is most prepared to make a good deal the most impatient party loses the same can be said about the most inflexible party impatience and inflexibility are characteristics that can lead to another major disappointment let s hope our leaders can rise above this and do something good that will be fair equitable and benefit the entire world if not we just get closer and closer to the capricorn stellium with saturn and pluto conjunct in january 2020 the consequences of today s decisions and actions are likely to manifest then

this article is more than 4 years old the trading week ending friday may 17 saw the russian ruble atop the list of foreign exchange performance rankings thereby joining the yen and swiss franc in making gains against the dollar at a time when risk appetite has been firmly off thanks to the ongoing us chinese trade tensions apart from the israeli shekel it seems the russian currency was also the only central eastern europe middle east and africa ceemea currency to rally against the euro that momentum has now carried forward into the current week at the time of writing 11 40 est on monday may 20 the ruble had gained 0 5 versus the dollar changing hands at rub 64 45 and was up 0 4 to trade at rub 71 94 against the euro a direct correlation can be drawn into between rising oil prices and the ruble s uptick while demand for russian sovereign bonds currently at their highest levels since august 2018 on expectations the country s central bank would cut interest rates soon to send yields lower while boosting prices is also being seen as supportive for the currency higher and firmer oil prices remain the key driver the ruble rose in near tandem with us iranian tensions pushing brent crude prices up by 2 5 per barrel last week on perceived risks of supply disruptions as washington and tehran exchanged heated words in an escalating geopolitical tussle subsequently opec and its russian led non opec crude producing partners indicated they would probably maintain production cuts which have helped support prices this year following their ministerial monitoring committee meeting known as the jmmc on sunday may 19 in jeddah saudi arabia market conjecture suggests the russians want to ditch the ongoing production cuts that have resulted in 1 2 million barrels per day bpd of crude oil being take out of the global supply pool but played along in jeddah at least until all parties meet again in vienna austria on june 26 while russia thinks the job of market rebalancing is done and wants to raise production opec s de facto leader saudi arabia is worried about a possible price crash that a potential output increase might end up causing end result is that moscow has opec where it wants it on paper the russians undertake just over a sixth 230 000 bpd of headline 1 2 million bpd cut and appear to be sticking to it the output cuts have helped oil prices to rise more than 30 this far into the current trading year but brent the global proxy benchmark remains stubbornly range bound oscillating in the 70 75 per barrel bracket given demand concerns in the wake of the us china trade tiff european slowdown and brexit chaos moscow appears to be at peace with oil prices above 60 per barrel and russian energy minister alexander novak has made little secret of it from time to time novak subtly dangles the threat of the russians breaking ranks and upping production his words in jeddah as cited by cnbc were in a similar vein we are supportive of continuing our cooperation with our colleagues from other countries but this continuation could depend to various extents on how the situation unfolds and what the forecasts for supply and demand will be on the market if it turns out that there will be a shortfall in the market then we will be prepared to examine options linked with a possible increase in production should russia decide to go its own way opec which i have always said lacks an exit strategy for the ongoing cuts will be in more than a spot of bother it is already grappling with market share issues at it bids to support prices the end of opec non opec cooperation has to come at some point sooner rather than later but until then ruble traders quite used to short term volatility can look to the upside for the oil linked currency

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by tom arnold london reuters lebanon s impasse in agreeing a credible fiscal reform plan and deteriorating global market conditions means it may struggle to refinance key foreign currency debts coming due this year unnerving overseas investors outright default can likely be averted in the short term by a government financing maneuver involving the central bank and local banks the main holders of its debt related stories but this is only likely to be a stopgap and many foreign funds contacted said they would be reluctant to delve into new lebanese eurobonds until they assess reforms lebanon s cabinet talks will convene again on monday after about a dozen sessions so far without a deal against a backdrop of protests by public sector workers and retired soldiers over concerns about wage and pension cuts the government in february promised difficult and painful reforms to control spending prime minister saad al hariri has said this may be the most austere budget in lebanon s history at stake is investor support for new debt sales needed to help meet maturing eurobonds this week and again in november access to international markets has been compounded by fresh turbulence on emerging markets as the trade row between the united states and china blew up again and geopolitical tensions involving iran heightened lebanon with one of the world s highest public debt burdens has been buffeted by political paralysis and fallout from conflict in syria and iraq which has weighed on regional trade investment and travel a small open economy it has also been hit by a fall in money flowing in from its scattered diaspora which traditionally helped fund a large chunk of its financing needs graphic lebanon foreign reserves the government is not even able to get its act together to deliver a comprehensible transparent budget nor did it present or formulate a credible medium term fiscal adjustment plan that strikes the right balance between the imperative of growth and fiscal consolidation said alia moubayed managing director at jefferies an international finance firm without a clear medium term economic and fiscal policy framework that addresses large external imbalances and given high levels of corruption and state capture investors will not be convinced to buy lebanon risk as donors will look with extra scrutiny before committing further funding the protracted budget process has pushed up the cost of insuring lebanon s debt in recent days to its highest level since jan 22 when it was struggling to form a government lebanon should be able to muddle through to find a solution to its most immediate debt headache a 650 million eurobond maturing on may 20 lebanon can pay back investors in this bond drawing on a foreign exchange transaction with the central bank a source familiar with the matter said the government has used the same unconventional approach to financing its deficit in the past the central bank would likely discount dollar denominated certificates of deposits for the banks to subscribe to in return for them buying long term domestic bonds said one banker familiar with the situation in parallel the central bank would do a swap with the finance ministry the issuer of the international debt the finance minister had previously said the government aimed to issue eurobonds in the range of 2 5 bln to 3 bln on may 20 to cover this maturity and lebanon s other maturing principle for 2019 a 1 5 billion issue due in november a source familiar with the matter told reuters on tuesday that lebanon might wait until emerging market investors have more appetite and the government has approved its budget the government is targeting international investors for around 20 percent of the new issue the government says it is committed to pay all maturing debt and interest payments on predetermined dates eurobond maturities this year would be met by issuing further eurobonds said garbis iradian chief mena economist at institute of international finance iif first they have to send a strong signal to the market by approving strong fiscal measures nassib ghobrial chief economist at lebanon s byblos bank said there was no risk to lebanon s foreign currency financing for this year because the central bank was committed to covering the hard currency needs but lebanon s economic challenges remain hefty its fiscal deficit ballooned to 11 2 percent of gross domestic product gdp last year from 6 1 percent the year before and its international reserves fell to 39 7 billion enough for 13 months of import coverage lebanon s cabinet made important progress on sunday in its debate over the draft budget which will have a deficit of 8 3 of gdp or less lebanon s finance minister ali hassan khalil said still that rebalancing could be tricky to achieve with anemic economic growth jpmorgan forecasts recently revised its growth forecast down to 1 3 percent in 2019 warning of significant downside risks surrounding fiscal reforms while cabinet formation has supported sentiment delays in the execution of much needed reforms could dent confidence against the background of large fiscal and external deficits and high debt giyas gokkent of jpmorgan securities wrote in a note deep seated fiscal reforms including improving the business climate and fighting corruption could help accelerate growth and unlock the 11 billion in funding pledged by the international community at a special conference in april 2018 according to the iif that money hinges on such reforms qatar also said in january it will invest 500 million in lebanese government dollar bonds it is unclear whether that support has materialized still some prospective investors remain unconvinced we are underweight lebanon said sergey dergachev senior portfolio manager at germany based union investment there s very few items that make us feel confident about increasing our position as the problems haven t been solved on the ground and the long term plan remains quite weak dergachev said it would be tough for lebanon to issue at the moment given uncertainty over the u s china trade spat additional reporting by tom perry in beirut editing by toby chopra
thank you thank you so very much i stand here as your mayor humble and hopeful honored to be the 56th mayor in the history of this great city we are a proud city with a proud history in this moment i cannot help but look at all of you and think about what lies ahead and what we can be together i m looking ahead to a city of safe streets and strong schools for every child regardless of neighborhood or zip code a city where people want to grow old and not flee a city of sanctuary against fear where no one must hide in the shadows a city that is affordable for families and seniors and where every job pays a living wage a city of fairness and hope and prosperity for the many not just for the few a city that holds equity and inclusion as our guiding principles chicago is not where my story began

was born and where she s growing up into the kind curious and spirited young woman i always knew she would be for me this has been a city of opportunity it s been a city of hope as i stand here today i can t help but think of where i came from and i know in my heart that a story like mine of a kid from a working class family growing up to realize the dreams of my father and mother through education hard work and sheer determination needs to be the story of possibility in every neighborhood kids who look like me and come from families like mine shouldn t have to beat the odds to get an education pursue their passions or build a family black and brown kids low income kids every kid in this city should grow up knowing they can pursue anything they can love anyone that s my chicago dream i know we re just a little bit closer to that dream as i stand here today inaugurated as chicago s first black woman and first openly gay mayor i know we re a little bit closer as we celebrate

people invented the skyscraper and the ferris wheel here our people invented our own chicago blues our people generations of industrious hardworking people who built one of the greatest cities to ever grace god s earth i stand here today as your mayor humble and hopeful and i make one solemn promise to the generations who came before us and to the generations who come after us we will continue to build this great city and leave it better stronger fairer and more prosperous than we found it the challenges we face today did not arise overnight and they will not be solved overnight and they certainly won t be solved by one mayor acting alone in this important moment let us remember the powerful words of chicago s poet laureate gwendolyn brooks we are each other s harvest she said we are each other s business we are each other s magnitude and bond folks we are and must be in this together our challenges can only be solved if we face them together we cannot fail we will not fail we are chicago i also remember so many people i ve met in this city who can t be here today the big guy who came to hear me speak and then followed outside on a cold blustery day on the southeast side and pleaded lori just bring us jobs just bring us jobs we want to work the teenagers i met on the south side kicked out of their homes and left on the streets at night in the bitter cold with no food and no shelter just because they are gay or trans the father on the west side who told me he was scared scared to death every time his three daughters left the house those girls are his whole world and he s worried somebody is going to gun them down the countless number of people whose daily fear is that ice would come for them as they took their kids to school stood as day laborers or just walked in their neighborhoods we should never forget that these are the people who put us here we are each other s business and standing up for them is our business our only business there are four stars on chicago s flag each standing for a point in our history the construction of fort dearborn the great expositions of 1893 and 1933 and the reconstruction of our city following the great chicago fire each star stands for building and rebuilding today we proudly reinterpret these four stars new meaning for a new century with new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead guiding our city and guiding our new administration as we move forward and rebuild again today we reimagine the first star standing for safety in every neighborhood people cannot and should not live in neighborhoods that resemble a war zone enough of the shootings enough of the guns enough of the violence let s unite in our response to the biggest challenge we face the epidemic of gun violence that devastates families shatters communities buries dreams and holds children hostage to fear in their own homes it inflicts lifelong trauma that spreads through our communities like a virus when we hear of a random bullet cutting a life short people across the city from all ages and all walks of life begin to wonder if chicago is a place where they can continue to live and raise their children some have already answered the question by moving away particularly from the hardest hit communities the mass exodus we have seen particularly in the black community saps the vitality of our great city we must reverse the exodus by creating the reality of safety in every neighborhood public safety must not be a commodity that is only available to the wealthy what this means for me is that there is no higher calling than restoring safety and peace in our neighborhoods we will develop a new proactive strategy in partnership with the communities hit hardest by the scourge of gun violence all of our stakeholders must be committed to this work this is not a challenge that can be solved by law enforcement alone nor will we ever place the blame on people in communities who are under siege no this greatest challenge demands all of us united together and i promise you the city will lead and we ve already begun this work to lead the citywide response we are creating a mayor s office of public safety to be led by a deputy mayor that office will be charged with developing and implementing a comprehensive violence prevention strategy that will connect efforts across city government other aspects of the public sector and nonprofit philanthropic education recreation business and faith communities it will seek to mobilize the entire city behind a unified strategy to prevent violence and promote public safety and while we will specifically address gun violence we will not limit our efforts there the devastation of violence is far and wide which is why we will also reach out and support the growing community of victims and witnesses we must recognize the importance of providing a transition for our returning citizens and we will accelerate the development of a trauma informed city starting with repairing our broken mental health safety net we will also continue the hard but essential work of forging partnerships between police officers and the community premised on mutual respect accountability and a recognition that the destinies of police and community are inextricably intertwined one simply cannot succeed without the other and to all of our brave first responders we will not leave you behind either you deserve not only our respect but our commitment to train you better provide the best quality supervision available and wellness support to address the trauma that you face every day these are critical pieces of police reform and accountability we are each other s business we are each other s neighbors and together we will work tirelessly to bring peace to this city our second guiding star is education we cannot attract families to chicago and keep families here without providing a quality public education for every child and that means every single child as a city we make promises to our children as well most of all we promise them an education a safe relevant and challenging education that prepares them for meaningful work civic engagement and lifelong learning but whether we deliver on that promise often depends on where you happen to live it s time to give every child and young person a good education to prove through our schools that we believe in them that we support them no matter who they are or where they live that every child gets a quality education that s our business no matter what someone said to me recently that children are a product of the adult ecosystem around them and she was 100 right our words our values how we meet our commitments and rise to the occasion it all matters we re shaping the future leaders of our city and when we put equity first in our education system when we make good on a promise that every kid matters it will instill within our children the values we seek to foster in our city as a whole that promise must begin early that s why we will work to expand early childhood education and extend the promise of a good education through high school and college and to every kid no matter their path forward every student should have the option to pursue vocational and technical training we will work with businesses and unions to set up apprenticeships for those who want to learn a trade we will then connect chicago s employers with our job ready students while they re in school so they can get to work the day they graduate and we will support our great teachers counselors librarians nurses and other support personnel who are essential to creating the safe and nurturing environment necessary for our children to grow learn and thrive let me also say that i m thrilled to see so many young people in the audience my next few words are for you and all of your peers across the city you have the most at stake in the city s future just as the city s future most depends on you we need your energy creativity intelligence and dedication there s hard work ahead of us but we will do that work because we believe in you and in the vast still untapped potential of this great city our goal is simple starting in our schools we will create a citywide workforce as the pipeline for jobs of today and tomorrow that will be the envy of the world we are each other s business and we must meet our educational challenges together the third of our guiding stars is stability to be true to the notion of stability we must start with getting our fiscal house in order over many many years chicago dug itself into a giant financial hole we have an outsize structural deficit a persistent and growing pension debt and other costs that that threaten our financial stability we are spending a significant percentage of every dollar just to service our pension debt alone and too much of that money is being sent to banks and wall street bond firms instead of going to our rebuild our neighborhoods reduce our property taxes and revitalize our transportation system we must tackle this problem head on my team has already been doing the necessary work of measuring the size and depth of our fiscal challenges as well as working on a range of possible solutions once that analysis is complete we will lay out a plan to put chicago on the path to solvency no doubt some hard choices will have to be made and none of this is going to be easy but we will do the hard work with transparency integrity and a determination to put our pensions on a true path to solvency and make our government work more efficiently and without balancing budgets on the backs of low wage and working class chicagoans and we will get there because we must stability also means that we must build housing that is affordable for more people including families long term residents whether homeowners or renters should not be forced out of their neighborhoods when it goes through a period of transformation and developers can no longer skip their responsibilities by taking tax dollars but leaving it to someone else to solve our affordable housing crisis here too the city must lead we need to cut the red tape and obstacles and instead promote the building of new units and have flexibility in our building code so that innovative housing forms can come on line we must also have a plan for expanding homeownership and converting vacant lots and abandoned buildings into new vibrant communities growth of housing that is affordable all over this city will be the charge of the new housing department under new leadership stability also means support for our business community large and small strong businesses growing businesses new businesses mean jobs for people and stability for the city we need fairness which means paying as much attention to our neighborhood businesses as we do to the businesses downtown our neighborhoods have been neglected for too long they cannot be anymore still we should never settle for dividing up a shrinking pie or pitting one part of this city against another chicago is the economic engine of illinois and the whole midwest as with everything we are each other s business we need to grow and grow and grow together our fourth star must be integrity i know i know putting chicago government and integrity in the same sentence is well a little strange but that s going to change it s got to change for years they ve said chicago ain t ready for reform well get ready because reform is here i campaigned on change you voted for change and i plan to deliver change to our government that means restoring trust in our city s government and finally bringing some real integrity to the way this city works it means making sure we have a government that actually works for people not a powerful few it s about the real harm done to our families and businesses when those with power and money cash in at our expense when public officials cut shady backroom deals they get rich and the rest of us get the bill when some people get their property taxes cut in exchange for campaign cash they get the money and sure enough we get the bill the family with the bungalow the lady who runs the hair salon the guy who owns the store on the corner they aren t big or powerful or well connected but they end up paying these practices have gone on here for decades this practice breeds corruption stopping it isn t just in the city s interest it s in the city council s own interest no official in the city of chicago elected or appointed should ever profit from his or her office never ever this requirement that people must give more to get access to basic city services must end and it will end starting today later this afternoon i will sign an executive order to end the worst abuses of so called aldermanic privilege this does not mean our aldermen won t have power in their communities it does not mean our aldermen won t be able to make sure the streetlights are working or the parking signs are in the right place or any of the thousands of good things they do for people every day it simply means ending their unilateral unchecked control over every single thing that goes on their wards aldermen will have a voice not a veto it s time for a new era of trust between the people of chicago and the government that serves them when our poet said we are each other s bond that s what she meant as i stand here today georgia is also on my mind as is alabama and every other state that is enacting laws intended to deprive women of our rights me must stand with women all across our country who fear for their basic rights and feel powerless in the face of the hateful legislation designed to control our bodies our choices we cannot go back not in chicago not as a nation we will join together and we will fight and there s something else we must do for ourselves and our posterity we will establish a new social compact here in chicago based on a simple principle shared by every major religion in the world it goes by many names in buddhism it says hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful in the quran it says whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind it is in the torah and again in the new testament it is called the great commandment love thy neighbor as thyself today too many of our people lack decent housing and far too many end up on our streets today too many of our people feel isolated and alone and as our senior population increases we must meet the needs of those without family or friends for support today as we prepare to enter the third decade of the 21st century 1 out of every 5 children in chicago still lives in poverty addressing the problems of housing isolation and poverty in our great city is just as important as anything else we may do and far harder to solve but tackle these problems we must i heard a century old hymn in church the other day a song that i know from my youth of so many sundays sitting in church listening to the working class people in my congregation who toiled in factories kitchens or outside and came to the church for a respite from their otherwise hard days we sang this song pass me not o gentle savior hear my humble cry while on others thou art calling do not pass me by in that moment it was our plea to god to shine his light on us and relieve us from our heavy labors as i reflect on this day and what lies ahead it means that we must not forget or ignore the plight of so many for whom joy often does not come in the morning whether it is the homeless people living with mental illness those desperate for love and recognition we will not pass them by as we pursue our new stars this will be our guiding light to those who are alone we are with you to those who need a home we will shelter you for those who have little we will do much we see you we hear you we are your neighbors and so help me we will not pass you by i stand before you representing tens of thousands of people from all over the city who daily contribute their time talent and resources in the cause of making a difference not just today but if we are bold our collective efforts will resonate for years to come our people friends and neighbors known and unknown at the block level in our places of worship in our community organizations and just individuals who want to make a difference have stepped up and contributed mightily to what is the greatness of the city i will have the privilege of leading but clearly a single leader cannot heal all the ails us a single leader cannot by herself conquer all of the challenges that would be present on day one we all have to be part of that solution we all must make the sacrifices necessary to identify problems and forge solutions and my friends we must not merely depend on the politicians the preachers the police the teachers the activists and others to show us the way we can no longer continue to cede control of our destiny to someone else each of us needs to ask what can i do what contributions can i make you may not be the richest the smartest or even the most able but ask yourself are you ready to serve in some way because our city surely needs you what has been the most amazing and humbling part of the experience in a journey that i have traveled particularly over these last few months is the tremendous hope and optimism that i am feeling from people all over the city my friends it is that message of hope and possibility that should get all of us up in the morning start us on our way and bring all of us together with the excitement and promise born of harnessing our collective energies to move forward together our challenges are great there s no mistaking that but if we follow these four stars safety schooling stability and integrity we can once again become a city that families want to move to not run away from no matter who you are no matter where you live no matter your circumstance in life chicago is now on a mission to include you to join hands with you to share power with you and to give you reason to believe that we can all pull in the same direction to make chicago better together and if we follow the great commandment together as neighbors our great city will shine god bless you and god bless chicago
it is a pleasure to be here at this important annual event sponsored and organized by the federal reserve bank of atlanta s center for financial innovation and stability the risks in our financial system are constantly evolving fifteen years ago everyone was talking about whether households were borrowing too much today everyone is talking about whether businesses are borrowing too much this evening i will focus on the implications of the increase in business debt over the past decade and review the steps the federal reserve and other agencies are taking to understand and limit the associated risks in public discussion of this issue views seem to range from this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis to nothing to worry about here at the moment the truth is likely somewhere in the middle to preview my conclusions as of now business debt does not present the kind of elevated risks to the stability of the financial system that would lead to broad harm to households and businesses should conditions deteriorate at the same time the level of debt certainly could stress borrowers if the economy weakens the federal reserve continues to assess the potential amplification of such stresses on borrowers to the broader economy through possible vulnerabilities in the financial system and i currently see such risks as moderate discussion many commentators have observed with a sense of déjà vu the buildup of risky business debt over the past few years the acronyms have changed a bitâ clos collateralized loan obligations instead of cdos collateralized debt obligations for exampleâ but once again we see a category of debt that is growing faster than the income of the borrowers even as lenders loosen underwriting standards likewise much of the borrowing is financed opaquely outside the banking system many are asking whether these developments pose a new threat to financial stability at the federal reserve we take this possibility seriously the fed and other regulators are using our supervisory tools and closely monitoring risks from the buildup of risky business debt business debt has clearly reached a level that should give businesses and investors reason to pause and reflect if financial and economic conditions were to deteriorate overly indebted firms could well face severe strains however the parallels to the mortgage boom that led to the global financial crisis are not fully convincing most importantly the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business sector losses which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages and there are other differences increases in business borrowing are not outsized for such a long expansion in contrast to the mortgage boom business credit is not fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble as mortgage debt was and clo structures are much sounder than the structures that were in use during the mortgage credit bubble could the increase in business debt pose greater risks to the financial system than currently appreciated my colleagues and i continually ask ourselves that question we are also taking multiple steps to better understand and address the potential risks in conjunction with other u s regulatory agencies both domestically through the financial stability oversight council fsoc and internationally through the financial stability board fsb we are monitoring developments assessing unknowns and working to develop a clearer picture we are also using our supervisory tools to hold the banks we supervise to strong risk management standards and we are using our stress tests to ensure banks resilience even in severely adverse business conditions the rise of business leverage let s start with the basic facts many measures confirm that the business sector has significantly increased its borrowing as the economy has expanded over the past decade business debt relative to the size of the economy is at historic highs corporate debt relative to the book value of assets is at the upper end of its range over the past few decades figure 1 and investment grade corporate debt has shifted closer to the edge of speculative grade at the moment the business sector is quite healthy overall business income is strong reflecting healthy profit margins and because interest rates are quite low by historical standards the costs of servicing today s higher levels of debt remain low relative to business income figure 2 despite crosscurrents the economy is showing continued growth strong job creation and rising wages all in a context of muted inflation pressures but if a downturn were to arrive unexpectedly some firms would face challenges not only is the volume of debt high but recent growth has also been concentrated in the riskier forms of debt among investment grade bonds a near record fraction is at the lowest ratingâ a phenomenon known as the triple b cliff in a downturn some of these borrowers could be downgraded into high yield territory which would require some investors to sell their holdings thereby confronting traditional high yield investors with a sudden influx of bonds there have also been sizable shifts within the non investment grade or riskier debt universe higher risk businesses have traditionally funded themselves with a mix of high yield bonds and leveraged loans over time the balance between the two has swung back and forth because of investor demand the interest rate environment and other factors in the past few years leveraged loans have grown far more quickly figure 3 in fact while net new issuance of high yield bonds in 2018 was close to nil leveraged loans outstanding rose 20 percent and now stand at more than 1 trillion so far this year issuance of high yield bonds and leveraged loans has been more balanced in addition underwriting standards have weakened with leveraged loans covenants intended to protect lenders may be an endangered species more loans now feature high debt to earnings ratios and the use of optimistic projections including earnings add backs is becoming more common the rise in riskier business borrowing has been funded principally by nonbank lenders collateralized loan obligations are now the largest lenders with about 62 percent of outstanding leveraged loans figure 4 these lenders are actively managed securitization vehicles that mostly buy higher risk assets like leveraged loans clos in turn are funded by a slice of equity and layers of debt of varying seniority after clos mutual funds are the next largest vehicle for holding leveraged loans with about 20 percent of the market these funds allow investors to redeem their shares daily although the underlying loans take longer to sell as a result investors may react to financial stress by trying to redeem their shares before the funds have sold their most liquid assets widespread redemptions by investors in turn could lead to widespread price pressures which could affect all holders of loans including clos and those that hold clos risks to financial stability using the framework deployed since the crisis as you can see there are similarities to the subprime mortgage crisis as with the mortgage boom the business debt story begins with rapid growth of debt to new highs and a surge in lending to risky borrowers made possible by aggressive underwriting using securitization vehicles but there are also important differences one difference is that financial authorities now closely monitor financial stability vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis armed with lessons learned from the crisis the board of governors meets at least four times a year to assess threats to the financial system and is constantly monitoring developments we use a checklist of potential financial vulnerabilities that we have described elsewhere most recently in the financial stability report we published earlier this month 1 this approach gives us a way to organize and weigh the mass of facts anecdotes and speculation we confront as we monitor financial stability in assessing financial stability risks we constantly consult our four point checklist borrowing by businesses and households valuation pressures leverage in the financial system and funding risk if households or businesses have borrowed too much they will be forced to cut back spending and investing or even default if their incomes fall or the value of the collateral backing their loans declines valuation pressures give us a sense of overall risk appetite and should investors lose that appetite how far prices could fall if lenders face defaulting borrowers and have too little loss absorbing capacity they risk insolvency at best they will cut back on lending to other borrowers dragging the economy down at worst they will fail which can lead to severe economic damage to households and businesses finally when the financial system funds long maturity assets with short maturity liabilities we risk a classic fast burn crisisâ a bank run or its equivalent involving investors and institutions outside traditional banking 2 in our framework the story of the mid 2000s goes something like this amid a self reinforcing cycle of house price gains and mortgage credit expansion households borrowed and lenders lent far too much and property prices rose far too high financial institutions of all shapes and sizes also borrowed too much and the financial sector was highly susceptible to a run because it funded risky long maturity mortgages with extended chains of fragile and opaque financing structures that ultimately rested on short maturity liabilities let s compare this story with the current situation using our four point checklist beginning with borrowing by businesses and households business debt has grown faster than gross domestic product gdp for several years and today is high but the growth in the ratio of business debt to gdp in the past decade is much less than the growth in household debt to gdp that we saw in the run up to the global financial crisis back then household debt grew from 60 percent of gdp to 90 percent or by half figure 5 at its recent low business debt was 65 percent of gdp now even after rapid growth it is still below 75 percent of gdp overall the increase in business debt relative to the size of the economy is one third the increase in household debt seen in the previous decade business debt rises in expansions it is a steady upward plod in borrowing over the long expansionâ not a rapid expansionâ that has now brought business debt to gdp back to historic highs seen this way the current situation looks typical of business cycles the mortgage credit boom was because of its magnitude and speed far outside historical norms 3 as for household debt we see that household debt to income ratios have steadily declined post crisis moreover a high and rising fraction of this debt is rated prime all told household debt burdens appear much more manageable our second factorâ valuation pressuresâ also points to moderate risks to financial stability valuations are high across several financial markets equity prices have recently reached new highs and corporate bond and loan spreads are narrow both commercial and residential property prices have moved above their long run relationship with rents although price gains slowed substantially last year all of these developments point to strong risk appetiteâ as might be expected given the strong economy but there does not appear to be a feedback loop between borrowing and asset prices as was the case in the run up to the financial crisis while borrowing by businesses has been strong it is not fueling excessive prices or investment in a critical sector such as housing whose collapse would undermine collateral values and lead to outsized losses instead the increase in business borrowing has been broad based across sectors including technology oil and gas production and manufacturing regarding the third factorâ leverage in the financial systemâ today banks at the core of the financial system are fundamentally stronger and more resilient our post crisis regulatory framework is based on robust capital requirements backed by strong stress tests resulting in much higher levels of capital in the banking system figure 6 these stress tests are a way to estimate the direct and indirect effects of extremely bad macroeconomic and financial developments on our banking system we publish the scenarios that describe the macro and financial developments every year by mid february and release the test results in june in the pre crisis environment supervisors focused more on the most likely outcomes not on these tail risks since we began routine stress testing in 2011 the scenarios we use have featured severe global recessions characterized by major stress in the corporate sector where large numbers of firms default on their loans and bonds as actual economic conditions have improved the scenarios have gotten tougher the most recent stress tests indicate that even after the losses from the scenario capital levels at the largest banks would remain above the levels those banks had before the crisis loss absorbing capacity elsewhere in the financial system is also much improved leverage at broker dealers is far below levels before the crisis and remains low relative to the norms of the past several decades insurers also appear well capitalized as for our fourth factorâ funding riskâ the susceptibility of the financial system to runs also appears low in part because of the post crisis regulatory regime large banks hold substantial amounts of highly liquid assets and rely relatively little on short term wholesale funding figure 7 money market funds hold much safer assets and clos which have facilitated the growth of leveraged loans have stable funding investors commit funds for lengthy periods so they cannot through withdrawals force clos to sell assets at distressed prices addressing the risks monitoring and acting overall vulnerabilities to financial stability from business debt and other factors do not appear elevated we take the risks from business debt seriously but think that the financial system appears strong enough to handle potential losses we also know that our dynamic financial system does not stand still we can always learn more about financial markets and we will always act to address emerging risks together with our domestic and international counterparts we are monitoring developments in business debt markets working to develop and share data on how these markets operate studying ways to further strengthen the system and working to ensure that banks are properly managing the business debt risks they have taken on through the fsoc the banking and market regulators coordinate our monitoring of financial conditions in recent meetings the fsoc has discussed leveraged lending in depth we recognize that each regulator directly sees only a part of the larger picture and we are working to stitch these parts together so we can collectively see that larger picture and the risks it holds for example the securities and exchange commission is examining the potential for liquidity strains at mutual funds and the commodity futures trading commission is working to understand the use of derivatives to hedge risks associated with leveraged loans what else are we watching for business debt growth has moderated somewhat since early 2018 but this might be just a pause another sharp increase in debt unless supported by strong fundamentals could increase vulnerabilities appreciably businesses investors and lenders need to focus on these vulnerabilitiesâ as will the federal reserve in addition regulators investors and market participants around the world would benefit greatly from more information on who is bearing the ultimate risk associated with clos we know that the u s clo market spans the globe involving foreign banks and asset managers but right now we mainly know where the clos are notâ only 90 billion of the roughly 700 billion in total clos are held by the largest u s banks that is certainly good news for domestic banks but in a downturn institutions anywhere could find themselves under pressure especially those with inadequate loss absorbing capacity or runnable short term financing the federal reserve is participating in international efforts under the auspices of the fsb to improve our knowledge of these key issues through the fsb we are focused on determining the size of the global leveraged loan market and the holders of the loans as an important step toward a better understanding of the underlying risks beyond monitoring markets and collecting new data several supervisory efforts are also under way to complement the quantitative analysis in our stress tests our supervisors have been qualitatively assessing how well banks are managing the risks associated with leveraged lending through the shared national credit program which evaluates large syndicated loans our supervisors are continuing to work with their counterparts at the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation to ensure that banks are properly managing the risks of losses they face from participating in the leveraged lending market conclusion let me wrap up with three thoughts first business debt is near record levels and recent issuance has been concentrated in the riskiest segments as a result some businesses may come under severe financial strain if the economy deteriorates a highly leveraged business sector could amplify any economic downturn as companies are forced to lay off workers and cut back on investments investors financial institutions and regulators need to focus on this risk today while times are good second today business debt does not appear to present notable risks to financial stability the debt to gdp ratio has moved up at a steady pace in line with previous expansions and neither fueled by nor fueling an asset bubble moreover banks and other financial institutions have sizable loss absorbing buffers the growth in business debt does not rely on short term funding and overall funding risk in the financial system is moderate third we cannot be satisfied with our current level of knowledge about these markets particularly the vulnerability of financial institutions to potential losses and the possible strains on market liquidity and prices should investors exit investment vehicles holding leveraged loans we are committed to better understanding the areas where our information is incomplete this commitment includes coordination with other domestic and international agencies to understand who is participating in business lending and how their behavior could potentially amplify stress events references adrian tobias daniel covitz and nellie liang 2015 financial

menafn afp after months of speculation that japan s government could postpone an impending sales tax hike to avoid damaging the economy it appeared set to go ahead with the move thanks to stronger than expected growth data released monday the data showed gdp expanded by 0 5 percent in the first quarter and while the recovery was soft and economists expressed concern over weak consumption the data is likely to boost the case for the sales tax to finally go ahead the consumption tax issue is huge politically in japan and there had been suggestions that it could be postponed for a third time with prime minister shinzo abe calling a snap election this summer here are some key questions and answers about the tax which is due to be raised from eight percent to 10 percent from october what is it the consumption tax is an eight percent tax payable on goods and services at the point of sale similar to vat in many other countries the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd notes it is one of the lowest rates among the group s 34 nations abe has vowed to raise it to 10 percent but has already twice delayed taking the plunge for fear of hobbling consumption and the economy why hike the tax after japan s tech driven property and stock market bubble burst in the early 1990s successive governments launched round after round of economic stimulus that swelled japan s debt mountain the nation s debt to gdp ratio a key indicator of financial health stood at an eye watering 226 percent in 2018 according to the oecd which noted it was the highest ever recorded in the group for comparison debt to gdp is 138 percent in the united states 71 percent in germany and 112 percent in britain the limit for members of the euro area is supposed to be 60 percent of gdp most economists agree that hiking the tax is crucial for reducing this debt mountain abe has also vowed to use the proceeds to fund free preschools and childcare in a bid to boost birth rates and the female workforce in the ageing and shrinking country why could it be postponed abe and his senior officials have insisted the hike will proceed as planned the leader has said it would take a shock on the level of the lehman brothers collapse to derail it but in a research note published before monday s gdp data tobias harris an analyst at teneo consultancy group noted that abe said a similar thing in 2016 and then after a feeble attempt to argue that such a shock could be imminent he postponed the tax increase for a second time anyway and after enjoying a long period of uninterrupted growth the economy slammed into reverse at the end of last year a series of forward looking indicators notably a key government index suggest that the economy may have entered a recession the last consumption tax hike in 2014 was widely blamed for sparking a recession and abe is desperate to avoid a repeat harris said if the escalation in the us china trade war intensifies downward pressure on japan s economy the prime minister could use the slowdown to justify delaying the tax hike again blaming external factors what s the political impact with abe enjoying high personal popularity ratings and political opposition next to non existent speculation is swirling that he could use a delay in the tax hike to call a snap general election having failed to achieve diplomatic breakthroughs with russia or north korea that might otherwise have justified a snap election delaying the consumption tax is the best argument abe can make for calling a general election said harris the consumption tax is seen by many as a third rail in japanese politics and politicians avoid raising taxes if they can help it in april 1989 then prime minister noboru takeshita ushered in japan s first ever sales tax at three percent and was forced to resign two months later amid plunging popular support and a separate corruption scandal his successor then received a drubbing at the ballot box what can soften the blow abe has promised a series of measures to mitigate the economic impact including maintaining the rate at eight percent for food and non alcoholic drinks in addition consumers will be offered incentives if they pay using cashless methods as japan seeks to wean itself off paper money bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda has said he believes these measures will mean the tax hike has only a limited impact on the economy

paul gessing your view for years the rio grande foundation has attempted to educate new mexicans on the bad economics of film subsidies the program which actually began under then gov gary johnson was enhanced by bill richardson when he and the legislature made it state policy to return 25 cents for every dollar spent in the state to the film industry the amount that could be spent in support of the film industry was uncapped during the richardson administration leading to some wild swings in annual subsidy payments that situation was partially resolved during the martinez administration when a 50 million annual cap was placed on payouts but subsidies could and did accumulate above that amount as we and others have pointed out this is the single most generous business subsidy offered by the state both economically and morally it is one thing to exempt a business from taxes that would otherwise be paid think industrial revenue bonds and their long term property tax exemptions it is another thing entirely for government to cut checks using our tax dollars to fund the ongoing operations of chosen businesses even leda which does result in tax dollars being paid out to businesses locating new facilities in new mexico is a one time funding mechanism but under new mexico s film program our taxes are collected and handed over to film companies doing business in new mexico that fact was laid bare for the public to see when shortly prior to the 2019 legislative session it was reported that the state owed hundreds of millions of dollars to the film industry in the 2019 session the legislature agreed to appropriate up to 250 million to pay off that debt that payment would be a sensible use of the surplus if the legislature at the same time enacted policies to wean the film industry away from ongoing government subsidies instead the legislature in sb 2 expanded the cap to 110 million annually and also allowed film producers unlimited subsidies if they have a qualified production facility within the state we know this will be a boon for hollywood filmmakers but what about new mexico s economy new mexico s top fiscal leaders rep patty lundstrom vice chair of the legislative finance committee and director david abbey recently gave a presentation in which they discussed tax and budget changes made during new mexico s 2019 session they note that film credit changes are estimated to cost 500 million to the general fund over the next five years in addition to the 250 million that would have been paid out under the existing cap also they note that the revised film program is likely the most significant state investment ever in a single industry despite evidence of about a 40 percent return on the dollar to say the least this echoes what the rio grande foundation has been saying for more than a decade we are happy to have films made here but the policy of opening up the state s treasury to any corporation is an economic loser recently gov lujan grisham has been in the media encouraging film productions originally slated for georgia to come to new mexico due to the peach state s own generous subsidies georgia has attracted a number of productions but recently adopted abortion limits have rankled some in hollywood who are threatening to shift production elsewhere ironically due to the money losing economics of film subsidy policies in both states a film boycott could be a boon for georgia s overall economy and an even bigger boondoggle for new mexico s which could see the annual film program s costs skyrocket already as rep lundstrom and abbey point out the subsidy program will cost an estimated 150 million annually this largesse targeted at one industry may seem affordable at a time of billion plus dollar surpluses thanks to booming oil production in the permian basin but at some point oil prices will fall for a sustained period or the spending aspirations of new mexico s legislature will grow too quickly for oil revenues to maintain paul gessing is the president of new mexico s rio grande foundation the rio grande foundation is an independent non partisan tax exempt research and educational organization dedicated to promoting prosperity for new mexico based on principles of limited government economic freedom and individual responsibility more filmmakers who shoot outside of albuquerque santa fe can now get additional rebate more city proposal to create film incentive program collapses more bill calls for lifting cap on new mexico s film incentives
