use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions regulatory framework key policies what are the principal governmental and regulatory policies that govern the banking sector the swiss banking sector is subject to official supervision from a swiss perspective a banking activity means the taking of deposits from the public or by way of refinancing from other banks for the purpose of financing a large number of persons or entities banking activities may only be conducted in or from switzerland if the relevant entity has been granted a licence by the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma finma grants the licence to the legal entity pursuing the banking activities but not to managers or shareholders the various criteria to be complied with in order to obtain a licence are set out in the federal banking act among other things the applicant must establish that the persons entrusted with its management enjoy a good reputation and thereby assure the proper conduct of business operations ie guarantee of irreproachable activity if at a later stage any of the licence requirements are no longer satisfied finma may take administrative measures including in extreme cases the withdrawal of the banking licence one of the most highly publicised aspects of swiss banking regulation is swiss banking secrecy disclosure of information pertaining to the client bank relationship is prohibited under the federal banking act banking secrecy rules encompass all data that pertain to the contractual relationship between the bank and its clients disclosure means communication to any third party including the parent company of the bank as well as the supervisory authority of this parent company or any other affiliate as a matter of principle any disclosure amounts to a breach of banking secrecy and may trigger administrative and criminal sanctions as well as civil liability for the bank concerned exceptions apply under certain circumstances for instance in the context of consolidated supervision over an international banking group or pursuant to a formal request issued by swiss public authorities acting as the case may be based on a request for international judicial or administrative assistance issued by a non swiss public authority including foreign financial intelligence units for anti money laundering aml purposes since 1 january 2017 the situation has however changed with the implementation of the automatic exchange of information see question 6 primary and secondary legislation summarise the primary statutes and regulations that govern the banking industry the federal banking act is the main statute governing the conduct of banking activities in or from switzerland the provisions of the federal banking act have been detailed in several implementing ordinances issued by the swiss government swiss federal council and by finma furthermore finma issued a series of circulars setting out its interpretation of the regulatory framework these regulations are complemented by the federal act on the swiss financial market supervisory authority finmasa which can be considered as a framework law governing the supervisory activities and instruments of finma in addition to being licensed as banks most swiss financial institutions need a licence as a securities dealer securities dealing activities are governed by the swiss federal act on stock exchanges and securities trading sesta as well as the financial markets infrastructure act fmia and their respective implementing ordinances from a swiss perspective securities dealing refers to five broad categories of activities namely issuing houses derivative suppliers market makers brokers operating on a short term basis for their own accounts and brokers acting in a professional manner for the account of their clients swiss banks also qualify as financial intermediaries within the meaning of the swiss anti money laundering legal framework and as such fall within the ambit of the federal anti money laundering act amla and its implementing ordinances a swiss bank may also serve as custodian for collective investment schemes this type of activity is subject to the collective investment scheme act and its implementing ordinances furthermore the organisation and operation of financial market infrastructures are governed by the fmia which also sets out the general requirements regarding market behaviour rules finally the swiss banking supervision system allows for the delegation of certain duties to self regulating organisations the swiss bankers association and the swiss funds and asset management association regularly issue self regulatory guidelines to their members which finma recognises as minimum standards that need to be complied with by all swiss banks this is particularly true regarding the duty of due diligence in identifying the contracting party and the beneficial owner agreement on the swiss bank s code of conduct with regard to the exercise of due diligence the rules of conduct for securities dealing and the guidelines governing portfolio management regulatory authorities which regulatory authorities are primarily responsible for overseeing banks finma is the supervisory authority in charge of supervising in particular banks securities dealers collective investment schemes and their managers insurance companies and other financial intermediaries for anti money laundering purposes systemic risks are in turn addressed by the swiss national bank finma and the swiss national bank have agreed on principles to coordinate their respective tasks government deposit insurance describe the extent to which deposits are insured by the government describe the extent to which the government has taken an ownership interest in the banking sector and intends to maintain increase or decrease that interest as a general rule deposits with swiss banks are not insured by any public authority in switzerland special rules apply to cantonal banks namely banks that are controlled by a swiss canton at least one third of the capital and voting rights must be held by a swiss canton in order for a bank to be characterised as cantonal the relevant cantonal legislation will specify to what extent the liabilities incurred by a cantonal bank are insured by the concerned canton in addition the federal banking act provides for a privileged deposit scheme small cash deposits up to an amount determined by finma on a case by case basis are paid out as soon as possible to each depositor following the bankruptcy of a swiss bank and are not subject to the standard liquidation procedure set out in the federal banking act and the federal debt enforcement and bankruptcy act in addition swiss banks are under an obligation to participate in a deposit protection scheme that aims at securing the payment of cash deposits up to 100 000 swiss francs such deposits also rank in a privileged class in the bankruptcy estate of a swiss bank the deposit protection scheme is limited to a maximum aggregate amount of 6 billion swiss francs finally banks are required to secure preferential deposits by claims against third parties secured in switzerland or by assets in switzerland for a total amount corresponding to at least 125 per cent of the preferential deposits they hold finma may increase this amount or grant derogations the federal banking act includes in addition specific provisions on reorganisation procedures prompter repayment of preferential deposits and the continuation of basic banking services during insolvency proceedings on 15 february 2017 the swiss federal council instructed the federal department of finance fdf to prepare a consultation draft aiming at strengthening the current deposit protection scheme on the basis of the recommendations of the group of experts on further development of financial market strategy and the ongoing discussions between the state secretariat for international financial matters finma and the swiss national bank on this issue in this context the swiss federal council has retained a certain number of measures that are to be implemented in the proposed draft namely in case of bankruptcy swiss banks would have to pay out cash deposits within seven business days which is in line with international standards the consultation draft should be made available during the course of 2018 at present finma considers that the two swiss largest banks credit suisse and ubs which are subject like other systemically important financial institutions sifis to a specific regime namely in terms of capital adequacy see question 16 have improved their crisis resistance over the years by establishing detailed recovery and resolution plans and implementing the necessary organisational measures for example both banks now have a non operating holding company acting as their respective group parent and have transferred their swiss based systematically important functions to separate subsidiaries that said according to finma further steps are to be undertaken to reduce financial and operational dependencies that persist in the groups both banks have to submit for finma s review viable emergency plans by 2019 to address inter alia this issue transactions between affiliates which legal and regulatory limitations apply to transactions between a bank and its affiliates what constitutes an affiliate for this purpose briefly describe the range of permissible and prohibited activities for financial institutions and whether there have been any changes to how those activities are classified swiss banking law does not provide for limitations that expressly apply to transactions between a bank and its affiliates a bank s transactions with its affiliates may however fall under the general limits imposed on a bank s risk exposure towards a single counterparty or a group of related counterparties for diversification purposes risk exposure towards one single counterparty or a group of related counterparties exceeding 10 per cent of the bank s capital is to be monitored by the bank and under certain circumstances reported to finma as a rule such risk concentrations cannot exceed 25 per cent of the bank s overall capital with effect from 1 january 2019 the revised capital adequacy ordinance cao provides that risk concentrations will be measured only according to core capital tier 1 as supplementary capital tier 2 will generally not be taken into account finma circular 2019 1 risk diversification banks has been revised to reflect these changes and will enter into force on 1 january 2019 under swiss banking laws entities are considered affiliates if they are linked through a controlling relationship ie directly or indirectly held with more than 50 per cent of the voting rights or capital or dominated in any other manner or by a factual or legal obligation to assist it is worth noting that a financial group or conglomerate which comprises a swiss bank or securities dealer or is effectively managed from switzerland may be subject to the consolidated finma supervision in this context intra group positions of a swiss bank would in principle fall within the limits imposed on single risk positions for diversification purposes only risk positions towards fully consolidated affiliates may under certain circumstances be exempted from these limits in terms of capital adequacy requirements see question 16 it should be noted that the swiss federal council has requested that the fdf prepare a draft on the risk weighting principles applicable to positions held in subsidiaries and a consultation procedure has been opened up until 30 may 2018 in the general context of the partial revision of the cao on its part finma has decided in october 2017 to retroactively apply as of 1 july 2017 a special regime to credit suisse and ubs this new regime provides inter alia for an abolition of the full deduction of parent companies positions held in subsidiaries from core equity capital and of the accompanying relief measures allowed for these two large banks and for their replacement with the implementation after a transition period of a risk weighting with weights up to 250 per cent with respect to positions in swiss based subsidiaries and 400 per cent with respect to positions in foreign subsidiaries of these two large banks these requirements relate to the parent companies capital ratios only to the exclusion of consolidated ratios it is planned that the new risk weightings will also apply to all other banks as of 1 january 2019 regulatory challenges what are the principal regulatory challenges facing the banking industry in our view the principal regulatory challenges facing the swiss banking industry may be summarised as follows banking secrecy and administrative assistance on 13 march 2009 the swiss federal council announced that switzerland would adopt the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd standard on administrative assistance in tax matters in accordance with article 26 of the oecd model tax convention this amendment would in turn allow the lifting of swiss banking secrecy in situations where suspicions of tax non compliance exist the swiss government therefore started the renegotiation of the network of double taxation agreements to which switzerland is a party in june 2010 the swiss parliament had already approved the first 10 double taxation agreements integrating article 26 of the oecd model tax convention as of today 51 double taxation agreements have been signed and have entered into force as a result of this process the distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion is no longer relevant in the context of international assistance in parallel on 19 november 2014 the swiss federal council approved a declaration aimed at joining the multilateral agreement on the automatic exchange of information in tax matters developed by the oecd on 5 june 2015 the swiss federal council adopted the dispatches on the oecd and council of europe convention on mutual administrative assistance in tax matters and on the federal act on automatic exchange of information aeoi act both drafts as well as the multilateral agreement on the automatic exchange of information in tax matters were approved by the swiss parliament on 18 december 2015 following this the swiss federal council adopted the relevant implementing ordinance aeoi ordinance on 23 november 2016 both the aeoi act and the aeoi ordinance finally entered into force on 1 january 2017 as a result switzerland s first exchange of information started in 2018 regarding information from 2017 between the relevant foreign countries including all eu member states in accordance with the agreement of 27 may 2015 regarding the amendment to the eu savings tax agreement with switzerland in january 2016 finmasa was amended to allow under certain circumstances and under finma supervision regulated entities to directly transmit non public information to foreign financial market supervisory authorities responsible for their supervision provided the prerequisites for granting international administrative assistance would be fulfilled and client and third party confidentiality and banking secrecy rights are preserved following the entry into force of this revision finma has enacted new circular 2017 6 direct transmission which sets out under which criteria supervised institutions may directly transmit non public information to foreign authorities and entities this circular entered into force on 1 january 2017 anti money laundering regulation and implementation of the latest financial action task force recommendations between 2013 and 2014 the swiss government amended amla with a view to adapting it to the revised financial action task force fatf recommendations the entry into force of the revised amla took place in two stages first in july 2015 and then in january 2016 the revision included inter alia the obligation for financial intermediaries to establish the identity of the beneficial owner s of unlisted operating companies ie individuals holding 25 per cent of the share capital or voting rights or controlling the company in any other manner or if no beneficial owner can be identified the identity of the most senior member of management and a two stage mechanism following the reporting of suspicions to the money laundering reporting office mro of the swiss federal office of police which requires the monitoring of the concerned account by the financial intermediary for a period up to 20 days during the analysis of the case by the mro to suspend any transaction that may result in preventing the confiscation of the concerned asset followed if the case is transferred to a criminal prosecution authority by the implementation of a full freeze on the account for five days until the decision to maintain the freeze is made by the criminal authority in the above context the provisions of the finma aml ordinance of 8 december 2010 and the aml ordinance of 11 november 2015 were partially revised in order to align them on the revised amla the entry into force of this revision took also place on 1 january 2016 in parallel the swiss bankers association published the 2016 version of its agreement on the bank s code of conduct with regard to the exercise of due diligence cdb which entered into force on the same day finally the revised finma aml ordinance and the cdb introduced the possibility for financial intermediaries to on board clients exclusively online in this context finma published a circular on video and online identification finma circular 2016 7 which entered into force on 18 march 2016 one of the main purposes of this circular is to clarify and facilitate video and online client identification for financial intermediaries subject to know your customer duties see update and trends following the latest fatf assessment of the swiss aml legal framework finma has decided to further revise the finma aml ordinance in order to address certain remaining shortcomings identified by the fatf as well as to implement finma s practice in this area as things stand the draft finma aml ordinance would introduce inter alia a duty to check information on beneficial ownership for all clients including low risk clients as well as duty to perform regular updates of client information it is further expected that the revised text includes clarifications on the monitoring of legal and reputational risks within international financial groups the revised finma aml ordinance is expected to enter into force in 2019 outsourcing projects outsourcing by banks securities dealers as well as insurers will be governed from 1 april 2018 by finma circular 2018 3 outsourcing banks and insurers this new circular 2018 3 which replaces the current finma circular 2008 7 lays down the requirements applicable to the outsourcing of significant functions ie functions having a material effect on compliance with the aims and regulations of financial market legislation it should be noted that finma has aligned this new text to reflect not only its principle based approach but also its technology neutral approach enabling financial institutions to comply with outsourcing requirements irrespective of their business model finma has further clarified the rules governing the outsourcing of risk management and compliance functions one of the main changes is that financial institutions are to maintain an inventory of all outsourced services and to assess on their own self assessment whether those are linked to significant functions further any outsourcing outside switzerland requires that financial institutions make sure that all necessary data for reorganisation resolution and liquidation purposes remain accessible in switzerland at all times finally it is worth noting that this new circular 2018 3 partially applies to intra group outsourcing projects the intra group nature of such projects is to be taken into consideration within the risk assessment to be performed by financial institutions this new circular provides for a transitional period up to five years new proposed swiss legislation on financial services and financial institutions on 27 june 2014 the swiss federal council published two drafts of the financial services act finsa and the financial institutions act finia while the purpose of the draft finia is to provide a new legal framework governing all financial institutions the objective of the draft finsa is to regulate financial services in switzerland whether performed in switzerland or on a cross border basis following the hostile reaction of participants on certain aspects during the consultation procedure the swiss federal council requested that the fdf significantly amend the drafts and prepare a dispatch by the end of 2015 on 4 november 2015 the swiss federal council adopted its dispatch on both revised draft instruments the preparatory commission of the council of states has requested some further amendments and simplifications which further delayed the legislative process debates before the swiss parliament started in december 2016 and will continue in the 2018 sessions at this stage it is difficult to assess how long the legislative procedure will take prior to the entry into force of the finsa and finia which is currently not expected before mid 2019 the introduction of the new finsa and finia would inter alia involve the following key changes to the current swiss regulatory framework under the proposed legislative framework financial services and institutions will be governed in switzerland by a general set of regulations on the supervision of financial services embodied in the finsa the finia and the financial market infrastructure act the draft finsa introduces an obligation for foreign services providers which would be subject to an authorisation in switzerland to register as a prerequisite to providing financial services in switzerland the draft finsa introduces categorisation rules based on the european union concept of professional clients and private clients the draft finsa also introduces market conduct rules including the obligation to verify the appropriateness and suitability of financial services as well as inducements and transparency rules integrating into the draft finsa the most recent case law of the swiss supreme court as regards the transparency and consent requirements for a financial institution to keep trailer fees the draft finsa further introduces uniform prospectus rules that generally shall apply to all securities offered publicly into or in switzerland as well as a change of paradigm in the enforcement of the claims of investors against financial institutions and the draft finia provides that independent asset managers who are currently not subject to prudential supervision will be newly supervised although they will not be directly subject to finma supervision their supervision will be conducted by independent supervisory organisations approved and monitored by finma financial market infrastructure the fmia including its implementing ordinances fmio and fmio finma entered into force on 1 january 2016 the purpose of this statute is twofold first from a formal perspective the financial market infrastructure act aims at achieving consistency by gathering in one single statute all existing provisions related to the organisation and operation of market infrastructures including conduct of business rules eg shareholding disclosures and second it aims at harmonising swiss financial legislation with international recommendations and standards including the european union s mifid 2 mifir and emir in particular regarding the regime applicable to negotiation platforms central counterparties central securities depositories payment and securities settlement systems and derivatives trading the introduction of the fmia involved inter alia the following key changes to the swiss regulatory framework the introduction of a licensing regime similar to the one applied to stock exchanges for multilateral trading facilities and organised trading facilities the introduction of a licensing obligation for central counterparties central securities depositories and trade repositories with the application of specific additional requirements and the introduction of clearing reporting and risk mitigation obligations for determined exchange traded and over the counter derivative transactions to which a professional investment firm is party following the entry into force of the new regime financial market infrastructures and the operators of organised trading facilities were granted a one year transitional period to comply with a certain number of new requirements eg pre and post trade transparency information duties moreover participants on a trading venue and securities dealers were released from fulfilling the extended record keeping and reporting duties regarding securities transactions until 1 january 2017 this transitional period was based on the expected date on which the corresponding provisions in mifid ii were expected to become because this date was postponed by a year the swiss federal council has decided to extend the corresponding transitional period to 1 january 2018 as of 1 october 2018 this reporting obligation will be expanded to include derivatives with an underlying asset admitted to trading on a swiss trading venue however the new rules contemplate a backloading period all derivatives transactions that would be reportable under the new rules transpiring between 1 january 2018 and 30 september 2018 will have to be reported by 31 december 2018 it is worth noting that in october 2017 finma further decided to grant non financial counterparties with low derivatives trading volumes a deadline extension until 1 january 2019 for over the counter derivatives transactions and until 1 july 2019 for exchange traded derivatives transactions to start their reporting to trade repositories in cases of derivatives transactions with foreign counterparties that do not report in accordance with fmia finma guidance 05 2017 separately in february 2017 finma announced the partial revision of the fmio finma rules regarding the disclosure of significant interests held in listed companies for third party accounts in order to align it with recent swiss case law under the new disclosure regime that entered into force on 1 march 2017 positions held for third party accounts can now be aggregated and disclosed at the level of the entity that is in effect making the decisions with respect to the exercise of voting rights depending on the circumstances this entity can be the asset management entity itself ie the entity that has the contractual relationship with the relevant client or an entity higher up in the chain of control if that particular entity is effectively controlling the manner in which the voting rights are being exercised by its subsidiaries alternatively it remains possible to aggregate and disclose client positions at the level of the person who ultimately controls the entity the new rules provide for a transitional period of six months for implementation filings made prior to march 2017 are not grandfathered previous disclosures of client positions must have been updated by 31 august 2017 in december 2017 finma launched a consultation on the amendment of the fmio finma with the aim of designating the categories of otc derivatives that will for the first time be subject to the clearing obligation finma is introducing the clearing obligation for certain otc standardised interest rate and credit derivatives listed in annex 1 of the proposed draft fmio finma the otc derivatives are already subject to the clearing obligation under eu regulations the consultation process will last until 12 february 2018 after any necessary adjustments have been made the publication of the amended annex 1 finma fmio is scheduled for summer 2018 corporate governance in the banking sector in november 2016 finma published its corporate governance requirements for banks by consolidating provisions of a certain number of related circulars and its relevant faqs into a new circular the finma circular 2017 1 corporate governance banks the revised regime entered into force in july 2017 the purpose of circular 2017 1 is to streamline the regulatory framework by providing for principles and guidelines in relation to corporate governance in particular it leaves banking institutions free to implement the requirements in question taking into account their own business models and the specific risks associated with them the circular sets minimum requirements not only regarding the composition of boards and the qualifications of their members but also for the organisation of the banks internal control systems further it details the allocation of responsibilities between the board of directors and the executive board of the banking institutions moreover it provides exceptions to the rule most committee members must be independent eg absence of links with the institution which may lead to a situation of conflict of interest it is worth noting that smaller banks are now allowed to have a combined audit and risk committee instead of two separate committees fatca implementation on 14 february 2013 the swiss and us governments signed a cooperation agreement to facilitate the implementation of fatca fatca agreement this agreement which entered into force on 2 june 2014 is based on a model agreement model ii tailored for countries such as switzerland that do not have an automatic information exchange in place with the united states model ii allows for an aggregate reporting of pre existing accounts in the absence of consent of the client to individual disclosure which may give rise to a group request by the us internal revenue service irs in this context the swiss government has further worked on a federal statute dealing with the implementation of the fatca agreement to detail financial institutions participation identification and communication obligations and to frame the procedures applicable to information exchange and to the levy of a withholding tax under the agreement on 27 september 2013 the fatca implementing act was approved by the swiss parliament along with the fatca agreement the fatca implementing act entered into force on 30 june 2014 participating swiss and deemed compliant financial institutions were to register with the irs by 25 april 2014 on 8 october 2014 the swiss federal council adopted a specific mandate to discuss a changeover to model i with the united states meanwhile it is unknown when the new agreement introducing model i will be implemented consumer protection are banks subject to consumer protection rules generally speaking swiss regulatory law does not provide for a specific consumer protection legal framework however within a certain type of credit swiss financial institutions are to observe mandatory provisions that cannot be altered to the detriment of consumers credits granted to individuals for purposes other than business or commercial activities in the range of 500 swiss francs and 80 000 swiss francs providing that the consumer is not obliged to reimburse the credit within less than three months are subject to the consumer credit act cca the cca sets out a series of mandatory consumer protection rules including the following the consumer credit contracts must be made in writing and comply with a with a maximum rate of interest set by the authorities ie in principle and since 1 july 2016 10 per cent plus the three month swiss franc libor interest rate it being specified that the maximum interest rate shall at least amount to 10 per cent the consumer credit contracts must list a series of absent information null and void eg the right of the consumer to revoke a line of credit in writing and within seven days of sending or the delivery of the contract to the borrower and the lender is to check the borrower s credit capacity and to report the granted consumer credit to the consumer credit information office it should be also noted that within national and international transactions with consumers under the swiss code of civil procedure the lugano convention or the swiss private international law act depending on the countries involved specific consumer protection rules may apply as regards the determination of the competent jurisdiction future changes in what ways do you anticipate the legal and regulatory policy changing over the next few years according to finma s general strategic goals for 2017 to 2020 the following fall within its main policy challenges ensuring that banks and insurance companies have strong capitalisation making a sustainable positive impact on the conduct of financial institutions mitigating the too big to fail issue through viable emergency plans and credible resolution strategies contributing to the protection of creditors investors and insured persons through accompanying structural change in the financial industry promoting the removal of unnecessary regulatory obstacles for innovative business models providing for principle based financial market regulation and promoting equivalence with relevant international requirements and keeping the cost of supervision stable and achieving further efficiency gains in addition one of the main challenges for the upcoming years is the entry into force and implementation of the finsa and the finia which will constitute a complete overhaul of the legal framework applicable to financial institutions and the provision of financial services in switzerland in the same vein the implementation of the automatic exchange of information will continue to have a significant impact on the swiss banking industry in particular tax related banking secrecy has been significantly weakened in relation to foreign clients moreover after the implementation in the swiss regulatory framework over the previous years of a substantial part of the legal and regulatory capital adequacy requirements for banks deriving from the basel iii standards the banks will face the comprehensive implementation of the remaining parts of those standards over the next two years see questions 16 and 20 finally finma intends to strengthen switzerland s position as one of the leaders in the fintech sector to this end the swiss regulator engaged in a number of international bodies to establish a framework aimed at promoting innovation as well as the protection of customers and investors in this area in 2016 finma further put in place a special fintech desk to address this sector s issues more efficiently see update and trends supervision extent of oversight how are banks supervised by their regulatory authorities how often do these examinations occur and how extensive are they swiss banking supervision is based on a division of tasks between finma and the banks external auditors pursuant to this two tier supervision system the auditors conduct on site audits while finma retains responsibility for overall supervision and enforcement measures to a certain extent the auditors act as an extension long arm of finma exercising direct supervision through regular audit checks in addition to examining the annual financial statements with an independent valuation of assets and liabilities the auditors also review whether the banks comply with their articles of association and their organisational rules as well as with the provisions of swiss banking law the circulars issued by finma and any applicable self regulatory provisions external auditors must on an annual basis prepare long form reports addressed to the members of the board of directors of the bank concerned and to finma these reports provide a comprehensive overview of the business activities and the internal organisation of the relevant bank the purpose of these reports is to allow finma to ensure that the financial institution complies with the regulatory requirements and that the individuals entrusted with its management enjoy a good reputation and thereby assure the proper conduct of business operations ie guarantee of irreproachable activity these audit reports are the main informational tools through which finma exercises its supervision in addition to the long form reports the auditors are obliged to inform finma if they suspect any breach of law or uncover other serious irregularities finma then initiates investigations and takes other measures necessary to ensure compliance with the legal framework and to eliminate irregularities a special supervisory regime has been put in place for the largest swiss banks ubs credit suisse zürcher kantonalbank and the financial groups raiffeisen and postfinance given the systemic risk caused by the size of these institutions in short finma does not exclusively rely on the reports received from the auditors but carries out its own investigations in accordance with its risk based supervision approach enforcement how do the regulatory authorities enforce banking laws and regulations the enforcement of swiss banking laws and regulations is closely linked to the obligation for swiss banks to ensure compliance at all times with the requirements for a banking licence continuing compliance with the conditions of a banking licence if at any time after the licence has been granted any of the licence requirements are no longer satisfied finma may take administrative measures aimed at ensuring the breach be remedied finma may also appoint an investigator in order to clarify the factual situation and to facilitate the implementation of the measures imposed by the authority should the breach of the legal and regulatory framework be characterised as serious finma could ultimately withdraw the banking licence something that would trigger the forced liquidation of the bank what are the most common enforcement issues and how have they been addressed by the regulators and the banks the most common enforcement issues encountered in the practice of finma may be generally summarised as follows the forced liquidation of unauthorised securities dealers the insolvency procedures and protective measures related to authorised and unauthorised entities procedures against individuals including entry onto a watch list ie a database with information on individuals whose business conduct is questionable or does not meet legal requirements and the sending of business conduct letters whereby finma informs the individual of its reservations as regards the assurance of proper business conduct the issues related to the compliance with the know your customer rules set out in the federal anti money laundering act and the agreement on the swiss banks code of conduct with regard to the exercise of due diligence see question 2 and the diligence requirements within the provision of cross border financial services as well as insider trading and market manipulation and the ongoing supervision of licensed entities especially banks and securities dealers in particular in order to ensure that the persons entrusted with the management of these entities fulfil on an ongoing basis the guarantee of irreproachable activity since spring 2015 finma publishes a summary enforcement report aiming at improving the transparency of its enforcement activity and having a preventive action on the financial market this report contains anonymised summaries of cases and includes references to court decisions and statistics on finma s enforcement activity resolution government takeovers in what circumstances may banks be taken over by the government or regulatory authorities how frequent is this in practice how are the interests of the various stakeholders treated swiss law does not provide for any specific rules setting out the conditions and situations in which a swiss banking institution may be taken over by the government or regulatory authorities hence the ubs recapitalisation that took place in 2008 where the swiss confederation made a capital injection into ubs through the subscription of mandatory convertible bonds for 6 billion swiss francs required the enactment of a special urgent law the federal ordinance of 15 october 2008 on the recapitalisation of ubs ag by the swiss government by contrast the involvement of finma within bank reorganisation and liquidation proceedings is now expressly provided for in the banking act and the implementing finma bank insolvency ordinance see questions 13 and 18 bank failures what is the role of the bank s management and directors in the case of a bank failure must banks have a resolution plan or similar document finma requires that swiss banks have sound business contingency management in place to ensure that critical business functions can be maintained or restored as quickly as possible in the event of a crisis sifis are in addition required to have contingency or recovery plans often called living wills in place the responsibility for the establishment of such plans lies with the bank s board of directors and senior management also if a bank becomes over indebted or experiences serious liquidity issues finma can order broad and far reaching protective measures which may directly affect the bank s conduct of business and the role of the bank s management and directors these protective measures may be taken independently from or in addition to the ordering of formal restructuring or liquidation proceedings in this context finma is in particular vested with the power to give direct instructions to the bank s governing bodies limit the powers of the bank s directors or managers or remove them from office remove the bank s statutory audit company limit the business activities of the bank forbid the bank to make or accept payments or undertake securities transactions order a temporary stay of a counterparty s right to enforce a debt against the bank and order a temporary stay of any contractual termination or termination of a counterparty right with respect to any contracts subject to certain conditions see question 18 are managers or directors personally liable in the case of a bank failure swiss law does not provide for a specific liability regime applicable to directors or managers of a bank should the bank s failure result from an intentional or negligent breach of the directors or managers duties the general rules of swiss company law would apply to determine the managers or directors personal liability for the damage caused to the company its shareholders or creditors this liability for mismanagement must be distinguished from the liability regime applicable to the managing or non managing partners of a swiss bank which is set up as a partnership or a limited partnership often referred to as a swiss private bank in case of bankruptcy of a swiss private bank the partners with unlimited liability would be jointly and severally liable with their own personal assets planning exercises describe any resolution planning or similar exercises that banks are required to conduct in line with international standards and as mentioned above sifis are to have both a recovery and a resolution plan aimed at identifying risks with respect to the stability of the financial system owing to their systemically important nature and determining viable ways to deal with the impact of a crisis in accordance with the banking ordinance a sifi is to establish a recovery plan that contains the measures that it would take in case of crisis and that would allow it to pursue its activity without requiring governmental funds responsibility for drafting and regularly updating the recovery plan rests with the executive board level of the sifi and must be embedded in a viable corporate governance framework the recovery plan as well as any amendment of it is subject to finma s approval provided that the legal requirements are met finma approves the recovery plan and then elaborates a resolution plan on its own based on the information provided by the sifi presently finma considers that the two largest swiss banks credit suisse and ubs have improved their crisis resistance over the years by establishing detailed finma approved recovery plans and implementing the necessary organisational measures see question 4 the resolution plan presents how in concrete terms a recovery measure or a sifi liquidation could take place finma is not obliged to disclose the resolution plan to the sifi in question and may in practice deviate from the sifi s planned strategies and measures if it deems appropriate capital requirements capital adequacy describe the legal and regulatory capital adequacy requirements for banks must banks make contingent capital arrangements the granting of a banking licence is subject to a minimum equity requirement the fully paid up share capital of a swiss bank must amount to a minimum of 10 million swiss francs and must not be directly or indirectly financed by the bank offset against claims of the bank or secured by assets of the bank in practice finma determines in each case the appropriate level of capital with regards to the scope of the contemplated activities capital adequacy and measurement rules are detailed in the revised cao the revised liquidity ordinance liqo and the revised finma circular 2015 2 liquidity risks banks see question 20 the current regime provides for minimum capital requirements that call at all times for an aggregate tier 1 and tier 2 capital ratio of 8 per cent of the bank s risk weighted assets in addition risk weighted positions must be covered at a ratio of 4 5 per cent with common equity tier 1 cet i capital and at a ratio of 6 per cent with tier 1 capital furthermore banks are to have from 1 january 2016 a capital buffer in the form of cet i capital between 2 5 and 4 8 per cent of the risk weighted assets finally under certain circumstances the swiss national bank can request that the swiss government order that an additional countercyclical buffer of up to 2 5 per cent of all or certain categories of the risk weighted assets be maintained in switzerland in the form of cet i capital in february 2013 such a countercyclical buffer was activated at the level of 1 per cent on loans secured against residential properties in switzerland on 30 june 2014 as per the request of the swiss national bank the swiss federal council increased the countercyclical buffer at the level of 2 per cent from 1 july 2016 banks with total assets of at least 250 billion swiss francs of which the total foreign commitment amounts to at least 10 billion swiss francs or with a total foreign commitment of at least 25 billion swiss francs are required to maintain an extended countercyclical buffer in the form of common equity tier 1 capital finally if finma deems risks not adequately covered by these capital requirements it can order banks to maintain additional capital in november 2017 the swiss federal council decided to revise as of 1 january 2018 the cao in order to introduce in addition to the above requirements a leverage ratio in accordance with basel iii requirements the revised cao requires a risk weighted capital ratio that rise with increasing size as well as an unweighted capital adequacy requirement for all non systemically important banks a safety net in the form of a leverage ratio has been implemented with this capital adequacy requirement based on the leverage ratio in this context a minimum core capital tier 1 to a total exposure ratio of 3 per cent is now required for all non sifis in december 2017 finma launched a consultation until mid february 2018 on the updating of circular 2015 3 leverage ratio so that banks can also apply the basel iii standard approach for derivatives when calculating the leverage ratio as regards quantitative liquidity requirements applied to non systemic banks the liqo was first revised on 1 january 2015 in line with the basel iii requirements in order to introduce two minimum standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr was introduced to ensure that banks hold a liquidity buffer to offset increased net cash outflows under a specified 30 day stress scenario according to the liqo non systemic banks were to comply with 60 per cent of the lcr s requirements as of 1 january 2015 by each of the following three years they have to comply with an additional 10 per cent until they have complied with 90 per cent of the lcr s requirements for 2018 phase in until 1 january 2019 the nsfr which requires non systemic banks to have sufficient stable funding available to cover illiquid assets initially had to be implemented in january 2018 that being the case owing to delays with the introduction of the nsfr on the european union and united states financial markets the swiss federal council has decided to review the situation at the end of 2018 and not to postpone the introduction of this requirement this year it should be noted that the liqo has been further revised based on practice and feedback since the implementation of the lcr requirement since 1 january 2018 the revised liqo provides for a relaxation of the lcr requirements for small banks the revised finma circular 2015 2 liquidity risk banks which also entered into force on 1 january 2018 clarifies inter alia the regime applicable to small banks in this context with regard to sifis the cao sets out a specific capital adequacy regime the latter calls for more stringent requirements as regards the bank s risk weighted assets which broadly comprise a basic requirement of leverage ratio of 4 5 per cent in line with the basel iii minimum requirements applicable to all banks an additional component of risk weighted assets of 12 86 per cent and a surcharge these requirements must not fall below 3 per cent with respect to the leverage ratio and 8 per cent as regards risk weighted assets that the sifi is to maintain at all times with regard to the surcharge its size is set with respect to the degree of systemic importance ie the total exposure and the market share of the relevant sifi as from 1 january 2018 sifis may also be subject to a total exposure ratio up to 10 per cent sifis also have to satisfy countercyclical equity buffers and leverage ratio requirements in addition to capital liquidity organisational and risk diversification requirements the applicable regime also entails provisions that allow the government to order adjustments to the remuneration system of a bank which would have to rely on government funding how are the capital adequacy guidelines enforced enforcement of the capital adequacy requirements is part of the ongoing supervision process aimed at ensuring that the requirements of the banking licence are met compliance with capital adequacy requirements has to be reported to the swiss national bank on a quarterly basis and is one of the topics addressed in the long form reports issued by the bank s external auditors on a yearly basis see question 9 undercapitalisation what happens in the event that a bank becomes undercapitalised finma benefits from an exclusive competence to intervene in the event of a bank s undercapitalisation upon the occurrence of a risk of undercapitalisation or insolvency finma can take various protective measures such as a moratorium of claims further in case of need finma may appoint a trustee in charge of the bank s reorganisation the latter is then to propose to finma a reorganisation plan with the purpose of protecting the bank s creditors such a scheme generally aims to recapitalise the bank for example through converting debt into equity as a result of the financial crisis finma was also granted additional powers with a view to increasing the likelihood of successful restructuring of a distressed bank finma may order the transfer of all or part of the bank s activities to a bridge bank compel a conversion of certain convertible debt instruments issued by the bank eg cocos or a reduction or cancellation of the bank s equity capital or both and as an ultima ratio order the conversion of the bank s debt obligations into equity finma is also authorised to liquidate insolvent banks in particular if no reorganisation is possible these measures are set out in more detail in the finma bank insolvency ordinance moreover in the context of the entry into force of the federal act on financial market infrastructure the banking act and ordinance have been amended in order to allow finma to couple any protective measure or reorganisation measure with a temporary stay of any contractual termination or termination right of a counterparty with respect to any contracts or the exercise of certain netting realisation and transfer rights which prevail in the absence of a stay ordered by finma for up to 48 hours in this context the banking ordinance generally requires for enforceability purposes that banks only enter into new agreements or agree to amendments to agreements which are subject to foreign law or provide for a foreign jurisdiction provided the counterparty acknowledges finma s stay right this obligation has been further specified in the revised finma bank insolvency ordinance which entered into force in april 2017 according to this revised text agreements entered into by foreign group entities are only subject to this obligation if the respective financial contract was guaranteed or otherwise secured by a bank or securities dealer whose seat is in switzerland insolvency what are the legal and regulatory processes in the event that a bank becomes insolvent finma benefits from the power to intervene in the event a bank becomes insolvent see questions 13 and 18 for the intervention tools that are available to finma recent and future changes have capital adequacy guidelines changed or are they expected to change in the near future in addition to the special capital adequacy regime and the leverage ratio regime imposed on swiss sifis see question 16 finma implemented capital adequacy and liquidity rules in line with international standards see question 16 in order for banks to build up the required capital and replace or phase out capital that no longer qualifies under the new rules transitional rules provide for an implementation schedule over a time period stretching to 2019 on 1 january 2016 the revised finma circular 2016 1 disclosure banks entered into force this revision aimed at aligning the disclosure duties of banks on risks risk management equity capital and liquidity on basel iii requirements in relation to it in the same vein the revised finma circular 2017 7 credit risks banks which came into force on 1 january 2017 with a transitional period of one year aims at aligning the credit risk capital requirements for banks with enhanced international standards in october 2017 finma announced that it will revise five of its bank related circulars ie 2008 6 interest rate risks banks 2011 2 capital buffer and capital planning banks 2013 1 eligible capital banks 2016 1 disclosure banks 2017 7 credit risks banks in accordance with changes in basel iii rules and international financial reporting standards a consultation was opened until the end of january 2018 for this purpose it is expected that the changes become effective in 2019 at the earliest one year later than under the international implementation schedule ownership restrictions and implications controlling interest describe the legal and regulatory limitations regarding the types of entities and individuals that may own a controlling interest in a bank what constitutes control for this purpose for purposes of the federal banking act a participation is deemed to be a qualified participation if it amounts to 10 per cent or more of the capital or voting rights of the bank or if the holder of the participation is otherwise in a position to significantly influence the business activities of the bank a qualified participation in practice finma often requires the disclosure of participations of 5 per cent or more for its assessment of whether or not the requirements of a banking licence are continuously met the federal banking act does not set any restrictions on the type of entities or individuals holding a controlling interest in a bank however one of the general requirements for a bank to obtain a licence is that individuals or legal entities holding be it directly or indirectly a qualified participation in a bank must ensure that their influence has no negative impact on the prudent and reliable business activities of the bank therefore the bank s shareholders and their activities can be relevant for the granting and the maintenance of a banking licence examples of circumstances where shareholders with a qualified participation may have a negative influence on the bank are a lack of transparency unclear organisation or financial difficulties of financial conglomerates as well as an influence of a criminal organisation on the shareholder should finma be of the view that the requirements for the banking licence are no longer met because of a shareholder with a qualified participation it may suspend the voting rights in relation to such qualified participation or if appropriate and as a measure of last resort withdraw the licence which would trigger a liquidation proceeding foreign ownership are there any restrictions on foreign ownership of banks if foreign nationals with qualified participations directly or indirectly hold more than half of the voting rights of or otherwise a controlling influence on a bank incorporated under swiss law the granting of the banking licence is subject to additional requirements in particular the corporate name of a foreign controlled swiss bank must not indicate or suggest that the bank is controlled by swiss individuals or entities and the countries where the owners of a qualified participation in a bank have their registered office or domicile must grant reciprocity which is swiss residents and swiss entities must have the possibility to operate a bank in the respective country and such banks operated by swiss residents are not subject to more restrictive provisions compared to foreign banks in switzerland the reciprocity requirement is subject to any obligations to the contrary in governmental treaties and is therefore not applicable to world trade organization member states furthermore finma may request that the bank is subject to adequate consolidated supervision by a foreign supervisory authority if the bank forms part of a group active in the financial sector if a bank incorporated under swiss law becomes foreign controlled as described above or if in the case of a foreign controlled bank the foreign holders of a direct or indirect qualified participation in the swiss bank change a new special licence for foreign controlled banks must be obtained prior to such event for the purposes of the federal banking act a foreigner is an individual who is not a swiss citizen and has no permanent residence permit for switzerland or a legal entity or partnership that has its registered office outside switzerland or if its registered office is in switzerland is controlled by individuals as defined above implications and responsibilities what are the legal and regulatory implications for entities that control banks there are no restrictions as to the business activities of the entities holding qualified participations in a bank providing the conditions for the granting and maintenance of the licence see question 21 are complied with generally transactions between the controlling shareholders of a bank and the bank itself may be subject to specific requirements eg the granting of loans to significant shareholders must be in compliance with generally recognised principles of the banking industry what are the legal and regulatory duties and responsibilities of an entity or individual that controls a bank each controlling shareholder has the duty to give notification of the acquisition or disposal of a qualified participation as well as its participation reaching exceeding or falling below certain thresholds see question 29 further as mentioned above the holder of a qualified participation must not negatively influence the prudent and reliable business activities of the bank otherwise the bank may lose its licence in cases where justified concerns exist that a bank is over indebted no longer complies with the capital adequacy rules or has serious liquidity problems finma may order certain protective measures and the establishment of a recapitalisation plan under a recapitalisation plan the rights of creditors and shareholders may be impaired see question 18 what are the implications for a controlling entity or individual in the event that a bank becomes insolvent there are no specific implications for a controlling shareholder of a bank if the bank becomes insolvent other than those described in question 18 changes in control required approvals describe the regulatory approvals needed to acquire control of a bank how is control defined for this purpose even though the acquisition of a qualified participation in a bank by a swiss individual or a swiss entity triggers in theory only notification obligations see question 29 it is necessary to seek a letter of no objection from finma for the account of the bank prior to an envisaged transfer of a controlling stake in a swiss bank since finma controls the continuing compliance with the conditions of a banking licence finma will examine whether the influence of the new shareholder with a qualified participation would be detrimental to the prudent and reliable business activities of the bank foreign acquirers are the regulatory authorities receptive to foreign acquirers how is the regulatory process different for a foreign acquirer the notification requirements outlined in question 29 also apply to non swiss acquirers in addition if a foreign individual or entity acquires a qualified participation in a swiss bank the bank must apply to finma for a special licence provided that foreign nationals with qualified participations directly or indirectly hold more than half of the votes of or otherwise a dominant influence on the bank for the conditions of the additional licence see question 22 factors considered by authorities what factors are considered by the relevant regulatory authorities in an acquisition of control of a bank finma generally considers whether the requirements for the banking licence are still met and in particular whether the new shareholders with a qualified participation will not negatively influence the bank s prudent and reliable business activities filing requirements describe the required filings for an acquisition of control of a bank each individual or legal entity must notify finma prior to acquiring or selling a direct or indirect qualified participation in a bank organised under swiss law this notification duty also applies if a qualified shareholder increases or reduces its qualified participation and attains falls below or exceeds 20 33 or 50 per cent of the capital or voting rights in the bank the notification must include a declaration whether the participation is held for the own account and whether any option or similar rights have been granted over the participation the bank itself is also required to notify finma of any changes triggering the notification duty of the shareholders once it becomes aware of such change in any case at least once a year in the case of a foreign controlled bank prior to any change of a foreign holder of a qualified participation the bank must apply with finma for a special licence in its application the bank has to demonstrate all the facts based on which finma may assess whether the conditions for the special permit are fulfilled as mentioned in question 26 it would be advisable that the bank contacts finma prior to a change of a holder of a qualified participation even if the bank is swiss controlled this would not need to be in the form of a formal application timeframe for approval what is the typical time frame for regulatory approval for both a domestic and a foreign acquirer generally the timing of the approvals or statements by finma largely depends on its workload the process for a special banking licence in the case of a foreign controlled bank may take three months however if the country of domicile or residence of the foreigner is not a world trade organization member the process may take much longer finma will have to assess whether that country grants the right of reciprocity if the acquirer is not a foreigner there is no formal approval or licence required and thus a statement of finma is available within a shorter time frame update and trends update and trends updates and trends since 2015 finma s focus has been on adapting the applicable legal and regulatory framework to the needs of the fintech sector in order to promote innovation in the financial sector finma is reviewing new licensing categories with less stringent requirements in this context on 2 november 2016 the swiss federal council instructed the fdf to prepare a consultation draft aiming to relax certain licensing requirements for fintech companies on 1 february 2017 the swiss federal council proposed for public consultation a draft focusing of the following three main elements the introduction of a maximum period of 60 days as opposed to seven days in accordance with finma s current practice for the holding of monies on settlement accounts eg for crowdfunding projects without any limitation in terms of amounts the creation of an innovation area called sandbox where companies are allowed to accept public deposits up to a total amount of 1 million swiss francs and without the need to apply for a banking licence subject to certain conditions such as disclosures prohibition to invest deposits etc and the introduction of a new fintech licence granted to institutions whose activities are limited to deposit taking activities to the exclusion of lending activities involving maturity transformation in such a case the total amount of the deposits would not exceed 100 million swiss francs moreover the minimum equity capital of companies benefitting from such a licence would have to amount to 5 per cent of the public funds and would be in any case above 300 000 swiss francs the first two pillars of the fintech sandbox regime were adopted by the swiss federal council on 5 july 2017 and entered into force on 1 august 2017 following this finma published a revised version of its circular 2008 03 on public deposits with non banks in december 2017 this circular which entered into force on 1 january 2018 specifies the sandbox regime and gives concrete examples with respect to the extension of the time frame applicable to settlement accounts on this issue finma clarified that the settlement account exemption does not apply to cryptocurrency dealers as long as their activity is comparable to that of a forex exchange trader the third item the fintech license light is currently being debated in the swiss parliament as part of the adoption of the finsa and finia see question 6 it is therefore not expected to enter into force before mid 2019 the swiss banking regulatory framework is expected to remain in a state of flux in the coming years with changes aimed at strengthening client protection and promoting innovation in the financial sector
account of the monetary policy meeting of the governing council of the european central bank held in frankfurt am main on wednesday and thursday 6 7 march 2019 1 review of financial economic and monetary developments and policy options financial market developments mr cœuré reviewed the latest financial market developments as regards bond market developments the fall in euro area ten year overnight index swap ois yields from early october 2018 to mid february 2019 had recently reversed slightly notwithstanding the recent recovery yields remained compressed compared with the levels observed in early october 2018 mr cœuré recalled that the dominant driver of lower yields in recent months had been a fall in the inflation component as reflected in revisions to market based inflation expectations the pronounced decrease in inflation linked swap rates across all maturities in the fourth quarter of 2018 had likely been related at least in part to the sharp parallel fall in oil prices however since the end of december 2018 oil prices had gone up by more than 25 both in us dollar and in euro terms but the euro area and us medium term inflation expectations seemed to have responded differently the us five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead had risen by around 20 basis points since early january 2019 in contrast the equivalent swap rate for the euro area had continued to decline until last week as had been indicated on previous occasions the prevalence of risk premia adjustments in recent months implied that caution was warranted when interpreting monetary policy expectations purely derived from market prices for the euro area the latest forward one month ois curve indicated that policy expectations in the euro area had remained broadly stable since mid january 2019 survey based expectations of a first hike in the deposit facility rate however had continued to shift further out in time in the united states the federal funds futures curve had shifted upward in recent days and had returned to levels observed in the second half of january 2019 surveys had backtracked somewhat but mostly in terms of timing and still pointed to expectations of one more hike in 2019 moving to equity markets risky assets had continued to rally both the s p 500 and the euro stoxx had gained about 6 since the governing council s january monetary policy meeting and were up by around 11 year to date all in all stock markets had by now almost fully recovered the sharp losses seen in the fourth quarter of 2018 however at least in the euro area the gains in share prices did not reflect an improvement in earnings prospects rather higher share prices mainly reflected a fall in the equity risk premium emerging markets had also benefited from the improved risk sentiment the msci emerging markets index was already above its pre october 2018 level and capital inflows into emerging markets had accelerated again credit spreads too had continued to narrow on improved risk sentiment euro area high yield spreads were down nearly 80 basis points since the governing council s monetary policy meeting on 12 13 december 2018 investment grade spreads had also come down both in the united states and in the euro area similarly the spreads of most euro area sovereign bond yields over equivalent german government bond yields had fallen since the start of the year corporate bond issuance volumes in europe had also been strong the premium that firms had to pay for issuing new bonds had declined measurably in recent weeks which suggested that the end of net purchases under the corporate sector purchase programme cspp had not had a meaningful impact on the corporate bond market in foreign exchange markets the euro exchange rate vis à vis the us dollar had remained relatively stable and had continued to trade close to the usd eur 1 13 1 14 level observed since early october 2018 the euro and the us dollar had depreciated notably against the british pound in recent weeks which likely reflected the financial markets view that the risks of a no deal brexit had diminished lately finally mr cœuré mentioned developments in the euribor term structure which had seen a gradual and persistent rise in rates in particular over the longer horizons and which had become largely disconnected from changes in policy rate expectations the global environment and economic and monetary developments in the euro area mr praet reviewed the global environment and recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area regarding the external environment global growth and trade momentum had slowed further global composite output had decreased again in january pointing to further deceleration in global growth momentum the weakness had been concentrated in the manufacturing sector whereas services had remained considerably more resilient global trade had slowed significantly around the turn of the year annual consumer price inflation in the oecd area had slowed to 2 1 in january from 2 4 in december largely driven by decelerating energy prices inflation excluding food and energy had remained broadly unchanged at 2 2 suggesting that underlying inflation pressures had remained subdued after a period of stability brent crude oil prices had increased in mid february ending 6 higher than at the time of the governing council s january monetary policy meeting the euro exchange rate had depreciated slightly against the us dollar since the january meeting in bilateral terms 0 2 as well as in nominal effective terms 0 5 turning to the euro area the latest incoming information pointed to continued subdued growth indicators related to the manufacturing sector had weakened further whereas those related to services had showed signs of stabilisation eurostat s second release had put euro area real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 0 2 in terms of the composition of growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 domestic demand and net exports had provided positive contributions while inventories had contributed negatively concerning gdp components private consumption had increased by 0 2 in quarter on quarter terms in the fourth quarter of 2018 up from 0 1 in the third quarter the weakness in consumption growth in recent quarters had been largely driven by non durable goods which appeared to be the component of household spending most sensitive to changes in energy prices gross fixed capital formation had grown by 0 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the same rate as in the previous quarter looking ahead investment growth dynamics were expected to remain subdued in line with the slowdown in foreign and domestic demand incoming data since the january monetary policy meeting had shown a continuation of solid employment growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 0 3 the pmi for employment had remained in expansionary territory but had moderated further across most countries and sectors growth of euro area trade in goods had weakened further year on year in the final quarter of 2018 driven mainly by intra euro area trade growth of extra euro area goods exports had also remained subdued reflecting in particular the contraction of exports to turkey and the united kingdom while export growth to china and the united states had also weakened these developments were also reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff projections which projected real gdp growth at 1 1 in 2019 1 6 in 2020 and 1 5 in 2021 real gdp growth had been revised down by 0 6 percentage points in 2019 and by 0 1 percentage points in 2020 reflecting both a more lasting adverse impact of country specific factors and heightened global uncertainties the projections for 2021 were unchanged turning to price developments according to eurostat s flash estimate annual euro area hicp inflation had been 1 5 in february up from 1 4 in january while the hicp excluding food and energy inflation had decreased somewhat to 1 0 from 1 1 in january meanwhile measures of underlying inflation had continued to move sideways domestic cost pressures had been increasing but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation incoming data pointed to building wage pressures which were expected to support the upward adjustment in underlying inflation annual negotiated wage growth had risen to 2 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 up from 2 1 in the third quarter while overall compensation per employee had grown by 2 2 in the fourth quarter of 2018 ecb staff projected hicp inflation decreasing until the fourth quarter of 2019 and then picking up over the remainder of the projection horizon to reach 1 6 in 2021 this v shaped pattern reflected first a significant decrease in hicp energy inflation linked to the recent strong drop in oil prices and downward base effects related to their previous increase in 2018 and second gradually rising underlying inflation supported by rising supply constraints and tightening labour markets in the march 2019 ecb staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised down significantly by 0 3 percentage points in 2019 and by 0 2 percentage points in both 2020 and 2021 hicp excluding energy and food had been revised down by 0 2 percentage points in each year of the projection horizon longer term market based inflation expectations as derived from the five year inflation linked swap rates five years forward had declined to 1 5 compared with around 1 7 one year ago longer term inflation expectations five years ahead in the survey of professional forecasters spf stood at 1 8 in the first quarter of 2019 financial conditions had eased this reflected market expectations about future monetary policy and some easing of trade tensions the impact of these factors on financing conditions had more than offset the impact of the deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook as priced in by financial markets equity prices had increased despite a worsening in earnings expectations while corporate bond spreads had tightened the market implied expected timing of the policy rate lift off was largely unchanged credit conditions had remained accommodative turning to money and credit developments the annual growth rate of broad money m3 had continued to hover around the rates observed since early 2018 while decreasing to 3 8 in january 2019 from 4 1 in december 2018 money creation continued to be supported by credit to the private sector at the same time loan growth had been lower in january increasing by 3 0 compared with one year ago the recent deceleration reflected developments in loans to non financial corporations nfcs in part due to base effects while loans to households had recently stabilised bank profitability remained subdued while banks were faced with a somewhat higher cost of market funding at the same time market concerns had risen about pressures on banks funding costs due to the forthcoming phasing out of the tltro ii as regards fiscal policy the euro area deficit ratio was projected to worsen in 2019 21 mainly due to a loosening of the fiscal stance monetary policy considerations and policy options summing up mr praet remarked that since the january monetary policy meeting financial conditions had eased mainly on account of a reappraisal of monetary policies at the global level and abating trade tensions moreover credit conditions for households and firms remained accommodative incoming data had continued to be weak in particular in the manufacturing sector the growth outlook in the march 2019 ecb staff projections had been revised down substantially for 2019 and to a lesser extent for 2020 the euro area expansion would continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions further employment gains rising wages and the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity at the same time the persistence of uncertainties was weighing on the growth outlook measures of underlying inflation remained muted domestic cost pressures in particular wages had been strengthening but had yet to translate into higher underlying inflation the march 2019 ecb staff projections entailed a marked downward revision in both headline and core inflation across the projection horizon with weaker economic momentum slowing the adjustment of inflation towards the governing council s aim market based measures of longer term inflation expectations had weakened in recent months in this light to ensure that inflation remained on a sustained path to levels that were below but close to 2 over the medium term mr praet proposed a to adjust the calendar based leg of the ecb s forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates to indicate the governing council s expectation that rates would remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary as recalibrating the calendar based leg of forward guidance would signal the governing council s determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation b to reiterate the governing council s forward guidance on reinvestments and c to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years counterparties would be entitled to borrow up to 30 of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the ecb s main refinancing operations over the life of each tltro these new operations would help to preserve the favourable bank lending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy the precise terms of the operations would be communicated in due course finally the ecb s lending operations would continue to be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 as regards external communication the governing council needed to a stress that the weakening in economic data pointed to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into the current year b emphasise that the weaker economic momentum was slowing the adjustment of inflation towards the governing council s aim c adjust the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates namely that the governing council expected them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary while reiterating the forward guidance on reinvestments d announce a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 and stress that the new tltros would help to preserve bank lending conditions and support the smooth transmission of monetary policy e announce the extension of the fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for the ecb s lending operations for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 f explain that these decisions would support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term g indicate that the risks to the euro area growth outlook were still tilted to the downside because of the persistence of geopolitical uncertainties h stress that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential for a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term and would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros and i reiterate that in any event the governing council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation 2 governing council s discussion and monetary policy decisions economic and monetary analyses with regard to the economic analysis members broadly shared the assessment of the outlook for economic activity in the euro area provided by mr praet in his introduction recent data and survey results had continued to be weak in particular in the manufacturing sector reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector specific factors while there were signs that some of these domestic factors dampening growth were starting to fade the weakening in economic data pointed to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that would extend into the current year with the persistence of uncertainties appearing to weigh on economic sentiment and the growth outlook this assessment was broadly reflected in the march 2019 ecb staff projections in which the outlook for real gdp growth had been revised down substantially for 2019 and slightly for 2020 compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections in considering the outlook and risks for the external environment members took note of the further slowdown in global growth and trade momentum in particular there were concerns about the potential impact of trade protectionism on the global outlook and the ongoing risk of an escalation of trade conflicts reference was made in the discussion to a number of factors including the impact of trade tensions between the united states and china the threat posed by a trade dispute between the european union and the united states and the risks surrounding a disorderly withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union attention was also drawn to the slowdown in growth in china as well as developments in the us economy which was expected to slow as a result of the waning effect of the fiscal package against this background the risks to the external environment were assessed to be on the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets turning to euro area activity members concurred that the recent data had continued to be weaker than expected it was noted that the carry over effect from weaker growth in the second half of 2018 implied a lower projection for growth in 2019 recent economic indicators had also been disappointing with the latest surveys and data releases confirming the need to revise the short term growth outlook downwards as partly reflected in the march staff projections the downside risks to growth identified in earlier discussions had thus to some extent materialised the weakness in growth was seen as being longer lasting than had previously been expected with the result that growth was now likely to be below potential for a number of quarters members considered that the downward revisions to the growth projections in the march staff projections were warranted and expressed confidence in the baseline as the central scenario in this context it was observed that the updated outlook for euro area growth just released by the oecd in its interim economic outlook although slightly lower than the ecb staff projections with 1 0 for 2019 and 1 2 for 2020 also incorporated a substantial downward revision to euro area growth members acknowledged that while the baseline scenario of a more protracted soft patch followed by a return to more solid growth was the most likely scenario uncertainty remained elevated and it was unclear how persistent the current soft patch would turn out to be it was noted that while some indicators pointed to growth rates in the first and second quarters of this year that were lower than in the march staff projections there were some positive factors to be taken into account such as those relating to the impact of fiscal measures and the unwinding of some temporary country and sector specific factors notably in the german car industry moreover it was recalled that beyond the near term a number of factors continued to support the euro area economic expansion including favourable financing conditions further employment gains and rising wage growth as well as the ongoing albeit somewhat slower expansion in global activity it was also emphasised that while the growth momentum was weaker it remained positive neither the euro area nor the global economy was currently in recession and the probability of a recession remained relatively low at the same time the view was widely shared that downside risks to the growth outlook continued to prevail despite the downward revisions incorporated in the march projections it was stressed that the revisions to the growth projections were mainly to the short term and that a rebound in activity was expected in the second half of the year reflecting the fading of temporary factors an improvement in external trade and an easing of trade conflicts following the downward revisions to growth in the first half of the year growth was expected to return to potential with quarter on quarter growth rates of around 0 4 throughout the projection horizon which might be considered optimistic it was highlighted that the growth projections had been revised down in a number of consecutive projection exercises and that growth might not be mean reverting as typically assumed in projections the remark was made that some of the factors behind the slowdown such as developments in china were unlikely to fade away in a few months uncertainty might also turn out to be more persistent than expected and concern was expressed that if the current high level of uncertainty persisted there could be a stronger adverse impact looking ahead in particular on investment as regards the balance of risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook these were generally assessed to be still tilted to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets although a case could be made that the risks to growth were now somewhat more balanced following the downward revision to the ecb staff projections it was considered that overall the global risk factors which were predominantly on the downside had the potential to further affect confidence and global activity negatively with adverse spillovers to activity in the euro area in an exchange of views about the outlook for fiscal policy members reiterated the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers in countries where government debt was high at the same time it was argued that consistent with the country specific recommendations from the european commission jurisdictions that had fiscal space should stand ready to use it given the downside risks to growth the mildly expansionary fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers were providing some support to economic activity with regard to price developments there was broad agreement with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction on the basis of current futures prices for oil headline inflation was likely to remain at around current levels before declining towards the end of the year measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted but labour cost pressures had strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets looking ahead underlying inflation was expected to increase over the medium term supported by the ecb s monetary policy measures the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth this assessment was also broadly reflected in the march staff projections in which annual hicp inflation was projected to rise from 1 2 in 2019 to 1 5 in 2020 and to 1 6 in 2021 compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections the outlook for hicp inflation had been revised down over the whole projection horizon reflecting in particular the more subdued near term growth outlook members took note of the implications for the medium term inflation outlook arising from the downward revisions to the growth outlook and generally agreed that the weaker economic momentum in the march staff projections implied a slower adjustment of inflation to the ecb s price stability objective underlying inflation as measured by the hicp excluding energy and food was still expected to pick up over the projection horizon but had also been revised down compared with the december 2018 eurosystem staff projections confidence in the upward movement in inflation dynamics was expressed even though the expected path for inflation was flatter than previously expected and thus the convergence of inflation would take longer than previously expected headline inflation was now only expected to reach 1 6 in 2021 at the end of the projection horizon members considered that recent developments in wage growth continued to provide positive support for the outlook for underlying inflation although compensation per employee in the euro area had been revised down slightly in the projections nominal labour costs were expected to strengthen supported by negotiated wage growth which stood at 2 2 in december 2018 the transmission of higher wages to consumer price inflation was considered to remain a key issue for the medium term outlook for inflation with higher wage growth not yet having passed through to price inflation as firms had absorbed increases by lowering profit margins some confidence was expressed however that as mark ups could not be squeezed indefinitely wage pressures would eventually pass through to underlying inflation at the same time it was highlighted that a smaller increase in unit labour costs was now projected and that the projected increase in profit margins was predicated on the rebound in economic activity taking place more generally it was recalled that the transmission to consumer price inflation was subject to time lags and it was noted that the slowdown in economic activity could weigh on the pass through from wages to prices moreover the mechanism whereby higher wage costs were transferred to prices might have changed structurally in recent years as appeared to be the case in both the united states and europe as regards recent developments in longer term inflation expectations members noted that expectations had declined further since the governing council s january 2019 monetary policy meeting market based inflation expectations as measured by the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead currently stood at 1 5 longer term survey based inflation expectations had been revised down as well standing at 1 8 in the spf for the first quarter of 2019 hence the gap between survey based and market based measures had widened somewhat while some concern was expressed about the trend in longer term inflation expectations the risk of an unanchoring of inflation expectations was assessed as very low on the monetary analysis members concurred with the assessment presented by mr praet in his introduction m3 continued to hover around the growth rates observed since early 2018 while private credit remained the main source of money creation from a counterpart perspective the decline in the contribution of the asset purchase programme app had recently been replaced by external monetary flows and credit to the general government the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs had decreased to 3 3 in january 2019 from 3 9 in december 2018 reflecting a base effect but also in some countries the typical lagged reaction to a slowdown in economic activity while growth in loans to households had remained unchanged it was underlined that bank lending conditions remained overall very supportive even if the latest available bank lending survey had pointed to the prospect of some tightening looking ahead bank funding conditions had become somewhat less favourable although banks were partly shielded from less benign conditions in bond markets owing to the increased share of deposits in their funding structures concerns were voiced that over time the effects of persistently low rates could depress banks interest margins and profitability with negative effects on bank intermediation and financial stability in the longer run it was recalled that the consequences of low rates differed across the maturity spectrum and across banks depending on their business models and the structure of their assets and liabilities monetary policy stance and policy considerations with regard to the monetary policy stance members widely shared the assessment provided by mr praet in his introduction that euro area financial conditions had eased also on account of markets reassessment of global monetary policy and remained overall very supportive borrowing conditions for firms and households were still favourable as the monetary policy measures put in place since june 2014 were continuing to support access to financing while the monetary policy stance was assessed as being very accommodative also in the light of the large stock of assets on the ecb s balance sheet the downward revisions of growth and inflation across the forecast horizon in the march staff projections were sizeable and larger than market participants had expected warranting some consideration at the same time confidence was expressed that the conditions for a rebound in activity and inflation remained in place to support a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term against this background members expressed broad support for the package of measures proposed by mr praet the proposed extension of the calendar based leg of the governing council s forward guidance was generally seen as underpinning the monetary accommodation needed to support inflation converging towards the governing council s aim reference was made to the publication of the downward revision to the projections which was in any case likely by itself to induce a further delay in the expected date of the first interest rate increase in line with the state contingent element of the forward guidance it was emphasised that the governing council would be reacting to the projected decrease in the inflation projections in a data driven manner in order to provide additional support in a situation that was characterised by various risks a question was raised about how frequently forward guidance should be adjusted in response to new data all in all bringing the calendar based leg of forward guidance more into line with market expectations of a later date for the first interest rate increase was widely seen as appropriately reflecting the governing council s assessment of the inflation outlook a number of members voiced an initial preference for extending the forward guidance through the end of the first quarter of 2020 while expressing their readiness to join a consensus forming on mr praet s proposal with the overall policy package seen as finely balanced shifting the forward guidance to march 2020 instead of december 2019 would provide additional accommodation and would be more in line with the markets pricing of a first interest rate increase compared with survey based expectations it was argued that a clear easing signal would be important in view of the significant downward revisions to the ecb staff projections other members preferred to extend the forward guidance until the end of 2019 as this was considered to be more consistent with the baseline scenario underlying the projections that foresaw a rebound of the economy in the second half of 2019 caution was expressed about committing to a longer horizon well into the following year in a situation of high uncertainty where incoming data could evolve in very different ways in view of the high prevailing uncertainty a data driven gradualist approach was seen as most appropriate while it was also argued that the governing council should avoid giving the impression that policy would be all but predetermined until the end of the year the need for more analysis of the effects of the various unconventional measures on financial intermediation was mentioned all in all members agreed to extend the governing council s forward guidance through the end of 2019 as part of the overall package as proposed by mr praet recalibrating the calendar based leg of the governing council s forward guidance would signal the governing council s determination to provide the monetary accommodation needed for a sustained convergence of inflation at the same time it would not pre empt the governing council s readjustment of its monetary policy if needed at one of its coming meetings should the outlook evolve less favourably than expected moreover the state based leg of forward guidance automatically implied a shift in rate expectations if the economic conditions for an interest rate increase were not yet in place satisfaction was expressed that the state based element of the governing council s forward guidance was working well together with the calendar based guidance members also expressed broad support for mr praet s proposal to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years these new operations would help to ensure that bank lending conditions remained favourable and would support the smooth transmission of monetary policy via the banking sector in the light of looming cliff effects related to maturing tltro ii operations upcoming regulatory requirements and the risk of some deterioration in funding conditions for banks tltro iii would help to avoid increasing funding pressures for banks in the discussion the mostly pre emptive nature of tltro iii was stressed as in most jurisdictions a tightening of credit conditions had not yet been observed tltro iii would act as a backstop to provide insurance to the economy at a time of high uncertainty with risks tilted to the downside while it was recalled that tltros had been very successful measures for providing accommodation in the euro area s bank based financial system their targeted nature was highlighted as well with respect to the horizon of the new set of operations a sufficiently long horizon was seen as helpful to ensure sufficient accommodation to bring inflation towards levels of below but close to 2 over the medium term and increase the impact on the real economy also by broadly matching the typical maturity of loans to nfcs conversely a shorter horizon would provide a stronger signal to banks that they needed to be prepared to secure funding on private markets and avoid becoming overly reliant on central bank funding members agreed that the design of the tltro iii operations should support the smooth transmission of monetary policy and favourable bank lending conditions preserving sufficient accommodation to support the convergence of inflation to the governing council s aim while not perpetuating the reliance of banks on unconventional policy measures modelling the conditions for the new operations on the design of tltro ii was seen as a way to ensure their pass through to the real economy and limit the use of funds for carry trades in government bonds financial stability considerations had to be taken into account but also needed to be addressed at the country level with regard to the pricing of tltro iii it was generally agreed that it should be indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations there was broad agreement that elaborating the details would need more reflection by the governing council and they should be communicated in due course members also agreed to continue conducting lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 monetary policy decisions and communication in the light of the foregoing discussion the president ascertained that all members supported the package of measures as proposed by mr praet turning to communication members widely agreed that it needed to be emphasised that decisions to be taken by the governing council would support the further build up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term moreover the measures would help to increase the resilience of the euro area economy to the risks resulting from geopolitical uncertainties at the same time it was underlined that the decisions should be seen as an appropriate adjustment of the instruments at the governing council s disposal in reaction to a weakening of economic data and the inflation outlook and should not be interpreted as a reversal of the policy stance in the governing council s communication it was furthermore seen as warranted to reiterate that significant monetary policy stimulus remained essential for a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below but close to 2 over the medium term and that it would continue to be provided by the forward guidance on the key ecb interest rates reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of tltros as emphasised in previous communication it also needed to be reiterated that in any event the governing council stood ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure a sustained convergence of inflation taking into account the foregoing discussion among the members on a proposal from the president the governing council took the following monetary policy decisions the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility would remain unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 40 respectively the governing council now expected the key ecb interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below but close to 2 over the medium term the governing council intended to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when it started raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation a new series of quarterly targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii would be launched starting in september 2019 and ending in march 2021 each with a maturity of two years these new operations would help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy under tltro iii counterparties would be entitled to borrow up to 30 of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 february 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation like the outstanding tltro programme tltro iii would feature built in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable further details on the precise terms of tltro iii would be communicated in due course the eurosystem s lending operations would continue to be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in march 2021 the members of the governing council subsequently finalised the introductory statement which the president and the vice president would as usual deliver at the press conference following the end of the current governing council

this month the federal reserve joined its global peers by turning decisively dovish jerome powell and friends haven t just stopped tightening soon they will begin actively easing by reinvesting the fed s maturing mortgage bonds into treasury securities it s not exactly quantitative easing i ii and iii but it will have some of the same effects why are they doing this one theory which i admit possibly plausible was that powell simply caved to wall street pressure the rate hikes and qt were hitting asset prices and liquidity much to the detriment of bankers and others to whom the fed pays keen attention but that doesn t truly square with his 2018 speeches and actions the fed s march 20 announcement suggests more is happening i think two other factors are driving the fed s thinking one is increasing recognition of the same slowing global growth that made other central banks turn dovish in recent months the other is the fed s realization that its previous course risked inverting the yield curve which was violently turning against its fourth quarter expectations and possibly toward recession see chart below courtesy of wsj s daily shot that would not have looked good in the history books hence the backtracking on the second point too late the yield curve inverted and recession forecasts became suddenly de rigueur among the same financial punditry that was wildly bullish just weeks ago my own position has been consistent recession is approaching but not just yet yet like the fed i am data dependent and the latest data are not encouraging today we ll examine this and consider what may have changed let s start with a step back the global economy clearly hasn t recovered from the last recession like it did in previous cycles yes the stock market performed well so has real estate we ve seen some economic growth which in a few places you might even call a boom but for the most part it s been pretty mild unemployment is low but wage growth has been sluggish at best rising asset prices fueled by almost a decade of easy monetary policy also contributed to wealth and income inequality which fueled populist and now semi socialist movements around the world this slow recovery began fading in the last few quarters the first cracks appeared overseas leaving the us as an island of stability not coincidentally we also had slightly positive interest rates and thus attracted capital from elsewhere this let our growth continue longer but now signs of weakness are mounting here too recall this follows years of astonishing amazing unprecedented and astronomically huge monetary stimulus by the federal reserve bank of japan european central bank and others in various and sundry ways they opened the spigots and left them running full speed for almost a decade and all it produced was the above mentioned weak recovery chart below from my friend jim bianco again via the daily shot that alone should tell you that putting your faith in central bankers is probably a mistake we can t know how much worse the last decade would have been without their help but does this feel like success yet here we are with millions still in the hole from the last recession and another one possibly looming we also can t rely on historical precedent to identify where when or why it will start but we can make some educated guesses earlier i called the us an island of stability other such islands exist too and australia is high on the list the last down under recession was 27 yes 27 years ago in 1991 no other developed economy can say the same the long streak has a lot to do with being one of china s top raw material suppliers during that country s historic boom but australia has done other things right too alas all good things come to an end while not officially in recession yet australia s growth is slowing university of new south wales professor richard holden says it is in effective recession with per capita gdp having declined in both q3 and q4 of 2018 by the way italy is similarly in a technical recession expect more such euphemisms as governments try to avoid uttering the r word as often happens real estate is involved australia s housing boom bubble could unravel badly last week grant williams highlighted a video by economist john adams digital finance analytics founder martin north and irish financial adviser eddie hobbs who say australia s economy looks increasingly like ireland s just before the 2007 housing collapse the parallels are a bit spooky australia s household debt to gdp was 120 5 per cent as of september last year according to the bank for international settlements one of the highest in the world in 2007 ireland was sitting at around 100 per cent at the same time the rba puts australia s household debt to disposable income at 188 6 per cent ireland was 200 per cent in 2007 while the us was only 116 3 per cent at the start of 2008 rba figures also show more than two thirds of the country s net household wealth is invested in real estate in 2008 that figure was 83 per cent in ireland and 48 per cent in the us meanwhile 60 per cent of all lending by australian financial institutions is in the property sector in 2007 the international monetary fund gave the irish economy and banking system a clean bill of health and suggested that a soft landing was the most likely outcome last month the imf said australia s property market was heading for a soft landing house prices in sydney and melbourne have fallen nearly 14 per cent and 10 per cent from their respective peaks in july and november 2017 coinciding with sharp drop off in credit flowing into the housing sector both for owner occupiers and investors real estate is by nature credit driven few people pay cash for land homes or commercial properties so when credit dries up so does demand for those assets falling demand means lower prices which is bad when you are highly leveraged it gets worse from there as the banking system gets dragged into the fray losses can quickly spread as defaults affect lenders far from the source like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name

and one company reveals the impact shipping and transport stocks are kind of a canary in the coal mine because they are among the first to signal slowing growth last week fedex reported its international shipping revenue was down and cut its full year earnings guidance its cfo blamed the economy reported cnbc slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue as seen in the year over year decline in our fedex express international revenue alan b graf jr fedex corp executive vice president and chief financial officer said in statement despite a strong u s economy fedex said its international business weakened during the second quarter especially in europe fedex express international was down due primarily to higher growth in lower yielding services and lower weights per shipment graf said to compensate for lower revenue graf said fedex began a voluntary employee buyout program and constrained hiring it is also limiting discretionary spending and is reviewing additional actions fedex shares have dropped roughly 27 percent in the past year lagging the xli industrial etf s 1 percent decline this little snippet overflows with implications let s unpack some of them revenue fell due to higher growth in lower yielding services so those who ship international packages have decided lower costs outweigh speed likewise lower weights per shipment signals they are shipping only what they must when they must fedex is responding with an employee buyout program and constrained hiring the company is overstaffed for its present requirements this might also reflect increased automation of work once done by humans in any case it won t help the employment stats in addition fedex is limiting discretionary spending i m not sure what that means every business always limits discretionary spending or it doesn t stay in business long if fedex is taking additional steps then whoever would have received that spending will also see lower revenues they might have to constrain hiring too obviously fedex is just one company although a large and critically positioned one but statements like this add up to recession if they grow more common and they are one reason fedex is in the vanguard is that it s uniquely exposed to world trade the growth of which is diminishing for multiple reasons part of it is technology the things we ship internationally are increasingly digital and they travel via wires and satellite links instead of ships and planes these sorts of goods aren t easily valued for inclusion in the trade stats energy is another factor between us shale production and renewable energy sources we don t import as much oil and gas from across the seas as we otherwise would that shows up in both trade and currency values the us dollar is stronger now in part because we send fewer dollars to opec note the massive and stealthy growth in lng liquified natural gas exports in the past few years think what this will look like in a few years with not one but four lng export terminals on the us coasts natural gas is also the basis for much of the chemical and fertilizer industry abundant us supplies and prices less than half the cost of russian gas in germany help many us industries compete those are just signs of normal progress and change the economy can adapt to them the greater threat is artificially constrained international trade which is what the trump administration s trade war is creating last year i explained how trade wars can spark recession and trade deficits are nothing to fear i won t repeat all that here but we have since seen several market swoons rallies as harsher trade restrictions looked more less likely whether you like it or not asset values depend on the relatively free flow of goods and services across international borders interfere with that and all kinds of assets become less valuable starting a trade war at the same time growth is slowing for other reasons is more than a little unwise agricultural tariffs have already ripped through us farm country to devastating effect leaving losses some farmers may never recover the president s tariff threats had other impact as well companies raced to import foreign supplied components and inventory before the tariffs took effect this jammed ports and highways last year not with new demand but future demand shifted forward in time this is important and i think we will see the impact soon if we are not already transport and logistics companies geared up for last year s surge expanding their facilities and hiring new workers importers built up inventory in an effort to avoid tariffs that were supposed to take effect in january the deadline was extended but the threat is still alive like what you re reading get this free newsletter in your inbox every saturday read our privacy policy here first name this is required email this is required subscribe for free recaptcha at some point all this has to stop carrying inventory is expensive and will eventually outweigh the benefit of avoiding tariffs then the boom will come to a screeching halt imports will fall as companies work down inventory all those jobs and construction projects will disappear that combined with the other cyclical factors and high debt loads everywhere could easily add up to a recession exactly when is hard to say recessions usually get pronounced in hindsight so there s some possibility we are in one right now but i still think we ll avoid it this year getting into this box took a long time and so will getting out of it regardless we ll have a recession at some point i think the next subprime crisis will be in corporate debt next week we ll look deeper into the timing question what the yield curve tells us and why the next decade will bring little or no economic growth i realize this is not a happy conclusion but i call them as i see them i ll leave you with one final but critically important thought prepare don t despair tough times are coming but we can handle them you have a chance to get ready i highly suggest you take it time flies monday is already april fool s day and the strategic investment conference is only a month and a half away i m really looking forward to this year s sic the lineup of speakers is truly phenomenal some of them confirmed they were coming at the last minute like my old friend kyle bass who enriches and energizes every conference he speaks at i can t wait to hear what he ll talk about on our china panel the sic is completely sold out at this point but you can still attend virtually like last year we re offering our virtual pass at a steep pre sic discount thanks to the live stream feature a huge hit with passholders in 2018 when we introduced it you will be able to watch most of the conference live as it happens you ll even be able to ask questions and vote on the best questions for the speakers and panelists to answer it s the next best thing to actually being there and after the sic is over you will receive video and audio recordings slide shows and transcripts to enjoy at your leisure on your smartphone tablet or computer again and again you ll find all the details on this page i hope you ll decide to join us at the sic via your virtual pass andy marshall who for the last 50 years has often been called the most important strategic thinker you ve never heard of quietly passed away last tuesday at age 97 starting at the rand think tank in 1949 he was persuaded to move from california by henry kissinger who wanted his intellect at the white house national security council in 1973 secretary of defense james schlesinger with whom he worked at rand brought him over to the defense department to set up the enigmatically titled office of net assessment it was basically a think tank designed to analyze long term threats and problems and help shape military strategy to deal with them he was reappointed by every president and defense secretary until his retirement in 2014 at the age of 94 in the 1970s andy famously contradicted the cia and the foreign policy establishment about the strength of russia s economy and predicted its collapse in the 1990s he quietly circulated his first memo saying china should become the main strategic focus of the us military like his russia analysis it was ignored at first called yoda within the military establishment andy s influence was enormous i first met him over 10 years ago as he hosted small gatherings of economists and strategists to talk about their views of the future i would find myself sitting at the table with names you would easily recognize but for some reason he kept asking me back he invited me to two of his famous week long sessions at the naval war college where he would mix an eclectic group of thinkers with high ranking military professionals to consider alternative futures he asked questions and then put us in a room for 12 hours a day plus long dinners afterward to discuss the opportunities and problems the scenarios might entail it was personally exhilarating and foundational for me at his retirement party a former vice president multiple defense secretaries abundant military brass and strategists gathered to honor this singular man s 40 years of continuous government service he spent 65 years focused on keeping our military prepared for the future i don t have enough room to properly pay tribute to one of the great futurists of our times andy brought the model of competitive thinking that he learned at the university of chicago to military strategy he basically invented the arena of inferential analysis you can read much better reviews of andy s career here by his biographer how is yoda and at the new york times and washington post his life was chronicled in his biography the last warrior andrew marshall and the shaping of modern american defense strategy like what you re reading get this free

apartment near the pentagon crammed full of books and journals to meet with other analysts andy was still mentally vigorous and primarily focused on china there in his room the net assessment of the potential problems with china were not sanguine i once asked andy why he kept inviting me back to his meetings and forums i truly had no idea every time i was in a room with him and the others he gathered i felt well out of my league he smiled and said because you don t think like other economists coming from andy that may be the finest and greatest compliment i have ever received andy marshall requiescat in pace starting sunday i will basically spend the night in each of the above cities before returning to puerto rico in cleveland we will check my eyes but i can tell you the

here s my top 10 items from around the internet over the last week or so as always we welcome your additions in the comments below or via email to bernard hickey interest co nz see all previous top 10s here my must reads are 8 and 9 on productivity seriously 1 our over vallued exchange rate still i m enjoying former reserve bank economist michael reddell s regular and detailed blogging over at croaking cassandra i ve got a feeling the reserve bank may not be enjoying it quite so much but his blog posts are certainly providing a whole new level of insight into how the bank and the government operates around economics one of his latest and there are many is on the new zealand dollar vs the australian dollar he has compiled a set of very long term charts that are fascinating note to self get out more the chart below is michael s his conclusion is sobering and nuanced after spending years reflecting on the issues i m convinced there is nothing much wrong with new zealand s economy that a real exchange rate averaging 20 30 per cent lower for a few decades could not resolve perhaps issues around size distance and agglomeration mean we will never again be the richest country in the world but we can do a great deal better than we have done in recent decades views differ on why the real exchange rate might have been on average so strong over the last few decades my story emphasises the high average real interest rates that have been needed to balance demand and supply keep inflation near target in new zealand relative to those abroad as just one example the yield on a 20 year new zealand government inflation indexed bond has been around 2 2 per cent this month the yield on 20 year us government inflation indexed bond has been around 0 7 per cent persistent differences in returns like that which don t appear to reflect differences in riskiness have really big and quite rational implications for the exchange rate but to be clear this is not a monetary policy story long term real interest rates reflect the pressures on real resources that result from government and private choices they are real phenomena not monetary ones 2 when less is more the new yorker takes a look at the success of patagonia the company that sells outdoor clothing and equipment its marketing and many of its practices are based on the idea that consumerism is not sustainable and we need to buy less not more yet it is growing sales at a double digit rate 3 ruth roger and me over the weekend i was on one of those political talk show panels tvnz s q a talking about the budget which is all good but i got a pleasant surprise when a feature of the show was an interview with andrew dean a new zealand academic who is currently a rhodes scholar and who has written a book about the experience of younger people now 30 years on from the ruthorogernomics era it was compelling viewing and the book is well worth a read i m part of the way through it now here s a taste of his thoughts courtesy of rob stock at fairfax dean is 26 and stressed by an economy that just does not add up for any but a tiny proportion of 20 somethings they have student loans to pay off houses are beyond their reach they face low wages high unemployment and a casualised labour market and they believe that when they get old there will be no such thing as nz super all the basic building blocks of a prosperous stable money life have been stripped from them by the political policies of the generation that was the last to benefit from free education cheap housing standard work contracts and the certainty of nz super but for all its social media savvy the 20 somethings are a generation that does not seem to have a voice 4 almost doubled jing daily has prepared a report on how much property chinese are buying globally and why according to the report chinese purchases of international real estate in the year to march 2014 equaled 22 billion up from 12 4 billion the previous year within the united states just under one in four dollars spent on international real estate is from a chinese person and the chinese are making waves in quality not just quantity the median home price for chinese buyers is 523 148 more than double the median home price across the united states as a whole will this surge in international buying continue all signs point to yes compared to prices in beijing and shanghai half a million dollars doesn t look that expensive to many of china s more affluent buyers particularly those interested in having their children educated abroad and diversifying their assets 5 an unconditional basic income in the wake of the skirmish over nz super and the problem opportunity of universality it s worth having a look at what scott santens writes about the ubi at medium by guaranteeing everyone has at the very least the minimum amount of voice with which to speak in the marketplace for basic goods and services we can make sure that the basics needs of life those specific and universally important to all goods and services like food and shelter are being created and distributed more efficiently it makes no sense to make sure 100 of the population gets exactly the same amount of bread some may want more than others and some may want less it also doesn t make sense to only make bread for 70 of the population thinking that is the true demand for bread when actually 80 of the population wants it but 10 have zero means to voice their demand in the market bread makers would happily sell more bread and bread eaters would happily buy more bread it s a win win to more accurately determine just the right amount and that s basic income it s a win win for the market and those who comprise the market it s a way to improve on capitalism and even democracy by making sure everyone has the minimum amount of voice 6 when the robots start fishing scott santens gets more room to air his views on the ubi here at the atlantic scott santens has been thinking a lot about fish lately specifically he s been reflecting on the aphorism if you give a man a fish he eats for a day if you teach a man to fish he eats for life what santens wants to know is this if you build a robot to fish do all men starve or do all men eat santens is 37 years old and he s a leader in the basic income movement a worldwide network of thousands of advocates 26 000 on reddit alone who believe that governments should provide every citizen with a monthly stipend big enough to cover life s basic necessities the idea of a basic income has been around for decades and it once drew support from leaders as different as martin luther king jr and richard nixon but rather than waiting for governments to act santens has started crowdfunding his own basic income of 1 000 per month he s nearly halfway to his his goal santens for his part believes that job growth is no longer keeping pace with automation and he sees a government provided income as a viable remedy it s not just a matter of needing basic income in the future we need it now says santens who lives in new orleans people don t see it but we are already seeing the effects all around us in the jobs and pay we take the hours we accept the extremes inequality is reaching and in the loss of consumer spending power 7 there s too much debt so says goldman sachs it would know in this piece in the telegraph goldman sachs worries about how ageing populations will ever repay the stuff it worries too much it needs to concentrate on selling and and buying more of the debt then waiting for the inevitable bailout and money printing followed by debt cancellation to solve the problem there are fees to be made get on with it anyway here s goldman wringing its hands it s well worth a read andrew wilson head of europe middle east and africa emea said growing debt piles around the world posed one of the biggest threats to the global economy there is too much debt and this represents a risk to economies consequently there is a clear need to generate growth to work that debt off but as demographics change new ways of thinking at a policy level are required to do this he said 8 but where s the productivity growth i m very interested in the second machine age argument that says a wave of computing power is about to break over the services sector of the economy to drive enormous productivity growth and wealth although the jury is still out on jobs and wages however this big ft piece on the lack of productivity growth in recent years suggest that thesis isn t working out or at least isn t being measured in the gdp figures or is about to happen a great read new data from the conference board think tank show that average labour productivity growth in mature economies slowed to 0 6 per cent in 2014 from 0 8 per cent in 2013 as a result of ebbing performances in the us japan and europe productivity which tracks how efficiently inputs such as labour and capital are used tends to evolve over long periods but the conference board readings confirm a longer term trend of sagging growth that is setting off alarm bells around the world marco annunziata the chief economist at general electric worries there is a structural problem in europe due to a lack of risk taking low r d spending and inflexible labour markets in the us the most efficient of the major economies productivity growth began to ebb in 2005 according to mr fernald this was a result of the lapsing of temporary growth dividends from the 1990s it revolution this raises the possibility that the recent dreary productivity growth in the us is actually a return to an older and weaker trend even in emerging economies where efficiency is catching up the rate of growth has slowed 9 where s the productivity growth redux paul krugman is also asking where the productivity growth went everyone knows that we live in an era of incredibly rapid technological change which is changing everything but what if what everyone knows is wrong and i m not being wildly contrarian here a growing number of economists looking at the data on productivity and incomes are wondering if the technological revolution has been greatly overhyped and some technologists share their concern we ve been here before the hitchhiker s guide was published during the era of the productivity paradox a two decade long period during which technology seemed to be advancing rapidly personal computing cellphones local area networks and the early stages of the internet yet economic growth was sluggish and incomes stagnant many hypotheses were advanced to explain that paradox with the most popular probably being that inventing a technology and learning to use it effectively aren t the same thing give it time said economic historians and computers will eventually deliver the goods and services this optimism seemed vindicated when productivity growth finally took off circa 1995 progress was back and so was america which seemed to be at the cutting edge of the revolution but a funny thing happened on the way to the techno revolution we did not it turned out get a sustained return to rapid economic progress instead it was more of a one time spurt which sputtered out around a decade ago since then we ve been living in an era of iphones and ipads and idontknows but even if you adjust for the effects of financial crisis growth and trends in income have reverted to the sluggishness that characterized the 1970s and 1980s 10 totally john oliver covering the end of the world as we know it not

overview the global capital markets are subdued despite several macro developments the us and china may announce as early as today when the two presidents will meet to ostensibly sign a trade deal while house of commons effort to block a no deal exit goes to the house of lords today india cut interest rates by 25 bp the second consecutive cut german factory orders slumped 4 2 in february the most in two years equities were mixed in asia and the dow jones stoxx 600 is snapping a four day advance us shares are trading softer and the s p 500 has a five day rally in tow reaching new six month highs yesterday bond yields are mostly softer though australia and new zealand were outliers in the asia pacific and italy is an exception in europe yesterday the 10 year bund yield rose above zero for the first time in a week but after the factory orders disappointed is back in negative territory the dollar is little changed though generally firmer late in the european morning most of the major currencies are 0 15 from yesterday s us close asia pacific china and the us may announce a meeting for xi and trump to meet and sign a new agreement in fact if an announcement is not made today the disappointment may way on the capital markets according to reports china will have until 2025 to meet the commitment to commodity purchases and allow us businesses to own wholly owned subsidiaries in china the us is pushing to front load commodity purchases with benchmark objectives for 90 and 180 days there are said to be some other non binding promises to be delivered by 2029 but there is no threat of retaliation if the goals are not met until the 2025 deadline for which the us retains the right for proportionate tariff action china has been reluctant to agree not to retaliate but seems to be taking it under advisement reports the pending agreement seems to do two things first get it done before the us sells fighter jets to taiwan second shape the timeframe to be most useful to the next president apparently on ideas that trump will be re elected there are three issues that we cite now that we will write about in more detail later first the commodity purchases sound good for us farmers and the energy producers however this is low value added sectors and seems to do little for us manufacturers china gets secures soy and energy inputs second the us is setting a dangerous precedent by seeking a sphere of influence in china it is not seeking a lifting of barriers to trade for everyone allowing the us to compete on a level playing field which had previously been its thrust just as the belt road initiative is in some ways reminiscent of earlier expansions by the european powers and the us the shift back to spheres of influence is a retreat from the open door a mainstay of us foreign economic policy since the start of the 20th century and globalized in the post wwii institutions like gatt wto world bank and imf third the us devalued the dollar by getting

overview the global capital markets are subdued despite several macro developments the us and china may announce as early as today when the two presidents will meet to ostensibly sign a trade deal while house of commons effort to block a no deal exit goes to the house of lords today india cut interest rates by 25 bp the second consecutive cut german factory orders slumped 4 2 in february the most in two years equities were mixed in asia and the dow jones stoxx 600 is snapping a four day advance us shares are trading softer and the s p 500 has a five day rally in tow reaching new six month highs yesterday bond yields are mostly softer though australia and new zealand were outliers in the asia pacific and italy is an exception in europe yesterday the 10 year bund yield rose above zero for the first time in a week but after the factory orders disappointed it is back in negative territory the dollar is little changed though generally firmer late in the european morning most of the major currencies are 0 15 from yesterday s us close asia pacific china and the us may announce a meeting for xi and trump to meet and sign a new agreement in fact if an announcement is not made today the disappointment may weigh on the capital markets according to reports china will have until 2025 to meet the commitment to commodity purchases and allow us businesses to own wholly owned subsidiaries in china the us is pushing to front load commodity purchases with benchmark objectives for 90 and 180 days there are said to be some other non binding promises to be delivered by 2029 but there is no threat of retaliation if the goals are not met until the 2025 deadline for which the us retains the right for proportionate tariff action china has been reluctant to agree not to retaliate but seems to be taking it under advisement the pending agreement seems to do two things first get it done before the us sells fighter jets to taiwan second shape the timeframe to be most useful to the next president apparently on ideas that trump will be re elected there are three issues that we cite now that we will write about in more detail later first the commodity purchases sound good for us farmers and the energy producers however this is a low value added sector and seems to do little for us manufacturers china secures soy and energy inputs second the us is setting a dangerous precedent by seeking a sphere of influence in china it is not seeking a lifting of barriers to trade for everyone allowing the us to compete on a level playing field which had previously been its thrust just as the belt road initiative is in some ways reminiscent of earlier expansions by the european powers and the us the shift back to spheres of influence is a retreat from the open door a mainstay of us foreign economic policy since the start of the 20th century and globalized in the post wwii institutions like gatt wto world bank and imf third the us devalued the dollar by getting europe germany and japan to revalue their currencies the 1960s through 1980s but america s fear of a devaluation of the yuan is so great that it does not seem to realize that yuan stability is a double edged sword it

regulatory framework key policies what are the principal governmental and regulatory policies that govern the banking sector because the deposits held by us banks are insured by the federal government many governmental and regulatory policies are aimed at protecting these deposits by requiring safe and sound banking practices this is accomplished through regulatory capital adequacy requirements and regulations relating to appropriate lending investment and other business practices in general a us banking organisation s obligations to its depositors takes precedence over its obligations to its shareholders following the global financial crisis of 2008 us bank regulatory policy has also been focused on reducing systemic risk the risk that the failure of one or more large financial institutions will jeopardise the stability of the financial system financial stability considerations have led to capital requirements that increase as a bank grows in size and complexity the pendulum now appears to be swinging in the opposite direction and us bank regulators are considering how to make bank regulation less burdensome without exposing the financial system to increased risk primary and secondary legislation summarise the primary statutes and regulations that govern the banking industry the principal statutes governing the us banking industry are the federal deposit insurance act fdia which provides for federal deposit insurance and vests the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic with regulatory authority over fdic insured banks the bank holding company act of 1956 as amended the bhc act which subjects companies that control banks called bank holding companies to supervision and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve the national bank act which provided for the establishment of national banks ie banks with charters issued by the federal government and vested the office of the comptroller of the currency occ with regulatory authority over them the federal reserve act which established the federal reserve system and contains restrictions applicable to banks such as section 23a of the federal reserve act which limits transactions between a bank and its affiliates and the home owners loan act hola which provided for the establishment of federal savings banks regulatory authorities which regulatory authorities are primarily responsible for overseeing banks there are three federal bank regulators as well as a multitude of state banking authorities the three federal bank regulators are the federal reserve system which has primary supervisory authority over bank holding companies savings and loan holding companies and state chartered banks that have elected to become members of the federal reserve system the fdic which in addition to administering the deposit insurance fund also has primary supervisory authority over state chartered banks that have opted not to become members of the federal reserve system commonly referred to as non member banks the fdic also has oversight authority at a secondary level over all other types of fdic insured banks and the office of the comptroller of the currency which has primary supervisory authority over national banks and federal savings banks in addition the national credit union administration has oversight over federal credit unions and insures deposits held by both federal and state chartered credit unions through the national credit union share insurance fund a federal fund backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the consumer financial protection bureau formed in 2011 has broad responsibilities to enforce federal consumer protection laws over both banks and non banks engaged in financial services activities government deposit insurance describe the extent to which deposits are insured by the government describe the extent to which the government has taken an ownership interest in the banking sector and intends to maintain increase or decrease that interest the fdic protects depositors against the loss of their insured deposits if an fdic insured institution fails fdic insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage is 250 000 per depositor as a temporary measure in response to the financial crisis from 31 december 2010 to 31 december 2012 all non interest bearing transaction accounts were fully insured regardless of the balance of the account at all fdic insured institutions this was an unprecedented action by the fdic and the unlimited insurance coverage has now expired a non interest bearing transaction account is essentially a checking account a deposit account where interest is neither accrued nor paid depositors are permitted to make an unlimited number of transfers and withdrawals and the bank does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal beginning during the global financial crisis in 2008 and continuing through 2009 financial institutions of all sizes sought to increase their capital levels for a variety of reasons including to help absorb current and future losses to ensure that capital ratios stayed above regulatory minimums and also to convey a sense of financial strength and confidence to investors customers counterparties and competitors capital raising in 2008 was significantly aided by the implementation of the capital purchase program cpp under the troubled asset relief program tarp in which financial institutions sold senior preferred shares and warrants exercisable for common stock to the treasury by 31 december 2008 the treasury had invested approximately 178 billion in 214 financial institutions through the cpp and by 31 march 2009 this amount had grown to nearly 199 billion in 532 financial institutions by year end 2009 the treasury had invested in nearly 700 banks with over 200 billion in tarp funds since that time as the us banking industry has returned to health virtually all banks have repaid their tarp funds transactions between affiliates which legal and regulatory limitations apply to transactions between a bank and its affiliates what constitutes an affiliate for this purpose briefly describe the range of permissible and prohibited activities for financial institutions and whether there have been any changes to how those activities are classified transactions between an fdic insured bank or thrift are subject to sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act the federal reserve s regulation w 12 cfr part 223 is the implementing regulation these restrictions effectively make it impracticable for the fdic insured institution to lend to its affiliates or purchase assets from them in addition all other transactions between the fdic insured institution and its affiliates must be at fair market value for this purpose an affiliate is any company that controls the bank or thrift that is under common control with the bank or thrift with a majority of interlocking directors with a bank or thrift or that is sponsored or advised by a bank or thrift control for this purpose is ownership of 25 per cent or more of any class of voting securities but also includes control in any other manner note that a controlling relationship can exist for the purposes of section 23a even at an ownership level of less than 25 per cent of voting securities companies that control a us bank or thrift are generally limited in the types of activities in which they can engage to financial services activities including securities underwriting insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking while there are certain exceptions to this rule over the past several years us regulators and congress have gradually eliminated or scaled back these exceptions regulatory challenges what are the principal regulatory challenges facing the banking industry much of the focus of the us banking industry has been to adjust to heightened supervision by the bank regulators in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that occurred in 2008 and 2009 pre crisis bank regulators focused on ensuring that individual banks had sufficient capital to avoid failure but did not consider systemic implications consequently the same capital requirements applied to both small and large banks post crisis the us bank regulators adopted a macroprudential perspective and expanded their focus to ensuring that the financial system avoids failure for this reason capital requirements now increase the larger and more complex that a bank grows in addition activities deemed overly risky such as proprietary trading are being limited or banned altogether the regulators have also instituted annual stress tests in which banks are required to demonstrate to their regulators that they would retain an adequate amount of capital even under extremely adverse hypothetical economic scenarios in addition a broad spectrum of legislators attributed part of the blame for the financial crisis to a lack of comprehensive and rigorous regulatory supervision and a breakdown in culture ethics and risk management on the part of the affected financial institutions a net effect was a wave of sweeping enforcement actions that continued through 2017 including enormous financial penalties primarily focused on the largest banks more broadly the policy debate whether to break up the largest banks in order to prevent another financial crisis continues to this day ironically at the same time the heavier compliance burden resulting from the increase in regulation has incentivised banks to expand their revenue base via acquisitions to bear the incremental costs the trump administration has pledged to roll back a significant portion of the regulations adopted post crisis the us treasury has issued policy papers detailing how the regulation should be reformed as trump appointees assume control of federal bank regulatory agencies they are expected to begin to implement this reform in congress there are several bills pending that would attempt to reduce the regulatory burden on banks and it appears likely that we will see some legislative action along these lines in 2018 consumer protection are banks subject to consumer protection rules us banks are subject to extensive consumer protection rules at both the federal and state level at the federal level they are primarily enforced by the cfpb the cfpb has rapidly become a powerful regulator and has been notably active both in issuing regulations and in bringing investigations and enforcement actions against a wide variety of financial companies including banks credit card companies credit reporting companies debt collection agencies mortgage brokers mortgage lenders mortgage insurers debt relief companies including law firms and student loan companies banks with assets of 10 billion or less are examined by their primary bank regulators but need to comply with cfpb rules banks with assets in excess of 10 billion are subject to examination by the cfpb although auto dealers are exempt by statute from cfpb regulation the cfpb has used its authority over banks engaged in indirect auto lending to address alleged discriminatory mark ups and similar dealer practices through enforcement activity and by imposing monitoring requirements on the banks conducting the indirect lending much of the cfpb s early rulemaking has focused on mortgage lending and servicing including an important rule issued in early 2013 requiring lenders to ensure that prospective buyers have the ability to repay their mortgages other areas of current cfpb focus include consumer protections for prepaid cards payday lending debt collection overdraft protection services and privacy notices virtually all consumer protection functions of the federal trade commission the department of housing and urban development the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators have been moved to the cfpb in connection with its formation accordingly the cfpb has the authority to enforce numerous ftc regulations as well as more than a dozen federal consumer protection statutes including the home owners protection act the fair debt collection practices act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act the truth in lending act and the privacy protections of gramm leach bliley states may also enact their own consumer protection law the cfpb s position is that federal consumer protection statutes set the floor and do not pre empt more rigorous state laws as we enter 2018 the cfpb is very much in a state of flux now under new leadership the agency appears to be in the midst of softening it approach to the industry as time progresses and the senior staff changes over we expect to see the cfpb continue to moderate its approach to supervision and enforcement future changes in what ways do you anticipate the legal and regulatory policy changing over the next few years in addition to the reform mandated by dodd frank the difficulties experienced by the us financial services industry during the financial crisis have resulted in more rigorous regulation that has cut across the industry post crisis the regulatory pendulum has swung sharply to more extensive and burdensome regulation as well as more frequent and severe enforcement actions increased capital requirements have been accompanied by a greater emphasis on higher quality forms of capital with a focus on common equity and the tier i common equity ratio it is the federal banking regulators position that common equity should constitute a majority of a banking firm s tier i capital because it is permanent deeply subordinated and does not oblige the issuer to make any payments to investors capital must absorb losses and permit the issuer to continue operating as a going concern as opposed to just serving as a buffer against losses in the event of a liquidation at the same time the regulators have been pressuring the banking industry to decrease its level of risk the combination of more extensive regulation higher capital requirements and lower risk has deeply impaired the profitability of the industry the trump administration has pledged to roll back a significant portion of the regulations adopted post crisis and the pendulum has begun to slowly swing in the other direction as 2018 progresses we expect a rollback of regulation to continue in two ways first the administration has almost completed its process of appointing a new slate of senior most bank regulators who will have a profound impact on the regulatory environment second in congress there are several bills pending that would further reduce the regulatory burden on banks and we expect to see legislative action this year in some form supervision extent of oversight how are banks supervised by their regulatory authorities how often do these examinations occur and how extensive are they banks are subject to extensive statutes and regulations in addition the applicable banking authorities conduct periodic on site examinations large banks have teams of regulators resident in their offices in order to facilitate continuous monitoring based on these examinations the authorities issue detailed confidential written reports articulating their concerns enforcement how do the regulatory authorities enforce banking laws and regulations federal bank regulators have a formidable array of enforcement mechanisms set out below is a brief overview of the types of enforcement actions generally used by the federal bank regulators in order of increasing severity including whether the actions are made public by the regulators in general enforcement actions can be divided into two categories informal and formal usually less severe in scope informal actions are generally not made public by the regulators and often remain undisclosed by the target while formal actions are in all but a few rare instances made public informal actions informal supervisory directives all banks maintain a close supervisory relationship with their primary regulators when that relationship is functioning at its best all material transactions and plans are shared and discussed with the bank s regulators and a good deal of informal supervisory direction is provided by the regulators to the bank all banks receive informal advice and direction from their regulators and often make significant adjustments to their operations and capital liquidity and controls as a result of that informal input supervisory criticisms within examination reports bank regulators deliver formal examination reports to their regulated institutions on a regular periodic basis these examination reports often contain express criticisms or concerns regarding a bank s operations or controls and directives from the regulators concerning the steps that need to be taken to correct such deficiencies or address such concerns examination materials are strictly confidential and may not be publicly disclosed by the institution supervisory letter a supervisory letter is an informal communication from a regulator to a bank either requesting information with respect to a targeted area or specific transaction or requesting that the bank take or refrain from taking certain actions supervisory letters are generally not publicly disclosed by the regulators and are used to call attention to specific areas of concern commitment letter a commitment letter is an informal written agreement between a bank and its regulator in which the bank commits to take certain corrective actions commitment letters often are entered into in connection with an approval request for a specific transaction or an expansion of powers commitment letters are generally not publicly disclosed by the regulators the regulators also sometimes seek board level commitments through the adoption by the board of formal resolutions on a given matter memorandum of understanding a memorandum of understanding is also considered an informal enforcement action and is typically executed by the full board of a banking organisation and the regulator memoranda of understanding are generally not publicly disclosed by the regulators formal actions formal written agreement a formal written agreement is an agreement typically signed by the board of directors of a bank and the regulator formal written agreements are generally publicly disclosed by the regulators in the absence of a compelling reason to maintain confidentiality cease and desist order a cease and desist order is imposed after the issuance of a notice of charges a hearing before an administrative law judge and a final decision by the regulator more often banks consent to a cease and desist order in order to expedite resolution by dispensing with the need for the notice and administrative hearing these are often referred to as consent orders temporary cease and desist orders can be issued on an interim basis pending completion of the steps necessary to issue a final cease and desist order the regulators are required by law to publicly disclose cease and desist orders troubled condition the federal bank regulators also have the ability to declare a bank or bank holding company to be in troubled condition which then subjects the bank or bank holding company to heightened scrutiny including a requirement that any addition or change of directors or senior executive officers be subject to prior regulatory approval a troubled bank or bank holding company also becomes subject to the fdic s golden parachute regulations which require prior regulatory approval in order to enter into an agreement to make or to actually make a broad range of payments to any officers directors employees or controlling shareholders that are contingent on the termination of that person s employment in addition federal bank regulators may impose civil money penalties in a number of circumstances including violations of law formal written agreements final orders or conditions imposed in writing unsafe or unsound banking practices or breaches of fiduciary duty what are the most common enforcement issues and how have they been addressed by the regulators and the banks the years following the financial crisis have witnessed some of the largest ever enforcement actions in the us remarkably in 2014 two of the world s biggest banks took the almost unprecedented step of pleading guilty to criminal violations in the us and agreed to pay staggering fines bnp paid 8 9 billion to resolve criminal and civil investigations into violations of us sanctions law and credit suisse paid 2 6 billion to resolve a criminal federal income tax investigation separately a number of large financial institutions have paid billions in fines penalties and disgorgement in connection with alleged attempted manipulation of foreign exchange benchmark rates governmental settlements have continued to arise out of the financial crisis notably in connection with mortgage backed securities with a number of financial institutions agreeing to pay tens of billions of dollars for regional and community banks the most common enforcement issue has been bank secrecy act bsa anti money laundering aml compliance following the terrorist attacks on 11 september 2001 enforcement actions requiring that banks strengthen their bsa and aml compliance programmes became particularly widespread then during the financial crisis bsa and aml concerns took a back seat to more fundamental concerns by the us bank regulators centring on capital adequacy asset quality managerial competence and risk management post crisis regulatory enforcement actions have focused again on bsa and aml enforcement actions often have a direct impact on a bank s ability to expand via acquisitions and often result in them being put into a penalty box while the enforcement action is pending the enforcement actions are typically very lengthy and it can take years to complete the work required to the satisfaction of the regulators during that time the bank is not permitted to make any acquisitions consumer compliance has also emerged as a common area of enforcement resolution government takeovers in what circumstances may banks be taken over by the government or regulatory authorities how frequent is this in practice how are the interests of the various stakeholders treated the fdic may acquire control of a bank if the bank becomes insolvent or is in danger of becoming so the primary regulator of the bank for example the occ in the case of national banks has the formal responsibility of closing the bank and appointing the fdic as receiver once appointed the fdic is charged with selling or liquidating the bank while at the same time minimising the cost of the failure to the deposit insurance fund depositors are paid by the fdic up to the maximum amount of deposit insurance coverage the fdic then uses the remaining proceeds of the receivership if any to repay creditors shareholders do not receive any payments from the fdic in return for their equity stock in the bank prior to the passage of the dodd frank act the fdic s resolution authority was limited to banks or thrifts whose deposits were insured by the fdic the fdic s resolution authority did not extend to the parent holding company or other non bank affiliates of an insured depository institution now the federal reserve and the fdic may recommend that based on an assessment of systemic risk the secretary of the treasury appoint the fdic as receiver for a financial company covered companies include domestic bank holding companies nonbank financial companies supervised by the federal reserve companies predominantly engaged in activities that the federal reserve determines are financial in nature or incidental thereto and any subsidiary of the foregoing the secretary can appoint the fdic as receiver if the secretary determines that the financial company is in default or in danger of default the company s failure and resolution through other means would have a serious adverse effect on the financial stability of the us no viable private sector alternative is available any effect on the claims or interests of creditors counterparties shareholders and other market participants is appropriate given the impact of a receivership on the financial stability of the us any liquidation would avoid or mitigate such effects and a federal regulatory agency has ordered the financial company to convert all of its convertible debt instruments that are subject to the regulatory order any financial company put into receivership must be liquidated no taxpayer funds may be used to prevent liquidation which will limit the alternatives to fdic receivership and may make it more challenging for a company to arrange private investment once it is within the zone of danger the fdic issued a final rule with respect to its orderly liquidation authority in july 2011 among other things the final rule provides that compensation paid to a senior executive or director deemed by the fdic as substantially responsible for a financial company s failure may be clawed back if the executive or director acted negligently bank failures what is the role of the bank s management and directors in the case of a bank failure must banks have a resolution plan or similar document in the event of a bank failure bank management and directors typically have very little involvement members of management may be employed by the acquirer of the failed bank but do not play a meaningful role in the seizure of the bank us banking regulations require that large banks and bank holding companies have a resolution plan in place are managers or directors personally liable in the case of a bank failure bank failures are often followed by lawsuits by the fdic against the bank s managers and directors alleging mismanagement and seeking money damages the fdic has filed a large number of these lawsuits following the wave of bank failures that occurred in 2008 and 2009 planning exercises describe any resolution planning or similar exercises that banks are required to conduct all bank holding companies and insured depository institutions with 50 billion or more in assets and non bank financial companies supervised by the federal reserve must submit periodically to the federal reserve and the fdic a living will for the company s rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure living wills are highly elaborate lengthy documents that contain a great amount of detail about a company s legal structure the legal regimes to which it is subject around the world how its business operations map to its legal entities internal and external contractual relationships and dependencies and a good deal more enhanced reporting is required including periodic reports about credit exposure to other significant financial institutions the federal reserve and the fdic may determine that a living will is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution of the company if they do they are empowered to jointly impose enhanced prudential standards or require divestitures development of these documents is an iterative process and institutions may be encouraged by the regulators to rearrange existing contractual and other arrangements that might complicate the separation of the institutions various business and legal entities in the event of financial distress in orders involving bank acquisitions by larger institutions the federal reserve has made it clear that the quality of an institution s living will and the resulting view of how difficult a company may be to resolve in the case of financial distress is a significant factor in assessing the potential impact on risks to the stability of the us financial system posed by the transaction under fdic living will guidance a covered institution must provide a fully developed discussion and analysis of a range of realistic resolution strategies each institution should include in the discussion and analysis at least one strategy that primarily involves the separation and sale of the covered institution s deposit franchise core business lines and or major assets to multiple acquirers as well as an alternative strategy involving the liquidation of the firm including a payout of insured deposits capital requirements capital adequacy describe the legal and regulatory capital adequacy requirements for banks must banks make contingent capital arrangements in july 2013 the us federal bank regulators adopted final capital regulations implementing the basel iii capital framework established by the basel committee on banking supervision the new capital regulations became effective on 1 january 2015 and will be fully phased in on 1 january 2019 today many us banking institutions publicly report their basel iii capital ratios on a fully phased in basis the regulations require that us banks and bank holding companies maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis the risk based ratio is determined by allocating assets and certain types of off balance sheet commitments into risk weighted categories with higher weighting assigned to categories with greater risk the risk based ratio represents total capital divided by total risk weighted assets the leverage ratio is tier 1 capital which includes common equity certain types of perpetual preferred and other instruments divided by total assets which are subject to adjustment but are not risk weighted in addition the regulations include a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital called tier 1 common to risk weighted assets and a tier 1 common capital conservation buffer of 2 5 per cent of risk weighted assets the regulations also include a minimum leverage ratio of 4 per cent the following are the minimum basel iii regulatory capital levels in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments during the transition period until 1 january 2019 basel iii regulatory capital levels 1 january 2015 per cent 1 january 2016 per cent 1 january 2017 per cent 1 january 2018 per cent 1 january 2019 per cent tier 1 common 4 5 5 125 5 75 6 375 7 tier 1 risk based

deemed well capitalised is critical to maintaining an institution s status and privileges as a financial holding company making capital distributions that deviate from the institution s capital plan engaging in interstate acquisitions and receiving approval from a federal bank regulator to engage in a merger or acquisition the well capitalised percentages discussed below should be considered a starting point the federal banking agencies have advised that institutions and their holding companies should maintain capital ratios well above the minimums for well capitalised status in addition an institution s or its holding company s primary regulator may require additional capital based on the institution s size complexity and risk profile weaker institutions are required to address their capital and operating deficiencies promptly or face regulatory driven corrective actions including a possible forced recapitalisation or merger under the fdia the us federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions the prompt corrective action regulations establish five categories based on a depository institution s capital position well capitalised institutions have a total risk based capital ratio of more than 10 per cent a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of more than 8 per cent a leverage ratio of more than 5 per cent a common equity tier 1 ratio of more than 6 5 per cent and may not be subject to an order written agreement or directive relating to capital adequately capitalised institutions have a total risk based capital ratio of more than 8 per cent a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of more than 6 per cent and a leverage ratio of more than 4 per cent and a common equity tier 1 ratio of more than 4 5 per cent undercapitalised institutions are those which fail to meet the requirements of an adequately capitalised institution significantly undercapitalised institutions are those with a total risk based capital ratio of less than 6 per cent a tier 1 risk based capital ratio of less than 4 per cent or a leverage ratio of less than 3 per cent or a common equity tier 1 ratio of less than 3 per cent and critically undercapitalised institutions are those with less than 2 per cent tangible equity to total asset ratio if an agency determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound activity it may impose more stringent treatment than would otherwise apply based upon the category of capitalisation into which the institution falls an institution may be deemed to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice if it has received a less than satisfactory rating for asset quality management earnings or liquidity in its most recent report on examination dodd frank mandates enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with 50 billion or more in assets that become stricter as companies grow in size and complexity and the federal supervisors basel iii implementing rules adopted in 2013 require enhanced regulatory capital requirements for banking organisations of all sizes undercapitalisation what happens in the event that a bank becomes undercapitalised once an institution becomes undercapitalised whether by failure to meet capital ratios or by regulatory determination a host of significant restrictions and regulations come into play the federal agencies are required to closely monitor all undercapitalised institutions and their compliance with fdicia capital restoration plans all undercapitalised institutions are required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal agencies pursuant to a deadline to be established by the agencies the capital restoration plan must specify the steps that the institution will take to become adequately capitalised the levels of capital to be obtained during each year that the plan is in effect how the institution will comply with the restrictions applicable to the institution and the types and levels of activities in which the institution will engage in addition before a plan can be accepted each company having control of the institution must guarantee that the institution will comply with the plan until said institution has been adequately capitalised on average during four consecutive quarters and provide appropriate assurances of performance control for this purpose is defined as it is under the bhc act the aggregate liability of controlling companies under such guarantees is limited to the lesser of 5 per cent of the depository institution s total assets at the time it becomes undercapitalised and the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time that the institution fails to comply with the plan the provision requiring a holding company to guarantee the performance of its subsidiary depository institutions can raise significant creditors rights issues that should be carefully examined before any such guarantee is granted in addition the asset growth of undercapitalised institutions is restricted an undercapitalised institution may not increase its quarterly average total assets unless its capital restoration plan has been accepted by the appropriate agency any increase is consistent with the plan and the institution s ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the institution to become adequately capitalised within a reasonable period likewise an undercapitalised institution may not acquire any interest in any company establish any additional branch office or engage in any new line of business unless its capital restoration plan has been accepted and the board of the fdic determines that the proposed action will further the purposes of fdia these requirements make significant expansion by undercapitalised institutions generally unfeasible significantly undercapitalised institutions once an institution becomes significantly undercapitalised or if it fails to take steps to become adequately capitalised it becomes potentially subject to a series of draconian measures within the discretion of the regulatory agencies in addition as described below companies controlling such institutions also become potentially subject to several significant restrictions the following may be imposed by statute or by appropriate agency action requiring the institution to recapitalise by selling enough shares including voting stock or obligations to adequately capitalise the institution and if grounds for appointment of a receiver or conservator exist requiring that the institution be sold or merged requiring any company having control of the institution to divest the institution if the appropriate agency determines that divestiture would improve the institution s financial condition and future prospects requiring the institution to comply with section 23a of the federal reserve act if the provision exempting transactions with certain affiliated institutions did not apply or otherwise restricting transactions with affiliates restricting interest rates paid on new deposits including renewals and rollovers substantially to the prevailing rates of interest on deposits of comparable amounts and maturities in the region where the institution is located restricting asset growth even more stringently than for undercapitalised institutions or requiring asset shrinkage requiring the institution to alter reduce or terminate any activity the agency determines poses excessive risk ordering a new election of the board dismissing any director or senior executive officer who held office for more than 180 days immediately before the institution became undercapitalised or requiring the institution to employ qualified senior executive officers who if the agency so specifies shall be subject to agency approval while directors and senior executive officers that have been dismissed have the right to petition the agency for reinstatement they bear the burden of proving that their continued employment would materially strengthen the institution prohibiting the acceptance of deposits including renewals and rollovers from deposit brokers prohibiting any bank holding company having control of the institution from making any capital distribution without prior approval of the federal reserve requiring the institution to divest or liquidate any subsidiary the agency determines to be in danger of becoming insolvent and a significant risk to the institution or likely to cause a significant dissipation of the institution s assets or earnings requiring any company having control of the institution to divest or liquidate any affiliate other than an insured depository institution the appropriate agency for such company determines to be in danger of becoming insolvent and a significant risk to the institution or likely to cause a significant dissipation of the institution s assets or earnings or requiring the institution to take any other action the agency determines to be more appropriate the fdia sets out a presumption that the following actions will be taken unless the agency determines such actions would not be appropriate requiring the sale of shares or obligations or requiring the institution to be sold or merged restrictions on affiliate transactions and restrictions on interest rates all significantly undercapitalised institutions and all undercapitalised institutions that fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan in a timely manner or that fail in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency are required to obtain prior agency approval before paying any bonus to any senior executive officer or providing compensation to any senior executive officer at a rate that exceeds the officer s rate of compensation excluding bonuses stock options and profit sharing during the 12 months prior to the month in which the institution became undercapitalised agency approval may not be granted if the institution has failed to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan critically undercapitalised institutions the fdic is required to act by regulation or order to restrict the activities of critically undercapitalised institutions at a minimum the fdic is required to prohibit critically undercapitalised institutions from doing any of the following without the fdic s prior written approval entering into any material transaction other than in the ordinary course of business extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction amending the institution s charter or by laws making any material change in accounting methods engaging in certain types of affiliate transactions paying excessive compensation or bonuses and paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution s weighted average cost of funds to a rate significantly exceeding the prevailing market rate on insured deposits the fdia calls for the appropriate federal agency within 90 days after an institution becomes critically undercapitalised to either appoint a receiver or with the concurrence of the fdic a conservator for the institution or take such other action as the agency determines with the concurrence of the fdic would be more appropriate after documenting why such action would be better insolvency what are the legal and regulatory processes in the event that a bank becomes insolvent when confronted with an insured depository institution on the brink of failure the fdic is required by law to guarantee insured deposits and dispose of the failed institution s assets in the least costly manner to the fdic s bank insurance fund with surplus funds after repaying the fdic if any flowing to uninsured depositors creditors and then shareholders of the failed institution this disposition process is referred to as a resolution the fdia expressly requires the affirmative documented determination by the fdic that its exercise of authority with respect to a resolution of a troubled institution is necessary to meet the fdic s insurance obligations on insured deposits and provides for a resolution that when measured in terms of the total amount of expenditures immediate or long term direct or contingent is the least costly to the of all possible methods the statute clarifies that the cost of any efforts at a resolution must be less than the value of insured deposits minus the present value of reasonably expected recoveries in a liquidation of the troubled bank this exacting least cost standard may only be waived if upon the written recommendation of and approval by two thirds of the members of the board of directors of the fdic and two thirds of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the president determines that the least cost approach would pose systemic risks ie have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability and the proposed resolution would mitigate these adverse effects fdic orchestrated dispositions of failed or failing federally insured depository institutions are most commonly structured as a purchase and assumption p a transaction whereby the fdic oversees the assumption of all insured deposits of the failed bank by one or more acquiring banks and the transfer of some or all assets of and the assumption of some or all other liabilities of the failing bank by the acquiring banks a number of variations of p a transactions exist and features of different variations may be combined in a particular case the two most prevalent variants are bridge bank arrangements and loss sharing agreements each of these two variants has proven particularly useful in large complex resolutions a p a transaction affords the opportunity for the acquiring bank to pay a premium for the going concern value of the failed bank thereby reducing the fdic s total cost of resolution and increasing the probability that the fdic may avoid a loss in guaranteeing insured deposits a p a transaction may also provide for assistance to the acquiring bank in capitalising or supporting the credit risk of the acquired assets and liabilities the terms of the transaction may be highly customised based on the intentions of the ultimate acquirer and may exclude certain assets or categories of assets that are carved out by the fdic into a segregated fund to be professionally managed and liquidated over time whether by the acquirer or by some other third party two less common structures are an open bank assistance transaction and a deposit payoff in an open bank assistance transaction the fdic provides ongoing support to the troubled institution to facilitate a turnaround plan as it works through its capital issues in order to provide open bank assistance the board of directors of the fdic the federal reserve and the secretary of the treasury must all determine that not to do so would cause systemic risks in a deposit payoff the fdic assumes and honours insured deposits and possibly uninsured deposits and liquidates the troubled institutions assets through receivership recent and future changes have capital adequacy guidelines changed or are they expected to change in the near future as noted in question 16 the us bank regulators adopted new basel iii capital guidelines in july 2013 that became effective in january 2015 in addition dodd frank requires the federal reserve to increase capital requirements the larger and more complex a banking organisation becomes ownership restrictions and implications controlling interest describe the legal and regulatory limitations regarding the types of entities and individuals that may own a controlling interest in a bank what constitutes control for this purpose both individuals and companies regardless of whether they are foreign or domestic may acquire controlling interests in us banks provided they meet the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements discussed in question 26 and obtain prior approval from the appropriate regulators as discussed in question 26 the need for prior approval can be triggered by an acquisition of as little as 10 per cent of the voting stock of a bank or a company that controls a bank or even by the acquisition of non voting equity securities foreign ownership are there any restrictions on foreign ownership of banks foreign acquirers of us banks are generally subject to the same limitations and processes as us acquirers the principal difference is that the us regulators will first ensure that the foreign acquirer is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision in its home country this is discussed in more detail in question 27 foreign acquirers should also be aware of filing requirements with the committee on foreign investment in the us cfius in february 2014 the federal reserve issued final regulations that substantially tightened the regulation of foreign banks operating in the us foreign banks with 50 billion or more in us assets excluding assets held in us branches and agencies must form a us intermediate holding company ihc to act as the parent company of substantially all of the foreign bank s us subsidiaries the ihc will be regulated by the federal reserve as if it were a domestic bank holding company and must comply with us regulatory capital requirements stress testing liquidity management requirements and a host of other regulatory requirements foreign banks were required to establish an ihc that is fully compliant with these regulations by 1 july 2016 implications and responsibilities what are the legal and regulatory implications for entities that control banks with certain exceptions companies but not individuals that acquire control of a us bank will be limited to engaging in financial services activities for example an automobile manufacturer is generally precluded from acquiring a us bank non financial companies are not however precluded by law from acquiring or establishing an fdic insured industrial bank a special type of bank although the ownership by non financial companies of industrial banks has generated significant controversy in recent years and there was a moratorium on the ability of non financial companies to acquire or establish industrial banks which was imposed by dodd frank in july 2010 and expired in july 2013 although the moratorium has expired no non financial company has successfully acquired or established an industrial bank since that time recently a few fintech companies have expressed interest in forming a bank or industrial bank and filed formal applications to do so what are the legal and regulatory duties and responsibilities of an entity or individual that controls a bank an investment that constitutes control under the bhc act by a company in a bank has several implications from a bank regulatory perspective the company would be deemed to be the parent bank holding company of the bank consequently the company would be subject to the federal reserve s source of strength doctrine which provides that a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks under this doctrine the federal reserve may require the company to provide additional capital to the bank in the event that the bank was under financial stress note that there is no cap on the amount of capital that the federal reserve can require that the company provide to the bank by its terms the source of strength doctrine only applies to companies and not to individuals that control banks because under the bhc act individuals cannot be deemed to be bank holding companies in addition a finding of control under the bhc act would mean that the company would control the bank for purposes of the prompt corrective action regulations issued by the federal bank regulators which are discussed in greater detail in question 18 under these regulations an fdic insured bank is required to file a capital restoration plan with its primary federal bank regulator within 45 days of becoming undercapitalised significantly undercapitalised or critically undercapitalised the regulations further require that the capital plan include a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank control for this purpose is identical to control under the bhc act the prompt corrective action regulations limit the aggregate liability under performance guarantees which are joint and several obligations for all companies that control a bank to the lesser of an amount equal to 5 per cent of the bank s total assets at the time that the bank was notified that it was undercapitalised or the amount necessary to restore the bank to adequately capitalised status ie a total risk based capital ratio of 8 per cent or greater a tier 1 capital ratio of 4 per cent or greater and a leverage ratio of 4 per cent or greater a finding of control would have other regulatory implications as well sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act would place restrictions on transactions between the company including its affiliates and the bank hence any loan asset transfer or other transactions between the company and the bank would be subject to a number of stringent limitations and an overall requirement that they be at arm s length moreover if the federal reserve were to commence an enforcement action against the bank its controlling shareholders may become parties to the proceeding depending on the particular facts and circumstances what are the implications for a controlling entity or individual in the event that a bank becomes insolvent in the event that a bank is declared insolvent the us bank regulators may assume control of the bank and ultimately offer it for sale to third parties if the regulators determine that the bank failed because of mismanagement by the parent company or controlling individual they typically pursue enforcement actions against members of management as well as lawsuits seeking reimbursement to the deposit insurance fund changes in control required approvals describe the regulatory approvals needed to acquire control of a bank how is control defined for this purpose the statutory authority for federal regulation of acquisitions of banks other insured depository institutions bank holding companies and other insured depository institution holding companies and their respective subsidiaries emanates primarily from the bhc act which regulates acquisitions of control of a bank or bank holding company by a company as well as the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries and the commencement or acquisition of companies engaged in non bank activities by a holding company or non bank subsidiary the bank merger act which regulates mergers between insured depository institutions and acquisitions of assets and assumptions of liabilities of one insured depository institution by another hola which regulates acquisitions of control of thrifts and thrift holding companies and the change in bank control act of 1978 the control act which governs all acquisitions of control of a bank thrift or holding company by a company other than those covered by the bhc act hola and the bank merger act as well as by individuals the control act provides that if a proposed acquisition is subject to the provisions of the bhc act hola or the bank merger act then the acquiring person need not comply with the control act frequently a particular bank acquisition involves the acquisition by one bank holding company of shares of another bank holding company followed by a merger between the two subsidiary banks such transactions are subject to prior regulatory approval under the bhc act on the one hand and the bank merger act on the other bhc act under the bhc act prior approval by the federal reserve is required for the acquisition by a company of control of a bank or of substantially all of the assets of a bank prior federal reserve approval also is required under the bhc act for an existing bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of a bank or bank holding company if it will own or control more than 5 per cent of the voting shares after such acquisition and merge with another bank holding company such approval is not required for the acquisition of additional shares in a bank or bank holding company by a company that already owns or controls a majority of the voting shares prior to such acquisition a company is deemed to control a bank or bank holding company under the bhc act if it has the power to vote 25 per cent or more of any class of voting securities of the bank or holding company it has the power to control in any manner the election of a majority of the board of the bank or holding company or the federal reserve determines after notice and an opportunity for hearing that the company has the power to directly or indirectly exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or holding company the bhc act contains a statutory presumption that a company that owns controls or has the power to vote less than 5 per cent of the voting securities of a bank or bank holding company does not have control for purposes of the bhc act the federal reserve s regulations provide that the term voting securities includes any securities giving the holder power to vote for directors or to direct the conduct of operations or other significant policies of the issuer preferred stock is deemed not to be a class of voting securities if it does not carry the right to vote for directors its voting rights are limited solely to the type customarily provided by statute with regard to matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the preferred stock and it represents an essentially passive investment or financing device in addition to acquisitions of voting securities federal reserve regulations identify a number of situations in which there is a rebuttable presumption that a company controls a bank or bank holding company for purposes of the bhc act this presumption will apply if a company enters into a contract with a bank or bank holding company pursuant to which the first company directs or exercises significant influence over the management of the bank a company and its management and principal shareholders own control or hold with the power to vote 25 per cent or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company and the first company itself owns controls or holds with the power to vote more than 5 per cent of any class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company or the two companies have one or more management officials in common the first company owns controls or holds with the power to vote more than 5 per cent of any class of voting securities of the other company and no other person controls as much as 5 per cent of any class of voting securities of the other company the federal reserve has also identified a number of circumstances that may indicate the existence of a control relationship under the bhc act such indicia of control include agreements that substantially limit the discretion of a bank holding company s management over major policies of the company including restrictions on entering into new banking activities without approval of another company or requirements for extensive consultation with the other company regarding financial matters agreements that restrict a bank holding company from selling a majority of the voting shares of its subsidiary banks agreements that give another company the ability to control the ultimate disposition of voting securities to a person of the other company s choice and to secure the economic benefits therefrom an investment of substantial size even if in non voting securities agreements that require that one holder s voting securities be redeemed at a premium upon transfer of shares held by another holder and agreements giving a company the ability to direct a bank holding company s use of the proceeds of the first company s investment the federal reserve has stated that provisions of the type described above may be acceptable if combined with other provisions that serve to preclude control of the acquiree by the acquiring company such mitigating provisions may include covenants that leave management free to conduct banking and permissible non banking activities a call right that permits the acquiree to repurchase the acquiring company s equity investment a provision granting the acquiree a right of first refusal before warrants options or other rights may be sold and requiring a public and dispersed distribution of these rights if the right of first refusal is not exercised agreements involving rights with respect to less than 25 per cent of the acquiree s voting shares and holding down the size of any non voting equity investment in the acquiree below the 25 per cent level with respect to the last point the federal reserve has generally taken the view except in certain circumstances that non voting equity investments by bank holding companies may not be equal to 25 per cent or more of a target s total equity in addition the federal reserve has viewed subordinated debt as equity for purposes of this limitation change in the bank control act the control act provides that a person seeking to effect an acquisition of control of a bank holding company or a federally insured depository institution must give prior written notice to the appropriate federal banking agency the agency then has a specified period to disapprove the acquisition if not disapproved within that period the acquisition may be consummated an acquisition may be made prior to expiry of the period if the agency issues written notice of its intent not to disapprove the acquisition the concept of control used in the control act differs somewhat from that used in the bhc act the control act defines control as the power directly or indirectly to direct the management or policies or to vote 25 per cent or more of any class of voting securities of an insured bank in addition federal reserve regulations provide that a person is rebuttably presumed to control a bank under the control act if the person owns controls or holds with the power to vote 25 per cent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution or owns controls or holds with power to vote 10 per cent or more of any class of voting securities of the institution and if the institution s shares are registered pursuant to section 12 of the exchange act or no other person would own a greater percentage of the institution s outstanding shares bank merger act the bank merger act provides that no insured bank or other insured depository institution may merge with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of another insured depository institution without the prior written approval of the responsible agency and prescribes certain procedures including procedures for obtaining shareholder approval and for appraisal of shares held by dissenting holders for such mergers where the acquiring or resulting bank is to be a national bank or a bank chartered in the district of columbia the occ is the responsible agency where the acquiring or resulting bank is to be a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system the federal reserve is the responsible agency where the acquiring or resulting bank will be a state chartered bank other than a savings bank that is not a member of the federal reserve system the fdic is the responsible agency where the acquiring or resulting institution is to be a thrift the occ is the responsible agency in addition a deposit transfer application to the occ may be required where the transferring or disappearing institution is a thrift hola hola governs acquisitions of control of insured federal or state thrifts including savings associations savings and loan associations building and loan associations and federal savings banks and holding companies of such thrifts thrift regulations provide that a company generally cannot acquire control of a thrift directly or indirectly unless it first receives written approval from the federal reserve the regulations create two thresholds for determining control conclusive control and control subject to rebuttal the regulations also establish presumptions of concerted action for purposes of determining the circumstances under which it might be appropriate to aggregate the holdings of different investors a company will be deemed to conclusively control a thrift if an acquirer directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies acquires more than 25 per cent of any class of voting stock acquires irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 per cent of any class of voting stock acquires any combination of voting stock and irrevocable proxies representing more than 25 per cent of any class of voting stock controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of the thrift or can exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the thrift subject to rebuttal an acquirer will be deemed to control a thrift if the acquirer directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies acquires more than 10 per cent of any class of voting stock and one or more additional control factors are present including being one of the two largest holders of any class of voting stock holding more than 25 per cent of total equity holding more than 35 per cent of combined debt securities and equity or being party to agreements that give an investor a material economic stake in a thrift or thrift holding company or that give an investor the power to influence a material aspect of management or policy acquires more than 25 per cent of any class of stock and one or more of the above control factors are present or holds any combination of voting stock and proxies representing more than 25 per cent of any class of voting stock that enables an acquirer to elect one third of the board of directors cause the shareholders of the thrift to approve its acquisition or reorganisation or exert a controlling influence on a material aspect of its business operations to satisfy the thrift regulations an investor should prior to an acquisition of equity securities debt securities or both of a thrift or thrift holding company that could subject the investor to a finding of control subject to rebuttal submit to and have approved by the federal reserve a rebuttal of control agreement rebuttals of control contain a series of passivity commitments foreign acquirers are the regulatory authorities receptive to foreign acquirers how is the regulatory process different for a foreign acquirer the receptivity of the us regulatory authorities to foreign acquirers of us banks depends in large part on whether the acquirer is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision by its home country supervisor as discussed below the filings are essentially the same for a foreign acquirer of a us bank a foreign acquirer however raises some different considerations also as noted in question 20 foreign acquirers need to be mindful of cfius filing requirements capital in considering applications by foreign banks to acquire us banks the federal reserve has looked to whether the capital levels of a foreign bank exceed the minimum levels that would be required under the basel capital accord both before and after the merger the federal reserve also looks to whether a foreign bank s capital levels are considered to be equivalent to the capital levels that would be required of a us banking organisation in doing so the federal reserve will typically consult a foreign bank s home country supervisor another important factor is that the us insured depository institutions controlled by the foreign bank both before and after the merger meet the requirements to be deemed well capitalised as discussed in question 22 in february 2014 the federal reserve issued regulations that substantially tightened the regulation of foreign banks operating in the us and required the formation of us intermediate holding companies if certain size thresholds are met requirement of comprehensive supervision under the bhc act the federal reserve is precluded from approving an application by a foreign bank to acquire a us bank unless the foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor in essence the federal reserve must determine that the bank is supervised or regulated in such a manner that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the bank including its relationships to any affiliate to assess the bank s overall financial condition and its compliance with laws and regulations if the federal reserve has previously determined that a particular home country supervisor practices comprehensive consolidated supervision the finding is relatively easy for the federal reserve to make in the context of subsequent acquisitions by other banks from the same home country conversely if the federal reserve has not previously made such a determination with respect to particular home country supervisor the determination process can take months and even years similarly the federal reserve must also determine that a foreign bank that is applying to acquire a us bank provide adequate assurances that it will make available such information on its operations and activities and those of its affiliates as the federal reserve deems appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with the bhc act to make this determination the federal reserve reviews the restrictions on disclosures in jurisdictions where the foreign bank has material operations and consults with the relevant non us governmental authorities concerning access to information the federal reserve also expects that the foreign bank commit to making available such information on its operations and those of its affiliates that the federal reserve deems necessary factors considered by authorities what factors are considered by the relevant regulatory authorities in an acquisition of control of a bank section 3 c of the bhc act sets out the criteria that the federal reserve must apply in acting upon bhc act applications the criteria are antitrust financial condition and future prospects management resources convenience and needs of the community and impact on systemic risk in every case the federal reserve must also take into consideration the effectiveness of the company or companies in combating money laundering activities including in overseas branches antitrust the bhc act provides that the federal reserve may not approve an acquisition that would result in a monopoly in or furtherance of a combination or conspiracy to monopolise or to attempt to monopolise the business of banking in any part of the us or might have the effect in any section of the country of substantially lessening competition unless the board finds that the anticompetitive effects of the transaction are clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the communities to be served during the federal reserve s review of an acquisition under the bhc act the antitrust division of the department of justice doj also has an opportunity to evaluate the competitive issues raised by the proposed transaction and may submit its comments to the federal reserve if the federal reserve approves the acquisition the bhc act provides that the transaction may not be consummated for 30 days or 15 days if the doj has not submitted adverse comments with respect to competitive factors during which time the doj may challenge the transaction in a federal district court evaluating the antitrust implications raised by in market bank acquisitions can be a complex task owing to the fact that the federal reserve and the doj apply different methodologies and focus on different competitive concerns most notable among those differences is the relevant product market defined by the two agencies the federal reserve continues to invoke the cluster of banking services market definition adopted by the us supreme court more than 50 years ago the federal reserve s primary tool for evaluating the antitrust implications raised by a bank merger is to measure the effect of the proposed merger on the concentration levels within locally limited geographic markets in contrast the doj evaluates disaggregated product markets including small business lending and middle market lending in addition to retail banking services at times these differences can lead to conflicting outcomes at the two agencies with respect to whether a particular transaction raises antitrust concerns and if so the level of divestiture required to resolve those concerns financial condition and future prospects the bhc act provides that in considering proposed acquisitions of bank shares or assets n every case the federal reserve board shall take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company or companies and the banks concerned the federal reserve s consideration of this factor generally centres round the adequacy of the resulting company s capital this analysis turns on the following three measures of capital adequacy whether the resulting company will satisfy the federal reserve s published risk based capital adequacy guidelines which establish minimum levels of capital that bank holding companies are expected to meet how the resulting company s capitalisation compares to the capitalisation of the two combining companies and how the resulting company s capitalisation compares to the capitalisation of its peers management resources the bhc act requires the federal reserve to take managerial resources into account in considering applications for acquisitions applications that have been denied on the grounds of inadequate managerial resources have generally involved attempted acquisitions of relatively small banks by persons with little or no experience in managing a banking business such managerial concerns are not limited to these circumstances however as part of the application process the federal reserve staff frequently seeks and obtains detailed information to document an acquirer s managerial resources such information often takes the form of strategic business plans for the combined company integration plans and staffing and cost savings projections in addition the federal regulators also scrutinise the larger bank holding companies management staffing planning and implementation of acquisitions as part of the examination process any adverse examination reports in this area can be expected to affect applicant during the application process convenience and needs of the community the federal reserve is required to take into consideration the convenience and needs of the community to be served in approving or rejecting an application under section 3 of the bhc act this consideration generally relates to the nature quality and availability of the applicant s actual or planned products and services including for example the hours and locations of operation interest rates on deposits and size of available loans as a practical matter the federal reserve has almost always determined that the general convenience and needs aspects of an application are consistent with approval of the application even if the applicant plans to offer no new services or products on the other hand the federal reserve has found increases in services greater loan limits increased hours and in particular the reopening or the assumption of the deposits of a closed institution to be positive factors weighing in favour of approval of an application because of more effective service to the community systemic risk under dodd frank the federal reserve is also required to consider the impact of a bank acquisition on systemic risk in assessing this factor the federal reserve looks at five factors the size of the combined company the availability of substitute providers for the critical services offered by the combined company the combined company s interconnectedness with the rest of the us financial system the degree to which the combined company contributes to the complexity of the us financial system and the extent of the combined company s cross border activities the community reinvestment act in considering the convenience and needs of the community the federal reserve is required under the community reinvestment act cra to consider an applicant s record of serving the credit needs of its entire community including low and moderate income neighbourhoods consistent with the safe and sound operation of the applicant the cra requires the federal banking regulators to encourage financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered and to that end the federal reserve is required to take an applicant s cra record into account under section 3 of the bhc act the cra provides a four tier system for rating an institution s record of meeting community credit needs outstanding satisfactory needs to improve and substantial non compliance each bank s primary regulator performs periodic examinations of and assigns a rating to the bank s cra performance an applicant s cra record may be the basis for the denial of an application although denials solely on cra grounds are rare the federal reserve takes into account both an institution s cra rating and cra evaluations in making its cra determination in connection with an application of the few cra based denials of applications most if not all have involved applicants having subsidiaries with low cra ratings control act criteria the appropriate agency may disapprove a proposed acquisition under the control act if the acquisition would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolise or to attempt to monopolise the business of banking in any part of the united states if the acquisition may have the effect in any section of the country of substantially lessening competition unless the responsible agency finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community to be served if the financial condition of any acquiring person is inadequate based upon the competence experience or integrity of any acquiring person or of any of the proposed management personnel if any acquiring person neglects fails or refuses to furnish the appropriate agency all the information required by it or if the acquisition would adversely affect the deposit insurance fund bank merger act criteria the bank merger act provides that the responsible agency may not approve any proposed merger that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolise or to attempt to monopolise the business of banking in any part of the united states or might have the effect in any section of the country of substantially lessening competition unless the responsible agency finds that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the convenience and needs of the community to be served in addition the responsible agency is required to take into consideration the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing and proposed institutions the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the impact of the merger on systemic risk the responsible agency must also take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger in combating money laundering activities including in overseas branches filing requirements describe the required filings for an acquisition of control of a bank in order to acquire a us bank an application must be filed under the appropriate statute set out in question 26 in general the filings require detailed information regarding the acquirer including all individuals who have the authority to participate in major policy making functions in addition detailed personal information of individuals with the most senior decision making authority must often be provided for the acquirer timeframe for approval what is the typical time frame for regulatory approval for both a domestic and a foreign acquirer an acquisition of a bank or bank holding company differs from most other types of acquisitions by virtue of the often elaborate and extended regulatory approval process in general when a bank holding company or a financial holding company acquires more than 5 per cent of the voting shares of another bank or bank holding company it must first receive federal reserve approval depending on the size and complexity of the proposal the approval process can be as short as 45 days or longer than six months update and trends update and trends updates and trends with the change in administration in november 2017 us banking regulation appears to be entering a more industry friendly period following the global financial crisis of 2008 to 2009 the regulatory environment for banks in the us became extremely harsh the regulatory environment again appears to be in a state of flux as the pendulum seems to be changing direction

process was validated by evaluating the complete mineral reserve process on the undepleted 2019 mineral resource model creating mining shapes as if no mining had occurred these generated shapes are referred to as 2019 reserve validation shapes the 2019 mineral resource model that was contained within the validation shapes that are broadly coincident with the 2018 actual stope and development ore positions were compared to the 2018 milled and mined results applicable validation shapes were determined by the use of cavity monitoring systems cms scans of the mined material for 2018 table 4 below

difference 2018 actuals 1 006 11 9 385 2019 reserve validation 801 15 4 397 20 3 the tonnage from the validation shapes is 20 less than actual mined while ounces produced are comparable the primary cause for this is the mining of material outside of the 2019 validation shapes that were originally part of the 2016 mineral reserves this additional material is not encompassed within the validation shapes and therefore would not be a part of the 2019 reserves if these areas were to be mined again the inclusion of uneconomic material waste within the mined stopes resulted in mining more tonnage

estimation of the model the classification has been adjusted to allow for the change in confidence as a result of the new information the estimation parameters have been adjusted to allow greater local accuracy of the grade estimates based on validation of the model estimates against production information and production volumes have been removed for all production prior to january 1 2019 this

at the valley of the kings was based on the initial understanding that the high grade gold was carried throughout the broad quartz stockwork running nominally east west consequently the 2014 report selected transverse longhole stoping as the mining method for the valley of the kings which provided for stopes up to 40 meters wide to be mined across the width of the quartz stockwork corridors the experience gained from over six quarters of mining at brucejack and the valley of the kings has led to a refined understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization the high grade gold mineralization is now understood to be carried in multiple zones of between 10 to 15 meters wide running nominally east west within the broader quartz stockwork at the valley of the kings based on improved understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization longitudinal longhole stoping mining along the direction of the corridors of high grade gold mineralization may be a better method of mining longitudinal longhole stoping will be tested this quarter and is expected to reduce the amount of internal waste within stopes potentially increasing the average stope grade and reducing the amount of underground development if successful an updated mineral reserve and life of mine plan will be prepared for yearend with longitudinal longhole stoping included in the mining method and incorporating the reserve expansion drilling from this year s drill program production and cash flows over the next five years estimated gold production of over 2 6 million ounces of gold will generate cash flows of 1 74 billion which are more than sufficient to pay down the scheduled debt maturities of approximately 580 million capital allocation strategy for 2019 is focused on

statements neither the tsx nor the nyse has approved or disapproved of the information contained herein scientific and technical information this news release uses the terms measured resources indicated resources together m i and inferred resources although these terms are recognized and required by canadian regulations under ni 43 101 the sec does not recognize such terms mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability the estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental permitting legal title taxation socio political marketing or other relevant issues there is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserves in addition inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies or economic studies except for a preliminary assessment as defined under ni 43 101 investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists or is economically or legally mineable cautionary note to united states investors technical disclosure contained in this news release has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of united states securities laws and uses terms that comply with reporting standards in canada with certain estimates prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects unless otherwise indicated all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates contained in this news release have been prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum classification system canadian standards including ni 43 101 differ significantly from the requirements of the sec under its industry guide 7 guide 7 and mineral reserve and resource information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by u s companies reporting pursuant to guide 7 in particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing the term resource does not equate to the term reserves under guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made and volumes that are not reserves should not be disclosed among other things all necessary permits would be required to be in hand or issuance imminent in order to classify mineralized material as reserves under guide 7 accordingly mineral reserves estimates included in this news release may not qualify as reserves under guide 7 guide 7 s current disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by guide 7 standards in documents filed with the sec united states investors should also understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimated inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineral resources measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resource reported in this aif exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however guide 7 normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures investors are specifically cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into guide 7 defined mineral reserves in addition the definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves under reporting standards in canada differ in certain respects from the standards of guide 7 accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with guide 7 non ifrs financial performance measures the company has included certain non ifrs measures in this news release refer to the company s md a for an explanation and discussion of non ifrs measures the company believes that these measures in addition to measures prepared in accordance with ifrs provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the

process was validated by evaluating the complete mineral reserve process on the undepleted 2019 mineral resource model creating mining shapes as if no mining had occurred these generated shapes are referred to as 2019 reserve validation shapes the 2019 mineral resource model that was contained within the validation shapes that are broadly coincident with the 2018 actual stope and development ore positions were compared to the 2018 milled and mined results applicable validation shapes were determined by the use of cavity monitoring systems cms scans of the mined material for 2018 table 4 below

difference 2018 actuals 1 006 11 9 385 2019 reserve validation 801 15 4 397 20 3 the tonnage from the validation shapes is 20 less than actual mined while ounces produced are comparable the primary cause for this is the mining of material outside of the 2019 validation shapes that were originally part of the 2016 mineral reserves this additional material is not encompassed within the validation shapes and therefore would not be a part of the 2019 reserves if these areas were to be mined again the inclusion of uneconomic material waste within the mined stopes resulted in mining more tonnage at a lower grade in 2018 than would have been mined based on the 2019 reserve validation shapes mining and processing brucejack is a high grade underground mining operation using the long hole stoping mining method and cemented paste backfill the valley of the kings the higher grade primary targeted deposit has been developed first the lower grade west zone will be developed in the second half of brucejack s 14 year mine life the mine is planned to increase the processing rate from 2 700 tonnes per day to 3 800 tonne per day by year end 2019 and mine a total of 15 8 million tonnes of ore for the 14 years at an average mill feed grade of 12 6 grams gold per tonne mineral processing at the current operation uses conventional gravity concentration and sulphide flotation producing gold silver

reserves definitions and guidelines prepared by the cim standing committee on reserve definitions and adopted by cim council 3 the quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred mineral resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource it is uncertain if further

january 1 2019 the 2019 mineral resource estimate for the valley of the kings zone differs from the 2016 mineral resource estimate in that there are significantly more drill holes used in the estimation of the model the classification has been adjusted to allow for the change in confidence as a result of the new information the estimation parameters have been adjusted to allow greater local accuracy of the grade estimates based on validation of the model estimates against production information and production volumes have been removed for all production prior to january 1 2019 this

at the valley of the kings was based on the initial understanding that the high grade gold was carried throughout the broad quartz stockwork running nominally east west consequently the 2014 report selected transverse longhole stoping as the mining method for the valley of the kings which provided for stopes up to 40 meters wide to be mined across the width of the quartz stockwork corridors the experience gained from over six quarters of mining at brucejack and the valley of the kings has led to a refined understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization the high grade gold mineralization is now understood to be carried in multiple zones of between 10 to 15 meters wide running nominally east west within the broader quartz stockwork at the valley of the kings based on improved understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization longitudinal longhole stoping mining along the direction of the corridors of high grade gold mineralization may be a better method of mining longitudinal longhole stoping will be tested this quarter and is expected to reduce the amount of internal waste within stopes potentially increasing the average stope grade and reducing the amount of underground development if successful an updated mineral reserve and life of mine plan will be prepared for yearend with longitudinal longhole stoping included in the mining method and incorporating the reserve expansion drilling from this year s drill program production and cash flows over the next five years estimated gold production of over 2 6 million ounces of gold will generate cash flows of 1 74 billion which are more than sufficient to pay down the scheduled debt maturities of approximately 580 million capital allocation strategy for 2019 is focused on

prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects unless otherwise indicated all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates contained in this news release have been prepared in accordance with ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum classification system canadian standards including ni 43 101 differ significantly from the requirements of the sec under its industry guide 7 guide 7 and mineral reserve and resource information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by u s companies reporting pursuant to guide 7 in particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing the term resource does not equate to the term reserves under guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made and volumes that are not reserves should not be disclosed among other things all necessary permits would be required to be in hand or issuance imminent in order to classify mineralized material as reserves under guide 7 accordingly mineral reserves estimates included in this news release may not qualify as reserves under guide 7 guide 7 s current disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by guide 7 standards in documents filed with the sec united states investors should also understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category under canadian rules estimated inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineral resources measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resource reported in this aif exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however guide 7 normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by guide 7 standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures investors are specifically cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into guide 7 defined mineral reserves in addition the definitions of proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves under reporting standards in canada differ in certain respects from the standards of guide 7 accordingly information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with guide 7 non ifrs financial performance measures the company has included certain non ifrs measures in this news release refer to the company s md a for an explanation and discussion of

2018 the 2019 mineral reserve process was validated by evaluating the complete mineral reserve process on the undepleted 2019 mineral resource model creating mining shapes as if no mining had occurred these generated shapes are referred to as 2019 reserve validation shapes the 2019 mineral resource model that was contained within the validation shapes that are broadly coincident with the 2018 actual stope and development ore positions were compared to the 2018 milled and mined results applicable validation shapes were determined by the use of cavity monitoring systems cms scans of the mined material for 2018 table 4 below summarizes the comparison table 4 validation of 2019 brucejack mine mineral reserve model vs 2018 actual production year tonnes 000 s gold grade g t contained

ounces produced are comparable the primary cause for this is the mining of material outside of the 2019 validation shapes that were originally part of the 2016 mineral reserves this additional material is not encompassed within the validation shapes and therefore would not be a part of the 2019 reserves if these areas were to be mined again the inclusion of uneconomic material waste within the mined stopes resulted in mining more tonnage at a lower grade in 2018 than would have been mined based on the 2019 reserve validation shapes mining and processing brucejack is a high grade underground mining operation using the long hole stoping mining method and cemented paste backfill the valley of the kings the higher grade primary targeted deposit has been developed first the lower grade west zone will be developed in the second half of brucejack s 14 year mine life the mine is planned to increase the processing rate from 2 700 tonnes per day to 3 800 tonne per day by year end 2019 and mine a total of 15 8 million tonnes of ore for the 14 years at an average mill feed grade of 12 6 grams gold per tonne mineral processing at the current operation uses conventional gravity concentration and sulphide flotation producing gold silver doré and gold silver flotation concentrate the mill will be upgraded to use the same process flowsheet at an increased mill feed rate of 3

4 tonnes grade and contained metal figures in totals may differ due to rounding 5 for comparative purposes only the brucejack mineral resource is reported at a gold equivalent value defined as aueq au ag 53 6 mineral resources exclude all mineral resource material mined prior to january 1 2019 the 2019 mineral resource estimate for the valley of the kings zone differs from the 2016 mineral resource estimate in that there are significantly more drill holes used in the estimation of the model the classification has been adjusted to allow for the change in confidence as a result of the new information the estimation parameters have been adjusted to allow greater local accuracy of the grade estimates based on validation of the model estimates against production information and production volumes have been removed for all production prior to january 1 2019 this has resulted in a reduction in the number of tonnes in the measured and indicated resource categories the 2019 measured and indicated resource for the valley of the kings zone is 13 7 million tonnes at 17 2 g t au compared to 16 4 million tonnes at 17 2 g t au in 2016 independent qualified persons the following qualified

geological understanding the plan for underground development and mining at the valley of the kings was based on the initial understanding that the high grade gold was carried throughout the broad quartz stockwork running nominally east west consequently the 2014 report selected transverse longhole stoping as the mining method for the valley of the kings which provided for stopes up to 40 meters wide to be mined across the width of the quartz stockwork corridors the experience gained from over six quarters of mining at brucejack and the valley of the kings has led to a refined understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization the high grade gold mineralization is now understood to be carried in multiple zones of between 10 to 15 meters wide running nominally east west within the broader quartz stockwork at the valley of the kings based on improved understanding of the geology and controls on the gold mineralization longitudinal longhole stoping mining along the direction of the corridors of high grade gold mineralization may be a better method of mining longitudinal longhole stoping will be tested this quarter and is expected to reduce the amount of internal waste within stopes potentially increasing the average stope grade and reducing the amount of underground development if successful an updated mineral reserve and life of mine plan will be prepared for yearend with longitudinal longhole stoping included in the mining method and incorporating the reserve expansion drilling from this year s drill program production and cash flows

by marshall auerback a market analyst and commentator produced by economy for all a project of the independent media institute the one silver lining in the nomination of political hack steve moore to the federal reserve is that it might spur a productive discussion on the benefits or lack of them of monetary policy as an instrument of economic growth this is principally because it s just one ingredient for what is necessary to instill economic growth and not a particularly good one at that a more direct approach is via appropriately targeted and sufficiently large fiscal actions in regard to monetary policy low interest rates kept in place for a long time can actually constrain economic growth unless they are coupled with sensible compensating fiscal policy due to the adverse income impact to savers emanating from a resultant lower income stream there is also a problem of political legitimacy when so little of the funding is explicitly approved by congress and is left instead to the discretion creation of the federal reserve which has historically tended to prioritize the narrow interests of finance over the rest of the economy and steve moore a leading advocate of cutting rates to promote additional economic growth even as he has historically championed spending cuts will simply perpetuate the unfortunately widely held notion of monetary policy as an effective cure all if his ideas gain policy traction within the powell led federal reserve in fact what is truly required is well formulated fiscal policy and less monetary policy activism precisely the opposite of today s prevailing trends solvency per se is not the issue the key here is how the money is spent lest fiscal policy become as diffuse in its effects as monetary policy has become as well as discredited politically because of perceived ineffectiveness when long standing structural issues such as inequality remain unaddressed moore a heritage foundation fellow and former wall street journal editorial board member has called for the federal reserve to cut rates in order to spur faltering economic growth here s the problem interest rates are a diffuse tool to manage economic growth for every distressed borrower who benefits from lower interest rate charges there is a saver adversely affected by the resultant loss of income additionally as bloomberg columnist noah smith argues cheap credit does a poor job of weeding out zombie companies that compete for scarce resources in fact a case can be made that low rates actually exacerbate prevailing deflationary trends low rates lower investment threshold returns and reduce the costs of holding inventory both of which can create oversupply as well as perpetuating asset bubbles a highly toxic combination that prevails in the united states indeed globally today even with lower unemployment the u s economy is largely characterized by middling growth spread too thin and too inequitably moore s policy prescriptions would likely make things worse low interest rate regimes have also helped to promote reckless financial engineering that has enabled corporate ceos and their trusty investment bankers to inflate profits and sustain company share prices as high as possible often at a cost of ignoring the strategic long term planning required to handle global competitive challenges from overseas companies that are slowly eating our proverbial lunch in essence therefore lax monetary policy has become the handmaiden of the speculation economy in general the fed s obsession with interest rates and bond yields along with the corresponding shape of the yield curve has obscured the manner in which such rates have provided a low cost laboratory for the creation of frankenstein like instruments of financial mass destruction furthermore as professors l randall wray and scott fullwiler have argued this was made even worse by the fed s cultivation of a belief that no matter what goes wrong the fed would never allow a too big to fail institution to suffer from excessively risky practice if anything this encouraged more risk taking the real paradox of using monetary policy in general is that it only works to the extent that it induces the private sector to spend more out of current income or encourages binging on private debt which low rates can facilitate if current income is adversely impacted by weak income flows however the interest rate is a highly flawed tool to solve the underlying problem especially if it means simplistically cutting rates further as moore advocates such an action can foment bubbles in a multitude of assets stocks and real estate being two of the most prominent examples the collapse of which ultimately creates greater deflation as well as exacerbating income inequality this is because asset bubbles create huge increases in income for top earners particularly in the finance sector due to the relentless expansion of credit brought about by prevailing low rates changes in technology and increasingly poor and outdated regulation in the context of a rapidly globalized financial system have accelerated a trend of asset growth and accumulation increasingly being funneled into fewer and fewer hands at the top when asset bubbles burst the economically distressed sell to those with higher prevailing cash balances setting the stage for further increases in inequality during the subsequent cycle as the post 2008 environment clearly has done as a new economics foundation report argues the process is self reinforcing because increasing wealth accrues both higher income returns and greater political power this means that those with the highest amount of wealth have the means to lobby governments to maintain status quo policy structures that perpetuate inequality cutting rates at this juncture simply perpetuates current bubble like conditions and therefore will make the ultimate outcome worse when the bubble inevitably bursts moore s policy prescription of cutting rates is therefore akin to giving a junkie another shot of heroin rather than dealing with the underlying addiction itself moreover the single minded focus on interest rate levels has per fullwiler and wray diverted the federal reserve s attention away from its responsibility to regulate and supervise the financial sector and its mandate to keep unemployment low its shift of priorities contributed to the creation of those conditions that led to crisis by contrast fiscal policy can also deal more effectively with the pathology of inequality via targeted spending which can impact distributional outcomes as it means directing funds toward those with the highest spending propensities as opposed to the 1 percent who generally save more of their income which means less bang for the fiscal buck contrary to prevailing neoliberal theology economic redistribution in such circumstances actually enhances an economy s growth potential rather than hindering it but we also want to avoid the fiscal zombie mindset as well the key is ensuring that deficits are used toward productive job creation not a perpetuation of crony capitalism all too often fiscal policy has been used in service of the latter this means it has become somewhat politically discredited as an instrument of policy by both parties in the first instance back in 2009 because the initial fiscal rescue package was insufficiently robust given the loss of almost 2 trillion in economic output in the united states alone then president obama s 700bn stimulus package while helpful mostly kept the recession from being far worse rather than enabling a significant economic recovery which later led to republican charges that the policy was ineffective by contrast on the monetary policy front financial institutions received commitments from the federal reserve that may have been as high as 29 trillion according to a report from the levy institute more recently the benefits of trump s highly touted tax reform have proven to be more apparent than real the whole premise behind the lower corporate tax rate was that it would result in literally trillions of dollars allegedly parked offshore being repatriated back to the united states resulting in a surge of job creation however as financial writer alex kimani has illustrated corporate america brought back just 664 9 billion of offshore profits or just 16 6 percent of the 4 trillion trump said they would return as a result of the tax overhaul in reality even kimani s analysis overstates the case there has been no massive dollar repatriation as such these dollars have always remained deposited in u s bank accounts but have simply been classified as offshore via accounting legerdemain in order to exploit lower corporate rates abroad as yves smith of naked capitalism points out apple managed to get a special deal with ireland that allowed it to report corporate profits nowhere for tax purposes kept the cash related to its irish sub in banks in the us and managed it out of an internal hedge fund in arizona given the prevailing deficit phobia that afflicts both political parties depending on which is in power this kind of gimmickry with minimal benefits being experienced by the bulk of the population has legitimized a political narrative against additional fiscal spending on the grounds that it didn t do what it promised to do and placed the united states closer to national bankruptcy while it is true that government that creates and issues its own currency can never run out of money a policy that ignores how funds are spent can easily produce undesirable outcomes such as inflation or rising inequality one of the great post keynesian economists of the 20th century hyman minsky insisted in the words of one of his students l randall wray that the impact of the budget on the economy depends on where spending and taxing is directed military spending and transfers for example are less productive and therefore more inflationary and yet this is precisely where much of trump s new spending is being directed even as vital social spending is being cut back unfortunately this has led opposition to trump to fall into the intellectual cul de sac of obsessing about debts and deficits rather than focusing on what we do with those deficits and as the paltry benefits of last year s tax package have largely dissipated to the extent that they created any economic benefit at all for the bulk of americans the focus has come back to the federal reserve just as steve moore s nomination has been announced a decade on from the collapse of the 2008 bubble the latest data on inflation shows an invidious combination consumer price index figures are now rising at their lowest level in almost two years but virtually all core inflation reports rana foroohar from the financial times was in rent or the owner s equivalent of rent up 0 3 per cent core goods inflation meanwhile was down 0 2 per cent this means higher house prices at a time when quality affordable housing is still out of reach for the average american lowering interest rates as moore suggests will likely exacerbate the housing bubble and fuel additional stock market speculation without fundamentally doing much to promote further spending power on the part of the average american citizen meanwhile the relative absence of a proper role for fiscal policy means that the toxic prevailing macroeconomic imbalances such as ongoing huge levels of household indebtedness and wealth inequality will continue every tool and target deployed by the federal reserve has simply restored an unhealthy status quo ante in financial speculation while the comparative diminution of fiscal policy has left us with an inefficient economy that still leaves tens of millions of workers behind in terms of wage gains access to decent public infrastructure and denial of quality health care imagine if some of those trillions of government loan guarantees standing credit facilities and bailouts to various financial institutions had gone toward more productive uses how much better would the u s economy look today regrets aside it s becoming increasingly difficult to make the case that cutting interest rates alone is a panacea in fact in the current context it may well make things worse
the ranking member on the finance committee of parliament mr cassiel ato forson has charged president nana akufo addo to gag vice president dr mahamudu bawumia because the utterances of the former deputy governor of the bank of ghana cause the depreciation of the ghana cedi against other major currencies of trade especially the united states dollar in his view the remarks by dr bawumia at a town hall meeting on wednesday 4 april 2019 caused the cedi to further depreciate against the us dollar i will urge the president to restrain his vice president because anytime he speaks the currency moves the former deputy minister of finance stated at the opposition national democratic congress public lecture on ghana s economy in accra on thursday 4 april 2019 you heard him talk about the likes of the judiciary and the court systems what has that got to do with the economic management team he had nothing to say he was just playing with numbers and again you know him and his credentials of lying with numbers you could see lies he added on wednesday however bloomberg s figures showed that the ghana cedi was ghs5 30 to 1 as of 4 p m on thursday 4 april 2019 bloomberg s figures showed that the ghana cedi was ghs 5 22 to 1 as shown in the graph below dr bawumia had said that it is warped reasoning on the part of the ndc to say that the fact that there has been a fall in the value of the cedi necessarily means ghana s economic fundamentals are weak dr bawumia said the cedi fall was largely due to external factors rather than weak fundamentals of the economy unlike in his opinion it pertained in 2014 when he dr bawumia famously said if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you according to dr bawumia factors such as the inflation rate the balance of trade the fiscal balance money supply are what we refer to as the fundamentals but speculation and expectations about these fundamentals external shocks such as oil price increases can also have powerful short term effects on the exchange rate when we see pressures on the exchange rate first we need to determine where these pressures are coming from or whether the pressures are transitory or permanent and as every astute central banker knows even with strong economic fundamentals speculation expectation and investor sentiment can exert pressures on the exchange rate ladies and gentlemen you will recall that i stated in 2014 that if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you that was true then and it s true now it is 100 per cent correct but it is warped logic to jump from that to a conclusion that if there is depreciation in your currency then the fundamentals must be weak do you understand the logic if the fundamentals are weak the exchange rate will expose you but if the exchange rate moves you cannot jump to that conclusion that the fundamentals are weak that defies logic dr bawumia said adding there could be external factors causing the exchange rate depreciation for example dr bawumia said if i tell you that if your leg is broken you are going to be unable to walk then i m somewhere and somebody comes to tell me this person is unable to walk can i just conclude that the leg must be broken there can be other reasons why you are unable to walk but the ndc logic will insist in the face of contrary evidence that since you cannot walk it must mean that your leg has broken in 2014 the economic fundamentals had weakened significantly and therefore the depreciation was easily explained it was not caused by dwarfs or high rise buildings as we were told the exchange rate for 2014 had exposed the weak economic fundamentals if you look on the screen it gives you the fundamentals as we had it in 2014 and 2018 every single one of them real gdp growth inflation the fiscal balance the wage bill wage bill to gdp gross debt interest rate current account all the fundamentals you ll see that we were in a much weaker position in 2014 compared to 2018 so ladies and gentlemen how have the cedi performed recently at the end of december 2017 the cedi had cumulatively depreciated by 4 9 per cent compared to 9 6 per cent in 2016 and this was the cedi s best performance since 2011 and at the end of 2017 we had the best performance of the cedi till 2011 the cedi however depreciated by 8 4 per cent in 2018 largely on account of the emerging market pressure and us interest rate increase the data on the annual rate of depreciation of the cedi in recent years show that the worst performance of the cedi so far under the npp government the 8 4 per cent depreciation that we saw since 2018 that worst performance is better than the best performance under the previous government between 2012 and 2016 so our worst is better than your best and when you say this this one is more like boot for chalewote ladies and gentlemen the start of 2019 has been characterised by another sudden sharp depreciation of the cedi which has largely been reversed within a week the cedi went up close to ghs5 9 to the dollar and then it retreated back to ghs5 07 and even was threatening to go below ghs5 but this is really an unprecedented development that you don t normally see such a retreat when the exchange rate depreciates and you ll see that in this period when there was a reversal in the cedi depreciation the bank of ghana had not intervened in the market dr bawumia said
general news of thursday 4 april 2019 source classfmonline com former president john dramani mahama has said the government can do all the propaganda it can with the economy but the reality will

similar event by the economic management team led by vice president dr mahamudu bawumia mr mahama said you can do all the lies and propaganda with the economy you like the reality of the people s

cedi which has largely been reversed within a week the cedi went up close to ghs5 9 to the dollar and then it retreated back to ghs5 07 and even was threatening to go below ghs5 but this is really an unprecedented development that you don t normally see such a retreat when the exchange rate depreciates and you ll see that in this period when there was a reversal in the cedi depreciation the bank of ghana had not intervened in the market dr bawumia said
well who would have thought that barely more than three months ago when the markets seemed to be falling apart that we would then go on to see the best first quarter start to any year for the s p 500 since 1998 oil prices up 32 per cent while posting its best start to any year since 2002 the chinese stock market at a 10 month high and a renewed surge in corporate bond issuance after the freeze we saw in november and december of last year all this attests to two things just how fast things change today in the global financial market and just how powerful the central banks are to this day this rally in risk assets can easily be traced to the early moves by the chinese central bank to aggressively ease monetary policy along with some fresh fiscal stimulus and don t forget about the dovish tilt by the federal reserve to the point that two pledged rate hikes at the final rate setting meeting of 2018 have been obliterated while the money markets are now beginning to price in a rate cut by the end of this year and it s not just the fed because every central bank on the planet has turned from hawk to dove from the european central bank to the bank of japan to australia new zealand and of course canada what this has done is create the conditions for flattening yield curves and lower interest rates everywhere this in turn has spelled a dramatic improvement in liquidity conditions which is why the financial markets broadly speaking are taking on more risk even with the global economy back on its heels we did see some moderately better chinese manufacturing data but the japanese european and u s economies remain very subdued to a large extent this is what the bond markets have been responding to with this latest dive in yields downward revisions to global growth and inflationary pressures that are subsiding everywhere curiously even with the price of oil back above 60 a barrel so while some pundits talk about this divergence between the stock market and government bond market it s really that both universes are reacting to a different set of circumstances stocks are reacting to dovish central banks and the fed s pivot is especially positive for the emerging markets since this has meant a capping out of the u s dollar rally which is another sign of improved global liquidity bonds are responding to sluggish economic growth and inflationary pressures which are now fading globally if there is going to be a situation where stocks and bonds end up converging it will be when the question over whether the first quarter soft patch in the u s economy and corporate earnings was just a brief affair owing to bad winter weather and the government shutdown or something longer lasting and more nefarious by late may or early june when we start getting the second quarter data flow we ll get a better handle on this my early read from the leading indicators tells me that insofar as any of this recent rally has been predicated on the view that the u s or global economy is set for any durable reacceleration we could be in for a bit of a letdown in the months ahead i get asked frequently as to whether my macro views have changed and the answer is no if anything the vast majority of the incoming data at home and abroad and the cascading downward growth forecasts from the likes of the world bank oecd and imf dovetail with my forecast that even if we avert an outright recession risks to the economic outlook are still squarely to the downside financial markets spent much of last year especially in the fourth quarter meltdown focusing on the disease which was the shift from synchronized world growth to synchronized world slowdown now they have turned their focus this year towards the cure whether that be actual policy stimulus in china or anticipation of fed induced interest rate cuts in the united states but it s important to stick to what we know instead of guess work we know that central banks will no longer be tightening all the leading inflation indicators at my disposal have peaked and rolled over for the cycle and as such interest rates will likely continue to be benign one of the biggest developments this year has been that we are back to over 10 trillion yes that is with a t of global bonds trading at a negative yield that volume of negative yielding bonds just six months ago was sitting closer to 7 trillion so this is a huge 30 per cent increase so safe income is once again increasingly in short supply and this scarcity value means that the asset mix and portfolio construction should be aimed at deriving a reliable cash flow in turn this means a barbell of non cyclical dividend paying stocks and high quality long duration bonds will make perfect sense even if the economy underperforms expectations through the spring which i see as a likely scenario david rosenberg is chief economist with gluskin sheff associates inc and author of the daily economic newsletter breakfast with dave

where the interest rate for short term bonds is higher than in the case of long term bonds last week the yields of three month and one year u s bonds turned out to be higher than the 10 year yield such a phenomenon is usually treated as a signal of an impending recession as in the case of the trade war the media needed a specific event to inform people that a recession is on the horizon when the yield curve started to reverse at a rapid pace the markets suddenly became paralyzed by the fear of an upcoming recession meanwhile from an investor s perspective such information is belated and of less value therefore we will take two steps forward again we will check whether the economic data also indicates a slowdown and we will consider whether a recession must mean there will be a bear market appearance on the trading floor ultimately during these times central banks are trying to keep the market from panicking treasury yield curve let s begin with the u s bond market as a small reminder most of the time bond yields are higher the longer their maturity ultimately lending money for a longer period of time bears higher risk however this does not change the fact that sometimes the demand for long term 10 or 30 year u s bonds is so high that their yields drop and are lower than in the case of short term bonds such a phenomenon generally means increasing fear among investors as a result there is a reversal of the yield curve which can be seen on the left in the graph below the light gray color shows the yield curve from two years ago the dark gray one is from the last year and the blue one is the current situation as you can see the latter no longer shows the growing trend like the other two but slowly begins to turn source gurufocus in turn on the right side of the graphic is a chart showing the difference between the interest rates of one year and 10 year u s bonds when the spread falls to zero as it is now it indicates an upcoming recession this indicator has worked well for the last seven recessions anyway the details from the bond market do not have to immediately convince anyone that a recession is on its way and you must run to the safest assets furthermore many analysts responsible for maintaining good moods have already said that this time is different and one should not worry about the yield curve that means it s worth looking at other important indicators global weekly leading index observation of the gdp of various countries allows us to state that we are dealing with recession however there is a so called leading indicator that monitors changes in many macroeconomic data including gdp sales and employment when its value in annual terms begins to drop it should be treated as a significant warning not every descent below zero means a recession but in the current situation a glance at the graph tells us a lot the global weekly index is today almost 3 lower than last year source advisor perspectives what will happen to the index in the coming months nobody will answer this question but we can look for clues analyzing the situation in different regions of the world asia let s begin with a country that for the last several decades has had a huge impact on global economic growth a lot depends on china while the local industry shows that the country experiences lower and lower demand for their products the pmi index looks as bad as it was at the bottom of the recession in 2009 source macro ops official figures for china still show economic growth at 6 while statements suggesting it is 0 or 1 are immediately censored the exports of south korea also look dramatic as we have just mentioned this is an indicator that should not be disregarded because it often works as a reflection of global economic conditions and future profits of companies currently south korean exports fall every month in february we saw a decrease of 11 1 year over year europe manufacturing pmi in the euro area speaks for itself source trading economics as a reminder above 50 indicates growth and below 50 indicates the economic sector s contraction in nominal terms without inflation now european industry is below the key level in addition the services pmi looks better and amounts to over 50 on the other hand it is an indicator that reacts with a slight delay to the manufacturing pmi and generally behaves more gently i e it does not adopt such extreme values as manufacturing pmi there is nothing to be excited by in terms of the data from italy which has been in an economic downturn for a long time the real problem to worry about though is the signals from germany in this case we can already talk about entering a recession and yet it is probably the most important economy on the continent germany among others suffers due to the deteriorating situation in the automotive sector which is usually one of the first to be affected by weakening consumption demand in many euro area countries gdp growth is below 1 per annum while the unemployment rate is low compared to the historical data this situation creates pressure on employers to raise wages this in turn increases the cost of goods and services prices are rising and consumers can t afford to spend more because of their debts the scale of danger is also showing in the bond market the german 10 year bond yield has dropped below zero in other words people are looking for a safe haven for their funds and choose government bonds even if they guarantee loss the u s after the fed resigned from regular interest rate hikes in january there has been a slight easing in place again we have seen the stock market rally optimism has returned and donald trump could once again proclaim that the american economy looks great and would look even better if interest rate hikes had not happened before the problem is in the u s economy which shows signs of overheating the first example is labor costs which are measured by a special organization associated with small entrepreneurs so far every time that index reached around 8 10 points a recession hit the u s the next year at the latest source bloomberg also record low unemployment in the u s is slowly growing in effect the average unemployment rate for the last three months is higher than for the last six months over the last few decades every such type of event has preceded a recession as for gdp growth in the u s the first quarter of 2019 will still be positive it can however negatively surprise the market many large entities assess that gdp will be between 1 5 and 2 5 needless to say gdp far below forecasts will mean hundreds of news stories about the recession and further shocks to the market let s not forget about the fed statement from march the total exclusion of any rate hikes this year fairy tales about a rate hike next year and premature termination of the balance sheet reduction this means that the federal reserve is already preparing for the first hit of a recession after which tools of exceptionally loose monetary policy will be automatically applied canada canadian gdp is falling very quickly it has to be noted that in this country a key role is played by the real estate market the inflow of chinese capital and speculative activities have been raising housing prices to record levels as a result the value of real estate and activities related to this market e g construction insurance have started to have a huge impact on gdp at the same time flats and houses became too expensive for ordinary citizens which caused considerable dissatisfaction the protests over time have brought desired results vancouver and toronto have decided to introduce special property taxes for real estate purchased by foreigners in this way the market was cut off from the new capital and the bubble began to burst which now translates into worse macroeconomic data in order to make you aware of the scale of the bubble in canada we will make a small comparison perhaps some of you have heard about the incredibly high prices of real estate in san francisco where even high earners like programmers have a problem buying a flat now let s compare the increases in real estate price indexes in san francisco with several canadian cities since january 2002 this gives us a certain point of reference regarding how dramatic effects on the canadian economy may have created a bursting bubble in the real estate market another important point after world war ii it happened that the u s fell into a recession and canada was able to avoid it in turn when canada fell into a recession the u s always fell into it in summary the situations in europe canada and asia look very poor in case of the u s the worst is probably ahead of us does that mean a sharp drop in the stock market we will certainly be witnessing events similar to those from march 22 stocks down bond prices up it is much harder to predict the scale when central banks started purchasing shares and bonds 10 years ago the market did not know what the effects of these actions might be today thousands of investors believe that the appropriate scale of purchases has a chance to keep the assets at high levels this is one of the factors that supports optimism in the u s in this way the fed has led to an absurd situation in which market prices completely dispersed with expected profits of the companies this can be seen in the chart below where the s p 500 index is shown in green and the profits of the companies included in the index are denoted as a red line source zero hedge the last decade in japan could be a measure of what can happen to the stock market with a shrinking economy and central bank interventions purchases of the bank of japan have made the stocks grow despite the current dramatic conditions of its economy and today they are significantly above the peaks of 2007 source stock charts however until a recession is officially confirmed the central banks of u s and china have no pretext on which to introduce another qe and negative interest rates we have to wait for their reaction for now two opposing forces will act on the stock market on the one hand the fear of a recession and information about companies poor results will deter people from investing in shares on the other hand the hope of an imminent qe4 launch will cause some investors sitting on the sidelines to take advantage of the first strong rebound after the announcement of the printing donald trump has a strong motivation to keep high prices on the stock exchanges the better the situation the more americans will be in a good mood when approaching next year s elections summary with the current involvement of central banks it is extremely difficult to determine where the markets will be in the next three months however we are convinced that more bad data coming from the economy will increase volatility in the markets central banks will certainly try to save the situation however one can not rule out a scenario in which one of their interventions will be perceived by the market as a total loss of control what will happen then in a moderately pessimistic scenario the stock market will be massively shaken and capital will flow to bonds in an extremely pessimistic scenario very low probability capital will start to evacuate from both main markets which could be a threat to the further functioning of the financial system in our opinion the most likely scenario is a printing on two fronts on the one hand we mean keeping high prices in the stock market to avoid panic on the other hand the economic recession will lead to a strong rise in unemployment governments will be forced to spend more on benefits and some countries will introduce universal basic income in the context of the markets the result will be a repeat from the 1970s high inflation and increases in tangible asset prices extremely expensive shares in the u s in nominal terms will fall in the sideline trend or slightly increase but after taking inflation into account it will turn out that they were hopeless and only bonds performance would have been worse than them however before central banks officially face a recession it is worth it to hold your funds mainly in cash the best way to do that is in u s dollar and swiss franc i e safe haven currencies
figure 1 dollar strength or weakness mattered little until around 2001 the increasingly negative correlation between crop prices and the u s dollar reflects structural changes in global agricultural production and trade that have increased the influence of macroeconomic factors as production of corn and wheat in the black sea region has soared what happens in russia and the ukraine is now of paramount importance especially for wheat likewise corn and soy production has increased dramatically in argentina and brazil making what happens to south american currencies central to determining the prices of those two crops the fate of the russian ruble rub and the brazilian real brl are closely linked to the outcomes in key agricultural markets at the same time a greater diversity of crop growing regions might be mitigating the effects of weather events inclement crop weather in the us south america or the black sea could still send crop prices higher but such weather is less likely to occur in all three places at once the brazilian and russian economies are in turn heavily influenced by developments in the world s most rapidly growing major economy china while china s 1 3 billion consumers are the most important food market in the world variations in china s growth rate have little direct influence on the prices of agricultural goods if china grows at say 6 rather than 7 or 8 chinese consumers probably won t buy much less of corn soy and wheat but their demand will grow more slowly for oil and industrial metals like iron ore and copper energy and metals are key exports from many major agriculture exporting nations including australia brazil canada and russia china s demand for raw materials moves the values of their currency via the markets for energy and metals this in turn changes the relative costs of production for farmers in south america the black sea region and elsewhere versus u s farmers who transact entirely in usd the rise of the black sea and south america over the past three decades u s wheat production has fallen from 8 12 of the world total to between 6 8 meanwhile black sea wheat production has risen from 8 12 of global production to around 13 15 figure 2 the post soviet revolution in black sea agricultural productivity has transformed the region to the world s leading wheat exporter selling the equivalent of 7 8 of global production to the rest of the world each year meanwhile u s exports of wheat used to be 4 5 of global production and now are around 3 of world output figure 3 figure 2 the black sea region has replaced the us as the top wheat exporter figure 3 black sea wheat exports dwarf us exports will sino u s trade war impact grain meat markets factors that could undercut farmland values the us remains the dominant corn producer but u s production has declined as a percentage of the world total until 2010 u s corn production ranged from 38 42 of the world total but has since fallen to around 33 34 over the same period south american production rose from 7 10 of world total to around 11 13 while black sea corn production increased from 1 3 of the world total to just below 5 figure 4 the impact on net exports of corn is much more dramatic since the us consumes most of its production it exports only the equivalent of 5 5 of total global production down from 8 during the late 1990s and early 2000s meanwhile south american net exports have risen from just 1 3 of global production to about 5 5 of world output just about the same as the us in the past decade black sea net exports of corn have increased from nothing to around 3 of world total output figure 5 figure 4 us remains dominant in corn but its production has fallen as of global total figure 5 south america has caught up to the us in corn exports and the black sea isn t far behind in the soybean market south america has increased its total production from 32 to 48 of world total while u s production has fallen from 47 of global total to just below 33 since the late 1990s figure 6 u s net exports of soybeans stagnated at around 15 of global production while south american exports now account for around 23 of world output up from around 6 7 20 years ago figure 7 figure 6 brazil and argentina are now the dominant soybean producers figure 7 us soybean exports have stagnated while south america s have quadrupled little wonder then that soybean and corn prices closely track the brlusd exchange rate figure 8 and 9 and that wheat prices move roughly in tandem with the rubusd rate figure 10 u s farmers have always been at the mercy of the usd to some extent but increasingly their prosperity is at the mercy of events in faraway places brazil s fiscal deficits and difficulties in passing pension reform could weaken brl and hurt u s growers of corn and especially soybeans meanwhile russia s exemplary fiscal health might turn out to be good news for u s farmers of wheat and maybe corn as well figure 8 the fate of the brazilian real exerts a strong influence on soybean prices figure 9 corn prices track the brazilian real figure 10 wheat exhibits a strong co movement with the russian ruble both brazil and russia however are at the mercy of china when measuring china s growth rate one could certainly look to the country s official gdp which is a very broad measure that includes china s increasingly diversified services economy a narrower measure called the li keqiang index which measures rail freight volumes electricity consumption and bank loans correlates exceptionally well with corn soy and wheat prices as well as with the prices of other commodities such as copper and oil moreover it also has strong correlations with the currencies of major agricultural exporters such as brl rub but also the australian and canadian dollars figure 11 figure 11 chinese growth influences metals and energy prices emerging market fx and crop prices the us china trade war has been bad news for american farmers depressing the price of soybeans in particular as china curtailed its imports of u s supplies that said the trade war has spurred china to dramatically ease monetary policy by reducing its reserve requirement ratio china has also recently enacted additional tax cuts the easing of china s monetary policy has steepened the country s yield curve and over the past dozen years china s yield curve has been an excellent predictor of accelerations and decelerations in both the li keqiang growth index as well as china s official gdp as such if china s growth does indeed respond to the monetary and fiscal stimulus this could boost not only china s economic growth but also energy and metals prices and through them the currencies of key agricultural exporting nations this could raise production costs in brazil russia and other emerging agriculture exporters and offer some relief to american farmers what is clear is that farmers around the world are the mercy of more than just weather and the u s dollar they are increasingly impacted by public policy decision made in far off places like brasilia moscow and beijing bottom line
here is why consensus has been so wrong on the u s dollar over the past year nearly every major bank and research outfit has had a bearish stance on the u s dollar the bearish thesis on the u s dollar typically comes in two forms first rising deficits and second the federal reserve s dovish pivot contrary to the consensus opinion i started to forecast back in april of 2018 that the u s dollar would rise and followed that call with a research note in august of 2018 titled is it too late to buy the dollar in that note i challenged the conventional wisdom and proved why the mainstream narrative on the u s dollar was wrong by the summer of 2018 using my leading indicators of global growth it was very clear that the global economy was in the middle of a fairly pronounced slowdown the main thesis of my bullish stance on the u s dollar stems from the fact that when global growth slows the u s dollar rises and when global growth accelerates the u s dollar falls in the aforementioned research note i concluded that the u s dollar would continue to rise despite conventional wisdom as long as the global economy continued to weaken based on the three short term factors described above and the probability of all three continuing i expect the dollar to move higher toward the level reached in january 2017 roughly 5 higher over the long term the outlook on the dollar is bullish relative to other major currencies with a far greater relative debt burden than the united states is it too late to buy the dollar august 2018 since that writing the main etf that tracks the u s dollar nysearca uup is up more than 3 in that note i suggested that i don t like to track uup or even the common dxy index as those baskets are comprised of mainly the euro and the yen between the euro yen and pound sterling over 80 of etf uup is covered when discussing the outlook for the u s dollar especially as it pertains to global growth i am much more concerned with a broad basket of currencies or more specifically how the u s dollar moves against emerging market currencies despite the increasing u s deficit discussions about mmt a radical dovish pivot from the fed and the announcement of the cessation of quantitative tightening all reasons cited for the demise of the u s dollar the greenback has increased against major currencies and against a broad basket of currencies why has the consensus been on the wrong side of this trade the focus as to the drivers of the u s dollar has been on the list above rather than the actual driver of the u s dollar which is the rate of change in growth globally typically when the growth rate of a country starts to decelerate their currency depreciates this is not the case with the u s dollar primarily due to the dynamics of being the world reserve currency i outlined this in detail in an article titled the counterintuitive nature of the u s dollar back in april of 2018 one year ago i summarized that when the world became convinced that the u s economy was slowing the dollar would rally why does this happen u s dollar index broad basket of currencies trade weighted source bloomberg as the u s economy starts to slow the u s clearly starts to import fewer goods from emerging market countries reliant on exports the same story can be applied to china if both china and the u s economy are slowing and the two largest economies are demanding fewer goods emerging market exporting countries see a decline in world trade emerging market currencies are heavily reliant on the flow of u s dollars to support their own local currencies which are not widely demanded thus running a trade surplus allows an emerging market country to use a growing pile of fx reserves to support their local currency if that flow of u s dollars starts to slow and the pile of fx reserves starts to dwindle it becomes more difficult to support the local currency devaluations ensue and the dollar rises due to the position as a world reserve currency while this is a simplified example we can see the correlation between periods of slowing global trade and a strengthening u s dollar given that the u s economy is the largest economy and the u s consumer is larger than the entire chinese economy when the u s starts to slow this has major ripple effects through the entire globe when china and the u s both decelerate in growth rate terms local emerging market exporting countries suffer my leading global inflationary impulse index shows how there has been a disinflationary impulse spreading through the global economy since the start of 2018 unsurprisingly this is when emerging stock markets peaked and the u s dollar started to rise rapidly global inflationary impulse year over year source epb macro research when the global inflationary impulse peaked at the end of 2017 the u s dollar started to bottom and then accelerate to the upside as illustrated in the chart below u s dollar index broad basket of currencies trade weighted source bloomberg the foreign exchange market is the most forward looking market even more so than my favorite market the u s treasury market when the dollar starts to rise rapidly that is an early indication that the u s economy may be slowing as shown above the u s dollar started to rapidly appreciate against global currencies starting in 2018 and by the fall it became obvious the u s economy was decelerating now the u s economic slowdown is agreed upon at this point the magnitude of the u s slowdown and the length at which it may persist is still debated but the signal from the u s dollar was spot on let s take a look at the export markets from export reliant emerging market countries to understand this dynamic south korea vietnam malaysia thailand indonesia singapore and taiwan are all countries that extremely reliant on exporting goods to the u s and china today malaysia actually printed an export figure that was far below what the street was expecting posting a decline in excess of 5 year over year malaysia exports year over year source bloomberg rather than single out any one country we need to look at these countries as an aggregate basket if we aggregate the nominal exports from the countries listed above rebase all the data to u s dollars and adjust for standard deviation we can see the year over year growth rate of exports from the important countries listed above emerging market export basket year over year source bloomberg we should be asking why are exports slowing so dramatically if the u s and china demand the most goods this should be telling this index perfectly picked up the global slowdown heading into 2015 2016 as well as the rebound in global growth this is just data we have seven export reliant countries that are showing a decline in export growth on an aggregate basis this is clearly coming from a decline in demand from the u s china and europe the vast majority of this trade occurs in u s dollars which makes it increasingly difficult for emerging market countries to support their local currency one cross rate i am watching closely in addition to my own custom baskets is the u s dollar vs south korean won or usdkrw this is graphed below usdkrw source bloomberg when thinking about the u s dollar we need to balance different time durations and different baskets most analysts quote the dxy index but as we can see this excludes very important information about the global and domestic economy over a long term horizon many years i am highly bullish on the u s dollar against all major currencies due to the relative indebtedness across economies for more on this you can check out the last note on the dollar by clicking here in the short term which for my analysis is 12 18 months i have a bullish bias on the u s dollar against major currencies and against em currencies i have had this view since april 2018 due to the dynamics of slowing global growth not factors that have a very little short term impact such as a fear of mmt in the short term there are hundreds of factors that can move the dollar around including but not limited to presidential tweets about the greenback or attacks on the fed a bearish view on the dollar was one of the most consensus views from the street a dovish fed ending qt and rising deficits have not been able to knock down the dollar in any meaningful way there was a brief adjustment in the greenback as the fed shifted from expecting three rate hikes in 2019 to maybe one rate cut as priced in by fed funds futures to get the dollar right over the long term you need to get the trending direction of growth correct for that i continue to spot economic inflection points using a wide array of economic data and leading indicators in a purely data driven manner without political bias or narrative drift

from 3 50 at february 28 2018 current market conditions aftershocks echoing throughout the nuclear fuel industry from the 2011 fukushima daichii nuclear incident which led to the multi year shutdown of all nuclear power generation in japan have produced several years of challenging market conditions in fiscal 2019 however several significant industry events have helped set the stage for sustained positive change in future years stability and a rising uranium price is a welcome change for the nuclear fuel industry which has been plagued by volatility and a sustained multi year decline in both the spot price and long term contract price of uranium during fiscal 2019 the uranium price declined from approximately us 21 25 per pound u 3 o 8 at the beginning of the year to an intra year low of us 20 50 per pound u 3 o 8 in april 2018 before strengthening and climbing steadily through the balance of the fiscal year to end the 2019 fiscal year at us 28 00 per pound u 3 o 8 the recent strength in the market has been supported in part by a number of events on the supply side most significant of these events was cameco corp s cameco announcement that the temporary shutdown of the mcarthur river mine would become indefinite with the timing of a restart dependent on future contracting and market conditions tied to this statement was cameco s confirmation of its continued commitment to meeting existing customer obligations by purchasing large volumes of uranium in the spot market national atomic company kazatomprom kazatomprom added to this supply side shift by keeping its promise to curtail its own production resulting in a 20 reduction from previously planned production levels kazatomprom also indicated that they will maintain this reduced level of production in calendar years 2019 and 2020 other curtailment efforts have also occurred including paladin energy ltd placing its langer heinrich operation in namibia on care and maintenance the primary production landscape changed further with the decision by rio tinto to sell its 68 2 share in the rössing operation in namibia to china national uranium corporation this sale does not create a fundamental change to supply and demand in the near term but it does likely mean that rössing production which had been a staple of western utilities for decades will now likely be destined for chinese consumption going forward according to the world nuclear association wna as at the end of the 2019 fiscal year there are 445 nuclear reactors operable in 30 countries these reactors can generate almost 396 gigawatts of electricity gwe which equates to approximately 10 of the world s electrical requirements and 21 of electrical requirements in organisation for economic co operation and development oecd member countries as at february 28 2019 are also 57 nuclear reactors under construction in 15 countries with the principal drivers of this expansion being china 13 reactors under construction india 7 russia 6 south korea 5 uae 4 and the united states 4 in addition there are another 126 reactors currently being planned around the world importantly in february 2019 the chinese government announced after a brief hiatus in the approval of new reactor projects in that country the preliminary approval for the construction of four new domestically designed hpr1000 reactors according to uxc s q1 2019 uranium market outlook q1 2019 outlook global nuclear power capacities are projected to increase to 462 reactors generating approximately 453 gwe in 35 countries by 2035 in the q1 2019 outlook uxc estimates base case demand in 2019 to be 195 million pounds u 3 o 8 uxc also estimates that annual uranium demand could grow to 210 million pounds u 3 o 8 under their base case for 2035 and to more than 290 million pounds u 3 o 8 in their high case for the same period the japan story remains a slow moving one but generally positive japan s restart effort continues to advance with the country finally beginning to make meaningful progress in bringing its nuclear fleet back online in fiscal 2019 japan increased its total number of nuclear reactors in operation to nine proving that there is a path to restart in the country perhaps more important was the fact that while japan has struggled with timely restarts over the past eight years the global nuclear energy industry has continued to advance and has now grown such that the current level of global nuclear power generation has recovered to the pre fukushima levels from this point forward additional japanese restarts can be seen as an added bonus to global nuclear generation the steady price rise in fiscal 2019 can also be attributed to the high volume of uranium transacted in the spot market in calendar year 2018 spot market volumes set a record exceeding 88 million pounds u 3 o 8 and surpassing the previously recorded high of 56 million pounds u 3 o 8 in 2011 while certain nuclear utilities looked to take advantage of low priced uranium available in the market the increase in transaction volume was mostly fueled by producer and trader buying resulting from production cutbacks as well as renewed interest from financial investors speculating in the physical market while spot market volumes exceeded expectations long term contracting in the market continued to lag market participants have entered into long term contracts for less than 400 million pounds of u 3 o 8 over the past five years a period in which consumption exceeded 800 million pounds u 3 o 8 while uncertainty surrounding fukushima has started to fade and signposts suggesting that buyers are planning to begin long term contracting have emerged a section 232 trade petition in the united states has brought renewed uncertainty to the market over the last several months the petition was submitted to the us department of commerce doc at the end of fiscal 2018 by us uranium producers energy fuels inc and ur energy inc requesting that the doc investigate whether uranium imports into the united states are detrimental to that country s national security uncertainty from the section 232 trade petition has gradually increased as we approach the conclusion of the doc investigation the companies who introduced the trade petition proposed a 25 domestic purchase quota for us utilities as a potential remedy however the doc has the discretion to propose any remedy that it may consider appropriate ahead of a final decision by the us president as to the implementation of any trade measure it is expected that the findings of the doc as well as an ultimate decision by the us president on whether a remedy will be imposed and what it will look like could be announced as early as the second calendar quarter of 2019 the overhang created by this potential trade action has had a direct impact on utility procurement especially those based in the us causing them to retreat from the market until the impact of the petition is better understood this slowed purchasing led uxc to revise its projections in its q1 2019 outlook such that cumulative uncovered nuclear utility requirements are now 1 6 billion pounds of u 3 o 8 through 2035 other important demand side events in fiscal 2019 have contributed to shifting market sentiment including positive news from some of the world s leading economies in november france released its anticipated energy plan answering questions that had emerged regarding potential plans by the country to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy under the new energy plan france upheld its goal introduced by previous french president hollande to reduce its reliance on nuclear energy to 50 but extended the time frame for this change by a decade from 2025 to 2035 this was seen as a considerable win for nuclear energy both in france and globally closely following the news from france was an announcement by the european commission that it will adopt a long term climate plan that calls for the european union to become the first major climate neutral economy by 2050 the plan focuses heavily on the energy sector stating that renewables and nuclear power will be the backbone of a carbon free european power system as well china continued building on its existing reactor portfolio by starting seven new reactors in fiscal 2019 adding to this accomplishment china became the first to commercially operate two new reactor designs westinghouse electric company s ap1000 and france s epr completion of these new designs was a positive signal to the industry that the designs work and will aid deployment of these reactor designs in other jurisdictions subsequent event effective april 1 2019 the corporation entered into a new management services agreement with the manager the msa

the reserve bank s proposals for increased bank capital requirements include consideration of the social impacts of banking crises a paper released by the reserve bank says while the reserve bank s explicit mandate does not make reference to societal well being the social impacts of crises are a relevant consideration for society and society s attitudes towards the risk of harm from crises that we seek to represent in our capital policy the idea that economic policies and by association financial regulations should be set after considering outcomes in the broadest sense is not novel the reserve bank says this comment comes in a reserve bank capital review background paper entitled an outline of the analysis supporting the risk appetite framework released on wednesday the paper is authored by susan guthrie a reserve bank adviser on financial system policy and analysis guthrie was also co author alongside gareth morgan of the book the big kahuna turning tax and welfare on its head in new zealand guthrie s highlighting of well being issues comes after reserve bank deputy governor and general manager for financial stability geoff bascand used well being eight times including in the title in a february speech on the capital proposals finance minister grant robertson is due to unveil the government s first well being budget on may 30 the reserve bank s capital proposals make the explicit assumption that new zealand is not prepared to tolerate a system wide banking crisis more than once every 200 years although guthrie notes the absence of a systemic banking crisis in nz s modern history there s a reserve bank paper on nz banking failures here she says a decision was made to define the policy goal as the banking system having sufficient capital to retain the confidence of the market when faced with losses as large as but not larger than losses that might arise once every 200 years we don t have evidence about new zealanders tolerance for banking crises and we hope that as a result of the consultative process we might become better informed however for the purposes of arriving at a capital proposal we needed a starting assumption and that became 1 200 guthrie writes she says failure probability rates are common in similar regulatory frameworks for example internationally some insurance regulators administer solvency standards that specify a probability of ruin that is not greater than 1 200 years in new zealand non life insurers are subject to a solvency requirement of 1 1000 years in relation to earthquake risks and 1 250 for other non life catastrophes in the us in 2017 analysts at the federal deposit insurance corporation used a risk tolerance of 1 500 years in their modelling work related to setting the reserve ratio for the us deposit insurance fund a risk tolerance is also embedded in the capital equation specified in the basel iii standards and used by banks permitted to model their risk weights a confidence level of 99 9 is specified this translates to a risk tolerance of 1 1000 years says guthrie how tolerant should the reserve bank be to the risk of a banking crisis says guthrie there are thus a range of risk tolerances evident in financial sector regulation around the world and in new zealand the risk tolerances used in other areas of financial regulation provided context for the decision to adopt 1 200 when setting minimum bank capital requirements more fundamentally though in order to set a risk tolerance for policy purposes it was necessary to consider the adverse economic and social impacts of banking crises acting as an agent for society how tolerant should the reserve bank be of the risk of a banking crisis given the available evidence about the impacts of such a crisis asks guthrie she goes on to acknowledge the reserve bank s mandate does not explicitly make reference to societal well being nonetheless she argues the social impacts of crises are a relevant consideration for society and for the reserve bank to consider in its bank capital policy it is essential that governments take into account the likely social implications of their economic policies it has been shown time and again that economic policies considered in isolation from their social outcomes can have dire consequences for poverty employment nutrition health and education which in turn adversely affect long term sustainable development the paper says sourcing this to the united nations there is a large literature about the economic and social impacts of deep and prolonged recessions such as are likely to arise in the event of a banking crises a common theme in the literature is the harm to mental and physical health family cohesion and community connectedness caused by the economic stress induced by a severe downturn through unemployment falling incomes reduced savings and or declining asset values there is evidence of these impacts in both developed and developing countries although local circumstances can act to mitigate the effects again sourcing the un she says that whilst systemic data s not available there s growing evidence that a crisis has significant impacts on individuals families and communities in terms of wellness cohesion and conflict this can include increases to rates of mental illness substance abuse and suicide enduring effects on society as a whole guthrie argues evidence should be considered in detail providing insight into why the likes of the world health organisation the world bank and the united nations see the societal impacts of financial crises as being long lived the break up of families ill health reduced spending on healthcare and nutrition and societal unrest can all be expected to have enduring effects on society as a whole below is detail from guthrie s paper on these perceived impacts impacts on physical health public health impacts from prolonged recessions such as increased mortality due to heart disease and illnesses such as liver cirrhosis related to increased alcoholism have been long documented adverse health effects are mostly found among the lower socio economic classes without economic security the lack of economic security is often stressful social and family structures break down and habits harmful to health are adopted these effects may be manifested in a psychopathological event such as suicide or after a time lag of a few years in chronic diseases impacts on mental health a recent study of 26 countries in the european union found that for every one percent increase in unemployment the suicide rate for people under 65 years of age went up by 0 8 percent during the asian crisis overall poverty rose from 11 percent to 18 percent in indonesia and urban poverty doubled to 18 percent in korea previous studies also point to increased inequality associated with financial crises in a panel of advanced and emerging market countries during 1988 2010 with the impact rising along with severity of recessions research also shows that the average rise in income inequality during recessions tends to be larger than the fall during booms suggesting that the poor tend to get a bigger share of the pain than the prosperity economic crises also coincide with a deterioration in social cohesion during the great depression in 1929 32 for example there was a 40 percent increase in suicide rates and a 10 percent increase in deaths from all causes in the united states similarly there was a 39 percent increase in suicide rates among males in japan during the asian crisis a 44 percent increase in hong kong sar china and a 45 percent rise in korea and thailand impacts on family cohesion economic stress is a major source of family tension and a leading cause of family breakups a study of housing prices and marital dissolution in the united kingdom in the period 1991 to 2004 found that a 10 percent fall in housing prices was associated with an additional 5 percent of couples breaking up although data are scarce some countries have seen an increase in cases of domestic violence linked to the crisis for instance a survey of 630 domestic violence shelters in the united states reported a 75 percent increase in the number of requests for services since the onset of the crisis the survey also found that abuse had become more severe impacts on the wellbeing of children and youth recent reports by unicef for example point to a significant deterioration in child well being in a number of advanced countries based on measures of material well being health and safety education behaviours and risks and housing and environment similarly the un composite human development index computed as a function of measures of life expectancy at birth access to knowledge and a decent standard of living declined between 2007 and 2012 for a number of middle and high income countries in the middle east and europe as well as for small island states the youth have been particularly hit hard by the crisis the jump in the youth unemployment rate has been most pronounced in advanced economies rising from 12 5 percent in 2007 to an estimated average of 17 9 percent in 2012 the rate has reached alarming levels in the peripheral euro area countries to 59 percent in greece and 56 percent in spain compared with an average rate for the euro area at 24 percent in mid 2013 and 7 5 percent in germany impacts on community connectedness we study the implications of the great recession for voting for anti establishment parties as well as for general trust and political attitudes using regional data across europe we compare the regions that greatly suffered from the crisis with those that weathered the crisis relatively well controlling or pan european and country specific time trends we show that the differential impact of the crisis explains the rise of anti establishment often populist parties and also the respective drop in trust towards political parties and the european union the world health organisation has recently highlighted the negative psychological effects of financial crises as well as the increase in crime that these typically bring impact on vulnerable people while everyone is vulnerable to their adverse consequences financial crises hurt disproportionately the poor as with natural disasters contagious diseases or climate change given that the poor have limited capacity and instruments to insulate themselves from the shock and recover from the impact of the crisis in any given country crises hit particularly hard the most vulnerable the young the old women and the ill a severe financial crisis can morph into a social crisis if it is poorly handled guthrie says the reserve bank believes such impacts as those detailed above are likely to lead to society being relatively intolerant of banking crises however one aim of the consultation is to generate a public conversation and prompt feedback about this important issue she writes she says the 1 200 assumption was accepted as being a reasonable approximation in the absence of any information to the contrary as to what society might consider an appropriate risk tolerance full cost benefit assessment for a regulatory impact statement to come meanwhile guthrie notes her paper isn t intended to provide a cost benefit assessment of the capital proposals instead she says the reserve bank will carry out a full cost benefit assessment for a regulatory impact statement nonetheless she says the concepts discussed in her paper will be an important component of that cost benefit assessment the full assessment will also consider any submissions received during the consultation period as well as looking at alternative scenarios to look at risks around estimates of costs and benefits additionally she notes other impacts of bank capital such as impacts on tax revenues where a tax regime treats interest payments by banks as a tax deductible expense as new zealand s does the more a bank substitutes debt funding for capital funding the less tax it pays all else equal while an increased tax payment would be an expense to the bank from a societal perspective it is simply a transfer and not a cost the only cost of capital from a societal perspective is the output impact of higher lending rates writes guthrie what the rbnz is proposing nz banks must currently meet a minimum total capital ratio of 10 5 of their risk weighted assets rwa the reserve bank is proposing to increase this to 18 for banks identified as systemically important anz asb bnz and westpac and 17 for all other banks after adopting a risk tolerance of 1 200 weighing up the available evidence and considering soundness and efficiency the decision was made to propose an increase in minimum tier 1 capital requirements such that the minimum requirement would exceed current tier 1 system wide capital by 20 billion the final proposal was expressed as capital relative to rwa not unweighted assets and reflected proposed changes to the calculation of rwa by the large four banks says guthrie the final proposal equates to capital equal to 9 3 of unweighted assets measured as total exposure at default or ead assuming banks hold a voluntary buffer of 0 5 of ead means the proposal will deliver capital equal to 9 8 of unweighted assets the deadline for submissions on the reserve bank proposals is friday may 3 the reserve bank then expects to publish final decisions in the third quarter of 2019 for full details on just what the reserve bank is proposing for bank

it is never a good thing when the economic management of the country comes to be engulfed in turbocharged emotion policymakers become distracted and their political opponents magnify the challenges and cast them in a way to assign blame rather than seek a path forward having seen pakistan go through two different periods of economic adjustment in the past 10 years this being the third i can say that these episodes always unleash angry energies in a way nothing else can except perhaps the approach of war to some extent this stands to reason it is during these periods of adjustment that the populace is called upon to make large sacrifices because of higher inflation and falling opportunities the middles classes have to curb consumption and businesses find their balance sheets contracting rapidly those unfortunate enough to have new investment coming online precisely at the time when the adjustment begins find themselves faced with collapsing sales and rising debt service costs as disposable incomes dries up and interest rates rise it is during periods of adjustment that the populace is called upon to make large sacrifices because of higher inflation and falling opportunities consumption investment employment purchasing power all collapse during these times and all governments face this quagmire in their opening months sometimes dragging on for years remember the first speech of pervez musharraf we have hit rock bottom he declared at the time for three years his government struggled with some of the toughest conditions ever attached to an imf programme a short six month standby that they had to implement before qualifying for the coveted poverty reduction and growth facility in 2002 things picked up rapidly after that for his government helping him get past the 2004 deadline he had set for himself to shed the uniform without honouring that promise the inflows that kicked in after 9 11 and pakistan acquiescing in being part of america s war on terror played a critical role in jumpstarting growth otherwise musharraf may well have had to honour his promise to shed the uniform by 2004 but even those circumstances back in 1999 were nothing compared to what he left behind once he relinquished power and fled the country 10 years later the year 2008 saw one of the biggest financial crises of pakistan s history consider for example that this was the first time that the stock market had to be frozen altogether since the magnitude of the plunge it was seeing day after day was so large it could have wiped out the diminishing foreign exchange reserves of the country asset management funds were frozen and a run on the banks had actually begun one of our economy s big untold stories on top of that the newly elected government had to eliminate fuel subsidies in one go causing a massive spike in the price of fuel and to jack up power tariffs steeply it had to undertake a sharp devaluation of the rupee and watch gdp growth rate crash to 1 7 per cent as public spending all but dried up a massive circular debt overhang coupled with almost rs700bn of borrowing from the state bank that had to be retired remember the economy was less than half the size back then compared to today so rs700bn was a lot more money than it is today and oil prices shot up to 147 per barrel at the peak of history s biggest oil price bubble the ppp paid a very heavy price for owning that stabilisation effort and the scale of the hate and invective levelled against that government was like nothing i have seen before anchors would launch into an hour long tirade against them on prime time and it was considered perfectly normal granted there was misgovernance but much of the raw emotion also owed itself to the scale of the adjustment they had to undertake the net result was paralysis coupled with high handed interventions from then chief justice iftikhar chaudhry who worked overtime to nullify almost every decision the government made regarding the economy at one point he actually summoned them to court to demand why gas was not being subsidised the pml n government faced a comparatively better situation but nevertheless it was rough riding in the initial year and a half at the outset they had to deal with a power system crippled by debt and largely lying idle then came the erosion of the reserves and the approach to the imf growth dropped to 4 7pc in their first fiscal year on the back of sharp drops in public spending but some cushion was provided with help from the kingdom of saudi arabia that granted the country a 1 5bn deposit to tide things over they got some help from sharply falling oil prices and then came cpec so the scale of the adjustment they had to undertake did not have to get as large as it was back in 2008 the present government is walking in the same footsteps a large adjustment that the government says has largely been made but some reasons exist to suggest that far more is to come has been undertaken as reserves hit around two months of import cover by the time the government decided to go to the imf back in october last year since then something like 6bn has poured in from saudi arabia the uae and china and the current account deficit has dropped from 2bn per month to 1bn all this is fine and containing the external sector deficits had to be undertaken there is no doubt about that but now the government appears to have embarked upon a new reform measure about which we know very little except for the fact that it is being taken seriously this reform measure involves unhinging the exchange rate from state control significantly which will be the most important step taken thus far by the new government it can be brought about other than that the reform path forward is a well trodden one and experience tells us it is rarely an easy one to walk the writer is a member of staff khurram husain gmail com twitter khurramhusain published in dawn april 4th 2019
the reserve bank s proposals for increased bank capital requirements include consideration of the social impacts of banking crises a paper released by the reserve bank says while the reserve bank s explicit mandate does not make reference to societal well being the social impacts of crises are a relevant consideration for society and society s attitudes towards the risk of harm from crises that we seek to represent in our capital policy the idea that economic policies and by association financial regulations should be set after considering outcomes in the broadest sense is not novel the reserve bank says this comment comes in a reserve bank capital review background paper entitled an outline of the analysis supporting the risk appetite framework released on wednesday the paper is authored by susan guthrie a reserve bank adviser on financial system policy and analysis guthrie was also co author alongside gareth morgan of the book the big kahuna turning tax and welfare on its head in new zealand guthrie s highlighting of well being issues comes after reserve bank deputy governor and general manager for financial stability geoff bascand used well being eight times including in the title in a february speech on the capital proposals finance minister grant robertson is due to unveil the government s first well being budget on may 30 the reserve bank s capital proposals make the explicit assumption that new zealand is not prepared to tolerate a system wide banking crisis more than once every 200 years although guthrie notes the absence of a systemic banking crisis in nz s modern history there s a reserve bank paper on nz banking failures here she says a decision was made to define the policy goal as the banking system having sufficient capital to retain the confidence of the market when faced with losses as large as but not larger than losses that might arise once every 200 years we don t have evidence about new zealanders tolerance for banking crises and we hope that as a result of the consultative process we might become better informed however for the purposes of arriving at a capital proposal we needed a starting assumption and that became 1 200 guthrie writes she says failure probability rates are common in similar regulatory frameworks for example internationally some insurance regulators administer solvency standards that specify a probability of ruin that is not greater than 1 200 years in new zealand non life insurers are subject to a solvency requirement of 1 1000 years in relation to earthquake risks and 1 250 for other non life catastrophes in the us in 2017 analysts at the federal deposit insurance corporation used a risk tolerance of 1 500 years in their modelling work related to setting the reserve ratio for the us deposit insurance fund a risk tolerance is also embedded in the capital equation specified in the basel iii standards and used by banks permitted to model their risk weights a confidence level of 99 9 is specified this translates to a risk tolerance of 1 1000 years says guthrie how tolerant should the reserve bank be to the risk of a banking crisis says guthrie there are thus a range of risk tolerances evident in financial sector regulation around the world and in new zealand the risk tolerances used in other areas of financial regulation provided context for the decision to adopt 1 200 when setting minimum bank capital requirements more fundamentally though in order to set a risk tolerance for policy purposes it was necessary to consider the adverse economic and social impacts of banking crises acting as an agent for society how tolerant should the reserve bank be of the risk of a banking crisis given the available evidence about the impacts of such a crisis asks guthrie she goes on to acknowledge the reserve bank s mandate does not explicitly make reference to societal well being nonetheless she argues the social impacts of crises are a relevant consideration for society and for the reserve bank to consider in its bank capital policy it is essential that governments take into account the likely social implications of their economic policies it has been shown time and again that economic policies considered in isolation from their social outcomes can have dire consequences for poverty employment nutrition health and education which in turn adversely affect long term sustainable development the paper says sourcing this to the united nations there is a large literature about the economic and social impacts of deep and prolonged recessions such as are likely to arise in the event of a banking crises a common theme in the literature is the harm to mental and physical health family cohesion and community connectedness caused by the economic stress induced by a severe downturn through unemployment falling incomes reduced savings and or declining asset values there is evidence of these impacts in both developed and developing countries although local circumstances can act to mitigate the effects again sourcing the un she says that whilst systemic data s not available there s growing evidence that a crisis has significant impacts on individuals families and communities in terms of wellness cohesion and conflict this can include increases to rates of mental illness substance abuse and suicide enduring effects on society as a whole guthrie argues evidence should be considered in detail providing insight into why the likes of the world health organisation the world bank and the united nations see the societal impacts of financial crises as being long lived the break up of families ill health reduced spending on healthcare and nutrition and societal unrest can all be expected to have enduring effects on society as a whole below is detail from guthrie s paper on these perceived impacts impacts on physical health public health impacts from prolonged recessions such as increased mortality due to heart disease and illnesses such as liver cirrhosis related to increased alcoholism have been long documented adverse health effects are mostly found among the lower socio economic classes without economic security the lack of economic security is often stressful social and family structures break down and habits harmful to health are adopted these effects may be manifested in a psychopathological event such as suicide or after a time lag of a few years in chronic diseases impacts on mental health a recent study of 26 countries in the european union found that for every one percent increase in unemployment the suicide rate for people under 65 years of age went up by 0 8 percent during the asian crisis overall poverty rose from 11 percent to 18 percent in indonesia and urban poverty doubled to 18 percent in korea previous studies also point to increased inequality associated with financial crises in a panel of advanced and emerging market countries during 1988 2010 with the impact rising along with severity of recessions research also shows that the average rise in income inequality during recessions tends to be larger than the fall during booms suggesting that the poor tend to get a bigger share of the pain than the prosperity economic crises also coincide with a deterioration in social cohesion during the great depression in 1929 32 for example there was a 40 percent increase in suicide rates and a 10 percent increase in deaths from all causes in the united states similarly there was a 39 percent increase in suicide rates among males in japan during the asian crisis a 44 percent increase in hong kong sar china and a 45 percent rise in korea and thailand impacts on family cohesion economic stress is a major source of family tension and a leading cause of family breakups a study of housing prices and marital dissolution in the united kingdom in the period 1991 to 2004 found that a 10 percent fall in housing prices was associated with an additional 5 percent of couples breaking up although data are scarce some countries have seen an increase in cases of domestic violence linked to the crisis for instance a survey of 630 domestic violence shelters in the united states reported a 75 percent increase in the number of requests for services since the onset of the crisis the survey also found that abuse had become more severe impacts on the wellbeing of children and youth recent reports by unicef for example point to a significant deterioration in child well being in a number of advanced countries based on measures of material well being health and safety education behaviours and risks and housing and environment similarly the un composite human development index computed as a function of measures of life expectancy at birth access to knowledge and a decent standard of living declined between 2007 and 2012 for a number of middle and high income countries in the middle east and europe as well as for small island states the youth have been particularly hit hard by the crisis the jump in the youth unemployment rate has been most pronounced in advanced economies rising from 12 5 percent in 2007 to an estimated average of 17 9 percent in 2012 the rate has reached alarming levels in the peripheral euro area countries to 59 percent in greece and 56 percent in spain compared with an average rate for the euro area at 24 percent in mid 2013 and 7 5 percent in germany impacts on community connectedness we study the implications of the great recession for voting for anti establishment parties as well as for general trust and political attitudes using regional data across europe we compare the regions that greatly suffered from the crisis with those that weathered the crisis relatively well controlling or pan european and country specific time trends we show that the differential impact of the crisis explains the rise of anti establishment often populist parties and also the respective drop in trust towards political parties and the european union the world health organisation has recently highlighted the negative psychological effects of financial crises as well as the increase in crime that these typically bring impact on vulnerable people while everyone is vulnerable to their adverse consequences financial crises hurt disproportionately the poor as with natural disasters contagious diseases or climate change given that the poor have limited capacity and instruments to insulate themselves from the shock and recover from the impact of the crisis in any given country crises hit particularly hard the most vulnerable the young the old women and the ill a severe financial crisis can morph into a social crisis if it is poorly handled guthrie says the reserve bank believes such impacts as those detailed above are likely to lead to society being relatively intolerant of banking crises however one aim of the consultation is to generate a public conversation and prompt feedback about this important issue she writes she says the 1 200 assumption was accepted as being a reasonable approximation in the absence of any information to the contrary as to what society might consider an appropriate risk tolerance full cost benefit assessment for a regulatory impact statement to come meanwhile guthrie notes her paper isn t intended to provide a cost benefit assessment of the capital proposals instead she says the reserve bank will carry out a full cost benefit assessment for a regulatory impact statement nonetheless she says the concepts discussed in her paper will be an important component of that cost benefit assessment the full assessment will also consider any submissions received during the consultation period as well as looking at alternative scenarios to look at risks around estimates of costs and benefits additionally she notes other impacts of bank capital such as impacts on tax revenues where a tax regime treats interest payments by banks as a tax deductible expense as new zealand s does the more a bank substitutes debt funding for capital funding the less tax it pays all else equal while an increased tax payment would be an expense to the bank from a societal perspective it is simply a transfer and not a cost the only cost of capital from a societal perspective is the output impact of higher lending rates writes guthrie what the rbnz is proposing nz banks must currently meet a minimum total capital ratio of 10 5 of their risk weighted assets rwa the reserve bank is proposing to increase this to 18 for banks identified as systemically important anz asb bnz and westpac and 17 for all other banks after adopting a risk tolerance of 1 200 weighing up the available evidence and considering soundness and efficiency the decision was made to propose an increase in minimum tier 1 capital requirements such that the minimum requirement would exceed current tier 1 system wide capital by 20 billion the final proposal was expressed as capital relative to rwa not unweighted assets and reflected proposed changes to the calculation of rwa by the large four banks says guthrie the final proposal equates to capital equal to 9 3 of unweighted assets measured as total exposure at default or ead assuming banks hold a voluntary buffer of 0 5 of ead means the proposal will deliver capital equal to 9 8 of unweighted assets the deadline for submissions on the reserve bank proposals is friday may 3 the reserve bank then expects to publish final decisions in the third quarter of 2019 for full details on just what the reserve bank is proposing for bank

supports tax reform says persistent structural challenges restrain economic growth obinna chima nigeria s economy is recovering the international monetary fund has said giving president muhammadu buhari s economic initiatives a pat on the back executive directors welcomed nigeria s ongoing economic recovery accompanied by reduced inflation and strengthened reserve buffers the imf stated in its latest executive board s 2019 article iv consultation with nigeria it noted that real gdp increased by 1 9 per cent in 2018 up from 0 8 per cent in 2017 on the back of improvements in manufacturing and services supported by spillovers from higher oil prices ongoing convergence in exchange rates and strides to improve the business environment according to the fund headline inflation fell to 11 4 per cent at end 2018 reflecting declining food price inflation weak consumer demand a relatively stable exchange rate and tight monetary policy during most of 2018 but remains outside of the central bank s target range of 6 9 per cent it said record holdings of mostly short term local debt and equity and a current account surplus lifted gross international reserves to a peak in april 2018 while the three times oversubscribed november 2018 eurobond helped cushion the impact of outflows later in the year the fund however pointed out that persisting structural and policy challenges in nigeria have continued to constrain growth to levels below those needed to reduce vulnerabilities in the country this according to the fund has made it extremely difficult to lessen poverty and improve weak human development outcomes such as in health and education sectors it welcomed tax reform plan in the country which aims to increase non oil revenue including through tax policy and administration measures the washington based institution noted that large infrastructure gap low revenue mobilisation governance and institutional weaknesses continued foreign exchange restrictions and banking sector vulnerabilities were dampening long term foreign and domestic investment and keeping the economy reliant on volatile oil prices and production under current policies the outlook remains therefore muted over the medium term with absent of strong reforms growth would hover around 2 5 per cent implying no per capita growth as the economy faces limited increases in oil production and insufficient adjustment four years after the oil price shock monetary policy focused on exchange rate stability would help contain inflation but worsen competitiveness if greater flexibility is not accommodated when needed high financing costs on the back of little fiscal adjustment would continue to constrain private sector credit and the interest to revenue ratio would remain high risks are moderately tilted downwards on the upside oil prices could rise prompted by global political disruptions or supply bottlenecks it stated however imf pointed out that bold reform efforts following the election cycle could boost confidence and investments in the country especially given relatively conservative baseline projections on the downside it noted that additional delays in reform implementation a persistent fall in oil prices reduced oil production increased security tensions or tighter global financial market conditions could undermine growth provoke a market sell off and put additional pressure on reserves and or the exchange rate imf supports nigeria s tax reform the imf s executive directors in the report also welcomed nigeria s ongoing economic recovery including tax reform accompanied by reduced inflation and strengthened reserve buffers they noted however that the medium term outlook remained muted with risks tilted to the downside in addition long standing structural and policy challenges need to be tackled more decisively to reduce vulnerabilities raise per capita growth and bring down poverty directors therefore urged the authorities to redouble their reform efforts and supported their intention to accelerate implementation of their economic recovery and growth plan directors emphasised the need for revenue based consolidation to lower the ratio of interest payments to revenue and make room for priority expenditure they welcomed the authorities tax reform plan to increase non oil revenue including through tax policy and administration measures they stressed the importance of strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation including through additional excises a comprehensive vat reform and elimination of tax incentives securing oil revenues through reforms of state owned enterprises and measures to improve the governance of the oil sector will also be crucial directors highlighted the importance of shifting the expenditure mix toward priority areas they welcomed in this context the significant increase in public investment but underlined the need for greater investment efficiency the report stated in addition it recommended increasing funding for health and education in nigeria the fund noted that phasing out implicit fuel subsidies while strengthening social safety nets would mitigate the impact on the vulnerable help reduce poverty gap and free up additional fiscal space directors recommended stronger coordination for more effective public debt and cash management with inflation still above the central bank target directors generally considered that a tight monetary policy stance is appropriate they encouraged the authorities to enhance transparency and communication and to improve the monetary policy framework including by using more traditional methods such as raising the monetary policy rate or cash reserve requirements directors also urged ending direct central bank intervention in the economy to allow focus on the central bank s price stability mandate directors commended the authorities commitment to unify the exchange rate and welcomed the increasing convergence of foreign exchange windows they noted that a unified market based exchange rate and a more flexible exchange rate regime would support inflation targeting directors also stressed that elimination of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices would remove distortions and facilitate economic diversification directors welcomed the decline in nonperforming loans and the improved prudential banking ratios but noted that restructured loans and undercapitalised banks continue to weigh on financial sector performance they suggested strengthening capital buffers and risk based supervision conducting an asset quality review avoiding regulatory forbearance and revamping the banking resolution framework directors also recommended establishing a credible time bound recapitalisation plan for weak banks and a timeline for phasing out the state backed asset management company amcon directors urged the authorities to reinvigorate implementation of structural reforms to diversify the economy and achieve the sustainable development goals they pointed to the importance of improving the business environment implementing the power sector recovery programme deepening financial inclusion reforming the health and education sectors and implementing policies to reduce gender inequities the fund added

the 20th anniversary of the euro this year is a good time to reflect on the robustness of europe s monetary union the memory of the last crisis which began in the united states in 2008 is still fresh in the minds of europeans the eurozone suffered more than the u s with some of its members getting hit much harder than others at a time when the eurozone is once again showing signs of a significant slowdown it is important to understand what happened last time did we learn anything in the euro s first 20 years that could help fight another recession the most popular narrative of the eurozone crisis relies on the economist robert mundell s theory of an optimum currency area oca which warns against establishing a common monetary policy in a federation of different states with different levels of economic resilience this view emphasizes that eurozone members lack the exchange rate flexibility that might help them respond to a negative shock to make matters worse because the european central bank targets the average eurozone inflation rate its monetary policy stance may not be suitable for all member states in the weakest countries this may lead to real interest rates above the level required for full employment another narrative focuses on financial fragility in good times some eurozone countries build up excessive leverage because of relatively low real interest rates partly a consequence of the ecb s one size fits all monetary policy in countries with weak institutions and poor governance this can lead to a loss of competitiveness and excessive consumption a crisis would then be nastier than normal triggering a fall in asset prices and debt defaults followed by a period of deleveraging and weak demand two questions are relevant today one is whether weaker eurozone countries would be better off outside the monetary union with their own national currencies this is not just an academic debate given the increasingly vocal anti euro constituencies in some member states a second more urgent question is whether a new eurozone recession would once again cause a crisis with highly uneven effects the answer will help to set policy priorities in the event of an economic shock my answer to the first question is no largely because the oca theory disregards two key factors for one thing globalized financial markets and large short term capital flows can cause wide exchange rate fluctuations for countries with floating currencies and for small open economies in particular as many emerging market countries have demonstrated such currency swings may affect a country s ability to repay foreign currency debt and could force it to adopt a monetary policy at odds with its domestic objectives furthermore the oca theory does not consider the stabilizing effect of central bank credibility it is difficult to imagine that ireland for example would have avoided a financial crisis had it been able to devalue its currency sharply in 2008 especially with debt denominated in euros and other strong global currencies in the crisis years from 2008 to 2013 eurozone policymakers struggled with a flight to safety toward core members as well as with increasing geographic balkanization of financial markets with investors favoring their own countries government bonds read more opinion eu needs a new global trade strategy has the euro saved or harmed europe as a result the ecb s loose monetary policy was less effective than it otherwise might have been in these circumstances it is hard to believe that a national central bank could have secured lower risk premiums through nationally targeted asset purchases if a macroeconomic adjustment program lacked credibility advocates of reverting to a national currency often point out that japan and the united kingdom were more successful than spain ireland greece and portugal in fighting the last recession but this viewpoint fails to take into account that historically these countries had been economically more volatile than germany or france and remained so after adopting the single currency as for the second question a new eurozone recession would most likely have a less uneven effect than in 2008 or 2011 today almost all eurozone countries have current account surpluses ireland is growing faster than china while spain and portugal are also doing relatively well and although robust house prices are fueling some of this growth leverage is lower than it was 10 years ago the next recession in these countries is therefore unlikely to come with a nasty banking crisis that could make matters worse the eurozone s three largest economies on the other hand pose a bigger recession risk germany and italy have weak banking sectors and are facing a sharp cyclical slowdown which in italy is combined with very low long term trend growth and high public debt france also is growing sluggishly and has high private debt a recession in the big three would drag down the eurozone s smaller members too the resulting eurozone wide shock would require a common response with countries coordinating monetary and fiscal policy to engineer the right stimulus but such a coordinated fiscal stimulus would be difficult to implement unless germany the country with the largest fiscal capacity took the lead moreover policymakers would have to try to prevent another bout of balkanization of eurozone financial markets as the last crisis showed such fragmentation impairs monetary policy limits risk sharing and removes all the advantages of having a large liquid integrated capital market the eurozone s real weakness is not the lack of exchange rate flexibility or its common monetary policy rather it is the breakdown in risk sharing when the economy is hit by large shocks combined with the absence of a common fiscal policy that is the main lesson of the past 20 years by lucrezia reichlin the views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author

i m sure you know this already but let me say it anyway cities have become really popular all over the world an ever larger share of the u s and global population lives in cities and that large share is expected to get even larger as demand for city living grows the supply of housing often can t keep up which results in and you know this too a rise in prices in the u s median rent has doubled since the 1990 s outpacing inflation by quite a bit in many cities this makes it hard for people who already live there to stay and hard for people who d like to move there i m sure you ve heard the horror stories about rents in cities like london and hong kong seattle and san francisco where the median one bedroom apartment costs about 3 700 a month the problem is so bad in new york city that it inspired a new political party jimmy mcmillan i represent the rent is too damn high party people are working eight hours a day and forty hours a week and some a third job new york like many cities has over time put in place various affordable housing policies one time honored tradition is some form of rent control that might mean setting a price cap on what a landlord can charge or limiting the amount the rent can be raised here s the stanford economist rebecca diamond rebecca diamond from an economics point of view it provides insurance against getting priced out of your neighborhood and rent control seems to be having a moment it already exists in a number of places diamond the most expensive cities in the u s they almost all have rent control and the appetite is spreading diamond you see rent control popping up politically when housing prices and rents are going up among the cities currently considering some form of rent control are chicago philadelphia providence and denver oregon recently became the first state to pass a rent control bill a statewide proposition in california failed but some cities there are moving ahead on their own a recent report by a consortium of affordable housing advocates says that if all the proposed rent control legislation were to pass nearly one in three american tenants would have some kind of rent protection most economists say that rent control is a bad idea as is just about any form of price control they believe that markets work best when supply and demand are allowed to find a natural equilibrium with price acting as the referee here s one such economist glaeser my name is ed glaeser and i am the fred and eleanor glimp professor of economics at harvard where i teach both microeconomic theory and the economics of cities dubner ed you have one minute to convince someone that rent control is a terrible idea go glaeser all right so i ve already squandered five of my seconds it s not particularly fair it s not a good way of allocating scarce space it s not a good way of helping the downtrodden it s a way that freezes a city and stops it from adjusting to changes a way that freezes people in apartments and stops the motion that is inherent in cities so that s a baseline economic take at least let s try to unravel this issue starting with a brief history of rent control glaeser rent controls really became ubiquitous in world war ii and the idea here was the nation was laying down its life to try and bring freedom to the world and it seemed wrong that some people who were well placed should earn some form of extra bonuses by being able to raise up rents on people maybe whose sons and daughters were off fighting for the u s elsewhere and rent control was seen as being a way of somehow or other trying to keep america being a bit fairer during world war ii now lots of places introduced rent control during this period after the war most of them got rid of it because that cause seemed to be a little bit less pressing but some cities kept it and new york of course is the most famous place that still has it glaeser himself grew up in new york glaeser i lived in a rent stabilized unit for the first ten years of my life i mean something like 72 74 percent of new york city s households were renters in those days and indeed the mid 1970s was an era in which new york s housing didn t seem that expensive affordability just wasn t the same issue that it was today now flash forward 30 years the cities have been enormously successful they haven t built enough to accommodate the new demand they risk becoming boutique towns affordable only to the wealthy and people are desperate to see that those cities don t push out every poor resident that they don t become monocultures built around the privileged and the rich and rent control appears to be at least one avenue for doing it but it s a very blunt instrument just how blunt there are decades worth of economic research describing the downsides of rent control the first major paper was written in 1946 by milton friedman and george stigler here s friedman milton friedman rent control is a law that supposedly is passed to help the people who are in housing and it does help those who are in current housing but the effect of rent control is to create scarcity and to make it difficult for other people to get housing where did this scarcity come from for one developers had less incentive to build new housing if there was a ceiling placed on what they could charge friedman also argued that rent control created a haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space this was echoed in a 1972 paper by edgar olsen which found that rent control led to what economists call an overconsumption of housing glaeser let s say you rented an apartment in new york in 1955 you had three small kids you rented a three bedroom it was perfectly matched for the needs of you with your kids growing up they moved out of the house in the early 70 s by the late 80 s maybe your husband or wife actually died and you re living on your own in a three bedroom apartment in new york but my goodness would you ever move out your rent is a fraction of what the market rent is one of my favorite stories about this and this is quoted by ken auletta s the streets were paved with gold he cites nat sherman the famous tobacconist to the world who had this big shop on fifth avenue who said that he pays i forget what it was dubner 355 a month for a six room apartment it says here glaeser isn t that amazing keep in mind it s a few decades ago but it s an unbelievable deal now what s outrageous about this is he then says i think it s fair because i use it so rarely right which means that he s not getting very much value out of it but the crazy thing about this is there were lots of new yorkers who would love to have that apartment and it would get a lot more value out of it in 1997 ed glaeser did his own analysis of rent control in new york city trying to determine just how economically inefficient it was he and his co author erzo luttmer found that this misallocation of bedrooms leads to a loss in welfare which could be well over 500 million annually to the consumers of new york before we even consider the social losses due to undersupply of housing glaeser s work has also inspired a new generation of economists to further the literature on rent control diamond historically people relied much more on theory in making their arguments about rent control that s rebecca diamond again she s a former student of ed glaeser s diamond because even without a lot of data you can make some pretty simple theoretical predictions about what rent control might do to a housing market but there are some things that theory alone cannot tell you diamond one of the biggest open questions in the literature of rent control is what happens to those tenants that get rent control really how much are the renters benefiting because they re the potential big winners of rent control and to measure that you really need to have data on where everybody lives and who gets access to rent control and whether they decide to stay in that rent controlled apartment or go somewhere else and traditional data sources that economists work with very rarely track migration of an individual dubner so you recently co authored with tim mcquade and franklin qian a paper called the effects of rent control expansion on tenants landlords and inequality evidence from san francisco first if you would talk about the data diamond yeah we have some really cool data so traditional data sets you can get things on the distribution of earnings and income things like that but you won t also see their migration so we have this you could call administrative data which tracks people s address histories dubner and where did these migratory data come from diamond we bought them from a company called infutor they are a company that works in identity management so they have this history of addresses for everyone which they collect from a number of different sources and stitch them together which is very useful for the private sector and firms that need to keep track of up to date addresses but from a research perspective it s super exciting data because it s so big and so detailed armed with this super exciting data on individual tenants diamond and her fellow researchers set out to measure some of the long term effects of rent control in san francisco they made particular use of a change in the city s rent laws san francisco had rent control but it didn t apply to many of the city s smaller apartment buildings diamond and the exemption was basically thought of as well these are mom and pop landlords they don t have market power they re not corporations so we don t need to regulate their rents and then newspapers reported that those smaller multi family buildings were increasingly purchased by corporate entities because that s really where you could make your money in the housing market and that led to a vote in 1994 where everyone in the city got to vote about whether we could remove this small multi family exemption and that would then expand rent control not just to the large multi family housing stock but also the small multi family housing stock and that indeed passed dubner so you ve got this awesome new law awesome for you guys at least as researchers that lets you mark before and after it s a perfect little natural experiment with a control group and then you ve got these wonderful data sets and then you mash up all of these data together and analyze it and you find the following your paper concludes that among many things rent control limits renters mobility by 20 percent and lowers displacement from san francisco especially for minorities so let s start with this what does it mean exactly that renters mobility is lowered by 20 percent and why is that important diamond so we look at whether the renters who get access to rent control choose to remain in their newly rent controlled apartment so we find that they are 20 percent more likely to remain there relative to our control group renters who don t get access to rent control dubner so that seems totally unsurprising yes diamond yes i more see that result as a validation that our data is good and high quality and we have something to work with here dubner okay further you write that rent control lowers displacement from san francisco what does that mean exactly diamond so we can look at not just whether you remain in the actual apartment you lived in when you got access to rent control but whether you remain in san francisco as a whole we find rent control has a dramatic impact on whether you actually live in san francisco or not so it prevents those renters from leaving the city as a whole which i think from a policy perspective of rent control advocates that s one of the goals they talk about as preventing displacement from the city dubner and then you write that especially for minorities that displacement is lowered diamond right so when you look at that first cohort of renters that already lived in the city at the time of rent control it is definitely helping minorities more it s preventing displacement of them especially dubner furthermore you write that landlords who are susceptible to rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent either by converting to condos selling to owner occupants or redeveloping buildings so now it starts to get a little more complicated can you talk about who s now starting to win here and who s starting to lose here diamond so obviously when the landlord is first notified about rent control he or she can quickly deduce that his or her rental stream is going to be lower than previously expected and just like any other business owner they might think about changing their business strategy so if renting out their apartments is no longer very profitable now they may decide oh maybe it s worthwhile to convert to condos and sell off the apartments to owner occupants and that would be a way to recover some of this lost income or another thing they could do is say knock down their old building and build some new construction and either sell those as condos or rent them out as apartments both of those options would avoid them having to pay this tax of rent control help recoup some of their losses which is good for the landlords but is going to undermine the goals of rent control because now we re going to have less rental housing out there available for rent control so you can start to see how rent control may be accomplishing a narrow short term goal making existing housing more affordable for a select group of people at the expense of the long term goal of making a city more affordable generally diamond when you pass rent control the landlords of the property suddenly getting covered by rent control are losing so much money they no longer really want to rent their apartments out at the prevailing new prices so they decrease their supply of rental housing to the market and if there s less supply that s going to drive up prices dubner okay so let me just make sure i have it pretty straight you find evidence that rent control increases gentrification one component of which is the displacement of low income tenants on the other hand you also find evidence that low income people including minorities at least those who are in rent controlled units already they re likely to disproportionately benefit from rent control so if i m an affordable housing advocate i might say oh fine fancy stanford professor who i m sure has some kind of great income and or housing subsidy and or situation i don t care that some landlords are suffering i don t care that the policy is having some downstream effects that you don t like i need to make sure that low income people aren t going to get a rent increase of 50 percent overnight so how do you respond to that argument diamond so when you think about those initial tenants that s the best bet you re going to get for the benefits of rent control to low income tenants the people that are already in the housing but even though we find that those tenants are much more likely to stay in their apartment when we look 10 15 years later the share of those 1994 residents that are still there is down to 10 percent or so so 90 percent of them no longer live in that initial apartment and it s that next low income tenant that wants to live in the city that low income tenant is going to have a very hard time finding an affordable option because now there s going to be less rental housing the prices that that low income tenant are going to face when they want to initially move in are going to be higher than they would have been absent rent control dubner i m curious how generalizable you think your findings from san francisco are for other cities diamond i would suspect that the actual quantitative loss of rental supply or benefits to the tenant will depend a little bit city to city but i think the qualitative takeaway that landlords are savvy and are going to work hard to not lose money on their investments i think is a very general point for economists who already felt confident in the theoretical arguments against rent control research like diamond s provides empirical evidence that essentially tells the same story yes there are some winners in rent control but the losing is more widespread and longer term but how about empirical evidence from a reverse angle that is not when a city adds or expands rent control like san francisco did but when it gets rid of it diamond so there s other work by david autor and coauthors that looks at the removal of rent control in cambridge massachusetts in 1994 by the early 1990s cambridge was one of the few remaining rent control strongholds in massachusetts landlords had been trying to get rid of it for years but there are a lot fewer landlords than there are tenants so any attempt to change the local law was voted down finally the rent control opponents had a winning idea put the issue up on a statewide referendum where there might be less empathy for all those city dwellers with below market rents when the referendum was held nearly 60 percent of the voters in cambridge were opposed but statewide it passed and so cambridge began to deregulate its rents years later a trio of m i t economists examined the effects of removing rent control glaeser okay so the classic paper on this has been written by david autor parag pathak and chris palmer ed glaeser again glaeser it showed that when units were brought out of rent control their owners invested in them so they upped the quality of the units there was more of a supply of higher end housing diamond they find that the rent controlled apartments experience a lot of renovation landlords renovate a lot and that drives up the desirability of living in those apartments also they find that that creates spillovers onto the nearby apartment buildings that they themselves weren t rent controlled glaeser so neighboring apartments became more valued as a result of the end of rent control and the most recent paper has shown that crime has gone down particularly street crime has gone down right after the elimination of rent control in cambridge diamond so it looked like rent control had negative externalities on the neighborhood so what does economic research tell us about rent control there are at least two conclusions which if i m reading it right sort of work against each other the first conclusion is that rent control doesn t help many people for very long in part because it constrains the supply of affordable housing the second conclusion is that just getting rid of rent control does not in and of itself lead to more affordable housing in fact a deregulated housing market can easily lead to less affordable housing the boston cambridge area is one of many places experiencing a steep shortage in not just affordable housing but housing overall so even if you accept that rent control is a big contributor to the affordable housing problem getting rid of it isn t necessarily a solution you can see why politicians and policy makers are confused in massachusetts in fact there s currently a movement to bring back statewide rent control and as we mentioned earlier massachusetts is not alone diamond so we just had this big vote in california about whether we should repeal a statewide law that restricts the scope of rent control in california and indeed we did not repeal that law dubner so somebody read your paper diamond it was interesting to see how our results were used by policy makers and media on both sides of the fight because indeed some of our results are like rent control are good others make them look bad you ve got to read the whole paper and take it all into account to make a decision but it was a very policy relevant paper for that discussion dubner i m curious what you can tell us about the political dimensions of rent control i may be wrong but i believe that rent control is generally supported by democrats and generally opposed by republicans diamond i think it s a simplification to say all democrats support rent control but i think in the short run you can see the benefits of rent control the tenants right away benefit what s much harder to see are these indirect effects that take a long time and it s harder to put your finger on that the losses are spread everywhere a little bit and harder to see walking down the street or talking to your constituents glaeser there certainly are some poor people who can benefit and it s a very tangible benefit right it s not some complicated thing which requires you to trust in the market it s just sort of very clear and if you think that people on the left many of them just don t trust markets to begin with then saying there s going to be some negative market effect to them that sounds like capitalist hocus pocus whereas what they can see right now is that mrs reyes s rents won t go up because of their regulation vicki been economists tend to believe their models and say end of story and believe me right that s vicki been been but communities don t necessarily have to believe economists and so economists need to do a better job of responding to the very real fears that communities have been used to be commissioner of the new york city department of housing preservation and development now she s a law professor at new york university and she directs the furman center for real estate and urban policy been the furman center has embarked on a project that we call not your grandmother s rent control to try to figure out if you were starting from scratch and you were designing the most efficient rent regulation system what would that look like as we ve been hearing economists are generally opposed to rent control it rewards some people but fairly arbitrarily it punishes many others and generally doesn t do much to improve overall access to housing that said most people don t think like economists or even believe them which is why many politicians and members of the public think rent control is a great idea david eisenbach well i m in favor of residential rent control and rent regulations that s david eisenbach he teaches history at columbia university and he recently ran for a citywide office in new york called public advocate there are in new york city about 3 4 million apartment units nearly 1 million of which are rent stabilized and new york s rental market is incredibly expensive as it is in many other cities with regulated rents like san francisco economists argue that overall high prices are a direct consequence of rent regulation what does eisenbach think eisenbach i disagree i mean there are a lot of reasons why real estate in san francisco and real estate in new york are high blaming it on rent stabilization is definitely not it the consequences of getting rid of either rent control and or rent stabilization would be the immediate displacement of a big portion of the population and that would just be cruel at this point i don t know how anybody could justify even somebody looking at it purely in economic terms how anybody could justify that just in human terms you re going to blame the high rents on rent control come on okay so eisenbach does not believe the economic research on rent control what does he believe in eisenbach well first and foremost i m an angry new yorker who walks around the streets of new york and sees empty storefront after empty storefront and just feels like my city is dying new york s commercial rents have spiked along with its residential rents and in some parts of manhattan as much as 20 percent of the retail space is either vacant or soon to be vacant eisenbach and i found out that there is this bill called the small business jobs survival act it was initially submitted back in the 1980 s and i figured why don t i run for office pushing this bill and so i ran for public advocate on the platform we re going to pass this bill it s going to save small business in new york city we should say that eisenbach did not win the election he came in 13th in a field of 17 but he did get a fair amount of attention for talking about all those empty storefronts which have upset a lot of people eisenbach there are two major provisions of the small business jobs survival act one it guarantees a 10 year lease renewal offer from the landlord to the tenant for any tenant with a commercial lease in new york city number two if the landlord and tenant cannot come to an agreement they go to legally binding arbitration and that arbitrator then will pick a fair market rent which will then be charged in the next 10 year lease renewal opponents of this proposal call it commercial rent control eisenbach but this bill the small business jobs survival act is absolutely not rent control it doesn t put a limit on how much rent can be charged which is the very definition of rent control it s legally binding arbitration much different dubner are there other cities that have this kind of small business jobs protection on the real estate front that works well eisenbach it s going to be unique even though eisenbach lost his election he still believes the small business jobs survival act may get through new york s city council i was interested to know what the economists we ve been speaking with rebecca diamond of stanford and ed glaeser of harvard what they thought about commercial rent regulation diamond so i m also very interested in that and i also know almost nothing about it i have never seen any work on it glaeser you can easily tell a story where the threat of some form of rent control makes a vacancy problem worse in the short run so for example i don t want to rent right now to a lower end tenant who could fill my space because i ll be locked in by the rent control law and i ve got that tenant forever so that means i m going to really hold out for a blue chip tenant because i have this threat of this law over my shoulder so do i think vacant empty storefronts are a problem sure i mean we can talk about it from a perspective merely as an urbanist where we think it s unattractive to have these things but i m also disturbed by it as an economist because someone s got space to sell there are people who want to buy that space why isn t the transaction happening right it s sort of the market is going awry and the answer to that of why the market is going awry is not immediately obvious there are of course plenty of theories as to why so many storefronts in new york are vacant here again is vicki been the former housing official who studies the real estate market at nyu been i think there are a lot of questions about how commercial rent regulation would work and how it might interfere with an efficient market one concern that i would have right now is we seem to be in the middle of an upset of a transition in retail in general because of the availability of internet retail a lot is in flux glaeser but there are two points of evidence against that one of which is that many of these storefronts formerly held services and i don t think a nail salon has been made obsolete by amazon just yet and secondly the rents the asking rents at least according to the most recent real estate board of new york report in many of these areas are still sky high it s not like there s no demand for areas where you re charging 300 400 per square foot to rent these areas in the long term all the economic push for both the landlords and the tenants is to get those units occupied and get the rent payments again flowing to the landlord landlords whether small or large are often left out of public discussions about property markets and if they re not left out they re usually drawn as villains vicki been in thinking about the project she calls not your grandmother s rent control is trying to change that been i think the thing that you really need to focus on is how can i ensure that the landlord is getting a reasonable return right because otherwise people will take their money and put it elsewhere and you won t get building and how can we at the same time try to close some of these avenues that landlords could use to try to escape rent regulation without it becoming a system that s so weighed down with so many different enforcement challenges that it kind of collapses of its own weight right you need to pay attention to the different ways in which property owners are making money on the property so you really need to have a holistic look at the same time you need to have very open eyes view of the kinds of costs that we re imposing on them there s one huge cost that drives real estate prices whether we re talking about rentals or sales for both commercial and residential buildings been in new york city for example a very high percentage of rent goes for property taxes so we can t be saying to landlords hey keep prices down but by the way your property tax just went up by 10 percent so we have to recognize that okay we as a taxpaying body have an obligation to understand the effect that those increases may have on rents and we can t just turn around and say to the landlord you absorb them right don t pass them onto the tenant because that s an unsustainable system glaeser it s certainly true that renters implicitly have to pay for property taxes and it s not obvious that s wrong because the idea of property taxes is they re paying for city services and renters use city services too that s obviously not wrong dubner so here s a big question that i really hope you can answer because i ve wondered this for a long time some of the biggest property owners in a city like new york and some of the wealthiest property holders generally are universities religious institutions hospitals and other not for profit institutions which makes them either partially or wholly exempt from paying property taxes so i m curious how does that exemption affect a the taxes paid by everyone else and how does that b ultimately affect housing prices for everyone glaeser first of all clearly you re right the government has decided to subsidize certain institutions by enabling them not to pay property taxes and from a purely accounting point of view those taxes need to come from somewhere else on the other hand it is also true that at least some of the institutions that you re talking about have proven to be extraordinarily important for the economic health of the area right we re subsidizing the university student right we re making it cheaper for them to rent than it would be otherwise is that fair well we thought that somehow or other it was a good idea to subsidize educational institutions at one point in time we thought there might be some spillovers from that some benefits from encouraging people to become educated but we should be open to re investigating that and anyway you shouldn t take my word for it because after all i m the employee of an educational institution we can ask whether or not the blanket property tax exemption that we ve given to religious institutions and educational institutions is appropriate i mean that seems like a reasonable question to ask in the case of religious institutions it in some sense goes back to fundamental issues about separation of church and state in the u s but we can still ask this question i would be surprised if we think that changing those tax rates is the number one step to take to promote affordability in new york city though relative to bringing more space on market that you can actually build on changing the regulations i mean it seems like that s not likely to be the case but it is true that you move stuff to a religious or educational use in many cases you re moving away from an owner who would actually build on it and that s also correct so what have we learned about housing especially affordable housing especially in the most desirable cities for starters we ve learned that it s complicated property taxes play a large underappreciated role in driving up costs and the tax burden isn t necessarily spread so equitably rent regulations meanwhile appeal to the public and politicians but they also create perverse incentives that in the long run work against affordable housing how about housing vouchers aren t they a more flexible way to subsidize housing been the advantage of a voucher is you can go through all of those eligibility requirements and really target the voucher to the families that you think are most in need and we in new york and in many other major cities we have prohibitions against a landlord refusing a tenant because they re using a voucher rather than earned income but we re still getting enormous resistance from landlords because if you have a federal government that shuts down and isn t paying its voucher payments and there the landlord is stuck with that right or if you have a city like new york city did that issued vouchers and then changed its mind and said oops that program is over then the landlord has a tenant in place who no longer can pay the rent and the landlord has to take them to court and bear the costs of that meanwhile the market price of housing in a place like manhattan lies somewhere between punitive and prohibitive so if rent control isn t a viable tool in the fight for affordable housing what is glaeser the most natural tool towards affordability is supply and to make sure that we are making it easy enough to build moderate cost rental apartment buildings in these cities ed glaeser again glaeser we ve used regulations to so restrict our ability to provide affordable housing units that now we re at this restricted frozen in amber form in the case of new york gosh new york is new york it s hard to imagine how much housing you d really need to sate demand for new york dubner what about boston where you live boston is facing what it calls a historic housing shortage the city s growing not enough housing to match what do you suggest boston do to accommodate that surge other than let the market work its famous magic glaeser look drive around boston it doesn t look overcrowded to me and i don t think it should look overcrowded to anyone else there s a lot of vacant industrial space that could easily house tens of thousands of units if you made it easy enough to build i ve got to think that this is a doable problem at least from an engineering and economics point of view the politics of course are more difficult dubner what specifically would need to be done to change it glaeser so the big answer is you need as of right zoning that enables fairly high density levels over a fair amount of space so currently boston s zoning plan is highly antiquated every project is handled on an ad hoc basis usually it involves variances that are quite high from the original plan which means that they are highly subject to judicial challenge all of that is a recipe for uncertainty and delay and endless community meetings the thing that works best is when you have something where you ve decided in advance this is how much we re going to allow to build there are a couple of simple rules that you ve got to follow come here bring your units and make it happen and that s what s needed that s what actually works it s not something that involves a 10 year negotiation process but something that says here are the rules upfront go to it it should be noted that not all u s cities impose the same level of red tape you see in boston and new york and san francisco glaeser if you want to look for affordability the american sunbelt is pretty great the atlantas the houstons the dallases the places that just have made it very easy to build over the last 40 years you want to ask why atlanta dallas houston phoenix each added a million people between 2000 and 2010 as metro areas it s because they make it astonishingly easy to build and you can go and you can buy a great looking house for a fraction of what you d pay in new york in these places we don t have an affordable housing crisis in the u s nationally we have lots of affordable housing in places with names like atlanta but just not in new york city many european cities meanwhile are more like new york in fact exaggerated versions of new york glaeser much of europe is quite restrictive in your cities but i m much more comfortable about the idea that much of central paris is patrimony of the world that needs to be protected while policies vary from city to city and country to country almost all major european cities have rent control glaeser sweden of course is the place where assar lindbeck the famous economist and although he was market oriented he certainly skewed to the left assar famously said that short of bombing i know of no way to destroy a city that was more effective than rent control and he certainly had stockholm in mind tommy andersson right now there are around 10 million people living in sweden around 550 000 of these people were standing in a queue waiting for an apartment in stockholm that is 5 percent of the swedish population that s the economist tommy andersson andersson i am a professor at lund university which is located in the south of sweden i focus on an area called market design sweden has nationwide rent control andersson the rental system in sweden is based on collective bargaining so according to the swedish law there is a union called the swedish union of tenants and their job is essentially to negotiate the rents for tenants and it s based on something which is called the utility value which essentially means that if you have two comparable apartments they should have the same rents another objective that they have is that they should keep the rents low the rents cannot be increased by too much if you ve been listening closely it may not surprise you to learn that this system has led to a housing shortage andersson because people will not invest in new buildings unless they can get good returns so if you look at this report written by the national board of housing building and planning from 2016 they estimated that sweden needs around 440 000 new homes before 2020 and that s not going to happen this shortage is what can lead to long lines to get an apartment especially in the more desirable places how long do you have to wait in stockholm andersson you have to wait for 10 or 20 or even 30 years to get an apartment right now if you would sign up today what if you don t want to wait 10 or 20 or 30 years for an apartment andersson so there are no official figures because it s a black market but it s clear that there exists a black market you can get an apartment in several different ways so one of them is essentially to buy a contract with black money you can also bribe someone in charge of allocating available apartments to get the better position in the queue and another thing which is popular is these fake swaps so you re allowed by law to swap apartments with other persons so you re just pretending that you are swapping apartments but essentially you re not in the old days what i had heard and i must stress that i don t have any scientific evidence of this but apparently black contracts used to cost around 10 percent of the market value but in recent years it has actually grown to say 20 percent of the market value of the apartment so it s expensive to buy a black contract you know it s always a risk to be involved in this business because even if you paid the money it s not clear that you will get the apartment simply because i mean there are criminal gangs involved in this as well that doesn t sound like what the designers of the swedish rental system were going for but the housing market in stockholm is so bad that even business leaders there have risen up in protest andersson the c e o and the founder of spotify in 2016 he wrote an open letter to the people of sweden saying that unless you solve this housing situation in stockholm spotify may consider moving its headquarters out of stockholm simply because we cannot find housing for our future employees if policy makers can t figure out smarter ways to encourage more affordable housing you can expect to see this kind of

the managing director of the international monetary fund christine largarde warned on tuesday that the prospects for the global economy were precarious in a speech delivered ahead of the imf s annual spring meeting next week where it will issue its world economic outlook lagarde indicated that the forecast for global growth already downgraded in january would be further lowered because the world economy had lost further momentum and slid into a synchronised deceleration only two years ago 75 percent of the global economy experienced an upswing she said for this year we expected 70 percent of the global economy to experience a slowdown in growth she added that while the imf did not expect a recession in the near term the global economy was unsettled and in a delicate moment and that any upturn in growth would be precarious her remarks underscored the extent to which the global economy and financial markets have become ever more dependent on the inflow of ultra cheap money from the world s central banks which have started to reverse their return to a more normal policy the us federal reserve has made clear it does not expect to raise interest rates this year after indicating at least two rises for 2019 as recently as last december and the european central bank announced some limited monetary stimulus at its most recent meeting lagarde warned that should there be a sharper than expected tightening of financial conditions it could create serious challenges for many governments and companies in terms of refinancing and debt service which could amplify exchange rate movements and financial market corrections the low interest rate regime of the past decade which the central banks have been incapable of ending had created problems in meeting any significant downturn or recession the reality is that many economies are not resilient enough high public debt and low interest rates have left limited room to act when the next downturn comes which inevitably it will lagarde said the latest report from the world trade organisation also points to a significant slowdown in global growth reflected in its predictions for trade releasing the forecast on tuesday the director general of the wto roberto azevêdo said that in 2017 trade growth stood at 4 6 percent at that point we were somewhat optimistic there was renewed dynamism and momentum in global trade since then leading indicators have shown momentum weakening particularly towards the end of last year trade had underperformed last year with growth of 3 per cent and we expected even more modest growth in 2019 at just 2 6 percent azevêdo said there were a number of elements involved but rising trade tensions were the major factor trade simply cannot play its full role in driving gdp growth when levels of uncertainty are so high greater uncertainty means lower investment and consumption investment in particular has a pronounced impact on trade the slowing of the world economy is most pronounced in europe where manufacturing indexes regarded as a reliable indicator of the state of the economy as a whole dropped sharply in march a widely followed purchasing managers index for the euro zone fell to 47 5 for march down from 49 3 in february with a level below 50 indicating a contraction it was the biggest drop in nearly six years the most significant downturn is in germany the biggest economy in the euro zone where the purchasing managers index for march dropped to its lowest point in seven years the wall street journal reported that germany s mechanical engineering industry association halved its forecast for growth this year to 1 percent pointing to the trade conflict between the us and china as the reason the journal cited the head of an italian auto supplier who warned of a bloodbath for manufacturers in europe this year the bloodbath has in fact already begun mass layoffs are underway at european and us auto plants indicating that the ruling classes intend to impose the full burden of the downturn in the global economy on the backs of the working class the official position in the us is that growth is on track to record levels of between two and three percent but movements in financial markets are pointing to a significant downturn if not recession one of the most significant is the inversion of the yield curve where the interest rate on long term treasury bonds falls below the rates on short term debt this is regarded as an indicator of recession as investors seek a safe haven putting their money in long term bonds driving up the price and lowering the yield another indication is the call last week by white house national economic council director larry kudlow for the fed to cut its interest rate by 0 5 percentage points the fed responded to the financial market turbulence last december by shelving its planned interest rate rises for this year and winding up its planned reduction of the financial assets it purchased during quantitative easing leaving the fed holding 3 5 trillion worth of bonds compared to about 800 billion before the 2008 financial crisis but the trump administration views these actions as insufficient in calling for the rate cut kudlow said it had to be undertaken as a precaution i don t want any threats to the recovery he said i m aware of the inversion of the yield curve and i m aware of the rest of the world s weak economy it speaks volumes about the underlying situation in the us and global economy that the present fed rate of between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent one of the lowest levels in history is regarded as a threat to growth this is indicative of the extent to which the entire economy has become dependent on the inflow of cheap money this money has not been used to finance an expansion in production rather it has been deployed in the very kinds of financial speculation and parasitism that led to the financial crisis more than a decade ago creating the conditions for another meltdown evidence of such speculation was revealed in an interview with the financial times this week with jonathon levine co managing partner of bain capital a global private equity group involved in takeovers bain said that increasingly aggressive projected benefits from mergers and acquisitions were masking the real scale of borrowing and heightening the risk of a crash in this sector bain indicated that people were using complex jargon to exaggerate cost savings for companies involved in mergers leading to soaring debt levels based on over inflated projections as the layoffs already taking place make clear the outcome of this parasitic and in some cases criminal activity will be intensified attacks on the jobs and social conditions of the working class

results may vary from these estimates see forward looking information in this press release for additional details 2018 overview and outlook in canada the 2018 drilling activity tracked 2017 levels for much of the year continued volatile commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas as a result of record high oil price differentials due to ongoing pipeline constraints continued to negatively impact the drilling industry by decreasing producer confidence and corresponding capital budgets while the corporation is cautiously optimistic for 2019 it does not anticipate a significant recovery in canadian activity from 2018 the corporation expects canadian oil and gas producers will continue to be faced with the challenge of exporting their products due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure and continued customer spending constraints relative to historical levels drilling rig division 2018 marked the corporation s first full calendar year of operations for its drilling rig division the drilling rig division continued its q4 2017 positive momentum with an annual adjusted 2018 ebitda of 3 060 and q4 2018 adjusted ebitda of 1 423 rig utilization continued to improve from q2 2018 as rig 5 and rig 6 were moved from saskatchewan to alberta upgraded and redeployed in september rig 6 and december rig 5 of 2018 the corporation continues to maintain a strong balance sheet at december 31 2018 the corporation s total debt to ebitda as defined in the corporation s lending agreement was 0 80 to 1 management believes this provides the corporation flexibility to execute on strategic acquisitions and opportunities that align with the corporation s growth plan during 2018 the corporation continued its growth plan with the following highlights on january 19 2018 the corporation acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of d2 drilling inc a private corporation which owned one heavy telescopic double drilling rig and additional drilling equipment in the weyburn estevan area of southeast saskatchewan the corporation issued 6 667 common shares of the corporation at a deemed price of 0 45 per common share and a cash payment of 530 equal to d2 s working capital at the time of closing for total consideration of approximately 3 000 on may 24 2018 the corporation completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of red dog drilling inc red dog used in connection with red dog s drilling rig operations consisting of two heavy telescopic double drilling rigs one cantilever triple drilling rig and one cantilever double drilling rig pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated may 10 2018 between red dog and the corporation the corporation acquired the red dog assets for a purchase price of 5 511 which was paid as follows i the issuance of 1 573 common shares at a deemed price of 0 33 per common share valued at 519 and ii 4 992 cash for vendor debt repayment on july 25 2018 the corporation announced it s u s subsidiary had entered into a management consulting contract with randy hawkings with the objective of mr hawkings advising the corporation regarding existing operations and growth strategies in the u s and internationally mr hawkings is a seasoned corporate executive with considerable experience as ceo president most recently he was consulting for trinidad drilling ltd trinidad in the usa and prior thereto he held the position of executive vice president us operations for trinidad before the acquisition of canelson drilling inc canelson by trinidad in 2015 mr hawkings was a founder president and ceo of canelson the corporation also made significant capital investments in 2018 to upgrade and relocate two rigs from saskatchewan to alberta both alberta rigs have been highly utilized since relocation and are expected to have similar utilization in 2019 the corporation intends to continue its strategic plan of geographical diversification of its business and purchasing high quality assets that have the capability to service a large portion of the anticipated drilling in the wcsb while providing and economics required by our customers and the equipment and resources required by our employees to operate safely and efficiently and at the same time providing an appropriate rate of return management believes the corporation is well positioned to capture new customer demand while growing with its current customer base and continues to improve the corporation s strong safety culture the corporation now has 11 drilling rigs consisting of nine complementary heavy telescopic double drilling rigs one cantilever triple drilling rig and one cantilever double drilling rig the corporation currently only markets its nine heavy telescopic double drilling rigs directional drilling division early in 2018 with the appointment of mr lyle whitmarsh as president and chief executive officer management began a thorough analysis of the directional drilling division in an effort to improve its performance and profitability as a result the corporation resized the directional drilling division in january 2018 by reducing its headcount and related expenses to align with forecasted activity in western canada for its directional drilling services with further reduced capital budgets within its directional drilling customer base in 2018 the directional drilling division recorded an annual adjusted ebitda loss of 1 284 and a q4 2018 adjusted ebitda loss of 337 the directional drilling division also recorded an impairment write down of 1 955 in q4 2018 2017 3 833 due to continued directional drilling losses since q1 2015 and management s thorough review of the directional drilling division including the consideration of potential implications of all available options management and the board of directors determined that both significant capital investment which could not be projected to meet the corporation s investment criteria and major macroeconomic changes which the corporation cannot project happening in the near future in western canada would be required in order to see a path to profitability for the division therefore the board of directors has approved discontinuing directional drilling operations starting in q2 2019 in connection with the cessation of the directional drilling division the corporation announces the departure of mr charlie lloyd vice president sales the board of directors thanks mr lloyd for his valuable contribution to the corporation and wishes him well in his future endeavors in addition mr rob van bostelen vice president operations has resigned from his position as an officer of the corporation but is continuing as an employee assisting the corporation in closing the directional division this was a very difficult decision but it is the right decision for matrrix with the full support of the corporation s board of directors we have determined that it is in the best interest of the corporation to discontinue the directional drilling division and focus on driving growth and profitability in our drilling rig division we would like to thank all the staff for their dedication and hard work said

nike popoola and femi asu the international monetary fund has urged the federal government to eliminate tax incentives and reform value added tax as part of efforts to stimulate economic growth the imf said on wednesday that its executive board concluded the 2019 article iv consultation with nigeria on march 27 2019 nigeria s economy is recovering real gdp increased by 1 9 per cent in 2018 up from 0 8 per cent in 2017 on the back of improvements in manufacturing and services supported by spillovers from higher oil prices ongoing convergence in exchange rates and strides to improve the business environment it said the washington based fund noted that headline inflation fell to 11 4 per cent at the end 2018 reflecting declining food price inflation weak consumer demand a relatively stable exchange rate and tight monetary policy during most of 2018 but remained outside of the central bank s target range of six to nine per cent it said record holdings of mostly short term local debt and equity and a current account surplus lifted gross international reserves to a peak in april 2018 while the three times oversubscribed november 2018 eurobond helped cushion the impact of outflows later in the year however persisting structural and policy challenges continue to constrain growth to levels below those needed to reduce vulnerabilities lessen poverty and improve weak human development outcomes such as in health and education the imf said according to it a large infrastructure gap low revenue mobilisation governance and institutional weaknesses continued foreign exchange restrictions and banking sector vulnerabilities are dampening long term foreign and domestic investment and keeping the economy reliant on volatile oil prices and production the fund said under current policies the outlook remains therefore muted over the medium term absent strong structural reforms growth would hover around 2½ per cent implying no per capita growth as the economy faces limited increases in oil production and insufficient adjustment four years after the oil price shock monetary policy focused on exchange rate stability would help contain inflation but worsen competitiveness if greater flexibility is not accommodated when needed the imf executive directors said long standing structural and policy challenges needed to be tackled more decisively to reduce vulnerabilities raise per capita growth and bring down poverty they therefore urged the nigerian authorities to redouble their reform efforts while supporting their intention to accelerate the implementation of their economic recovery and growth plan the fund said the directors emphasised the need for revenue based consolidation to lower the ratio of interest payments to revenue and make room for priority expenditure it said they welcomed the authorities tax reform plan to increase non oil revenue including through tax policy and administration measures they stressed the importance of strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation including through additional excises a comprehensive vat reform and elimination of tax incentives the directors said securing oil revenues through reforms of state owned enterprises and measures to improve the governance of the oil sector would also be crucial they welcomed the significant increase in public investment but underlined the need for greater investment efficiency the imf said they also recommended increasing funding for health and education they noted that phasing out implicit fuel subsidies while strengthening social safety nets to mitigate the impact on the most vulnerable would help reduce the poverty gap and free up additional fiscal space read also police arrest prison officers for plotting inmates escape they recommended stronger coordination for more effective public debt and cash management the directors also stressed that the elimination of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices would remove distortions and facilitate economic diversification they welcomed the decline in non performing loans and the improved prudential banking ratios but noted that restructured loans and undercapitalised banks continue to weigh on financial sector performance the imf suggested strengthening capital buffers and risk based supervision conducting an asset quality review avoiding regulatory forbearance and revamping the banking resolution framework the directors also recommended establishing a credible time bound recapitalisation plan for weak banks and a timeline for phasing out the state backed asset management corporation of nigeria it said with inflation still above the central bank target the directors generally considered that a tight monetary policy stance is appropriate copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on this website may not be reproduced published broadcast rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part without prior express written permission from punch

by vicente morin aguado havana times from the pages of the new york times carmelo mesa lago a cuban economist and professor at the university of pittsburgh recently published an opinion piece with his political proposal for the economy of subversive implications we asked mesa the most prolific of economists dedicated to the cuban reality several clarifications about his brief but forceful article which we post below he notes that despite the staggering subsidies of foreign aid received first from the soviet union and later from venezuela the performance of the economy has been depressing ht subsidies from a foreign power vs the embargo which of these factors weighs more on the balance of the disaster carmelo mesa lago this question is difficult to answer if the official cuban figures for the cost of the embargo are used it would be higher but those calculations are not reliable twenty five years ago the embargo was a very serious problem for cuba because it was isolated in the western hemisphere but cuba now has trade with at least 80 countries including the us as well as investments from multiple nations the embargo still causes damage such as sanctions against international banks that carry out transactions with the state but the fundamental cause of the problems has been cuba s inability to generate enough exports to finance essential imports the subsidies of the ussr were very beneficial because the soviets paid between four and eleven times the price of sugar on the world market twice the price for nickel and sold oil to cuba at a price lower than the world market between 1960 and 1990 these price subsidies represented us 39 36 billion non reimbursable in total including credits to cover deficits in the trade balance and direct investments cuba received 65 billion of which it paid only 500 million so in those 30 years the soviet subsidies were greater than the cost of the embargo in the case of venezuela that government pays cuban doctors seven times the salary of a venezuelan doctor in the public sector that is there is a hidden subsidy regarding the cost of oil supplied by this country ht if we talk about reforms mother earth is the origin of every economy right now there are people who sleep at the doors of some stores waiting for the next opening so as not to miss the few and expensive foods that are sold cml farmers must obligatorily sell to the state about 70 of their harvests at a price that the government sets below the market price in china and vietnam the farmer decides what to plant to whom to sell and sets the price there are no limits to the investment and the land contracts are for 50 years or for an indefinite period these incentives explain how in relatively few years both asian countries are self sufficient in food and especially vietnam generate a surplus to export it is the second world exporter of rice and sells 250 000 tons to cuba a country that imports around us 1 500 billion of food per year most of which could be produced in the country ht speaking of foreign investments how does the silenced clamor to be able to pay the workers their full salary in hard currency influence cml foreign investors are not allowed to hire and pay their employees directly nor can they fire them this is done through a cuban state agency and discourages both foreign investment and workers since the relationship between effort and remuneration is weakened ht another key factor regarding the essential promotion of foreign investments you said is in the monetary unification could you clarify for several reasons 1 the monetary duality does not allow us to identify which companies are productive and which are not and the same happens with the profitability of exports 2 duality generates distortions that affect the entire economy 3 while in the state economy the exchange is 1 cuc 1 cup among the population the change is 1 cuc 25 cup 4 in addition workers receive their salaries in national pesos cup but they have to buy most products in convertible pesos cuc ht with about 40 books dedicated entirely to his homeland the pittsburgh professor makes an urgent call to change which collides with the arteriosclerosis of the ruling elite and even with the newly endorsed constitutional scaffolding cml unlike china and vietnam who recognized that the private sector is an important driver of growth the ideological reasoning in cuba behind these absurd limitations is to avoid a concentration of property and wealth the market socialism model of china and vietnam under the communist party government could actually provide a way forward the new york times opinion there s only one way out for cuba s dismal economy the island s economy is neither efficient nor competitive to move forward it must deepen and accelerate reforms the market socialism model could provide a way by carmelo mesa lago professor mesa lago is an expert on cuba s economy march 28 2019 for the past 60 years cuba has been unable to finance its imports with its own exports and generate appropriate sustainable growth without substantial aid and subsidies from a foreign nation this is the longstanding legacy of cuba s socialist economy the island s economic dependence began with spain in the colonial era continued with the united states during the first republic and expanded significantly with the soviet union and finally with venezuela in the current century between 1960 and 1990 the soviet union gave cuba 65 billion triple the total amount of aid that president john kennedy s alliance for progress gave latin america at its peak in 2012 venezuelan aid subsidies and investment amounted to or close to 12 percent of the gross domestic product and yet despite the staggering foreign aid subsidies it has received the economy s performance has been dismal in the past seven years growth has been a third of the officially set figure needed for adequate and sustainable growth while investment has been one third of the required rate industrial mining and sugar production are well below 1989 levels and the production of 11 out of 13 key agricultural and fishing products has declined cuba is now facing its worst economic crisis since the 1990s tourism has been a bright spot for cuba from 2007 to 2017 visitors to the island doubled largely thanks to the arrival of more americans whose numbers grew considerably after president barack obama eased diplomatic relations in 2015 but hurricane irma and the tightening of travel restrictions by president trump like barring american tourists from using hotels and restaurants run by cuba s military and the alert declared by the administration after the sonic attacks on united states diplomats in havana led to a drop in tourism during the end of 2017 and the first half of 2018 tourism rebounded in september driven by a cruise industry that offers customers lodging meals and tours those visitors spend about 14 percent of what those arriving by air spend since the revolution cuba has run a large annual fiscal deficit in its merchandise trade but since the start of the century it has benefited from a surplus on the services balance because of the growth in exports of medical and teaching services sold mainly to venezuela this surplus exceeded the deficit in the merchandise trade but as venezuela s economy weakened the cuban surplus decreased drastically in addition venezuela s oil supply halved and overall trade fell by 27 percent cuba s woes are a result of the inefficient economic model of centralized planning state enterprises and agricultural collectivization its leaders have pursued despite the failure of these models worldwide in his decade in power president raúl castro tried to face his brother fidel s legacy of economic disaster head on by enacting a series of market oriented economic structural reforms he also opened the door to foreign investment but so far the amount materialized has been one fifth of the goal set by the leadership for sustainable development unfortunately the pace of reforms has been slow and subject to many restrictions disincentives and taxes that have impeded the advance of the private economy and desperately needed growth it is time to abandon this failed model and shift to a more successful one as in china and vietnam in 2018 miguel díaz canel the first of a new generation of leaders born after the revolution took office trapped by mr castro s program he has promised continuity the new constitution approved on feb 24 through a referendum doesn t introduce any significant change to its prevailing model of centralized planning and state dominance over the means of production and land the only way out of the hole for cuba would be to accelerate and deepen reforms china and vietnam s market socialism model under communist party rule could provide a way forward but opposition persists from the old guard who are now well into their 80s but still hold key positions in the party and in the government poor agricultural production the result of collectivized agriculture causes the island to spend 1 5 billion a year on food imports as part of his agrarian reform mr castro began leasing fallow state owned land to farmers through 10 year contracts now increased to 20 years that may be canceled or renewed depending on the farms performance farmers must sell most of their crops to the government at prices set by the state which are below market prices the chinese and vietnamese reforms granted farmers land for 50 years or for an indefinite period of time and allowed the farmers to sell their products to whomever they wanted at prices set by supply and demand in a few years both countries achieved food self sufficiency and exported the surplus particularly vietnam which sells cuba 250 000 tons of rice annually that could be produced domestically if cuba were to introduce this type of reform it would solve the chronic food shortage while eliminating imports around 13 percent of the country s work force is self employed it generates 12 percent of the g d p through activities like providing lodging and dining services to foreign tourists but the government has imposed serious restrictions and suspended certain types of licenses and businesses are taxed according to the number of employees they hire the ideological reasoning behind these absurd limitations are to avoid a concentration of property and wealth conversely china and vietnam recognized that the private sector is an important driver of growth if reform is carried out and foreign investors are allowed to hire and pay a full salary directly to their employees there will be a significant improvement in the economy and the government can undertake the desperately needed monetary unification that will attract more investment and eliminate the economic distortions that plague the economy carmelo mesa lago is a professor emeritus of economics and latin american studies at the university of pittsburgh he has published some 45 books on cuba most recently voices of change in cuba

says world bank puts bangladesh among 5 fastest growing economies projects 7 3pc growth in fy2018 19 bangladesh needs to come up with reforms at the earliest to sustain the growth momentum which has landed it among the five fastest growing economies in the world the world bank said yesterday the washington based multilateral lender tipped the bangladesh economy to grow at 7 3 percent this fiscal year which however is lower than the prediction of the government 8 13 percent and the asian development bank 8 percent as per the wb projection only four countries other than bangladesh will achieve more than 7 percent economic growth this year they are india 7 5 percent bhutan 7 6 percent rwanda 7 8 percent and ethiopia 8 8 percent and yet bangladesh faces several short and long term development challenges the wb said in its spring 2019 edition of the bangladesh development update one of the immediate challenges is to address the issues of banking sector vulnerabilities revenue shortfall and pressure on foreign exchange reserves according to the report unveiled at the wb office in dhaka yesterday the banking sector is struggling with non performing loans and private sector credit growth has slowed down too wb country director robert j saum said while unveiling the report with a special focus on regulatory predictability high non performing loans npls compounded by an eroding capital base continue to pose financial stability risks the wb said directed lending poor risk management and weak corporate governance stemming from lack of enforcement and regulatory independence lead to the rise in npls at the end of last year the banking sector s total npls stood at tk 93 911 crore up 26 38 percent year on year according to bangladesh bank data at the same time the practice of loan rescheduling and write offs also increased putting further stress on banks last year the central bank approved loan rescheduling of tk 20 000 crore despite these wholesale approvals of loan rescheduling default loans are increasing the report said last week finance minister ahm mustafa kamal announced an easy loan rescheduling scheme for defaulters from may 1 the defaulters will be able to reschedule their loans for 12 years by making 2 percent down payment of the total dues at present defaulters can reschedule their loans for at most 3 years by providing 10 to 15 percent down payment speaking at the programme zahid hussain lead economist at the wb s dhaka office said frequent and wholesale rescheduling of bad loans is not sustainable for banks we will end up killing the goose that lays the golden eggs if the goose dies then where will further rescheduling and fresh loans come from he noted in its report the wb called for tightening regulation on loan rescheduling and stopping special rescheduling it also recommended ensuring true autonomy of the bb as the sole regulator of the financial sector and also full regulatory oversight on the state owned banks the wb country director said another matter of worry for bangladesh is that the domestic revenue mobilisation was well behind the target so far this year in the first six months of fiscal 2018 19 the revenue growth was only 6 4 percent higher than the corresponding period of the previous year the smallest in recent memory the report mentioned about slow revenue growth zahid said how will development expenditure be increased for higher growth without increasing the revenue the report also highlighted the pressure on the exchange rate which can pose a macroeconomic risk the foreign exchange reserves have been stagnant for a while which was not the case before zahid said and yet bangladesh s growth outlook remains stable and strong thanks to the stable macroeconomic front and export oriented industry led growth according to the wb report sound macroeconomic policies such as keeping the budget deficit below 5 percent of the gdp and resilient domestic demand have led to growth in manufacturing and construction industries on the supply side it said on the demand side growth is led by private consumption and exports after a modest performance last year export earnings and remittances have bounced back helping the rural economy to grow faster in addition the country has substantially improved its electricity generation and a bumper agricultural harvest has further stimulated growth the wb pointed out however sustaining the rapid economic growth will require significant reforms including increasing the predictability of regulation measures are needed to address several challenges particularly in boosting private investment and diversifying exports the wb country director said reform initiatives are also required to continue bangladesh s extraordinary trajectory of reducing extreme poverty which fell from 31 5 percent in 2010 to 24 3 percent in 2017 despite strong progress some of the drivers of poverty reduction appear to be weakening he mentioned in this context bangladesh has shown remarkable generosity in sheltering and providing for the basic needs of nearly one million rohingya in two of the poorest upazilas in cox s bazar saum said the wb report mentioned that bangladesh will require huge investments in physical and human capital and also in innovation to become an upper middle income country by 2031 and achieve high income country status by 2041 any reform effort requires a clear strategy political champions supported by a capable reform team and well established consultation and coordination mechanisms to ensure a high level of coordination among all relevant stakeholders it added
this article first appeared in forum the edge malaysia weekly on april 1 2019 april 7 2019 for the last several decades we have been haunted by the fear of financial crises and the widening income and wealth disparities what is perhaps even more disturbing is to learn that these two undesirables reinforce each other in other words it is a vicious cycle of income and wealth disparities and financial crisis the 2008 financial crisis provides ample empirical evidence to show that income and wealth disparities can contribute to financial crisis described in a stylised way it works like this poor families with stagnant or falling income resort to borrowing in order to make both ends meet when the value of real estate properties seems to keep rising credit standards weaken and banks are only too willing to oblige their borrowers who use their houses as collateral the party comes to an abrupt end when the real estate bubble bursts potentially leaving some borrowers with negative equity what is empirically true for many countries may not be true for all countries it is possible that income and wealth disparities in a certain country may not lead to financial crisis those in the lower income group can have income high enough to enjoy a comfortable life especially when the state runs well funded welfare schemes the journey made by income and wealth disparities to financial crisis is through the medium of building up of excessive debts when borrowers cannot service their debts on a massive scale the financial system suffers a meltdown we are here making a case that income and wealth disparities is a factor in the last global financial crisis moreover we wish to argue that the reverse is also true financial crisis leads to greater income and wealth disparities in the following ways in the wake of financial crisis unemployment increases and those affected may have to sell their assets for example property or securities at a discount individuals and businesses that are over leveraged are forced to conduct a fire sale of their assets it is a buying opportunity for the rich the result is widening income and wealth gap following the last financial crisis many governments have embarked on loose monetary policy to stimulate demand and growth these took the unconventional form of quantitative easing conventional loosening of monetary policy takes the form of lowering short term interest rates which works and flows through normal credit channels quantitative easing policy works more through the asset price channel where central banks buy public and private debt to push down long term rates to facilitate bank lending to boost economic activity and to encourage purchase of and investment in riskier financial assets as yields on long term securities plunge and asset price surges super low interest rates encourage companies private equity hedge funds and the rich to borrow even more to invest in financial assets sending prices even higher initially these borrowings are more likely to be used to purchase productive assets and investments that boost the economy in the late cycle however corporations borrow not to invest in production but in stock buybacks and mergers and acquisitions at higher premiums given that more dollars are available to chase fewer deals the rise in debt and equity transactions generated generous fees for wall street from bankers to traders fund managers and private equity investors while all this has not spurred productive investments to the levels intended it has stoked the fires of financial markets sending the bond and equity markets to pre 2008 financial crisis highs meanwhile incomes of the majority of population stagnated or rose marginally low and negative interest rates redistribute wealth from savers to borrowers and issuers of debt only the rich and those able to access loans were able to participate in the financial rally kevin wash former federal reserve board member said quantitative easing as a policy works purely through an asset price channel enriching the few who own stocks and other financial products and not the majority whose earnings come from wages this was echoed by richard fischer a former president of federal reserve bank of dallas who called quantitative easing a massive gift to the elites of the financial world these statements are corroborated by evidence on stock ownership in the uk which became more concentrated after the crisis between 2006 and 2012 according to a report by standard and poor s in 2016 share ownership of the top 1 of households rose 20 points to 53 from 32 while that of the bottom 90 dropped 9 points from 25 to 14 the takeaway is that the attempts of central banks in many developed countries to overcome financial crisis and to reflate the economy through the monetary policy of quantitative easing acted as an important economic channel that led to the consequences unintended or otherwise of widening the income and wealth gap in the us given the stimulation of the us economy via tax cuts which increased its fiscal deficit during the late cycle and the loose monetary policy 2 5 interest rate in the us and effectively 0 in other developed economies such as europe and japan it appears that governments and central banks could have limited fiscal and monetary levers to effectively combat the next recession this brings us to the role of the state in dealing with the vicious cycle of income and wealth disparities and financial crisis the first role is to design policies to narrow income and wealth disparities senator elizabeth warren speaking of the 2008 financial crisis said years of flat wages low savings and high debt have left the american household extremely vulnerable any effective policy has to start with households the second is to reduce the disruptions of financial crisis by preparing for it when times are good the state should promote sustainable balanced and inclusive economic growth institute guidelines for credit growth in different asset classes and enhance productive potential at the level of economic philosophy it is most important to uphold the basic principle that finance must serve economy and economy must serve society and not the reverse lim mah hui is a former banker and professor and has written widely on public policy issues and finance he published the book nowhere to hide the great

fear ran rampant in news and opinion coverage including abc s world news tonight cnbc programming the daily beast the washington post the new york times cnn and more not everyone or every story agreed

december rate hike there were also occasional reminders that economic forecasting often falls short bloomberg businessweek published why are economists so bad at forecasting recessions on march 28

column for bloomberg markets a recession is coming and maybe a bear market too in it he gave a business downturn starting this year a two thirds probability if nobel prize winning economist robert shiller is right that just worrying about recession can become a self fulfilling prophecy that halts the stock market what negative impact could this daily drumbeat of recession fears from the media have unfortunately the tone of economic coverage often reflects the liberal media s attitudes toward a president under president barack obama even during difficult economic times the liberal media looked for signs of recovery when the administration dubbed summer 2010 recovery summer they followed obama s lead and touted milestone projects paid for by the massive stimulus under president donald trump they ignore much of the good economic news and look for bad news in the trump era the networks along skipped or minimized some strong jobs reports ignored stock market record highs while emphasizing stock market tumbles and more mrc business kept track all month to prove that every calendar day was marked by recession worries forecasts and speculations march 1 recession lurking around

robert barone expressed concerns about the deceleration of u s gdp and global economic troubles in his column where s the recession you ask it would behoove market watchers to stop ignoring the

chairman michael steele to discuss the current economy steele argued the economy was doing well and president donald trump should celebrate it but nodded to recession fears saying there are some

recession march 7 dow carnage as recession warnings intensify yahoo finance republished a piece from ccn complaining about a selloff that took place before u s markets opened that day it said the dow

consecutive day of losses march 8 recession talk morning and evening on cnn obama era economic adviser austan goolsbee appeared on cnn newsroom the morning of march 8 and said for sure the economy is slowing reacting to an abysmal february jobs report goolsbee said if we start getting multiple months like that the unemployment rate is going to start shooting back up and people are definitely going

policies that are upside down in terms of where we should be going march 9 recession worries from the hill the telegraph the hill published an op ed claiming president trump is wrecking the economy in it contributor neil baron wrote the gdp growth that delights trump supporters is likely to be short lived trump s tax cuts failed to launch the promised investment boom that was supposed to lead to long term growth in fact growth may already be slowing initial jobless claims a proxy for layoffs recently rose by 8 000 a growing number of economists and 73 percent of money managers predict a recession later this year or next the telegraph also reported that day that the u s faces real risk of recession it said the country saw the biggest one month surge in recession risk in three decades as consumers start to buckle under higher credit costs top economists have warned march 10 60 minutes asks fed are we headed to a recession cbs s 60 minutes anchor scott pelley proved recession remained on the minds of liberal journalists in his interview with chairman jerome powell even after powell told him we see the economy as in a good place pelley asked where powell sees economic weakness about people behind on car payments and declining retail sales that was all before he popped the big overarching question are we headed to a recession march 11 by the day more and more people are predicting we ll go into a recession u s news and world report chided the trump administration over the budget s failure to cut the debt and faulted its rosy economic projections committee for a responsible federal budget president maya macguineas told them the administration assumed 3 percent growth forever she added by the day more and more people are predicting we ll go into a recession so to premise all these savings on the presumption of ongoing economic growth is a risky proposition march 12 cnn column warns business nerves could spur recession moody s analytics economic mark zandi is a media favorite perhaps because he s a registered democrat and supported hillary clinton in 2016 after advising the mccain campaign in 2008 he wrote businesses are nervous and sentiment is at risk of breaking if anything goes wrong and plenty could go wrong a recession could materialize swiftly if businesses lose faith and there is a good chance they will march 13 cnbc reports very real risk of 2020 recession the ucla anderson forecast on the economy showed a very real risk the u s economy would head into a recession in 2020 according to cnbc ucla forecasters warned of a global slowdown that

the preliminary reading of first quarter gdp until late april march 15 goolsbee in the ny times are we one wrong turn away from recession you never know when a recession will sneak up on you proclaimed the headline of austan goolsbee s new york times economic view column published online march 15 and in print march 16 after quoting president donald trump s economic optimism goolsbee warned yet some series people remain nervous he cited economic data forecasts and history to argue one wrong turn could cause a recession by scaring consumers into pausing their spending march 16 marketwatch says business leaders are bracing for recession although marketwatch published an opinion column about corporate leaders recessionary fears on march 15 it was still actively promoting it on march 16 the original piece consulted gartner research firm which warned many companies are taking a recessionary stance and making preparations to capitalize on a downturn rather than be a casualty of one more and more u s business leaders are talking about a possible downturn or recession march 17 another recession is a matter of when not if the left wing guardian s economic columnist larry elliot opined as recession looms could mmt be the unorthodox solution mmt or modern monetary theory is a an economic idea embraced by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny that disregards the size of deficits regarding a coming recession elliot wrote it would be a mistake though to assume that all is now well because that is far from the case the mood remains nervous and that s not just because another recession is a matter of when not if march 18 bloomberg a recession is coming and maybe a bear market too columnist a gary shilling s bloomberg markets headline was crystal clear regarding his bearish economic attitude the column piled on the pessimism i first suggested the u s economy was headed toward a recession more than a year ago and now others are forecasting the same i give a business downturn starting this year a two thirds probability march 19 cnbc video greater than average chance for recession cnbc released a video interview with nobel prize winning yale economist robert shiller discussing the economy and recession in it shiller suggested there is a greater than average chance for a recession but warned that it s very iffy forecasting the economy a year or two in the future he humbly acknowledged i m not confident in my ability to predict these things any more than i m confident of anybody else march 20 marketwatch recession will burst credit bubble of biblical proportions investment strategist john maudlin s marketwatch column was less concerned with when a recession would arrive and more concerned with the credit bubble that he warned would explode at that time citing the federal reserve s decision not to increase interest rates he complained it may indeed buy the market an additional year or two but postponing the inevitable downturn with artificially low rates will come at a cost the cost is a massive credit bubble that is already of biblical proportions its implications chill me to the bone march 21 recession by mid 2020 investment strategist tells cnbc our view is that the u s will be in recession or close to recession by the middle of 2020 paul kitney of daiwa capital markets told cnbc on march 21 march 22 inverted yield curve spurs many recession stories many news outlets talked about recession on this day and several days that followed due to a bellwether u s bond indicator known as the inverted yield curve u s markets flash warning last seen before great recession the daily beast headline declared yet another recession warning just flashed red business insider s headline began even abc world news tonight mentioned the inverted yield curve that night a marketwatch column that day also interpreted the fed s total capitulation as a guarantee that recession is coming their actions speak loud and clear it continued march 23 fair chance of 2019 2020 recession the yield curve inversion was still spurring recession prognostication march 23 as evidenced by forbes investing contributor simon moore he said the inversion the yield curve has a good track record and puts the chance of a recession at 30 but unlike some of the more fear mongering coverage moore at least admitted there are risks of forecasting the recession based on just the yield curve data and that a 25 30 chance of recession is not that high march 24 growing fears about a u s recession bring down stocks reuters reported stock futures were falling again just days after the three major stock indexes declined and risk assets fell out of favour on growing fears about a u s recession later it pointed out that historically an inverted yield curve where long term rates fall below short term has signalled an upcoming recession march 25 vox tackles panic over yield curve cnbc cites mounting fears at least two media outlets addressed the yield curve again march 25 vox published an explainer about why that metric sent the financial press into a tizzy the left wing website acknowledged nobody really knows if it means a recession really is on the way but it s certainly not good news and while you wait to see if economic disaster strikes you might as well learn what the hell it is the analysts on television are talking about the same day squawk on the street co anchor sara eisen asked editor at large john harwood if the end of the mueller investigation changes anything between president donald trump and president xi jinping regarding a trade deal i don t think so he said but harwood added that both presidents are under economic pressures to get an agreement the chinese economy is weakening we ve seen that the u s economy is slowing down we had the yield curve invert on friday there are mounting fears of potential recession say by 2020 march 26 new york magazine goes to defcon 3 using military aviation threat system s language for an economic story is sure to incite fear even when it doesn t use the highest threat level but that s the way new york magazine headlined its story about the yield curve concerns recession worries move to defcon 3 blared josh barros headline late in the story were admissions that not everyone thinks that the yield curve is signalling a recession it could just be predicting weaker growth far more people will read the scary headline than will make it to the calmer tones in the latter portion of the article after the advertisement march 27 scary foreclosure image dominates vox recession piece pictures speak louder than words and the full banner image of a red foreclosure sign stretched across the top of a vox piece about recession concerns certainly spoke loudest even louder than the second paragraph that read economists now believe that another recession might arrive sooner rather than later potentially before 2021 and a growing group of analysts and experts have started to talk more about the possibility of a recession on the horizon march 28 the street promotes gold due to imminent recession the street s real money section included a call to start investing in gold since a recession is coming author jim collins declared i firmly believe the yield curve is a sign of an impending recession why because the last nine recessions have been preceded by an inverted three month 10 year u s treasury yield curve although he told people not to panic he urged changes to asset allocations including adding hard assets like gold march 29 another recession indicator gets axios attention not just focused on the inverted yield curve anymore axios called attention to another recession indicator it warned was flashing the new indicator was the value of corporate equities that households and non profits own the rate had fallen at the end of 2018 the same day cnbc reported that key data could end or defend recession fears

persist as march was winding to a close recession fears had not abated bloomberg s headline on the 30th said us gets health check as recession fears persist could that persistence have had anything to

wall street would be scrutinizing upcoming economic data after a dismal february jobs report and recessionary warning signals from u s treasury yields and hoping to find reassurance jack ablin of cresset capital management in chicago told reuters the yield curve inversion is the manifestation of investors fears that the u s is getting caught up in a global slowdown but reuters did admit many

2018 proved to be a difficult year for mexican hotels and while 2019 might still have some recurring economic political and industry specific challenges some positive themes within them are showing there s still room for optimism now is the time for mexican hotel owners and investors to take action and those who are able to deftly ride rough waters ahead will emerge the most victorious below i highlight five themes to watch in 2019 1 political changes and their effects on tourism on 10 march 2019 mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador completed the first 100 days of his six year term much has already occurred but the three main policy impacts to the tourism industry in mexico include cancelling the construction of mexico city s new international airport eliminating the mexico tourism promotion council cptm and redirecting these important marketing funds to finance a mayan train route and closing the mexican investment promotion agency promexico offices and redirecting these efforts to the embassies and consulates promoting mexico as a destination for high spending international travelers is critical to maintaining the positive tourism growth rates that contribute importantly to mexican gdp employment and competitiveness eliminating the cptm is very concerning and its efforts must be replaced with appropriate promotional strategies to sustain international visitation growth although it remains to be seen whether nationalistic economic policies with a social inclusion focus will actually benefit the majority of mexicans as of today amlo s public popularity and consumer confidence remains high certainly positive public policies concerning improved services and livability conditions in key tourism destinations like los cabos will help social integration yet corporate confidence remains low the domestic business community and foreign investors appear to be losing confidence in the mexican economy and private investment remains stalled 2 economic headwinds and their links to business demand besides political uncertainty economic headwinds usually lead companies to postpone important decision making and investments slower business investment and tighter discretionary spending affects lodging demand and revenue per available room growth according to str parent company of hnn political and economic uncertainty hampered performance in 2018 with revpar down 3 2 in u s dollars furthermore international credit rating agencies and global financial institutions are concerned about the lower expected economic growth levels in mexico and the imf recently lowered its 2019 economic growth projections from 2 5 in october 2018 to 2 1 in january 2019 although the signature of the t mec which replaced nafta in december 2018 eased commercial tensions between the u s and mexico it still requires ratification consequently business tourism to key industrial cities in mexico is being affected pending further clarity on the new legislation and the reactivation of stalled investment projects the recent u s government shutdown also affected lodging demand in mexican border cities like ciudad juárez and tijuana the shutdown however as well as u s trade issues with china have weakened the u s dollar and positively helped the mexican peso to appreciate more than 2 since the beginning of the year 3 safety security and seaweed all softening leisure demand safety and security concerns and the seaweed outbreak have also affected u s leisure visitation to key resort markets like cancún and the riviera maya since lower u s visitation to these key markets has been offset by more price sensitive domestic and regional latin american visitors primarily from colombia lower adrs have been achieved moreover differences in seasonality and shorter booking windows for local travelers have limited the ability of operators to maximize rates which ultimately affects profitability additional softening effects in cancún and the riviera maya are being felt due to lower visitation from the united kingdom an impact of brexit fewer tourists from argentina due to their economic weaknesses above average hotel supply growth and greater competition from alternative lodging options according to the cancún hotel association it took more than 40 years for cancún to reach 30 000 hotel rooms and airbnb reached the same level of available supply there in only seven years 4 other financial impacts on hospitality businesses other financial effects that hospitality businesses will feel in 2019 include higher labor costs from minimum wage increases raised 16 2 for the year energy prices interest rates and credit risk spreads to combat reduced operating margins from rising utilities prices various mexican publicly traded hospitality companies recently engaged external experts to find long term savings solutions interest rates continue to rise in december 2018 the mexican central bank increased its base interest rate to 8 25 due to the uncertainty of amlo s economic policies as well as to reduce the risk of higher inflation as a result mexican peso denominated lending rates for hospitality developments are now about 250 to 300 basis points higher than the tiie interbank rate presently around 8 5 yielding a total loan cost of about 11 to 12 per year depending on other project attributes to compensate for this higher cost of capital and risk investors now require higher returns but as mentioned above operating performance has decreased therefore cap rates have increased and reduced implied values and will likely slow transaction volumes 5 slow lodging transaction volumes that will soon favor buyers last year was a seller s market with multiple larger 100 million or more hotel sales that took place in primary cities like mexico city los cabos and the riviera maya whereby sellers mostly involved u s public companies and buyers were private mexican families or funds examples include hyatt hotels corporation s sale of the hyatt regency in mexico city for 365 million host hotels resorts joint venture sale of the jw marriott in mexico city for 183 million brookfield s sale of the hilton in los cabos for 167 million marriott international s joint venture sale of the w in mexico city for 112 million although various key ownership groups are looking to divest in 2019 disconnects in expected valuations between sellers and buyers will keep transaction volumes slow in the short term the medium term however will present good buying opportunities particularly for private investment groups with longer holding periods and greater tolerance for volatility notably since amlo cancelled the construction of mexico city s new international airport in late 2018 mexican lodging investors have begun seeking safer acquisition and diversification opportunities in the caribbean europe and the u s for example mexico based rlh properties recently acquired the luxurious villa magna hotel in madrid for 210 million 236 million and is seeking other investments in spain and europe the reported purchase yield was less than 2 which demonstrates the flight to safety into international premium assets 2019 should continue to be an active year for management changes brand conversions and product renovations as owners will seek to strengthen distribution and product positioning in both urban and resort markets at this point in the mexican lodging cycle amresorts for instance recently signed two new resort conversion deals in the riviera maya with the oasis hotels resorts following the trend of strategic partnerships in the all inclusive resort sector that i wrote about a few months ago 2019 outlook summary i believe that mexico s hospitality industry will benefit from strong support and resources from the private sector indeed mexico s hospitality industry benefits from strong private sector leadership and influence led by the important national council of tourism enterprises which is comprised of 15 important national chambers and associations that collectively represent over 90 of the tourism activities of the country as the multiple interviews at the recent 2019 mexico hotel tourism investment conference revealed the country s hospitality sector still has whitespace for new brands operators products niches and innovation country wide and sector specific business conditions however must improve for all stakeholders to thrive with mexico s hotel industry facing political changes and economic slowdowns and its sector s performance declining the evaluation of investment strategies and operating tactics proves critical ultimately 2019 should reflect as they say in mexico a río revuelto ganancia de pescadores translation there is always

bangkok trade tensions between china and the united states are putting a drag on economies in the region with growth likely to continue to slow in the coming two years the asian development bank said in a report released wednesday april 3 the manila philippines based regional lender s latest economic outlook forecasts that growth in developing asia will slow slightly to 5 7 percent this year and 5 6 percent in 2020 in 2017 growth was at 6 2 percent the main risk to the outlook is still the ongoing trade conflict as heightened trade policy uncertainty can negatively affect investment and manufacturing activity it said a sharper slowdown in the advanced economies or the prc people s republic of china is another risk the update comes as china and the us prepare for another round of talks this week in washington aimed at resolving their dispute over china s industrial policies and acquisition of technology after the dispute escalated in mid 2018 with both sides imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other s products world trade weakened contracting nearly two percent in january from a year earlier the report shows it said the solid growth momentum in the first nine months of the year began to fade in the last quarter growth in industrial production also showed signs of weakness the adb report said this is an added burden as the business cycle for major economies heads into a negative trend said the adb s chief economist yasuyuki sawada this global business cycle seems to create some impact on asian economies he said in an interview it s not only trade tensions other reports show similar sluggishness in the region which remains the main driver for world economic growth the latest set of purchasing manager indexes showed slight improvements in exports in march from january february for indonesia vietnam thailand and taiwan as well as china but other data suggest that growth in china could well weaken again in the near term capital economics said in a report as such we think it is too soon to predict a turn in fortunes for the region s manufacturing sectors the asian development bank forecasts that growth in major economies will slip to 1 9 percent in 2019 and 1 6 percent in 2020 from 2 2 percent last year the us economy is forecast to expand at a 2 4 percent annual rate this year slowing from 2 9 percent in 2018 and to decelerate to 1 9 percent growth in 2020 japan s growth will remain flat at 0 8 percent this year it estimates and fall to 0 6 percent next year the bank expects growth in the area using the euro to fall to 1 5 percent in 2019 and 2020 from 1 8 percent in 2018 on the positive side inflation should remain manageable and domestic demand in many economies in southeast and south asia is vibrant the asian development bank said that s less true of east asia where consumers have grown more cautious about spending auto sales in china for example have plunged in recent months in one of the biggest reversals of sentiment developing countries in asia are seeing an uptick in investment from many parts of the world especially china it noted china s foreign direct investment in new projects such as renewable energy textile factories and property in the region nearly tripled while investment by the us jumped by nearly three quarters while much of the adb s report focused on trade and investment the bank urged governments across the region to devote more resources to cultivating resilience and taking measures to help prevent or mitigate natural disasters the report noted that 84 percent of the 206 million people affected by natural disasters each year in 2000 2018 lived in developing asian economies more than half of the 60 000 deaths from such catastrophes each year were in this region which suffers a large share of extreme weather events and earthquakes the report says that a large share of the 1 7 trillion in annual investments in infrastructure needed over the coming decade should go to reducing risks from such disasters one area of concern is insurance almost all direct damage is not covered by insurance sawada said another area that could yield strong results is in weather forecasting and warnings in the asia pacific home to four of every five people affected by storms and other disasters while earthquakes and tsunamis are virtually impossible to predict when it comes to extreme weather there is room for constructing mechanisms and building up early warning systems sawada said there is huge potential ap

derek lacey dlacey gannett com henderson county is consistently growing and so is its economy wednesday morning industry professionals heard from the experts about the ins and outs of henderson county s demographics job numbers and wages as well as global and national economic issues during the henderson county partnership for economic development s industrial executives forum at blue ridge community college tom tveidt with syneva economics presented a deep dive into economic factors for the county and james smith of parsec financial took a global and national view on economic issues from recessions to trade local manufacturing executives elected leaders and more attended the nearly two hour presentation it was largely good news for henderson county s economy focusing on consistent growth that outpaces the vast majority of the country the county s population growth and employment growth remain strong and consistent outpacing the nation and the state in both categories while wage and income growth lags the nation and state the county has seen at least 49 years of uninterrupted population growth tveidt said with an average of 1 535 new residents every year totaling 115 708 in 2017 he compared that to the 43 percent of counties across the country who lost population between 2016 and 2017 going back seven years only 19 percent of counties across the u s have added population year over year he said noting that buncombe county also is one in 2017 the new net population in henderson county came from 2 182 people who moved into the county from elsewhere in the country and 38 from other countries over the seven years leading up to 2017 tveidt showed that the ratio of new residents mainly coming from domestic moves holds constant but that natural population growth or the number of births compared to deaths is consistently negative there were 279 more deaths than births in the county in 2017 census statistics show all ages coming to county it s not just the number of people but who those people are that s important he said the largest demographic is people between 40 44 of which 1 357 people moved to the county between 2012 and 2017 in that same time he said 2 458 millennials ages 20 34 moved to the county 2 796 generation xers and 3 461 baby boomers ages 50 69 the takeaway he said is you re growing you re going to keep growing and the county is attracting people of all age groups employment growth employment also continues its upward climb since the country climbed out of the great recession tveidt said henderson county reached a peak of more than 37 000 employed before the recession hit at the end of 2007 but had lost more than 4 000 jobs by 2010 when things started to turn around it wasn t until the third quarter of 2016 he showed that local employment reached a new post recession high the average annual employment growth rate in henderson county is 2 9 percent he said outpacing the national rate of 1 7 percent and the statewide rate of 1 8 percent but the good news doesn t necessarily translate into wages for those workers tveidt said the average weekly wage in henderson county is 757 compared with 966 across the state and 1 090 across the country annually the average county wage is 39 284 in north carolina that s 50 154 and 56 552 in the u s per capita income is a little closer to the state and national metrics however at 41 179 in henderson county 44 222 in the state and 51 640 nationwide a county of commuters most of the county s residents also commute out of the county for work tveidt said in 2015 22 071 people lived in henderson county but were employed elsewhere 17 257 residents were employed in the county and 15 296 people from outside the county were employed here but that doesn t mean all jobs in the county are filled unemployment is down below 3 percent while there are roughly 2 000 jobs posted online each month he said it s a struggle every community across the country is facing and a good one to have he added more positives other things tveidt touched on include retail sales which are also up for the county by 68 percent from 2018 outpacing the state in six of the last nine years and new business registrations that continue to grow now four times what they were in 2009 growing 18 percent annually median home prices are up outpacing buncombe county the state and nation in the last two years and have stayed positive for the past 51 straight months global view smith took a much broader approach to the economic issues affecting industry in the county everything from the global economic scene to international trade deals across the globe economic activity is higher today than it has ever been before and tomorrow it will be higher than today smith said the european union while it still includes the united kingdom is the largest economic entity in the world and the united states the largest individual country economically followed by china japan and germany the world s economic activity in the past 25 years eclipses all the economic activity of human history prior he said nobody has ever seen a more dynamic global economic picture than what we have today smith said everyone with money wants to invest in the u s he said your scheme is to explain where henderson county north carolina is and show them why they want to invest here the problem of having more jobs than unemployed people in the country is an issue that goes back to around 2000 and the dot com boom he said since then the participation rate has never gotten back to what it was primarily because of demographics even so he said that when the latest unemployment report comes out on friday he has no fear saying it will mark the 101st consecutive month for new all time records for total people employed in non farm payroll jobs the importance of trade after world war ii smith explained the world trade organization was formed creating a set of rules for everyone to follow and increase trade since then global trade has increased by several orders of magnitude and the more you participate in trade the richer everyone gets there is currently a terrific trade disagreement between the u s and china he noted as china pursues its made in china 2025 initiative seeking to become the world leader in 10 key industries led by the u s china won t let up on their goals and the u s won t give up its leadership in those sectors he said smith praised the north american free trade agreement or nafta which essentially created a free trade zone in north america resulting in higher incomes higher employment rates and increased outputs by very large margins in all three countries the genius of it is that the three countries together don t need the rest of the world economically speaking that while everything nafta countries produce may not be the lowest cost they produce everything needed to be self sufficient ideas for the future he also noted the ideas of economist george schultz who proposed that nafta should also include a provision similar to one included with the european union that any citizen of either of the three countries who s not a convicted felon should be able to get a work permit to work in one of the other two if we would adopt the idea of people being freely able to work in all three countries who were a citizen of any one we would solve our unemployment problem we would solve 50 plus percent of our illegal immigration problem smith said i think it s a brilliant solution and i don t know why you don t hear more about it from politicians in washington d c he also spoke of a brilliant idea of microsoft founder bill gates that any foreign citizen should receive a green card along with their diploma when they graduate from an american university after all smith said we ve always succeeded from stealing the best and the brightest from the rest of the world every single person including native americans in the united states descended from immigrants he said whether that was 20 000 years ago or last week there are things to worry about today too he said including the problem of high government spending across the globe

a small business investment company sbic is a privately owned and operated company that makes long term investments in american small businesses and is licensed by the united states small business administration sba the principal reason for a firm to become licensed as an sbic is access to financing leverage provided by sba in addition banks and federal savings associations as well as their holding companies have the ability to own or to invest in sbics and thereby to own indirectly more than 5 percent of the voting stock of a small business 1 and can receive community reinvestment act credit for sbic investments banks and their holding companies are permitted to invest in sbics under the regulations implementing the volcker rule pursuant to the dodd frank act they also receive exemptions from certain capital charge regulations and lending affiliation rules under the gramm leach bliley act a business seeking a u s government contract that is a set aside for small businesses does not lose its status as a small business by reason of a control investment by an sbic many business development companies bdcs also have formed sbic subsidiaries as part of their business strategies this document provides a summary description of the sbic debenture program sba leverage in the form of debentures and a general overview of sba regulations and policies applicable to debenture sbics the u s small business administration sba administers the sbic program through its investment division which employs approximately 80 people sba is an independent federal agency located at 409 third street sw washington dc 20006 202 205 6510 useful information about the sbic program is available on sba s website at www sba gov inv or may be obtained by contacting samuel j boyd jr 202 205 7546 sbia the sbic industry is served by an active trade association the small business investor alliance sbia which is located at 1100 h street nw suite 1200 washington dc 20005 202 628 5055 www sbia org sbia s president is brett palmer harry haskins the long term senior career sba manager of the sbic program is sbia s director of sbic relations sbia provides a variety of information and services to its members and represents the industry with sba and on capitol hill sbia publishes regular updates and is a resource for information concerning the sbic program development of sbic program established by the united states congress in 1958 to stimulate long term investment in american small businesses the sbic program has evolved into a significant factor in financing smaller american businesses from the sbic program s inception to december 31 2018 sbics have provided approximately 97 6 billion of funding in more than 181 185 financings to businesses 2 including well known companies such as amgen apple computer costco federal express intel tesla and whole foods 3 the sbic program has undergone significant changes since its creation in 1958 the original program permitted only debenture leverage the small business equity enhancement act of 1992 drastically changed the sbic program it created a new form of sba leverage known as participating securities essentially preferred limited partnership interests in an sbic increased the amount of leverage available to an sbic to 90 million which subsequently was indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living since march 31 1993 and then modified in 2009 to be 150 million and again in 2018 to be 175 million required minimum private capital of 10 million for sbics using participating securities and 5 million for sbics using debentures provided for stricter sba licensing standards and enacted other changes to make the program more consistent with the private venture capital industry unlike the debenture program where sba is a creditor of the sbic which requires an sbic to make periodic interest payments the participating securities program required an sbic to pay sba a prioritized payment preferred return and a profit share when the sbic realized profits as a consequence the participating securities program was designed to permit investing in equity securities whether or not those securities had a current pay component this new program resulted in a large expansion of the number of sbic licenses granted following the burst of the technology bubble in 2002 the administration decided there no longer was a need for an equity sbic program and that the existing participating securities program would cause significant losses to sba accordingly sba decided to terminate the participating securities program and announced that beginning on october 1 2004 it would not issue commitments to use participating securities leverage or license new sbics using that leverage sba officials continue to emphasize that they believe the debenture program is working well and they want to expand it the governing law and regulations for the debenture program have undergone several revisions since 1994 that have further streamlined and improved the sbic program sba has continued its outreach to institutional investors bank regulators and prospective applicants in order to enlarge the existing debenture program and to create ways for sbics to make certain kinds of equity investments without undermining the financial integrity of the debenture program as of december 31 2018 4 there were 305 licensed sbics with approximately 15 8 billion of private capital and 11 3 billion of outstanding sba leverage of which 11 2 billion is debenture leverage and 18 million is participating securities leverage of these sbics 227 use debentures 25 use participating securities 47 do not use leverage and six are specialized sbics during the 2018 federal fiscal year october 1 september 30 federal fy ended september 30 2018 sba licensed a total of 25 sbics with approximately 1 2 billion of private capital of those 21 were debenture sbics and four were unleveraged sbics sba did not license any sbics during the first quarter of the 2019 federal fy ended december 31 2018 sba leverage sba currently provides financing called leverage to sbics in the form of debentures sbic s borrow leverage by issuing debentures debentures are unsecured ten year loans issued by the sbic that have interest only payable semi annually most debentures bear a temporary interest rate based on libor until they are pooled and sold to the public the interest rate excluding the annual sba charge described below on these debentures is fixed when the sba pools debentures from various sbics and sells them to the public with the pooled debentures having a 10 year maturity from the sale date the interest rate recently has been between 33 8 and 65 9 basis points in excess of the interest rate on treasury notes with 10 year maturities the treasury note rate in the most recent march 2019 pooling the interest rate was 3 113 percent excluding the annual sba charge described below this interest rate represented a 0 513 percent premium to the treasury note rate and reflected a decrease from the 3 548 percent excluding the annual sba charge described below rate set in the september 2018 pooling as of september 30 2018 there were 10 8 billion of debentures outstanding plus 3 4 billion of undrawn commitments to issue debentures lmi and energy saving debentures more than a decade ago sba created lmi debentures for use by sbics making equity investments in low and moderate income zones lmi zones or in companies with significant numbers of employees in lmi zones that are more fully described below under the heading lmi debentures in addition on april 19 2012 sba published final regulations authorizing a limited amount of so called energy saving debentures which would enable sbics licensed after 2008 to acquire equity securities in energy saving qualified investments using debentures no energy saving debentures have been issued early stage sbic initiative on january 31 2011 the administration announced its start up america initiative which among other things had as its purpose to promote high growth entrepreneurship across the country with new programs to help encourage private sector investment in startups and small firms as part of this initiative the sba published final regulations on april 27 2012 that established a new type of sbic called an early stage sbic by their own terms these regulations provided that the early stage program would terminate on september 30 2016 on september 19 2016 sba published a notice of proposed rulemaking which proposed various changes to the early stage program the proposed rule reflected sba s intent to continue licensing and providing sba guaranteed leverage to early stage sbics beyond the initial five year term previously announced and proposed regulatory changes however on september 28 2017 sba announced that it was not going to renew the early stage program or finalize the proposed rule in its memorandum announcing the non renewal of the early stage program sba encouraged venture capital fund managers to apply for a license as a non leveraged sbic i e an sbic that does not utilize sba debenture leverage 5 sba licensed only five early stage sbic s during the early stage program s existence sba is no longer issuing leverage commitments to these early stage sbics however they may continue to draw on their existing leverage commitments subject to sba regulations and policies impact investment program as part of the start up american program the sba also approved the creation of an impact investment fund program and set aside an aggregate of 1 billion of debenture leverage to be distributed over five years beginning with federal fy 2011 on september 25 2014 sba announced policy changes for this program including an extension of the program past the original five year period and an intention to commit on average 200 million per year to impact sbics on february 2 2016 sba published a proposed rule which would create a new class of sbic s called impact sbics however on september 28 2017 sba announced the termination of the impact investment program in its memorandum terminating the impact investment program sba stated that although it is terminating the impact investment program it remains committed to licensing qualified applicants which intend to finance small businesses located in underserved arears or employ an investment strategy focused on social environmental and or economic impact accordingly since november 1 2017 sba has not accepted management assessment questionnaires for applicants seeking to be licensed under the impact investment program fund managers who submitted management assessment questionnaires before september 28 2017 were given an opportunity to convert to a standard sbic applicant by providing written notice to sba no later than october 28 2017 fund managers with existing green light letters from sba authorizing them to submit an application for an sbic under the impact investment program are permitted to submit the license application consistent with the requirements contained in the green light letter if any such manager is approved as an impact sbic then it must operate under the impact sbic policy guidance under which it is licensed licensed sbics that are operating under the impact investment fund program are required to continue operations under the impact sbic policy guidance under which they were licensed and if they were approved to issue debentures sba will continue its practice of approving leverage commitments and draws based upon sba s regulations and credit policies that are applicable to all sbics business development companies a significant number of the publicly traded bdcs have sbic subsidiaries using debentures a bdc owned sbic is generally able to use up to 175 million of debentures on a 2 1 ratio to the amount of capital contributed to the sbic bdcs also may form more than one sbic and thereby use up to 350 million of debentures at one time formation of a second sbic is subject to sba policies that generally apply to the formation of second funds requiring successful operations of the first fund for at least two years among other requirements sbic subsidiaries of bdcs like other sbics are required to have a limited life typically with a five year investment period followed by a five year harvest period and may not be formed with perpetual existence reserving and drawing leverage sbics obtain leverage by reserving a leverage commitment and then drawing down leverage that commitment leverage commitments may be obtained at the time of licensing for an amount up to one tier6 of leverage subject to availability and thereafter as needed for an amount of up to two tiers of leverage 7 but not more than twice in any federal fy when a leverage commitment is issued the sbic pays a one time commitment fee that is 1 percent of the amount of the leverage commitment a leverage commitment expires on september 30 of the fourth federal fy following the fiscal year of its issuance sbics may apply twice each month to draw down leverage commitments sba s approval of a draw request is good for 58 days and an sba can make a draw against the approval on one day s notice a newly licensed sbic is permitted to draw only one half tier of leverage before sba s first regulatory examination generally 6 10 months after licensure debentures that will be pooled use an interim credit facility provided by the federal home loan bank of chicago at the time of each disbursement for these pooled debentures fees totaling 2 425 percent are deducted from the amount the sbic receives a 2 percent user fee payable to sba 37 5 basis points of underwriting fees and 5 basis points as an administrative fee to the selling agent the sbic pays an interim interest rate on debenture leverage of libor plus 30 basis points and the amount of sba s charge described below in march and september of each year all debenture leverage issued since the prior pooling is pooled by sba and sold to the public in the form of trust certificates and a new interest rate for all such debenture leverage is established and fixed until the leverage is repaid typical use of leverage a management team may hold a closing and form its fund at any time before or after it files its formal sbic application 8 however it may not obtain leverage until it receives its license a process that currently is taking about 6 12 months from the date that sba accepts a filed license application for processing 9 after the license application is accepted by sba for processing many applicants draw their private capital to pay organization expenses and management fees and to make investments in any event an sbic is required to have drawn at least 2 5 million of private investors capital prior to licensing once licensed most sbics fund their operations solely by using sba leverage until the ratio of outstanding leverage to paid in capital from private investors called leverageable capital reaches two to one and they then coordinate capital calls from private investors with the use of leverage to maintain a two to one leverage to drawn private capital ratio 10 sbics are permitted to borrow money from banks or other unaffiliated third parties prior to their initial leverage but sba requires such borrowings to be repaid when leverage is first drawn leverage availability a single sbic may use up to 175 million of debentures and the total amount of debentures that may be outstanding among a group of commonly controlled sbics is limited to an aggregate of 350 million 11 the amount of leverage commitments available to an sbic is its regulatory capital multiplied by the tiers of leverage that sba has approved for the sbic sba obtains funds enabling it to supply leverage for pooled debentures by guarantying payment of trust certificates that are purchased by traditional purchasers of government guaranteed notes sba then invests the proceeds in sbics in the form of debentures sba guaranteed trust certificates for debentures are sold in march and september of each year sba obtains funds enabling it to supply leverage for debentures that are not pooled including lmi debentures and early stage sbic debentures by guarantying loans made by the federal home loan bank of chicago the amount of leverage commitments that may be issued each year is subject to the amount authorized by congress in recent years congress has enacted authorized levels in three year cycles for federal fy 2019 4 billion of leverage commitments is expected to be available leverage commitments issued by sba each year have been well below the amounts authorized by congress during the past five 5 federal fys sba issued a total of 12 098 billion of leverage commitments as shown in the following chart federal fy leverage commitments issued by sba 2014 2 549 billion 2015 2 553 billion 2016 2 514 billion 2017 1 960 billion 2018 2 522 billion sbics drew a total of 10 581 billion of debenture leverage during the past five federal fys in the amounts shown in the follow chart federal fy leverage drawn by sbics 2014 2 065 billion 2015 2 337 billion 2016 2 158 billion 2017 1 902 billion 2018 2 119 billion the trust certificates representing an interest in the pooled debentures are sold with the assistance of investment bankers who receive a 37 5 basis point fee to institutional purchasers of government guaranteed fixed rate notes with 10 year maturities the interest rate on trust certificates is a premium over the 10 year treasury note rate the premium has been as high as 2 273 percent in the pooling in september 2008 since then the premium has decreased dramatically and during the last five years has been less than 1 percent the premium over the 10 year treasury note rate for each of the last ten 10 poolings is shown in the

513 3 113 historically the amount of leverage commitments that sba could issue each year was subject to annual congressional appropriation of an amount necessary to cover anticipated losses on the leverage issued thus the amount of congressional appropriation and the rate of loss anticipated on the issued leverage referred to as the subsidy rate determined the actual amount of leverage that would be available each year this typically resulted in significantly less leverage being available than the level authorized by congress beginning on september 1 1996 sba charged a 1 00 percent annual charge on leverage it provided to sbics causing significant reductions in required congressional appropriations needed to support increasing amounts of available leverage the amount of the charge is determined in the fiscal year in which a leverage commitment is issued and applies to all leverage issued pursuant to that commitment the subsidy rate was substantially reduced in the case of debentures to less than 1 00 percent with the result that no appropriations were required to support their issuance beginning in federal fy 2000 in december 2000 legislation was enacted requiring sba to set the amount of the charge it imposed on commitments issued each fiscal year at the rate necessary so that the sum of all fees charged including 1 percent commitment fees 2 percent user fees the annual charge and anticipated profit distributions would equal the amount of anticipated losses the charge for leverage commitments issued between federal fy 2006 and federal fy 2018 varied from a low of 0 285 percent for federal fy 2010 to a high of 0 94 percent for federal fy 2006 the charge for leverage commitments issued in federal fys 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 was 0 355 percent 0 742 percent 0 672 percent 0 374 percent and 0 222 percent respectively the charge for leverage commitments issued during federal fy 2019 is 0 094 percent an all time low sba s website contains historical information concerning the sbic program including the amount and pricing of leverage committed and issued since the sbic program was restructured in 1994 summary of calculation of interest rate charged on conventional pooled debentures the rate of interest payable by a conventional sbic on pooled debentures is the sum of the following 1 the interest rate of treasury notes with 10 year maturities at the time the trust certificates are pooled and sold 2 the premium required by the purchasers of the trust certificates above the 10 year treasury note rate and 3 the annual charge payable to sba at the rate applicable in the fiscal year in which the commitment was issued thus for example the interest rate for debentures issued in the march 2019 pooling pursuant to a leverage commitment issued during federal fy 2018 was 2 600 10 year treasury rate 0 513 premium required by trust certificate purchasers 3 113 trust certificate rate 0 222 sba charge for debenture commitment issued in federal fy 2018 3 335 total interest rate repayment of debenture leverage debentures that have 10 year maturities from the date of pooling are not amortized prior to maturity and bear interest payable semi annually 12 debentures are unsecured and the general partner of the sbic is generally not liable for their repayment beginning with the september 2006 issuance debentures may be prepaid without penalty but a debenture must be repaid in whole repayment of debentures is subordinate to repayment of loans from non associate lenders up to the lesser of 10 million or twice the amount of the sbic s regulatory capital 13 sba is able to issue debentures with maturities shorter than 10 years but has not done so since 1991 unrelated business taxable income exemption prior to october 2004 certain tax exempt entities that invested in sbics were subject to recognition of unrelated business taxable income ubti as a result of the issuance of debentures tax legislation adopted in october 2004 exempts tax exempt investors from ubti that otherwise would be caused by the issuance of debentures by sbics licensed after enactment of the legislation but only if no tax exempt investor other than a governmental unit owns more than 25 percent of the capital or profits interest of the sbic and all tax exempt investors including governmental units other than any agency or instrumentality of the united states own less than 50 percent of the capital and profits interest of the sbic distributions by debenture sbics an sbic using debentures makes distributions among its partners as provided in the sbic s limited partnership or operating agreement the sources of those distributions are limited as follows 1 distributions from positive retained earnings available for distribution so called read an sbic has read if it has positive net realized cumulative retained earnings that is the cumulative earnings after all expenses and realized and unrealized depreciation of investments have been deducted an sbic may distribute an amount equal to read prior to repayment of its outstanding debentures note that sba determines whether distributions have been made in excess of read as of the end of each calendar year 2 in addition to distributions from read described in paragraph one except as provided in paragraph three below until all debentures have been repaid in full an sbic may make distributions in any calendar year up to two percent of its regulatory capital 14 3 after an sbic has substantially completed making new investments it generally files a wind up plan with sba if sba feels secure about repayment of outstanding debentures sba may permit some repayment of regulatory capital prior to the repayment in full of all outstanding debentures sba generally only gives that approval when the sbic has previously made significant repayments of debentures the remaining portfolio is performing well and sba feels reasonably well assured that outstanding debentures will be repaid in full with respect to funds available for distribution an sbic will seek to negotiate with sba the proportion of those funds that will be used to repay debentures and to make distributions constituting a return of regulatory capital while sometimes this proportion is 1 1 an sbic cannot reliably predict what arrangement if any sba may be willing to accept sbics are permitted to make distributions before the end of a fiscal year in situations where an sbic made a distribution mid year from read that then existed but at the end of the year the sbic did not have read for the year for example if the sbic wrote off an investment after mid year sba has taken the position that the sbic s distribution was improper and that event of default occurred under the debenture leverage in such a case the sbic would be given a specified period of time to cure the default not less than fifteen days the failure to cure could result in sba declaring all debentures immediately due and payable and seeking the appointment of sba or its designee as a receiver unlike conventional debentures which are permitted to make distributions to its investors from read before debentures are repaid an early stage sbic must make distributions to sba concurrently with the making of any distributions to its investors the amount that an early stage sbic must distribute to sba is determined by a formula based on the degree of capital impairment 15 a leverage ratio and amounts previously distributed to sba just in time financing the sbic program permits the funds from investors and sba leverage to be taken down by the partnership in lock step thereby delaying investor capital calls and potentially increasing investor returns an sbic using debentures is required to have total regulatory capital of at least 5 million 20 million in the case of an early stage sbic 16 however sba requires an sbic applicant to have firm commitments when it files its formal license application in an amount equal to the amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the applicant to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if does not subsequently raise additional funds generally at least 20 25 million while an applicant needs to have binding subscriptions for the full amount of its regulatory capital only 2 5 million of the sbic s regulatory capital needs to be paid in prior to issuance of the sbic license 17 lmi debentures on september 30 1999 sba adopted regulations providing incentives for sbics to invest in low and moderate income zones lmi zones an lmi zone is a geographic area that satisfies one of five definitions that currently are used by different federal agencies in determining areas requiring special attention debenture sbics also may use lmi debentures highlights of the regulations are as follows sbics making venture capital type investments equity or certain subordinated loans in small businesses with 50 percent or more of its employees or tangible assets in an lmi zone or to a small business that has 35 percent of its employees residing in an lmi zone will be eligible to obtain sba financing in the form of a deferred interest debenture sba intends to issue non amortizing debentures with maturities of 5 or 10 years each with a zero coupon for the first five years if the interest rate is 5 percent this means that the sbic would receive approximately 75 000 in proceeds for issuing a 100 000 debenture on the 10 year debentures interest would be payable semi annually commencing in the sixth year the small business financed by the sbic must either satisfy the employee or asset test described above at the time of applying to the sbic for financing or within 180 days after the closing of the financing lmi debentures will be issuable to sbics that have reserved debenture leverage at the time of making a draw request the sbic specifies whether it will use an lmi debenture or a regular debenture the interest rate for the lmi debenture is fixed when it is initially issued for its full term lmi debentures will be held by the federal home loan bank of chicago and are not pooled in the same manner as other leverage community reinvestment act credit current community reinvestment act cra regulations present banks other than certain small banks with a continuing need to make investments that qualify for cra purposes investment in an sbic is specifically identified in the cra regulations as a type of investment that will be presumed by the regulatory agencies to be a qualified investment for cra purposes the investment should be in an sbic that is located in or doing substantial business in the region in which the bank s assessment area is located but the sbic is not required to be headquartered within the assessment area itself the sbic act and other federal statutes explicitly permit banks bank holding companies federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies to invest in sbics gramm leach bliley and dodd frank act exemptions as part of the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act effective april 1 2002 the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted new regulations governing regulatory capital treatment for certain equity investments held by banks bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the regulations an 8 percent tier 1 capital deduction applies on covered investments that in the aggregate are less than 15 percent of an organization s tier 1 capital a 12 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 15 24 99 percent of tier 1 capital and a 25 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 25 percent and above of tier 1 capital the regulations exempt sbic investments from such capital charges so long as their value is less than 15 percent of tier 1 capital however the amount of sbic investments will be considered when determining capital charges with respect to other investments these rules however may be affected by contemplated changes to bank capital requirements to conform to the basel iii accords in addition ownership of a 15 percent equity interest in a portfolio company by a bank affiliated sbic will not give rise to a presumption that the portfolio company is an affiliate under sections 23 a and b of the glb act the dodd frank act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics the final regulations implementing the volcker rule under the dodd frank act permit banking entities to invest in licensed sbics as well as in funds that have received permission from sba to file an sbic license application and to sponsor sbics investment advisers act exemption an adviser that solely advises sbics an entity that has received a green light letter authorizing it to submit a formal sbic license application to sba and an applicant that is affiliated with one or more sbics and that has applied for another sbic license are expressly exempted from the dodd frank act amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which generally require advisers to certain types of private funds to register with the securities and exchange commission or to become exempt reporting advisers the sbic advisers relief act which became law on december 4 2015 provides certain additional relief for investment advisers that advise private funds and sbics and for investment advisers that advise venture funds and sbics before the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to private funds that had assets under management in the united states of less than 150 million could rely upon the so called private fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements also prior to the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to one or more venture capital funds as defined by the sec could rely upon the so called venture capital fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements the sbic advisers relief act revised the private fund adviser exemption by excluding sbic assets from counting towards the 150 million threshold for purposes of determining whether an investment adviser satisfies the conditions for the private fund adviser exemption and by deeming sbics to be venture capital funds for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption sbic investments an sbic can only invest in small businesses and must invest at least 25 percent of its invested funds in smaller enterprises 18 sba regulations define a small business as a company with tangible net worth total net worth less goodwill of less than 19 56 million and average after tax income exclusive of loss carry forwards for the prior 2 years of less than 6 5 million a company failing that test can still qualify as a small business if it meets the size standards for its industry group under an alternative test the size standards for industry groups under this alternative test are based on the number of employees typically 500 to 1 000 for a manufacturing company or gross revenues 19 a smaller enterprise is a company with a net worth excluding goodwill of less than 6 million and average after tax income for the prior two years of less than 2 million or which meets the alternative test importantly in making a determination under the size test and the alternative test the company and all affiliates of the company must be considered companies are affiliates of each other if one controls or has the power to control the other or a third party or parties control or have the power to control both sbics and private funds exempted from registration under certain sections of the investment company act of 1940 are not considered affiliates of a company for purposes of determining whether that company qualifies as a small business or a smaller enterprise certain debt to equity ratios must also be met if an sbic finances the change of ownership of a small business with more than 500 employees sbic regulations restrict the amount that an sbic is permitted to invest in any company and its affiliates the so called overline limit the stimulus legislation of 2009 changed the overline limit from 20 percent of regulatory capital to 10 percent of the sum of regulatory capital20 and the total amount of leverage that is projected to be used by the sbic in its business plan that was approved at the time its sbic s license was granted i e 30 percent of regulatory capital if regulatory capital is 75 million or less and the regulatory capital is proposed to be fully leveraged with two tiers of leverage by way of example if an sbic has regulatory capital of 25 million it may not invest more than 7 5 million in a single company without sba s approval assuming the sbic was approved for two tiers of leverage at the time it was licensed as an sbic sba may approve a larger percentage if necessary to protect the sbic s investment but has indicated it will give such consent only in unusual circumstances sbic regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses companies whose principal business is re lending or re investing venture capital firms leasing companies factors banks many kinds of real estate projects single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses companies that will use the proceeds outside of the united states or have more than 49 percent of their tangible assets or employees outside the united states at the time of financing or within one year following the financing unless the funding is used for a specific u s purpose that is acceptable to sba businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business and businesses that use 50 percent or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier historically sba regulations prevented an sbic or two or more sbics acting together and its associates controlled or related persons from controlling a small business except on a temporary basis to protect its investment or if the small business was a start up in december 2000 legislation was enacted eliminating the legislative basis for regulating control during the investment period effective november 21 2002 sba adopted final regulations permitting an sbic and its associates to control a small business for up to seven years and with sba s consent for a longer period to permit an orderly sale of the investment or to ensure the financial stability of the small business sbics are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest generally a conflict of interest may arise if an associate21 of the sbic has or makes an investment in the small business or serves as one of its officers or directors or would otherwise benefit from the financing investing in an associate generally requires prior sba approval unless an exception applies joint investing with an associate such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner may be made on the same terms and conditions and at the same time or on terms that are fair to the sbic terms of portfolio company financings an sbic may make investments in the form of debt with no equity features loans debt with equity features debt securities or stock rights to acquire stock and interests in limited partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures equity securities investments must be made for a term of not less than one year except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the sbic intends to participate or to protect the sbic s prior investment loans and debt securities must have amortization not exceeding straight line the permissible interest rate depends on the type of debt for straight loans the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 19 percent or ii 11 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate for debt securities the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 14 percent or ii 6 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate regulations define an sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the maximum permitted rate when more than one sbic participates in the financing the applicable interest rate is calculated adding in all points fees discounts and other costs of money other than i application fees of up to 1 percent of the proposed financing and closing fees of up to 4 percent of the financing if it is a debt security or 2 percent for loans ii permitted prepayment penalties and iii reasonable monitoring expenses each of which may be charged in addition to the permitted interest in addition an sbic may be reimbursed for its reasonable closing costs including legal fees in addition sbics may structure financings to receive a royalty based upon the improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic may also charge a default rate of interest of up to 7 percent and a royalty based on improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic is permitted to require a small business to redeem equity securities but only after one year and only for a price equal to either i the purchase price or ii a price determined at the time of redemption based on a a reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the company e g based on the book value or earnings or b fair market value determined by a professional third party appraiser mandatory redemptions not complying with these requirements will result in the investment being treated as a debt security subject to the interest restrictions described above however the small business can be required to redeem the sbic s equity security earlier than one year after its issuance if the small business has a public offering has a change of control or management or defaults under its investment agreement an sbic is permitted to retain its investment in a business that ceases to be a small business and is permitted to continue to invest in such a large business until the company has a public offering following a public offering the sbic is permitted to exercise rights to acquire securities that were obtained prior to the public offering if within one year of the initial financing by an sbic a portfolio company changes its business to one in which an sbic is prohibited from investing then the sbic must divest itself of the investment absent sba s approval to retain the investment sbic operations sba has adopted a number of regulations and policies concerning operating requirements of sbics intended to assure their proper management principal regulations and policies include an sbic using leverage must invest its idle funds not invested in small businesses in liquid safe short term investments specified in the regulations principally u s government obligations repurchase obligations with federally insured institutions with a maturity of 7 days or less and whose underlying securities are direct u s government obligations federally insured deposits and deposits in well capitalized federally insured financial institutions an sbic and its associates may provide management services to small businesses in which the sbic invests but only may charge for services at competitive rates for services actually rendered sba requires that leveraged sbics applying for a license after april 1 2004 must credit 100 percent of such fees if not paid to the sbic against the management fee otherwise payable by the sbic to the management team except for placement fees paid to associated licensed broker dealers sbics are required to value their assets annually semi annually if leverage is used pursuant to valuation guidelines approved by sba sba has issued model valuation guidelines that are similar to those customarily used by venture capital firms but do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles an sbic s ability to borrow funds from third parties is subject to sba regulation sbics may only incur unsecured debt sbics are required to file a variety of reports with sba none of which generally are considered burdensome these reports include an annual financial statement which is certified to by the sbic s independent certified public accountants and contains information concerning each portfolio company valuation reports as described above capital certificates reporting among other things changes in regulatory capital and leverageable capital reports as to changes in the sbic s management material litigation a brief report describing each investment and copies of reports sent to investors and if applicable to the sec sba will conduct regulatory examinations of each sbic on an annual basis a key regulatory metric for sba is the extent of capital impairment which is the extent of realized and in certain circumstances net unrealized losses of an sbic compared with the sbic s regulatory capital interest payments management fees organization and other expenses are included in determining realized losses sba regulations preclude the full amount of unrealized appreciation in the value of an sbic s portfolio investments from being considered when calculating capital impairment in certain circumstances if an sbic issues leverage it will be required to avoid capital impairment capital impairment will be considered to exist if the sbic s capital impairment ratio calculated by adding the sbic s realized losses and net unrealized depreciation22 and dividing the result by the sbic s private capital exceeds permitted levels detailed in the regulations and which vary depending on the proportion of equity investments made by the sbic and the ratio of outstanding leverage to leverageable capital sba has certain rights and remedies if the sbic violates sba regulations which include being in a condition of capital impairment remedies for regulatory violations are graduated in severity depending on the seriousness of capital impairment or other regulatory violation for minor regulatory infractions warnings are given for serious infractions the use of debentures may be limited or prohibited outstanding debentures may be declared to be immediately due and payable restrictions on distributions and making new investments may be imposed management fees may be required to be reduced and investors may be required to pay their unfunded capital commitments to the sbic in severe cases sba may require the limited partners to remove the partnership s general partner or manager or its officers directors managers or partners or sba may obtain appointment of a receiver for the partnership organization sbics are organized under state law as corporations limited partnerships or limited liability companies sba strongly encourages debenture sbics to be organized as limited partnerships investors investors may be either domestic or foreign individuals or entities the sbic act specifically authorizes banks and federal savings associations to invest up to 5 percent of their capital and surplus in sbics certain investors owning 33 percent or more of an sbic are required to submit certain background information to sba and are subject to sba s fingerprinting requirements all investors in an sbic and anyone owning 10 percent or more of any investor owning 10 percent of an sbic must be identified to sba in the sbic s license application diversity of ownership sba has regulations and policies designed to assure that leveraged sbics receive significant investments from investors who do not participate in or otherwise control the sbic s management additionally a leveraged sbic must receive at least 30 percent of its private capital from a total of three or more investors who are unrelated to the management and who are not affiliated with one another or from a single such investor meeting certain limited qualifications such as a bank insurance company or certain publicly traded corporations no single investor together with its affiliates may own more than 70 percent of a leveraged sbic s private capital restrictions on transfer investors in an sbic may not transfer their interests without sba s prior consent additionally as a condition to providing leverage to the sbic sba presently requires investors owning 50 percent or more of an sbic that uses leverage as well as the sbic s managers and other control persons to enter into a written agreement with sba providing for personal liability for repayment of leverage for directly or indirectly participating in a change of control of an sbic without sba s prior consent additionally without sba s consent an sbic may not release any of its investors from the liability to make the full amount of their capital contribution management fee management fees paid by sbics using leverage are subject to sba s prior approval leveraged sbics that submit license applications from and after april 1 2004 and that intend to use leverage are permitted to charge an annual management fee of up to 2 5 percent of the sum of i the amount of its regulatory capital adding back certain distributions made which reduce regulatory capital and ii the amount of debenture leverage the sbic plans to use that is approved by sba for five years and thereafter 2 5 percent of the cost basis of loans and investments in active portfolio companies however if the base on which the fee is calculated exceeds 60 million the permissible rate declines to 2 percent when the base is 120 million or more sba policies require that management fees for leveraged sbics be reduced by 100 percent of consulting board and other fees received from portfolio companies by affiliates of the sbic s general partner except for fees paid to licensed broker dealers sba only permits increases in regulatory capital to create a prospective entitlement to increased management fees i e the increased level of management fees only may be charged from the beginning of the calendar quarter in which the regulatory capital is increased not the date of the initial closing sba s policies concerning management fees are quite detailed and are set forth in tech note 7a 23 licensing sba uses a two step licensing process for first time sbics in the first phase an applicant completes and submits to sba a form entitled management assessment questionnaire maq an applicant must pay a non refundable fee of 10 000 at the time it submits the maq 24 the maq contains the elements of the applicant s business plan as well as detailed information concerning the experience of each of the principals to carry out the business plan sba generally requires that at least two substantially full time principals have at least five years of successful investment experience at a decision making level in the types of investments the applicant is proposing to make generally each individual s track record should include at least 10 15 investments with a reasonable number of complete realizations during the last ten years and preferably including some that are quite recent sba also considers how long and in what ways the management team has worked together sba views the track record of the principals and the cohesiveness of the key principals as being fundamentally important additionally sba is concerned about the internal management of the sbic they prefer a team composed of three to five principals although as few as two and as many as six also are acceptable however sba does not want dominance by a single principal over investment and other management decisions including personnel matters they do not want to license a one man band sba looks at the division of the sbic s carried interest to evaluate relationships they have an informal rule that no principal may own 50 percent or more of the carried interest unless there are only two principals and they each have 50 percent the maq is then reviewed by sba s investment committee after which the principals if appearing qualified are invited to meet with the members of the investment committee after the meeting with the applicant s principals sba s investment committee may turn the application down or issue a green light letter indicating that the applicant has passed the first part of the application process and now is authorized to file a formal application at the present time a green light letter usually is issued three to four months following submission of the maq and immediately after the interview an applicant that receives a green light letter must file its formal license application not more than 18 months after the date of that letter applicants must pay sba an additional non refundable license application fee of 20 000 at the time they submit their formal application for an sbic license 25 after receipt of the green light letter and obtaining commitments for at least the minimum required regulatory capital from investors satisfying the diversity requirement the applicant files a formal application which contains additional information about the applicant and the management team as well as the applicant s and its general partner s or manager s organizational applicant documents although the regulations require a debenture sbic to have at least 5 million of regulatory capital sba generally requires an sbic to have firm commitments when its formal license application is filed for an amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the sbic to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if it does not subsequently raise additional funds depending on the projected size of the sbic sba could require 20 25 million of private commitments or more at the time the application is filed during the formal licensing process sba seeks to determine that there is a qualified management team and that the sbic has a good chance of operating profitably sba reviews the applicant s business plan projections and organizational documents and conducts reference and other background checks including litigation searches and an fbi fingerprint check on the management team the process presently is taking approximately 6 12 months sba requires applicants to advise their investors that the investors are not entitled to rely on sba s review of the applicant in deciding whether to invest after a license application is filed and accepted for processing by sba an applicant may make pre licensing investments which will be included in the applicant s regulatory capital if they are submitted to and approved by sba prior to the investment being made sba requires 10 business days to review such pre licensing investments but approvals frequently take longer sba does not determine the quality or wisdom of the investment rather sba simply seeks to determine if the investment is made in compliance with sba regulations once licensed sba pre approval of investments is not required sba requires all principal members of the management team to attend a one day regulations class run by sba and will only permit one pre licensing investment to be made prior to at least one person from applicant attending the class arrangements for attending the regulations class are made by contacting sbia timeline applicants should assume the following timeline for securing a license and leverage management assessment questionnaire 3 6 months formal license approval 6 12 months receipt of leverage following licensing 1 2 months 10 20 months use of more than one half of one tier of leverage following licensing 6 10 months after licensing this timeline assumes the license application is filed immediately upon receipt of the green light letter licensing second funds for second sbic funds sba follows a process that is similar to licensing new funds with one important exception if certain conditions are satisfied instead of filing a maq the process is initiated by submitting a formal written request asking sba to issue a green light letter for the new fund sba now requires the submission of a nonrefundable fee in the same amount that would have been paid had a maq been submitted to utilize this process and avoid writing a new maq to obtain a green light letter there should be substantially the same management team that is pursuing an investment strategy that is substantially similar to that of the existing sbic after submission of a request outlining the proposed new sbic sba s office of operations compares the new fund and the prior fund s similarity of business plan changes in management team track record profitability liquidity and prior sba compliance record and makes a recommendation to the investment committee that in turn makes a decision whether to issue a green light letter for the new fund following receipt of that letter when the new fund has received commitments for the minimum required capital that also satisfies the diversity requirement the fund may submit a formal application for processing under sba policy the prior sbic and the follow on sbic must each agree not to co invest more than 30 percent of its investable capital with the other sbic endnotes 1 this longtime ability of banks federal savings associations and their holdings companies to invest in sbics was preserved in the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 2 u s small business administration offering circular series sbic 2019 10 a march 12 2019 3 small business administration 2017 sbic update summary 4 sbics that have surrendered their licenses or have been transferred to the office of liquidation are not included in these figures 5 a more detailed description of the non leveraged sbic program is available from pepper hamilton llp 6 a tier is sba jargon for the multiple of an sbic s regulatory capital the sbic may obtain in leverage regulatory capital is an important metric for sbics and is represented by the sum of an sbic s funded commitments from its investors plus unfunded commitments from investors that have sufficient financial means to qualify as institutional investors sba regulations describe the qualifications of institutional investors most forms of business entities with a net worth excluding however unfunded capital commitments from that entity s investors of at least 10 million qualify as institutional investors as do banks or savings and loan associations or their holding companies insurance companies pension plans for private or public sector employees and tax exempt foundations or trusts in each case with a net worth of at least 1 million if an entity institutional investor has a net worth of less than 10 million only that part of its unfunded commitment that is less than 10 percent of its net worth will be included in regulatory capital institutional investors also include individuals with a net worth exclusive of the equity of their most valuable residence of at least 10 million or if the amount committed to the sbic does not exceed 10 percent of their net worth 2 million not more than 33 percent of the sbic s regulatory capital may be invested by state or local government entities that are not pension plans 7 sba permits debenture sbics that are performing well and have seasoned portfolios to use a third tier of leverage in certain limited circumstances see the section below entitled just in time financing 8 see the section below entitled licensing 9 an sbic that makes an investment prior to the acceptance of its license application by sba will not be able to include the amount so invested in the sbic s regulatory capital 10 sba policies however require that an sbic must have invested in portfolio companies at least 50 percent of the private capital that it had drawn prior to receipt of leverage some sbics that have incurred sizeable organization expenses and or management fees prior to making investments have found it necessary to draw more than 2 5 million of private capital in order to comply with this policy additionally debenture funds may draw at a three to one ratio in certain limited circumstances 11 the regulations implementing the new markets venture capital program act of 2000 provide that an sbic may have outstanding leverage in excess of the generally applicable leverage ceiling based on investments in low income geographic areas for sbic s licensed before october 1 2009 the leverage ceiling is calculated without regard to the amount of the cost basis of equity investments in smaller enterprises located in a low income geographic area but only to the extent that such amounts do not exceed 50 percent of the sbic s leverageable capital for sbic s licensed from and after october 1 2009 the single sbic leverage ceiling is increased to 175 million if at least 50 percent of each such sbic s financings has been and will be invested in small businesses located in a low income geographic area 12 early stage sbic debentures require quarterly interest payments 13 currently sba does not permit sbics with outstanding leverage to have secured debt 14 the restrictions on distributions set forth in paragraphs one and two may cause a phantom income issue when an sbic using debentures realizes income in a year that does not exceed the amount of prior cumulative net losses distribution of such income would reduce the amount of the sbic s regulatory capital and therefore is subject to the 2 percent limitation while investors may have received the benefit of deductions for these losses in prior years although use of such losses is severely restricted for individuals they may incur phantom income in the year in which such profits arise these restrictions also may cause operating issues for sbics whose limited partnership agreements restrict the reinvestment of realized investment proceeds 15 see discussion under sbic operations 16 see sbic technote 16 17 see footnote 8 18 this percentage may be lower for certain sbics licensed before february 17 2009 19 the alternative size test uses the predominant industry for the company with its affiliates taken together 20 regulatory capital for this purpose has a somewhat more expansive definition in determining over line limits because certain distributions may be added back in 21 the definition of an associate is complex generally covering all control persons and their respective control persons but also includes other persons 22 the actual calculation is complex as certain types of unrealized appreciation are not fully credited 23 on june 21 2017 sba published for comment a draft technote 7b which upon its effectiveness will supersede technote 7a 24 before december 13 2017 sba did not charge a fee for maq filings the 10 000 fee for maq filings will apply until september 30 2021 beginning october 1 2021 the fee for maq filings will be adjusted for inflation 25 starting october 1 2018 the fee for formal sbic license applications increased from 20 000 to 25 000 and will increase annually on a federal fy basis in 5 000 increments through september 30 2021 beginning october 1 2021 the fee for formal sbic license applications will be adjusted for inflation

a small business investment company sbic is a privately owned and operated company that makes long term investments in american small businesses and is licensed by the united states small business administration sba the principal reason for a firm to become licensed as an unleveraged sbic is the special rules applying to investments in sbics made by certain financial institutions banks and federal savings associations as well as their holding companies have the ability to own or to invest in sbics and thereby to own indirectly more than 5 percent of the voting stock of a small business the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics additionally banks federal savings associations and their holding companies also receive community reinvestment act credit for sbic investments and in the case of banks and their holding companies also receive exemptions from certain capital charge regulations and lending affiliation rules under the gramm leach bliley act a business seeking a u s government contract that is a set aside for small businesses does not lose its status as a small business by reason of a control investment by an sbic this document provides a general overview of the sbic program for sbics not using leverage provided by sba the u s small business administration sba administers the sbic program through its investment division which employs approximately 80 people sba is an independent federal agency located at 409 third street sw washington dc 20006 202 205 6510 useful information about the sbic program is available on sba s website at www sba gov inv or may be obtained by contacting samuel j boyd jr 202 205 7546 sbia the sbic industry is served by an active trade association the small business investor alliance sbia which is located at 1100 h street nw suite 1200 washington dc 20005 202 628 5055 www sbia org sbia s president is brett palmer harry haskins the long term senior career sba manager of the sbic program is sbia s director of sbic relations sbia provides a variety of information and services to its members and represents the industry with sba and on capitol hill sbia publishes regular updates and is a resource for information concerning the sbic program historical perspective established by the united states congress in 1958 to stimulate long term investment in american small businesses the sbic program has evolved into a significant factor in financing smaller american businesses from the sbic program s inception to december 31 2018 sbics have provided approximately 97 6 billion of funding in more than 181 185 financings to businesses 1 including well known companies such as amgen apple computer costco federal express intel tesla and whole foods 2 the sbic program has undergone significant changes since its creation in 1958 the original program permitted only debenture leverage the small business equity enhancement act of 1992 drastically changed the sbic program it created a new form of sba leverage known as participating securities essentially preferred limited partnership interests in an sbic increased the amount of leverage available to an sbic to 90 million which subsequently was indexed to reflect changes in the cost of living since march 31 1993 and then modified in 2009 to be 150 million and again in 2018 to be 175 million required minimum private capital of 10 million for sbics using participating securities and 5 million for sbics using debentures provided for stricter sba licensing standards and enacted other changes to make the program more consistent with the private venture capital industry unlike the debenture program where sba is a creditor of the sbic which requires an sbic to make periodic interest payments the participating securities program required an sbic to pay sba a prioritized payment preferred return and a profit share when the sbic realized profits as a consequence the participating securities program was designed to permit investing in equity securities whether or not those securities had a current pay component this new program resulted in a large expansion of the number of sbic licenses granted following the burst of the technology bubble in 2002 the administration decided there no longer was a need for an equity sbic program and that the existing participating securities program would cause significant losses to sba accordingly sba decided to terminate the participating securities program and announced that beginning on october 1 2004 it would not issue commitments to use participating securities leverage or license new sbics using that leverage sba officials continue to emphasize that they believe the debenture program is working well and they want to expand it the governing law and regulations for the debenture program have undergone several revisions since 1994 that have further streamlined and improved the sbic program sba has continued its outreach to institutional investors bank regulators and prospective applicants in order to enlarge the existing debenture program and to create ways for sbics to make certain kinds of equity investments without undermining the financial integrity of the debenture program as of december 31 2018 3 there were 305 licensed sbics with approximately 15 8 billion of private capital and 11 3 billion of outstanding sba leverage of which 11 2 billion is debenture leverage and 18 million is participating securities leverage of these sbics 227 use debentures 25 use participating securities 47 do not use leverage and six are specialized sbics during the 2018 federal fiscal year october 1 september 30 federal fy ended september 30 2018 sba licensed a total of 25 sbics with approximately 1 2 billion of private capital of those 21 were debenture sbics and four were unleveraged sbics sba did not license any sbics during the first quarter of the 2019 federal fy ended december 31 2018 community reinvestment act credit current community reinvestment act cra regulations present banks other than certain small banks with a continuing need to make investments that qualify for cra purposes investment in an sbic is specifically identified in the cra regulations as a type of investment that will be presumed by the regulatory agencies to be a qualified investment for cra purposes the investment should be in an sbic that is located in or doing substantial business in the region in which the bank s assessment area is located but the sbic is not required to be headquartered within the assessment area itself the sbic act and other federal statutes explicitly permit banks bank holding companies federal savings associations and savings and loan holding companies to invest in sbics gramm leach bliley act and dodd frank act exemptions as part of the implementation of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act effective april 1 2002 the federal reserve board the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency adopted new regulations governing regulatory capital treatment for certain equity investments held by banks bank holding companies and financial holding companies under the regulations an 8 percent tier 1 capital deduction applies on covered investments that in the aggregate are less than 15 percent of an organization s tier 1 capital a 12 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 15 24 99 percent of tier 1 capital and a 25 percent deduction applies to investments aggregating 25 percent and above of tier 1 capital the regulations exempt sbic investments from such capital charges so long as their value is less than 15 percent of tier 1 capital however the amount of sbic investments will be considered when determining capital charges with respect to other investments these rules however may be affected by contemplated changes to bank capital requirements to conform to the basel iii accords in addition ownership of a 15 percent equity interest in a portfolio company by a bank affiliated sbic will not give rise to a presumption that the portfolio company is an affiliate under sections 23 a and b of the glb act the dodd frank act generally prohibits a banking entity from acquiring or retaining any equity partnership or other ownership interest in or sponsoring a private equity fund in addition non bank financial companies that engage in proprietary trading or ownership or sponsorship of a private equity fund may be subject to additional capital and quantitative limits these prohibitions are not applicable to investments in sbics the final regulations implementing the volcker rule under dodd frank act permit banking entities to invest in licensed sbics as well as in funds that have received permission from sba to file an sbic license application and to sponsor sbics investment advisers act exemption an adviser that solely advises sbics an entity that has received a green light letter authorizing it to submit a formal sbic license application to sba and an applicant that is affiliated with one or more sbics and that has applied for another sbic license is expressly exempted from the dodd frank act amendments to the investment advisers act of 1940 the advisers act which amendments require advisers to certain types of private funds to register with the securities and exchange commission or to become exempt reporting advisers the sbic advisers relief act which became law on december 4 2015 provides certain additional relief for investment advisers that advise private funds and sbics and for investment advisers that advise venture funds and sbics before the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to private funds that had assets under management in the united states of less than 150 million could rely upon the so called private fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements also prior to the enactment of the sbic advisers relief act only advisers solely to one or more venture capital funds as defined by the sec could rely upon the so called venture capital fund adviser exemption from the advisers act s investment adviser registration requirements the sbic advisers relief act revised the private fund adviser exemption by excluding sbic assets from counting towards the 150 million threshold for purposes of determining whether an investment adviser satisfies the conditions for the private fund adviser exemption and by deeming sbics to be venture capital funds for purposes of the venture capital fund adviser exemption certain exemptions from sba regulations unleveraged sbics are exempt from many sba regulations which pertain to sbics using debentures including the management ownership diversity requirement which generally prohibits a single investor from owning greater than 70 percent of an sbic and requires that at least three institutional investors which are entities or natural persons that satisfy certain net worth criteria unaffiliated with management and one another and whose investments in the sbic are significant in dollar and percentage own at least 30 percent of the sbic the overline limitations which restrict how much can be invested in any one portfolio company and its affiliates restrictions on the sbic s use of its idle funds restrictions on the sbic s incurrence of third party secured debt certain recordkeeping requirements limitations on distributions to the sbic s investors and the requirement to obtain sba approval to decrease regulatory capital 4 by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days by more than 2 percent per year but must notify sba of any reduction within 30 days prohibitions the sbic s ability to sell assets to its associates without sba approval sba consent requirements for certain types of co investments made with the sbic s associates the requirement that sba approve management services contracts with the sbic s management company and the sbic s initial management expense and any changes thereto although the sbic is required to notify sba of such initial management expenses and of any such changes the requirement to obtain sba s prior approval for new directors and officers other than the chief operating officer although the sbic is required to notify sba of any such new directors or officers within 30 days and limitations on the amount of management fees the sbic is permitted to pay sbic investments an sbic can only invest in small businesses and must invest at least 25 percent of its invested funds in smaller enterprises 5 sba regulations define a small business as a company with tangible net worth total net worth less goodwill of less than 19 56 million and average after tax income exclusive of loss carry forwards for the prior two years of less than 6 5 million a company failing that test can still qualify as a small business if it meets the size standards for its industry group under an alternative test the size standards for industry groups under this alternative test are based on the number of employees typically 500 to 1 000 for a manufacturing company or gross revenues 6 a smaller enterprise is a company with a net worth excluding goodwill of less than 6 million and average after tax income for the prior two years of less than 2 million or which meets the alternative test importantly in making a determination under the size test and the alternative test the company and all affiliates of the company must be considered companies are affiliates of each other if one controls or has the power to control the other or a third party or parties control or have the power to control both sbics and private funds exempted from registration under certain sections of the investment company act of 1940 are not considered affiliates of a company for purposes of determining whether that company qualifies as a small business or smaller enterprise certain debt to equity ratios must also be met if an sbic finances the change of ownership of a small business with more than 500 employees sbic regulations preclude investment in the following types of businesses companies whose principal business is re lending or re investing venture capital firms leasing companies factors banks many kinds of real estate projects single purpose projects that are not continuing businesses companies that will use the proceeds outside of the united states or have more than 49 percent of their tangible assets or employees outside the united states at the time of financing or within one year following the financing unless the funding is used for a specific u s purpose that is acceptable to sba businesses that are passive and do not carry on an active trade or business and businesses that use 50 percent or more of the funds to buy goods or services from an associated supplier historically sba regulations prevented an sbic or two or more sbics acting together and its associates controlled or related persons from controlling a small business except on a temporary basis to protect its investment or if the small business was a start up in december 2000 legislation was enacted eliminating the legislative basis for regulating control during the investment period effective november 21 2002 sba adopted final regulations permitting an sbic and its associates to control a small business for up to seven years and with sba s consent for a longer period to permit an orderly sale of the investment or to ensure the financial stability of the small business sbics are precluded from making investments in a small business if it would give rise to a conflict of interest generally a conflict of interest may arise if an associate7 of the sbic has or makes an investment in the small business or serves as one of its officers or directors or would otherwise benefit from the financing investing in an associate generally requires prior sba approval unless an exception applies joint investing with an associate such as another fund controlled by affiliates of the general partner may be made on the same terms and conditions and at the same time or on terms that are fair to the sbic terms of portfolio company financings an sbic may make investments in the form of debt with no equity features loans debt with equity features debt securities or stock rights to acquire stock and interests in limited partnerships limited liability companies and joint ventures equity securities investments must be made for a term of not less than one year except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the sbic intends to participate or to protect the sbic s prior investment loans and debt securities must have amortization not exceeding straight line the permissible interest rate depends on the type of debt for straight loans the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 19 percent or ii 11 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate for debt securities the maximum permitted rate is the higher of i 14 percent or ii 6 percent over the higher of the sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate regulations define an sbic s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the maximum permitted rate when more than one sbic participates in the financing the applicable interest rate is calculated adding in all points fees discounts and other costs of money other than i application fees of up t 1 percent of the proposed financing and closing fees of up to 4 percent of the financing for debt securities or 2 percent for loans ii permitted prepayment penalties and iii reasonable monitoring expenses each of which may be charged in addition to the permitted interest in addition an sbic may be reimbursed for its reasonable closing costs including legal fees an sbic may also charge a default rate of interest of up to 7 percent and a royalty based on improvement in the performance of a portfolio company after the financing an sbic is permitted to require a small business to redeem equity securities but only after one year and only for a price equal to either i the purchase price or ii a price determined at the time of redemption based on a a reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the company e g based on the book value or earnings or b fair market value determined by a professional third party appraiser mandatory redemptions not complying with these requirements will result in the investment being treated as a debt security subject to the interest restrictions described above however the small business can be required to redeem the sbic s equity security earlier than one year after its issuance if the small business has a public offering has a change of control or management or defaults under its investment agreement an sbic is permitted to retain its investment in a business that ceases to be a small business and is permitted to continue to invest in such a large business until the company has a public offering following a public offering the sbic is permitted to exercise rights to acquire securities that were obtained prior to the public offering if within one year of the initial financing by an sbic a portfolio company changes its business to one in which an sbic is prohibited from investing then the sbic must divest itself of the investment absent sba s approval to retain the investment sbic operations sba has adopted a number of regulations and policies concerning operating requirements of sbics intended to assure their proper management principal regulations and policies include an sbic and its associates may provide management services to small businesses in which the sbic invests but only may charge for services at competitive rates for services actually rendered unleveraged sbics are required to value their assets annually pursuant to valuation guidelines approved by sba sba has issued model valuation guidelines that are similar to those customarily used by venture capital firms but do not conform with generally accepted accounting principles an sbic s ability to borrow funds from third parties is subject to sba regulation although sbics using debentures may only incur unsecured debt unleveraged sbics may incur secured debt sbics are required to file a variety of reports with sba none of which generally are considered burdensome these reports include an annual financial statement which is certified to by the sbic s independent certified public accountants and contains information concerning each portfolio company valuation reports as described above capital certificates reporting among other things changes in regulatory capital reports as to changes in the sbic s management material litigation a brief report describing each investment and copies of reports sent to investors and if applicable to the sec sba will conduct regulatory examinations of each sbic on an annual basis sba has certain rights and remedies if the sbic violates sba regulations remedies for regulatory violations are graduated in severity depending on the seriousness of the regulatory violation for minor regulatory infractions warnings are given for serious infractions restrictions on distributions and making new investments may be imposed management fees may be required to be reduced and investors may be required to pay their unfunded capital commitments to the sbic in severe cases sba may require the limited partners to remove the partnership s general partner or manager or its officers directors managers or partners or sba may obtain appointment of a receiver for the partnership organization sbics are organized under state law as corporations limited partnerships or limited liability companies investors investors may be either domestic or foreign individuals or entities the sbic act specifically authorizes banks and federal savings associations to invest up to 5 percent of their capital and surplus in sbics certain investors owning 33 percent or more of an sbic are required to submit certain background information to sba and are subject to sba s fingerprinting requirements all investors in an sbic and anyone owning 10 percent or more of any investor owning 10 percent of an sbic must be identified to sba in the sbic s license application restrictions on transfer investors in an sbic may not transfer their interests without sba s prior consent additionally without sba s consent an sbic may not release any of its investors from the liability to make the full amount of their capital contribution licensing sba uses a two step licensing process for first time sbics in the first phase an applicant completes and submits to sba a form entitled management assessment questionnaire maq an applicant must pay sba a non refundable fee of 10 000 at the time it submits the maq 8 the maq contains the elements of the applicant s business plan as well as detailed information concerning the experience of each of the principals to carry out the business plan sba generally requires that at least two substantially full time principals have at least five years of successful investment experience at a decision making level in the types of investments the applicant is proposing to make generally each individual s track record should include at least 10 15 investments with a reasonable number of complete realizations during the last ten years and preferably including some that are quite recent sba also considers how long and in what ways the management team has worked together sba views the track record of the principals and the cohesiveness of the key principals as being fundamentally important additionally sba is concerned about the internal management of the sbic they prefer a team composed of three to five principals although as few as two and as many as six also are acceptable however sba does not want dominance by a single principal over investment and other management decisions including personnel matters they do not want to license a one man band sba looks at the division of the sbic s carried interest to evaluate relationships they have an informal rule that no principal may own 50 percent or more of the carried interest unless there are only two principals and they each have 50 percent the maq is then reviewed by sba s investment committee after which the principals if appearing qualified are invited to meet with the members of the investment committee after the meeting with the applicant s principals sba s investment committee may turn the application down or issue a green light letter indicating that the applicant has passed the first part of the application process and now is authorized to file a formal application at the present time a green light letter usually is issued three to four months following submission of the maq and immediately after the interview an applicant that receives a green light letter must file its formal license application not more than 18 months after the date of that letter applicants must pay he maq applicants must pay sba an additional non refundable license application fee of 25 000 at the time they submit their formal application for an sbic license 9 after receipt of the green light letter and obtaining commitments for at least the minimum required regulatory capital from investors satisfying the diversity requirement the applicant files a formal application which contains additional information about the applicant and the management team as well as the applicant s and its general partner s or manager s organizational applicant documents although the regulations require a debenture sbic to have at least 5 million of regulatory capital sba generally requires an sbic to have firm commitments when its formal license application is filed for an amount of capital that is sufficient to enable the sbic to have a first closing and conduct its operations even if it does not subsequently raise additional funds depending on the projected size of the sbic sba could require 10 20 million of private commitments for an unleveraged sbic or more at the time the application is filed during the formal licensing process sba seeks to determine that there is a qualified management team and that the sbic has a good chance of operating profitably sba reviews the applicant s business plan projections and organizational documents and conducts reference and other background checks including litigation searches and an fbi fingerprint check on the management team the process presently is taking approximately six to nine months sba requires applicants to advise their investors that the investors are not entitled to rely on sba s review of the applicant in deciding whether to invest after a license application is filed and accepted for processing by sba an applicant may make pre licensing investments which will be included in the applicant s regulatory capital if they are submitted to and approved by sba prior to the investment being made sba requires 10 business days to review such pre licensing investments but approvals frequently take longer sba does not determine the quality or wisdom of the investment rather sba simply seeks to determine if the investment is made in compliance with sba regulations once licensed sba pre approval of investments is not required sba requires all principal members of the management team to attend a one day regulations class run by sba and will only permit one pre licensing investment to be made prior to at least one person from applicant attending the class arrangements for attending the regulations class are made by contacting sbia timeline applicants should assume the following timeline for securing a license management assessment questionnaire 3 6 months formal license approval 6 12 months total 9 18 months this timeline assumes the license application is filed immediately upon receipt of the green light letter licensing second funds for second sbic funds sba follows a process that is similar to licensing new funds with one important exception if certain conditions are satisfied instead of filing a maq the process is initiated by submitting a formal written request asking sba to issue a green light letter for the new fund sba now requires the submission of a nonrefundable fee in the same amount that would have been paid had a maq been submitted to utilize this process and avoid writing a new maq to obtain a green light letter there should be substantially the same management team that is pursuing an investment strategy that is substantially similar to that of the existing sbic after submission of a request outlining the proposed new sbic sba s office of operations compares the new fund and the prior fund s similarity of business plan changes in management team track record profitability liquidity and prior sba compliance record and makes a recommendation to the investment committee that in turn makes a decision whether to issue a green light letter for the new fund following receipt of that letter when the new fund has received commitments for the minimum required capital that also satisfies the diversity requirement the fund may submit a formal application for processing under sba policy the prior sbic and the follow on sbic must each agree not to co invest more than 30 percent of its investable capital with the other sbic endnotes

kate duchene chief executive officer thank you alice good afternoon and welcome to rgp s third quarter conference call here is a quick roadmap for my remark i ll start with a brief overview of our operating results for the third quarter second i ll share some color around trends we re seeing in the fourth quarter as well as marketplace dynamics third i will discuss our progress on bill rate improvement and expanding our mix of business to higher value and more profitable offerings and fourth i will share additional detail regarding the appointment of tim brackney as our president and chief operating officer which we announced today i m delighted that tim could join us on this call as we welcome him to this important role for the company first operating results our total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 19 were 179 5 million which represents an increase of 4 1 over the third quarter a year ago we are pleased with growth in north america and asia pacific and our business in germany north america grew 6 4 asia pacific grew 4 or 7 5 constant currency and taskforce continued to deliver exceptional growth at 48 for the first time in 12 quarters europe faced a decline in revenue herb will share additional detail later in the call but let me say now that europe s challenges are a result of three primary factors first the expected completion of some large projects second a loss of focus on our pipeline development while we were delivering on those projects and third the unstable macro environment we believe is causing clients to postpone or delay critical decision making regarding project initiation this is especially true in the uk with the brexit uncertainty with respect to things we can control we have increased our sense of urgency and focus on business development pipeline development and sales management we are also evolving certain positions to bring more business development capability to the team broadly finally as i just mentioned taskforce continues to perform beyond expectations and we are actively discussing further opportunity to grow that business in europe now i want to talk for a minute about cost structure we re pleased by our progress in bringing sg a down as a percentage of revenue year over year sg a improved by 110 basis points our sg a expense was 31 of revenue versus 32 1 in the prior year third quarter and this improvement happened at a time when we have increased our marketing spend to support the launch of a new website and brand refresh we have been working hard on our brand enhancement and we ll be prepared to reveal more detail regarding our work regarding this work during our call to discuss year end results in addition we ve made important investments in headcount to accelerate our capabilities and digital engagement transformation and automation these are growth areas in our client base and we must invest in order to win further work we balance such investments against the goal of moving sg a below 30 of revenue turning to bottom line results we ve again made progress we achieved 13 9 million of adjusted ebitda or 7 8 of revenue compared to 8 7 million or 5 of revenue in the year ago quarter our pre tax q3 income more than doubled to 9 6 million from 4 6 million in the prior year quarter we intend to deliver more profit to the bottom line through a combination of improved leverage from growth careful talent management and compensation planning expense management improved pricing and expanding our mix of business to higher value services this is the third consecutive quarter we have delivered progress on this important metric as i ve stated before our long term financial objectives are to deliver 10 annual revenue growth which may include strategic growth sg a below 29 as a percentage of revenue and adjusted ebitda performance between 11 and 13 herb will share further detail regarding our financial results during his discussion in a moment my perspective on our improving results through three quarters of a fiscal year is that our strategies in evolving the business and our hard work in transforming our sales culture which includes focus and accountability are paying off at the same time we have more work to do in curating a healthy and vibrant pipeline never taking our eye off the ball there and staying committed to sales management and continuing to develop further management consultant competencies so we grow our solutions practices next i want to talk for a minute on trends we re seeing in the current quarter our weekly revenue in q4 is trending relatively flat to prior year in north america our velocity has slowed as we moved through q3 and have entered q4 i do not believe that there are fundamental obstacles in the business with such strong growth for the first half of the year we were focused on serving our clients and failed to balance enough attention on pipeline development we have also experienced slower client decision making in the u s following the holidays in the face of negative economic news the financial markets as we know brought considerable pessimism and worry in december and january we faced the government shutdown in the u s that left people feeling uncertain and we had one significant client in north america s furlough all employees post holidays for two weeks in that landscape we just did not see new significant projects launch as quickly in january and february i have said before that i do not believe our revenue trajectory will be linear given the nature of our agile human capital business model we will face some ebb and flow of project demands in our client base i can assure you that we have renewed our focus on pipeline development and are starting to see some pickup in client decision making two of the leading activity indicators we track are legal contract flow we keep increasing the number of outstanding proposals which is rising i also remain optimistic about the potential of our business as i follow marketplace trends and research and changing workforce strategies as evidenced by recent studies published by randstad the staffing industry analysts and intuit a dominant labor trend over the next five years will be the rise of the blended workforce this means that employers large and medium sized report plans to procure non employee talent to team with full time employees to get project work done in fact in randstad s report 61 of employers survey reported the intent to convert one third of full time physicians to what they call an agile labor category the rationale for such workforce strategies are twofold companies gain flexibility in procuring the exact skills needed for special projects and companies can more rapidly respond to changes in the skill sets needed without the delay and challenge of traditional employment management rgp is perfectly positioned to meet this labor trend around the globe as we excel at project scoping talent acquisition and management as well as subject matter assessments we provide both first resourcing and project delivery our talent enjoys a full suite of benefits and professional development opportunities which allows them to focus on the client and the project success we particularly welcome this growing trend given that we ve been successful selling agility to baby boomers who are traditionally more conservative in approach now we have both the client buyer and a talent base who actively seek agility and flexibility these are important macro trends for our business model which we believe will drive increasing opportunity in the future we have a unique business platform to be the blended workforce provider of choice i will now update you on our priority enterprise objectives that i laid out during our q1 call to improve pricing and to grow our higher value solutions business we are making progress on both through three quarters bill rates have improved by 2 2 in north america and 4 1 in europe for new engagements in north america bill rates have improved approximately 9 per hour since the beginning of the fiscal year in part due to progress made growing our solutions business year over year our solutions practices are up double digits through three quarters of the year led by technical accounting project and transaction services projects now before handing off to herb i wanted to again welcome tim brackney to this call as our new president and chief operating officer tim has been with rgp for 16 years joining us first as the managing director of our portland oregon office after launching his career at pwc tim relocated to the bay area in 2011 and oversaw our northern california business during a period of significant growth tim earned his mba from stanford graduate school of business so was very familiar with silicon valley and he s done a terrific job in building our business in this vibrant economy for the past two years tim has been a part of our executive team driving our revenue efforts in north america and executing our sales transformation strategies tim has performed well in leading the north american business back to growth and i m excited about his ability to have that same positive impact across all regions i believe the time is right to name a coo to align our revenue plans growth strategies and processes globally this focus is important as we drive opportunity with global clients who want a trusted provider who can deliver agile talent seamlessly wherever they operate i ll now turn the call over to herb for a more detailed review of our third quarter results herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you kate and good afternoon everyone i ll start by giving detail on our fiscal third quarter financial results and we ll then discuss the trends we re seeing in the fourth quarter starting with an overview of the third quarter results total revenue for the third quarter fiscal 19 was 179 5 million a 4 1 increase from the comparable quarter year ago sequentially revenue was down 4 9 a normal trend since this quarter includes the christmas new year s and chinese new year s holiday the first third of the quarter was very strong with some slowing after the holiday break on a constant currency basis revenue increased 5 3 year over year and decreased 4 8 sequentially our third quarter gross margin was 37 8 up 150 basis points from the prior year third quarter primarily the results of the impact of internal pricing initiatives slightly lower payroll taxes and business expenses sg a expenses were 55 6 million or 31 of revenue compared to 55 3 million 32 1 of revenue in the third in the fiscal third quarter a year ago our net income improved to 5 8 million or 0 18 per diluted share compared to 4 6 million or 0 14 per diluted share in the prior year quarter gaap tax rates were 1 in last year s quarter compared to 39 7 this year last year we had a favorable impact from the tax cuts and jobs act in q3 adjusted ebitda was 13 9 million or 7 8 of revenue compared to 8 7 million or 5 of revenue in the year ago quarter now let me discuss some of the highlights of our revenues geographically our u s performance remain solid in the quarter with revenue increasing 6 year over year the east and central south regions have been especially strong led by strong double digit growth in atlanta philadelphia cleveland and dallas chicago also continues to perform well sequentially revenue in the u s increased 4 4 primarily as the result of consultants being on holiday during christmas and new year s compared to the second quarter which includes only the thanksgiving holiday for the third quarter total revenues internationally were 37 1 million versus 38 1 million in the third quarter a year ago a decrease of 2 6 year over year on a constant currency basis revenues internationally increased by 2 7 sequentially revenues decreased 7 6 6 constant currency europe s third quarter revenue decreased 9 7 year over year and sequentially 3 5 constant year over year and 8 7 sequentially europe s growth slowed this quarter from the growth trend of the last three years especially in the u k where economic conditions are mixed we had several major projects ramp up as well as multiple client delayed project starts and some clients have been hesitant to commit on new projects asia pac continued their strong performance led by double digit growth in both china and japan turning to the early revenue trends for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 weekly revenues since q4 are trending relatively flat compared to last year if the current trend continues revenue would be in the range of 180 million to 186 million compared to 183 8 million last year as kate mentioned earlier we are positive about our forward prospects however there are some uncertainty in the market short term north americas continue to grow in most markets though at a slower rate than the last several quarters new starts slowed after the first of the years as clients late start dates on projects as mentioned earlier europe revenue has slowed while asia pac continues to grow north america is strong in most markets especially atlanta chicago dallas denver mexico city charlotte is also performing well with financial services being the catalyst in fact financial services is up globally as well northern california slowed after the holidays after several years of strong growth and southern california continues to lag europe despite issues in the u k and the netherlands had excellent results and germany led by taskforce taskforce continues to provide profitable growth asia pac s growth is being driven by china and japan and we see that continuing in the foreseeable future now turning to gross margins gross margin for the third quarter was 37 8 increasing 150 basis points from the prior year equivalent period and decreasing 110 basis points sequentially the year over year changes related primarily to improved bill pay ratio driven by aggressive internal initiatives to improve pricing as well as lower business expenses the sequential decrease was the typical decline from the reset of the payroll taxes at the beginning of the new calendar year for the third quarter our gross margin in the u s was 38 6 compared to 36 9 in the third quarter last year and our international gross margin was 34 8 compared to 34 a year ago for the fourth quarter we expect our gross margin to be in the 38 8 to 39 3 range compared to 38 3 a year ago as kate mentioned we ve been making significant strides in improving bill rates and gross margin and new deals sold as expected we re seeing the impact now the average hourly bill rate for the quarter was approximately 124 in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 123 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 bill rates are improving however the overall average is staying constant as a result of mix europe which has the highest bill rates had a decline in revenue whereas asia pac which had the lowest bill rates had increased revenue the average pay rate for the third and second quarter was approximately 62 63 last year as a reminder these hourly rates are derived based on prevailing exchange rates during each given period now looking at other components of our third quarter financial results sg a expenses were 55 6 million or 31 of revenue this compares to sg a of 55 3 million or 32 1 of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 55 million or 29 1 of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the year over year percentage decrease from last year s third quarter relates to improved leverage from revenue growth with lower severance and acquisition costs in the quarter particularly offset by benefits commission bonus expenses tied to support revenue growth sg a was up 600 000 sequentially resulted from the additional payroll and benefit costs from new headcount to support the growth of critical markets and an increase in operating expenses including rent and bad debt expense offset by lower commission bonus and severance expense stock compensation expense was 1 9 million or 1 1 of total revenue in the fourth quarter we reserved sg a to be in the range of 55 6 million to 56 4 million sequentially severance will be lower however we ll have slightly higher marketing expense and we ll also have a charge of 525 000 for loan forgiveness this loan is related to tim brackney s relocation in the northern california in 2011 at the end of the third quarter our office count was 73 47 domestic and 26 international we completed the renovation of our san francisco office and closed the former creative san francisco office during the quarter they re now fully combined with with the rgp team in san francisco turning to other components of our financial statements depreciation was just under 1 2 million and amortization was just under 1 million as a result of the improvements noted above our adjusted ebitda our cash flow margin which we define as ebitda before stock compensation and contingent consideration adjustments was 7 8 in the third quarter up from 5 a year ago our pre tax income was 9 6 million in the third quarter up from 4 6 million in the year ago quarter during the third quarter we recorded a provision for income taxes of 3 8 million representing an effective tax rate of 40 our gaap tax rate for each of the upcoming quarters is difficult to predict it could be volatile as the rate will be dependent on several factors including the operating results of our u s and foreign locations each of which are taxed or benefited at different statutory rates and the offset of the tax benefit of foreign losses in certain locations by valuation allowances on a cash basis our tax rate was about 32 and we expect the annual rate to be in the 31 to 33 range finally our gaap net income was 5 8 million or 0 18 per share during the third quarter now let me turn to the balance sheet cash and investments at the end of the third quarter were 48 million a 7 2 million increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 receivables at quarter end were approximately 138 5 million compared to 146 5 million at the end of the second quarter days of revenue outstanding were approximately 66 days compared to 64 days in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 dividends for the quarter were approximately 4 1 million capital expenditures were 5 9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 2 5 million during the quarter as we have multiple office relocations occurring this year we are transitioning to an open office footprint and the change in concept requires an investment in new office furniture we expect capex to be in the 3 million to 4 million range in q4 three of our largest offices are moving this year including two in the new york tri state area as well as our san francisco office that i mentioned earlier we are migrating to an open office layouts and enhance the collaboration for our teams as well as to reduce the overall footprint in the third quarter we repurchased 9 2 million in stock we are continually evaluating uses of cash to reduce debt and or facilitate our growth both organically and strategically in addition within days after at quarter end we paid down our revolver by 10 million our stock buyback program has 97 7 million remaining we will continue to return cash to shareholders through our quarterly dividend while amounts in debt repayment the capital requirements of growing our business organically and strategically and fiscal prudence our shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter were approximately 32 million a quick update on our acquisitions countsy the accounting as a service for venture backed start ups we acquired as part of the accretive acquisition continues to perform well revenue was up just under 20 for the quarter compared to last year and is up 14 year to date countsy was just named the bpo partner of the year by netsuite the award acknowledges their strong client count growth and their ongoing collaboration with netsuite countsy achieved this award because of their dedication to providing fast growth start ups integrated and scalable solutions before i turn the call back over to kate i d like to take a minute to thank john bower our chief accounting officer for his outstanding 21 years of service to the company i ve really enjoyed working with john the last few years he was critical to me in assisting in my transition to my role john has decided to retire enjoy some free time john thanks for everything now i d like to turn the call back over to kate for some closing comments kate duchene chief executive officer thank you herb let me also add my thanks to john it s been a privilege to work side by side with you john for the last almost 19 years we are really going to miss you while we look forward to delivering our year end report on the business in july but before turning to q a i want to remind our investors about our client continuity statistics for q3 and year to date we are proud of these statistics and we re proud for a reason it means our clients are continuing to come back to us as their trusted provider to deliver projects in a blended workforce environment our client continuity remains strong during our third quarter we served 49 of our top 50 clients from fiscal 2018 and 45 from 2017 through q3 we have 286 clients for whom we provide services at a run rate exceeding 500 000 in fees and that number is up from 257 000 in fiscal 2018 in addition our top 50 clients for the quarter represented 35 2 of total revenues while 50 of our revenues came from 111 clients our largest client for the quarter was approximately 2 4 of revenue at the end of the third quarter 90 of our top 50 clients have used more than one type of service or functional expertise and this penetration reflects the diversity of relationships we continue to build within our clients organization and reinforces the opportunity for growth so that concludes our prepared remarks and we re happy to answer any questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from andrew steinerman jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst hi i have two questions the first one might be a simple one what is a hopeful goal of creating a new coo president role obviously kate you had the title president by breaking out president and coo what does the management team collectively hope to accomplish and then also i know there was a quick call out to part of accretive and the growth there but if you can now that we re in the anniversary this just reported third quarter how did accretive overall perform in the first year with rgp kate duchene chief executive officer okay so andrew hello i ll take the first question and then i ll have herb give us some more color on accretive overall so i think the time was right now to name a coo and my overall hope is that tim and i worked very closely together could drive the same growth strategies and the planning process across all of our regions you know this year we have continued to build deeper and bigger client relationships with some of the largest companies in the world and i think these are our largest company is an household name for everyone in the technology space and i think if we can really submit ourselves as a provider of choice for those global companies which are actively migrating their workforce strategies that will be a good thing for our business and our investors overall so i need a proven leader who can help me in aligning our growth strategies our investment planning and our core processes to improve delivery to our clients and improve our consultant experience everywhere we operate so that s the primary reason for it tim s been essentially operating in this role in north america which is 80 of our business now so this is a natural extension for him he s a very talented guy and we don t want to lose him in the business too herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer and then andrew on your second question on accretive overall it s exceeded expectations when we went in we had we modeled that we would lose approximately 10 of their revenue through transition we actually ended up only losing about half of that so overall from a revenue perspective it s been very positive on the downside we lost a couple of people that were good performers that we had preferred stayed with us but they decided it was time to take look at things outside of the company but we worked hard to integrate their team within our offices and it s been an exciting transition and it s helped us a lot especially in the grc area where they re very strong and then of course countsy i highlighted this as well kate duchene chief executive officer let me just add something to andrew the post acquisition our entire goal was to stabilize revenue and to stabilize their good people in our business i think the opportunity ahead for us in the next 12 to 18 months is to really optimize some of the offerings and bring them together with some of this offerings we have in our solutions business and accelerate growth so if you think about the grc space for example which is the governance risk and compliance we probably have more capability and starting to build out automation tools that could leverage and grow that business and so that s what i mean by optimizing our capabilities together and i think that s what s still ahead of us for us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mark marcon with baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good afternoon just to start can you talk a little bit about what you re seeing in the tri state region and also can you describe a little bit with greater depth what you meant in terms of southern california in terms what you re seeing there kate duchene chief executive officer yes i m going to pass mark the question to tim since he s been leading our north america business tim brackney president north america and executive vice president revenue hi mark in tri state what we re seeing is we worked hard to stabilize our operations there and what we re starting to see is some churn there a little resurgence in our ability to kind of go to market the way that we d like to in southern california we continue to struggle a little bit with the transition of that marketplace there from being one that s entertainment entertainment dominated and then have lost some large clients to other lower cost markets so what we ve done is to try to transition our go to market approach to one that can be go after more middle market and emerging market practices there so we re sort of in the middle of that transition right now mark marcon robert w baird analyst great and tim how long do you think before we get back to growth i mean like meaningful growth in the tri state tim brackney president north america and executive vice president revenue never soon enough but i feel pretty good about the team that we ve put in place and who ve been together for the last 18 months or so and have worked real hard to transition and sort of move the aircraft carrier and so i feel very good about our prospects over the next year or so kate duchene chief executive officer yes mark can i just add something i would we focused for a long time on tri state because a lot of our financial services business was coming out of tri state but keep in mind that it doesn t live in tri state anymore so we have significant clients that have moved a lot to charlotte and are also moving to the salt lake city area as they look for lower cost markets in which to operate some of their shared service and other compliance functions so i look at now more how is our east region performing because many of our client buyers from tri state have moved say into charlotte so i look at it now more regionally and follow what we re doing in terms of rebuilding our financial services business mark marcon robert w baird analyst great and then can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives that you ve had in place in north america that tim was already in charge of north america so the expansion and the responsibilities is really global so can you talk a little bit about what would be some of the commonalities or initiatives that you would bring on a global basis herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean mark the biggest thing that we re that we will be doing and we ve already kind of started to export really relate to sales discipline and pipeline management kind of getting working off of a common process and making sure that we can stitch that together as part of the global coalition i mean we transitioned really from being i think very tribal in nature and sort of operating very geographically and now we want to be more client centric to be able to meet our clients where they work so in order to do that we need to have more commonality behind process and approach kate duchene chief executive officer yeah i d also say i think one of the things that tim has led is strong sales force adoption and sales process adoption and that is not so that we can beat on our sales teams or our client service teams it s really to get them to use the technology that we provided to make them more efficient and hopefully a better engagement in their job i mean it does also help with sales management but we need to be using that as actively everywhere we operate and that also gives us visibility across the globe to serve some of our largest clients like we ve had great growth in our pharma business and i m very bullish about our opportunities in big pharma in china for example and it s absolutely critical in delivering that that we re able to share our client development and client insights with one another mark marcon robert w baird analyst that s great and then can you give us a little bit more color with regards to what you re seeing on the ground in terms of the post holiday slowdown both as it relates to what you saw in north america and then in addition to that if you could just it sounds like germany was strong at least with the task and so when we go through and look at was it just the uk that really slowed down because of brexit or was it more dispersed across europe kate duchene chief executive officer yes let me talk about europe for a minute and then i ll pass it either to tim or herb and they can share more color in north america in the uk everyone will tell you and i m sure you ve had other clients mark that are talking about the chaos and people are getting whipsawed right so it just naturally seizes the marketplace for a while and clients it really did get slower in decision making i would say right now we re starting to feel some momentum where we re starting to bid on some big projects that we hope to hear soon so it does sound like clients are starting to pick up again in the netherlands i m disappointed in our performance in the netherlands part of that is a result of some legislative change that has happened with respect to agile business models that we re working through but that is a function too of migrating our business to higher value work less commodity oriented work which i think is important for us in the longer term that has created some short term challenges and our leader in europe right now is very active sitting in the netherlands market with the team to really drive better performance out of that group and we ve started to see some uptick in sweden for example that in some very interesting ways if i could just close some very interesting rpa business there for a large regional client that we think will grow so it is some of the natural ebb and flow of our business but we are doing all we can to control the things we can control and that is our effort and our drive and our commitment and you can be assured that the three of us at this table are focused on it every day herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer and mark in the us from a macro perspective we saw a lot of uncertainty coming out of the holiday as we know a lot of things going on government shutdown potential trade war things like that and what it did is it basically forced our clients to reprioritize so we saw a lot of delay in strategic decision making some shrinking of scope of projects at least in the initial phases and then to think about as opposed to drawing big bangs thinking about sequencing things appropriately based on strategic priorities i would say that in the last few weeks we ve seen some far but there s still some uncertainty out there mark marcon robert w baird analyst great that s terrific color thank you kate duchene chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you operator instructions and i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the call back to kate duchene ceo for any closing remarks kate duchene chief executive officer thank you operator and again thank you for attending this call and your interest in rgp we ll look

2018 proved to be a difficult year for mexican hotels and while 2019 might still have some recurring economic political and industry specific challenges some positive themes within them are showing there s still room for optimism now is the time for mexican hotel owners and investors to take action and those who are able to deftly ride rough waters ahead will emerge the most victorious below i highlight five themes to watch in 2019 1 political changes and their effects on tourism on 10 march 2019 mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador completed the first 100 days of his six year term much has already occurred but the three main policy impacts to the tourism industry in mexico include cancelling the construction of mexico city s new international airport eliminating the mexico tourism promotion council cptm and redirecting these important marketing funds to finance a mayan train route and closing the mexican investment promotion agency promexico offices and redirecting these efforts to the embassies and consulates promoting mexico as a destination for high spending international travelers is critical to maintaining the positive tourism growth rates that contribute importantly to mexican gdp employment and competitiveness eliminating the cptm is very concerning and its efforts must be replaced with appropriate promotional strategies to sustain international visitation growth although it remains to be seen whether nationalistic economic policies with a social inclusion focus will actually benefit the majority of mexicans as of today amlo s public popularity and consumer confidence remains high certainly positive public policies concerning improved services and livability conditions in key tourism destinations like los cabos will help social integration yet corporate confidence remains low the domestic business community and foreign investors appear to be losing confidence in the mexican economy and private investment remains stalled 2 economic headwinds and their links to business demand besides political uncertainty economic headwinds usually lead companies to postpone important decision making and investments slower business investment and tighter discretionary spending affects lodging demand and revenue per available room growth according to str parent company of hnn political and economic uncertainty hampered performance in 2018 with revpar down 3 2 in u s dollars furthermore international credit rating agencies and global financial institutions are concerned about the lower expected economic growth levels in mexico and the imf recently lowered its 2019 economic growth projections from 2 5 in october 2018 to 2 1 in january 2019 although the signature of the t mec which replaced nafta in december 2018 eased commercial tensions between the u s and mexico it still requires ratification consequently business tourism to key industrial cities in mexico is being affected pending further clarity on the new legislation and the reactivation of stalled investment projects the recent u s government shutdown also affected lodging demand in mexican border cities like ciudad juárez and tijuana the shutdown however as well as u s trade issues with china have weakened the u s dollar and positively helped the mexican peso to appreciate more than 2 since the beginning of the year 3 safety security and seaweed all softening leisure demand safety and security concerns and the seaweed outbreak have also affected u s leisure visitation to key resort markets like cancún and the riviera maya since lower u s visitation to these key markets has been offset by more price sensitive domestic and regional latin american visitors primarily from colombia lower adrs have been achieved moreover differences in seasonality and shorter booking windows for local travelers have limited the ability of operators to maximize rates which ultimately affects profitability additional softening effects in cancún and the riviera maya are being felt due to lower visitation from the united kingdom an impact of brexit fewer tourists from argentina due to their economic weaknesses above average hotel supply growth and greater competition from alternative lodging options according to the cancún hotel association it took more than 40 years for cancún to reach 30 000 hotel rooms and airbnb reached the same level of available supply there in only seven years 4 other financial impacts on hospitality businesses other financial effects that hospitality businesses will feel in 2019 include higher labor costs from minimum wage increases raised 16 2 for the year energy prices interest rates and credit risk spreads to combat reduced operating margins from rising utilities prices various mexican publicly traded hospitality companies recently engaged external experts to find long term savings solutions interest rates continue to rise in december 2018 the mexican central bank increased its base interest rate to 8 25 due to the uncertainty of amlo s economic policies as well as to reduce the risk of higher inflation as a result mexican peso denominated lending rates for hospitality developments are now about 250 to 300 basis points higher than the tiie interbank rate presently around 8 5 yielding a total loan cost of about 11 to 12 per year depending on other project attributes to compensate for this higher cost of capital and risk investors now require higher returns but as mentioned above operating performance has decreased therefore cap rates have increased and reduced implied values and will likely slow transaction volumes 5 slow lodging transaction volumes that will soon favor buyers last year was a seller s market with multiple larger 100 million or more hotel sales that took place in primary cities like mexico city los cabos and the riviera maya whereby sellers mostly involved u s public companies and buyers were private mexican families or funds examples include hyatt hotels corporation s sale of the hyatt regency in mexico city for 365 million host hotels resorts joint venture sale of the jw marriott in mexico city for 183 million brookfield s sale of the hilton in los cabos for 167 million marriott international s joint venture sale of the w in mexico city for 112 million although various key ownership groups are looking to divest in 2019 disconnects in expected valuations between sellers and buyers will keep transaction volumes slow in the short term the medium term however will present good buying opportunities particularly for private investment groups with longer holding periods and greater tolerance for volatility notably since amlo cancelled the construction of mexico city s new international airport in late 2018 mexican lodging investors have begun seeking safer acquisition and diversification opportunities in the caribbean europe and the u s for example mexico based rlh properties recently acquired the luxurious villa magna hotel in madrid for 210 million 236 million and is seeking other investments in spain and europe the reported purchase yield was less than 2 which demonstrates the flight to safety into international premium assets 2019 should continue to be an active year for management changes brand conversions and product renovations as owners will seek to strengthen distribution and product positioning in both urban and resort markets at this point in the mexican lodging cycle amresorts for instance recently signed two new resort conversion deals in the riviera maya with the oasis hotels resorts following the trend of strategic partnerships in the all inclusive resort sector that i wrote about a few months ago 2019 outlook summary i believe that mexico s hospitality industry will benefit from strong support and resources from the private sector indeed mexico s hospitality industry benefits from strong private sector leadership and influence led by the important national council of tourism enterprises which is comprised of 15 important national chambers and associations that collectively represent over 90 of the tourism activities of the country as the multiple interviews at the recent 2019 mexico hotel tourism investment conference revealed the country s hospitality sector still has whitespace for new brands operators products niches and innovation country wide and sector specific business conditions however must improve for all stakeholders to thrive with mexico s hotel industry facing political changes and economic slowdowns and its sector s performance declining the evaluation of investment strategies and operating tactics proves critical ultimately 2019 should reflect as they say in mexico a río revuelto ganancia de pescadores translation there is always

in this 2013 photo containers of export goods are piled at a port in qingdao in eastern china s shandong province china has the world s second largest economy and asia is on track to have four of earth s 10 biggest economies in coming years anger over income inequality and stagnant wage growth in the middle class has roiled u s politics for years this has had the spillover effect of promoting irrational views of international trade many politicians and activists on both the left and right simply fail to recognize that for two centuries such trade has driven global economic growth and more recently created a massive global middle class of more than 3 billion people far from international trade being one more way for the 1 percenters to exploit other americans it most helps low and middle income families by driving down the cost of goods yes deals like the north american free trade agreement can wipe out jobs but they also create many well paying jobs and a persuasive 2016 study was the latest to discredit the claim that nafta hammered overall u s employment in promoting ratification of the u s mexico canada agreement the successor deal to nafta negotiated by his administration president donald trump appears to have come around to understanding the importance of trade with america s immediate neighbors but trump and america in general need to have an epiphany on the importance of trade with asia then reject the populist impulses and shaky economics that stalled the promising trans pacific partnership in 2016 advertisement that s because the opportunity for u s exports to bloom and for u s companies to expand in asia goes far beyond china now the second largest economy after america a january report on the investopedia website based on 2018 international monetary fund data showed japan has the third largest economy after decades as the second largest india has already passed france to become the sixth largest economy and should pass the united kingdom to become the fifth largest economy this year or in 2020 south korea is on track to pass canada as the 10th largest within three years at which point asia would have three of the world s top five economies and four of its top 10 in the heritage foundation s 2018 ranking of 183 nations for their openness to free trade japan and south korea are in the middle of the pack and china and india are somewhat worse the united states is 48th down from 11th in 2016 because of trump s expansion of tariffs on imports all five would benefit from more access to each others markets unfortunately instead of ambitious deals like nafta trade talks with the asian economic powerhouses have been more about trump s tariffs and his largely unfounded concerns about trade imbalances remember in 2018 the u s economy thrived despite the highest trade deficit since 2008 advertisement results if not rhetoric have been limited in november trump signed his administration s first bilateral trade deal with south korea with few significant changes from a previous accord on thursday the president declared that the u s and china may announce a vaguely described but very monumental deal within a month after their ninth round of negotiations on april 15 16 japanese economic revitalization minister toshimitsu motegi is coming to the u s for trade talks u s and indian officials are far apart in ongoing negotiations over trade in electronic medical and agricultural products domestic politics can get in the way of healthy trade policies but if washington beijing tokyo new delhi and seoul want to boost their nations economies history shows the path to take lowering barriers to free trade and letting the free market create jobs and more affordable goods

whatever one thinks of donald trump s proposal to build a beautiful wall it is unlikely to resolve the crisis sending ever more people largely from central america to america s borders the problems that drive large numbers to leave their homes and trust their families to criminal gangs will not be solved by bigger fences but better thinking fundamentally the united states should regard mexico and central america not as adversaries but as economic partners in a world increasingly defined by competition between the u s and an ever more aggressive china determined to establish global hegemony even in our hemisphere in this context a strong policy of investment and aid to our southern neighbors makes both economic and political sense the american relationship with mexico and central america is implicitly complementary the u s and mexico not only exchange products and services they also produce them jointly american manufacturing or value added inputs represent 40 percent of every dollar mexico exports to the united states chinese exports to the u s represent only one tenth as much mexico complements the u s in ways that promote regional competitiveness capital abundance and high skilled labor in the u s are complemented by low skilled labor abundance and capital scarcity in mexico factors that are if anything even more evident in central america the region s weak human capital accumulation has hobbled its integration with advanced trading partners like the united states in central america more than half of youths between 15 and 24 are out of the educational system and most work at poorly paid jobs only 38 percent of central american youths aged 27 to 29 hold a high school degree compared with 61 percent in the rest of latin america the 1994 passage of nafta led to a period of unprecedented growth and optimism mexico enjoyed macroeconomic stability during which inflation exchange rate volatility and short term interest rates converged with those of the u s economic cycles in industrial production also converged in both countries this emergence was derailed first by china s 2001 entry into the world trade organization and then by the great recession the recession is now a bad memory but china s influence has only grown by 2003 china had surpassed mexico as the second leading importer to the united states behind canada by granting wto membership and most favored nation status to china the u s opened the door for an expansion of chinese manufactured exports to the detriment of traditional sources such as mexico which lost around 650 000 manufacturing jobs from 1995 to 2016 a big overlap exists in the kinds of products clothing automotive and consumer electronics in which both mexico and china excelled the two countries export mixes to the u s became similar just when china increased its manufacturing export capacity mexico specialized in industries and activities in which in some cases china would eventually develop a comparative advantage in 2006 mexico s maquiladoras mostly lower tech factories requiring semi skilled labor to do assembly and finishing work generated more than 25 billion in foreign exchange and accounted for 44 percent of total mexican manufacturing exports 94 percent of maquiladora exports went to the u s as china s access to u s markets grew the maquiladora industry lost jobs largely to china s benefit the increase in chinese exports to the u s hurt mexican labor markets which faced a negative demand shock after 2001 these shocks may have been disproportionately large in the case of manufacturing establishments that use unskilled labor especially for maquiladoras in the border region these factories production structures resembled those of chinese firms and they were thus more vulnerable to china s enhanced presence in the u s import market the displacement of mexican manufacturing products in the u s market led to a decrease in mexican wages and the negative effects spilled over to wages paid in nonmanufacturing industries the decline of manufacturing in mexico has had a devastating impact on the country as china s dominance as a u s trading partner has grown mexico has seen a rapid rise of crime and corruption the once bright hope seen for the country largely as a result of close cooperation with the united states has faded and led most recently to the election of its most aggressively left wing president in 50 years andrés manuel lópez obrador the results south of mexico were even worse in the pre china era mexican manufacturers would move some their more labor intensive operations to central america where costs were lower but as the mexican economy has failed to expand such movement has decreased instead of new production many of these countries simply import manufactured goods from china rather than building industries for liftoff while they export commodities to beijing chinese merchandise imports by central american countries costa rica dominican republic el salvador guatemala and honduras rose from 4 7 billion in 2011 to 8 5 billion in 2017 according to united nations statistics what we now see at the border the desperate movement of families reflects this sad reality as in mexico the nations of central america are afflicted by high unemployment slowing growth and rising criminality if prosperity never fully arrived in mexico it was only scarcely glimpsed farther south this situation and mass migration can be addressed only through a strategic repositioning by the region s dominant economic power this would include more incentives for american businesses that have already decided to move operations out of the country and shift them to mexico where they would at least benefit both countries instead of to china for president trump whose comments about latin america are often both ill conceived and poorly received this initiative would deprive china of markets and allow our closest neighbors to share in a new north american prosperity it s an idea that has gained some support within the administration and from both republicans such as marco rubio and democrats like prospective presidential candidates julian castro and joe biden a bold program that steers american investment and that of allies to mexico and central america could be critical to bolstering our trade position and creating newly receptive customers and it could reshape the immigration debate by slowing migration a win both for america and those countries desperately in need of creating opportunity for their citizens it also would serve to address the historic gap between our neighbors and ourselves there s an old saying in mexico ascribed to the nineteenth century dictator porfirio díaz pobre me xico tan lejos de dios y tan cerca de los estados unidos which means poor mexico so far from god and so close to the u s a reimagined american mexican alliance would make both sides happy to be neighbors again photo by mario

third i will discuss our progress on bill rate improvement and expanding our mix of business to higher value and more profitable offerings and fourth i will share additional detail regarding the appointment of tim brackney as our president and chief operating officer which we announced today i m delighted that tim could join us on this call as we welcome him to this important role for the company advertisement advertisement first operating results our total revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 19 were 179 5 million which represents an increase of 4 1 over the third quarter a year ago we are pleased with growth in north america and asia pacific and our business in germany north america grew 6 4 asia pacific grew 4 or 7 5 constant currency and taskforce continued to deliver exceptional growth at 48 for the first time in 12 quarters europe faced a decline in revenue herb will share additional detail later in the call but let me say now that europe s challenges are a result of three primary factors first the expected completion of some large projects second a loss of focus on our pipeline development while we were delivering on those projects and third the unstable macro environment we believe is causing clients to postpone or delay critical decision making regarding project initiation this is especially true in the uk with the brexit uncertainty with respect to things we can control we have increased our sense of urgency and focus on business development pipeline development and sales management we are also evolving certain positions to bring more business development capability to the team broadly finally as i just mentioned taskforce continues to perform beyond expectations and we are actively discussing further opportunity to grow that business in europe now i want to talk for a minute about cost structure we re pleased by our progress in bringing sg a down as a percentage of revenue year over year sg a improved by 110 basis points our sg a expense was 31 of revenue versus 32 1 in the prior year third quarter and this improvement happened at a time when we have increased our marketing spend to support the launch of a new website and brand refresh we have been working hard on our brand enhancement and we ll be prepared to reveal more detail regarding our work regarding this work during our call to discuss year end results in addition we ve made important investments in headcount to accelerate our capabilities and digital engagement transformation and automation these are growth areas in our client base and we must invest in order to win further work we balance such investments against the goal of moving sg a below 30 of revenue advertisement advertisement turning to bottom line results we ve again made progress we achieved 13 9 million of adjusted ebitda or 7 8 of revenue compared to 8 7 million or 5 of revenue in the year ago quarter our pre tax q3 income more than doubled to 9 6 million from 4 6 million in the prior year quarter we intend to deliver more profit to the bottom line through a combination of improved leverage from growth careful talent management and compensation planning expense management improved pricing and expanding our mix of business to higher value services this is the third consecutive quarter we have delivered progress on this important metric as i ve stated before our long term financial objectives are to deliver 10 annual revenue growth which may include strategic growth sg a below 29 as a percentage of revenue and adjusted ebitda performance between 11 and 13 herb will share further detail regarding our financial results during his discussion in a moment my perspective on our improving results through three quarters of a fiscal year is that our strategies in evolving the business and our hard work in transforming our sales culture which includes focus and accountability are paying off at the same time we have more work to do in curating a healthy and vibrant pipeline never taking our eye off the ball there and staying committed to sales management and continuing to develop further management consultant competencies so we grow our solutions practices next i want to talk for a minute on trends we re seeing in the current quarter our weekly revenue in q4 is trending relatively flat to prior year in north america our velocity has slowed as we moved through q3 and have entered q4 i do not believe that there are fundamental obstacles in the business with such strong growth for the first half of the year we were focused on serving our clients and failed to balance enough attention on pipeline development we have also experienced slower client decision making in the u s following the holidays in the face of negative economic news the financial markets as we know brought considerable pessimism and worry in december and january we faced the government shutdown in the u s that left people feeling uncertain and we had one significant client in north america s furlough all employees post holidays for two weeks in that landscape we just did not see new significant projects launch as quickly in january and february i have said before that i do not believe our revenue trajectory will be linear given the nature of our agile human capital business model we will face some ebb and flow of project demands in our client base i can assure you that we have renewed our focus on pipeline development and are starting to see some pickup in client decision making two of the leading activity indicators we track are legal contract flow we keep increasing the number of outstanding proposals which is rising advertisement advertisement i also remain optimistic about the potential of our business as i follow marketplace trends and research and changing workforce strategies as evidenced by recent studies published by randstad the staffing industry analysts and intuit a dominant labor trend over the next five years will be the rise of the blended workforce this means that employers large and medium sized report plans to procure non employee talent to team with full time employees to get project work done in fact in randstad s report 61 of employers survey reported the intent to convert one third of full time physicians to what they call an agile labor category the rationale for such workforce strategies are twofold companies gain flexibility in procuring the exact skills needed for special projects and companies can more rapidly respond to changes in the skill sets needed without the delay and challenge of traditional employment management rgp is perfectly positioned to meet this labor trend around the globe as we excel at project scoping talent acquisition and management as well as subject matter assessments we provide both first resourcing and project delivery our talent enjoys a full suite of benefits and professional development opportunities which allows them to focus on the client and the project success we particularly welcome this growing trend given that we ve been successful selling agility to baby boomers who are traditionally more conservative in approach now we have both the client buyer and a talent base who actively seek agility and flexibility these are important macro trends for our business model which we believe will drive increasing opportunity in the future we have a unique business platform to be the blended workforce provider of choice i will now update you on our priority enterprise objectives that i laid out during our q1 call to improve pricing and to grow our higher value solutions business we are making progress on both through three quarters bill rates have improved by 2 2 in north america and 4 1 in europe for new engagements in north america bill rates have improved approximately 9 per hour since the beginning of the fiscal year in part due to progress made growing our solutions business year over year our solutions practices are up double digits through three quarters of the year led by technical accounting project and transaction services projects advertisement advertisement now before handing off to herb i wanted to again welcome tim brackney to this call as our new president and chief operating officer tim has been with rgp for 16 years joining us first as the managing director of our portland oregon office after launching his career at pwc tim relocated to the bay area in 2011 and oversaw our northern california business during a period of significant growth tim earned his mba from stanford graduate school of business so was very familiar with silicon valley and he s done a terrific job in building our business in this vibrant economy for the past two years tim has been a part of our executive team driving our revenue efforts in north america and executing our sales transformation strategies tim has performed well in leading the north american business back to growth and i m excited about his ability to have that same positive impact across all regions i believe the time is right to name a coo to align our revenue plans growth strategies and processes globally this focus is important as we drive opportunity with global clients who want a trusted provider who can deliver agile talent seamlessly wherever they operate i ll now turn the call over to herb for a more detailed review of our third quarter results herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you kate and good afternoon everyone i ll start by giving detail on our fiscal third quarter financial results and we ll then discuss the trends we re seeing in the fourth quarter starting with an overview of the third quarter results total revenue for the third quarter fiscal 19 was 179 5 million a 4 1 increase from the comparable quarter year ago sequentially revenue was down 4 9 a normal trend since this quarter includes the christmas new year s and chinese new year s holiday the first third of the quarter was very strong with some slowing after the holiday break on a constant currency basis revenue increased 5 3 year over year and decreased 4 8 sequentially our third quarter gross margin was 37 8 up 150 basis points from the prior year third quarter primarily the results of the impact of internal pricing initiatives slightly lower payroll taxes and business expenses sg a expenses were 55 6 million or 31 of revenue compared to 55 3 million 32 1 of revenue in the third in the fiscal third quarter a year ago our net income improved to 5 8 million or 0 18 per diluted share compared to 4 6 million or 0 14 per diluted share in the prior year quarter gaap tax rates were 1 in last year s quarter compared to 39 7 this year last year we had a favorable impact from the tax cuts and jobs act in q3 adjusted ebitda was 13 9 million or 7 8 of revenue compared to 8 7 million or 5 of revenue in the year ago quarter now let me discuss some of the highlights of our revenues geographically our u s performance remain solid in the quarter with revenue increasing 6 year over year the east and central south regions have been especially strong led by strong double digit growth in atlanta philadelphia cleveland and dallas chicago also continues to perform well sequentially revenue in the u s increased 4 4 primarily as the result of consultants being on holiday during christmas and new year s compared to the second quarter which includes only the thanksgiving holiday advertisement advertisement for the third quarter total revenues internationally were 37 1 million versus 38 1 million in the third quarter a year ago a decrease of 2 6 year over year on a constant currency basis revenues internationally increased by 2 7 sequentially revenues decreased 7 6 6 constant currency europe s third quarter revenue decreased 9 7 year over year and sequentially 3 5 constant year over year and 8 7 sequentially europe s growth slowed this quarter from the growth trend of the last three years especially in the u k where economic conditions are mixed we had several major projects ramp up as well as multiple client delayed project starts and some clients have been hesitant to commit on new projects asia pac continued their strong performance led by double digit growth in both china and japan turning to the early revenue trends for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 weekly revenues since q4 are trending relatively flat compared to last year if the current trend continues revenue would be in the range of 180 million to 186 million compared to 183 8 million last year as kate mentioned earlier we are positive about our forward prospects however there are some uncertainty in the market short term north americas continue to grow in most markets though at a slower rate than the last several quarters new starts slowed after the first of the years as clients late start dates on projects as mentioned earlier europe revenue has slowed while asia pac continues to grow north america is strong in most markets especially atlanta chicago dallas denver mexico city charlotte is also performing well with financial services being the catalyst in fact financial services is up globally as well northern california slowed after the holidays after several years of strong growth and southern california continues to lag europe despite issues in the u k and the netherlands had excellent results and germany led by taskforce taskforce continues to provide profitable growth asia pac s growth is being driven by china and japan and we see that continuing in the foreseeable future now turning to gross margins gross margin for the third quarter was 37 8 increasing 150 basis points from the prior year equivalent period and decreasing 110 basis points sequentially the year over year changes related primarily to improved bill pay ratio driven by aggressive internal initiatives to improve pricing as well as lower business expenses the sequential decrease was the typical decline from the reset of the payroll taxes at the beginning of the new calendar year for the third quarter our gross margin in the u s was 38 6 compared to 36 9 in the third quarter last year and our international gross margin was 34 8 compared to 34 a year ago for the fourth quarter we expect our gross margin to be in the 38 8 to 39 3 range compared to 38 3 a year ago advertisement advertisement as kate mentioned we ve been making significant strides in improving bill rates and gross margin and new deals sold as expected we re seeing the impact now the average hourly bill rate for the quarter was approximately 124 in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 123 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 bill rates are improving however the overall average is staying constant as a result of mix europe which has the highest bill rates had a decline in revenue whereas asia pac which had the lowest bill rates had increased revenue the average pay rate for the third and second quarter was approximately 62 63 last year as a reminder these hourly rates are derived based on prevailing exchange rates during each given period now looking at other components of our third quarter financial results sg a expenses were 55 6 million or 31 of revenue this compares to sg a of 55 3 million or 32 1 of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 55 million or 29 1 of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the year over year percentage decrease from last year s third quarter relates to improved leverage from revenue growth with lower severance and acquisition costs in the quarter particularly offset by benefits commission bonus expenses tied to support revenue growth sg a was up 600 000 sequentially resulted from the additional payroll and benefit costs from new headcount to support the growth of critical markets and an increase in operating expenses including rent and bad debt expense offset by lower commission bonus and severance expense stock compensation expense was 1 9 million or 1 1 of total revenue in the fourth quarter we reserved sg a to be in the range of 55 6 million to 56 4 million sequentially severance will be lower however we ll have slightly higher marketing expense and we ll also have a charge of 525 000 for loan forgiveness this loan is related to tim brackney s relocation in the northern california in 2011 at the end of the third quarter our office count was 73 47 domestic and 26 international we completed the renovation of our san francisco office and closed the former creative san francisco office during the quarter they re now fully combined with with the rgp team in san francisco turning to other components of our financial statements depreciation was just under 1 2 million and amortization was just under 1 million as a result of the improvements noted above our adjusted ebitda our cash flow margin which we define as ebitda before stock compensation and contingent consideration adjustments was 7 8 in the third quarter up from 5 a year ago our pre tax income was 9 6 million in the third quarter up from 4 6 million in the year ago quarter during the third quarter we recorded a provision for income taxes of 3 8 million representing an effective tax rate of 40 our gaap tax rate for each of the upcoming quarters is difficult to predict it could be volatile as the rate will be dependent on several factors including the operating results of our u s and foreign locations each of which are taxed or benefited at different statutory rates and the offset of the tax benefit of foreign losses in certain locations by valuation allowances on a cash basis our tax rate was about 32 and we expect the annual rate to be in the 31 to 33 range finally our gaap net income was 5 8 million or 0 18 per share during the third quarter now let me turn to the balance sheet cash and investments at the end of the third quarter were 48 million a 7 2 million increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2019 receivables at quarter end were approximately 138 5 million compared to 146 5 million at the end of the second quarter days of revenue outstanding were approximately 66 days compared to 64 days in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 dividends for the quarter were approximately 4 1 million capital expenditures were 5 9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 2 5 million during the quarter as we have multiple office relocations occurring this year we are transitioning to an open office footprint and the change in concept requires an investment in new office furniture we expect capex to be in the 3 million to 4 million range in q4 three of our largest offices are moving this year including two in the new york tri state area as well as our san francisco office that i mentioned earlier we are migrating to an open office layouts and enhance the collaboration for our teams as well as to reduce the overall footprint in the third quarter we repurchased 9 2 million in stock we are continually evaluating uses of cash to reduce debt and or facilitate our growth both organically and strategically in addition within days after at quarter end we paid down our revolver by 10 million our stock buyback program has 97 7 million remaining we will continue to return cash to shareholders through our quarterly dividend while amounts in debt repayment the capital requirements of growing our business organically and strategically and fiscal prudence our shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter were approximately 32 million a quick update on our acquisitions countsy the accounting as a service for venture backed start ups we acquired as part of the accretive acquisition continues to perform well revenue was up just under 20 for the quarter compared to last year and is up 14 year to date countsy was just named the bpo partner of the year by netsuite the award acknowledges their strong client count growth and their ongoing collaboration with netsuite countsy achieved this award because of their dedication to providing fast growth start ups integrated and scalable solutions before i turn the call back over to kate i d like to take a minute to thank john bower our chief accounting officer for his outstanding 21 years of service to the company i ve really enjoyed working with john the last few years he was critical to me in assisting in my transition to my role john has decided to retire enjoy some free time john thanks for everything now i d like to turn the call back over to kate for some closing comments kate duchene chief executive officer thank you herb let me also add my thanks to john it s been a privilege to work side by side with you john for the last almost 19 years we are really going to miss you while we look forward to delivering our year end report on the business in july but before turning to q a i want to remind our investors about our client continuity statistics for q3 and year to date we are proud of these statistics and we re proud for a reason it means our clients are continuing to come back to us as their trusted provider to deliver projects in a blended workforce environment our client continuity remains strong during our third quarter we served 49 of our top 50 clients from fiscal 2018 and 45 from 2017 through q3 we have 286 clients for whom we provide services at a run rate exceeding 500 000 in fees and that number is up from 257 000 in fiscal 2018 in addition our top 50 clients for the quarter represented 35 2 of total revenues while 50 of our revenues came from 111 clients our largest client for the quarter was approximately 2 4 of revenue at the end of the third quarter 90 of our top 50 clients have used more than one type of service or functional expertise and this penetration reflects the diversity of relationships we continue to build within our clients organization and reinforces the opportunity for growth so that concludes our prepared remarks and we re happy to answer any questions thank you questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from andrew steinerman jpmorgan your line is now open andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst hi i have two questions the first one might be a simple one what is a hopeful goal of creating a new coo president role obviously kate you had the title president by breaking out president and coo what does the management team collectively hope to accomplish and then also i know there was a quick call out to part of accretive and the growth there but if you can now that we re in the anniversary this just reported third quarter how did accretive overall perform in the first year with rgp kate duchene chief executive officer okay so andrew hello i ll take the first question and then i ll have herb give us some more color on accretive overall so i think the time was right now to name a coo and my overall hope is that tim and i worked very closely together could drive the same growth strategies and the planning process across all of our regions you know this year we have continued to build deeper and bigger client relationships with some of the largest companies in the world and i think these are our largest company is an household name for everyone in the technology space and i think if we can really submit ourselves as a provider of choice for those global companies which are actively migrating their workforce strategies that will be a good thing for our business and our investors overall so i need a proven leader who can help me in aligning our growth strategies our investment planning and our core processes to improve delivery to our clients and improve our consultant experience everywhere we operate so that s the primary reason for it tim s been essentially operating in this role in north america which is 80 of our business now so this is a natural extension for him he s a very talented guy and we don t want to lose him in the business too herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer and then andrew on your second question on accretive overall it s exceeded expectations when we went in we had we modeled that we would lose approximately 10 of their revenue through transition we actually ended up only losing about half of that so overall from a revenue perspective it s been very positive on the downside we lost a couple of people that were good performers that we had preferred stayed with us but they decided it was time to take look at things outside of the company but we worked hard to integrate their team within our offices and it s been an exciting transition and it s helped us a lot especially in the grc area where they re very strong and then of course countsy i highlighted this as well kate duchene chief executive officer let me just add something to andrew the post acquisition our entire goal was to stabilize revenue and to stabilize their good people in our business i think the opportunity ahead for us in the next 12 to 18 months is to really optimize some of the offerings and bring them together with some of this offerings we have in our solutions business and accelerate growth so if you think about the grc space for example which is the governance risk and compliance we probably have more capability and starting to build out automation tools that could leverage and grow that business and so that s what i mean by optimizing our capabilities together and i think that s what s still ahead of us for us andrew steinerman jpmorgan analyst great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from mark marcon with baird your line is now open mark marcon robert w baird analyst good afternoon just to start can you talk a little bit about what you re seeing in the tri state region and also can you describe a little bit with greater depth what you meant in terms of southern california in terms what you re seeing there kate duchene chief executive officer yes i m going to pass mark the question to tim since he s been leading our north america business tim brackney president north america and executive vice president revenue hi mark in tri state what we re seeing is we worked hard to stabilize our operations there and what we re starting to see is some churn there a little resurgence in our ability to kind of go to market the way that we d like to in southern california we continue to struggle a little bit with the transition of that marketplace there from being one that s entertainment entertainment dominated and then have lost some large clients to other lower cost markets so what we ve done is to try to transition our go to market approach to one that can be go after more middle market and emerging market practices there so we re sort of in the middle of that transition right now mark marcon robert w baird analyst great and tim how long do you think before we get back to growth i mean like meaningful growth in the tri state tim brackney president north america and executive vice president revenue never soon enough but i feel pretty good about the team that we ve put in place and who ve been together for the last 18 months or so and have worked real hard to transition and sort of move the aircraft carrier and so i feel very good about our prospects over the next year or so kate duchene chief executive officer yes mark can i just add something i would we focused for a long time on tri state because a lot of our financial services business was coming out of tri state but keep in mind that it doesn t live in tri state anymore so we have significant clients that have moved a lot to charlotte and are also moving to the salt lake city area as they look for lower cost markets in which to operate some of their shared service and other compliance functions so i look at now more how is our east region performing because many of our client buyers from tri state have moved say into charlotte so i look at it now more regionally and follow what we re doing in terms of rebuilding our financial services business mark marcon robert w baird analyst great and then can you talk a little bit about some of the initiatives that you ve had in place in north america that tim was already in charge of north america so the expansion and the responsibilities is really global so can you talk a little bit about what would be some of the commonalities or initiatives that you would bring on a global basis herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean mark the biggest thing that we re that we will be doing and we ve already kind of started to export really relate to sales discipline and pipeline management kind of getting working off of a common process and making sure that we can stitch that together as part of the global coalition i mean we transitioned really from being i think very tribal in nature and sort of operating very geographically and now we want to be more client centric to be able to meet our clients where they work so in order to do that we need to have more commonality behind process and approach kate duchene chief executive officer yeah i d also say i think one of the things that tim has led is strong sales force adoption and sales process adoption and that is not so that we can beat on our sales teams or our client service teams it s really to get them to use the technology that we provided to make them more efficient and hopefully a better engagement in their job i mean it does also help with sales management but we need to be using that as actively everywhere we operate and that also gives us visibility across the globe to serve some of our largest clients like we ve had great growth in our pharma business and i m very bullish about our opportunities in big pharma in china for example and it s absolutely critical in delivering that that we re able to share our client development and client insights with one another mark marcon robert w baird analyst that s great and then can you give us a little bit more color with regards to what you re seeing on the ground in terms of the post holiday slowdown both as it relates to what you saw in north america and then in addition to that if you could just it sounds like germany was strong at least with the task and so when we go through and look at was it just the uk that really slowed down because of brexit or was it more dispersed across europe kate duchene chief executive officer yes let me talk about europe for a minute and then i ll pass it either to tim or herb and they can share more color in north america in the uk everyone will tell you and i m sure you ve had other clients mark that are talking about the chaos and people are getting whipsawed right so it just naturally seizes the marketplace for a while and clients it really did get slower in decision making i would say right now we re starting to feel some momentum where we re starting to bid on some big projects that we hope to hear soon so it does sound like clients are starting to pick up again in the netherlands i m disappointed in our performance in the netherlands part of that is a result of some legislative change that has happened with respect to agile business models that we re working through but that is a function too of migrating our business to higher value work less commodity oriented work which i think is important for us in the longer term that has created some short term challenges and our leader in europe right now is very active sitting in the netherlands market with the team to really drive better performance out of that group and we ve started to see some uptick in sweden for example that in some very interesting ways if i could just close some very interesting rpa business there for a large regional client that we think will grow so it is some of the natural ebb and flow of our business but we are doing all we can to control the things we can control and that is our effort and our drive and our commitment and you can be assured that the three of us at this table are focused on it every day herb mueller executive vice president and chief financial officer and mark in the us from a macro perspective we saw a lot of uncertainty coming out of the holiday as we know a lot of things going on government shutdown potential trade war things like that and what it did is it basically forced our clients to reprioritize so we saw a lot of delay in strategic decision making some shrinking of scope of projects at least in the initial phases and then to think about as opposed to drawing big bangs thinking about sequencing things appropriately based on strategic priorities i would say that in the last few weeks we ve seen some far but there s still some uncertainty out there mark marcon robert w baird analyst great that s terrific color thank you kate duchene chief executive officer you re welcome operator thank you operator instructions and i m showing no further questions in the queue at this time i d like to turn the call back to kate duchene ceo for any closing remarks kate duchene chief executive officer thank you operator and again

a growing number of homes in the us and china are teetering on the brink of a price slump that would drag their economies into a recession the international monetary fund has warned using the latest evidence from global housing markets the washington based organisation said there was a clear increase in the risk of a housing price collapse in both countries after years of ultra low interest rates and loose lending by financial institutions ahead of its annual meeting next week the imf s research showed a strong connection between falling house prices and declines in activity across the economy between 1990 and 2017 illustrating the power of housing markets to trigger wider slumps in gdp growth it follows similar concerns from us economists that the global recovery has been running out of steam since 2008 and slowdowns in the us and chinese economies are likely to undermine worldwide growth recent falls in housing activity and relatively high long term borrowing rates have also been seen as signals of a recession possibly as soon as next year in the us blackrock the world s largest fund manager told investors thattraders were becoming increasingly worried about the potential for a recession in the us christine lagarde head of the imf said this week that rising trade tensions concerns about brexit and tougher financial conditions as central banks raised interest rates had increasingly unsettled the global economy over recent months lagarde indicated that the imf which acts as lender of last resort to financially distressed nations was likely to downgrade its forecast for world growth in 2019 and 2020 uk house prices have already flatlined and were predicted to fall later this year by the office for budget responsibility with brexit seen as the main reason for buyers to sit on their hands view image in fullscreen the imf head christine lagarde has said it was likely to lower its predictions for world economic growth photograph xinhua rex in an extract from the global financial stability report the imf said risks to the us housing market were similar to the levels seen in 2002 03 before the outset of the sub prime mortgage crisis borrowers at the bottom of the income scale then proved vulnerable to rising interest rates which pushed the cost of monthly mortgage payments beyond their means and forced them to default without stricter rules on lending the imf said the us economy would increasingly be at risk of a house price slump resulting in a shock to economic activity large house price declines can adversely affect macroeconomic performance and financial stability as seen during the global financial crisis of 2008 and other historical episodes the report said these macro financial links arise from the many roles housing plays for households small firms and financial intermediaries as a consumption good long term investment store of wealth and collateral for lending among others in this context the rapid increase in house prices in many countries in recent years has raised some concerns about the possibility of a decline and its potential consequences optimistic growth forecasts for the us this year and next rely on the federal reserve maintaining interest rates near 2 or even cutting them should the economy slow down officials at the fed have paused further increases following fears that it could choke off demand for homes and provoke panic selling since late 2016 us house prices at risk appear to have deteriorated gradually due to overvaluation concerns and high credit growth but they have been partly offset by still easy financial conditions the imf report said in china after 2010 high credit to gdp gaps and tightening of financial conditions contributed to increased downside risks since 2016 house price overvaluation has also contributed to the deterioration of house prices at risk it added
arguably markets are a little exhausted by the trade war holding onto hope can be exhausting and judging by the diminishing impact of trade war news traders are tired of speculation and want substantial answers a de escalation in the trade war is practically priced in to the markets now future strategic consequences aside the market moving variable is probably going to be whether us and chinese negotiators can flag a clear removal of at least some of the tariffs imposed on one another 5 market watch ii us nfps as far as us non farm payrolls go the state of the us labour market always sits at the front of the carousel of concerns for market participants of late however the data itself has taken on some new dimensions whereas in the recent past and we are talking in months to maybe years it s been all about wage growth and the inflation outlook as an extraordinarily low unemployment rate stoked concerns of an inflation outbreak in the us economy and subsequently higher interest rates that issue still exists however now markets have to deal with another layer of complexity the fear that the us economic machine is slowing down and may lack the capacity to maintain labour market strength 6 just a bit of profit taking in our neck of the woods spi futures are suggesting the asx200 will translate the overnight action into a 6 point loss at the open today australian equites are standing as an outlier based on futures markets across the asian region most other futures contracts are pointing to a reasonably positive start for asia s major indices aussie stocks gassed out somewhat yesterday proving the most notable laggard across the equity index map given it was the outlier a single domestic cause for the broad based selling on the asx is difficult to determine the market did sell off from a 70 reading on the rsi so perhaps we can chuck out the old cliché and chalk up the move to profit taking 7 reactions to an unofficial budget lacking a strong lead to follow this morning as markets await tonight s key risk events perhaps the curious matter for the asx today will be how the market react to last night s budget reply speech from labor leader bill shorten aside from some quizzicality as to why the opposition leader kept bandying around the yield on 10 year bonds as evidence for his economic argument market participants may take greater notice of the detail contained within the budget reply than that of the official budget on tuesday markets like to play with and price in probabilities and given the balance of probabilities suggests a labour government come next election perhaps last night s policy announcements will create greater impact than those announced on tuesday 8 market watch spi futures down 9 points or 0 1 to 6209 near 7 25am aedt aud 0 1 to 71 18 us cents on wall st dow 0 6 s p 500 0 2 nasdaq 0 1 in new york bhp 0 2 rio flat atlassian 4 5 in europe stoxx 50 0 2 ftse 0 2 cac 0 1 dax 0 3 spot gold 0 1 to us1291 10 an ounce at 2pm new york brent crude 1 to us69 99 a barrel us oil 0 4 to us62 71 a barrel iron ore 0 2 to us92 90 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 3 to 627 yuan lme aluminium 0 1 to us1895 a tonne lme copper 0 6 us6450 50 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 34 australia 1 48 5 year yield us 2 32 australia 1 50 10 year yield us 2 51 australia 1 89 germany 0 01 us australia 10 year yield gap near 7 25am aedt 62 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between the sydney morning herald the age and ig
on view nurtureart march 16 april 14 2019 brooklyn last november when amazon decided to split their second headquarters between new york and washington d c artists and cultural workers had to contend with the complicity of the culture industry in displacement and gentrification and also shoulder the hardships from the exacerbation of these already disastrous crises characteristic to all large development projects which only redistribute wealth upwards simultaneously our creative capital is traded against our scapegoating by a rapacious developer class in artwashing campaigns many of us began to mobilize against the deal i began work with a group of cultural producers under the banner bad barcode in coalition with fuck off amazon 1 when i mentioned this to my good friend and brooklyn based painter adam simon who has been exploring the representations of corporate logos in his work for many years he mentioned that i should meet with an artist named brett wallace i was told we had much to discuss on the topics of immaterial labor amazon the gig economy and so on both adam and brett opened solo exhibitions on march 15th at studio 10 and nurtureart respectively 2 during our first meeting brett and i shared our admiration for allan sekula and the history of documentary workerist photography and discussed how the grassroots opposition to amazon was developing by the time of our second meeting now recording to register our conversation amazon had abandoned the deal the below is the conversation we had at new inc an art design and technology incubator inside the new museum edited for length and clarity brett wallace working conditions installation nurtureart gallery new york 2019 performers mischa ipp and ben dawson photo david riley andreas petrossiants rail regarding amazon hq2 it s clear that very few people if any thought the grassroots would win so quickly in three months time more or less 3 my feeling is that the fight worked so well due to the scale of solidarity as always part of the work the grassroots carried out was in a productivist and documentarian legacy that you re also working in i e in this case uncovering the tarps that shroud companies behind a veneer that s infantilized in their logos let s say and made personal to show what s going on behind the scenes amazon s heinous working conditions selling facial recognition tech to ice their implication in the carceral state how the development would displace communities of color and working class folk were made clear to many and contextualized in a history reaching back to robert moses redlining disastrous rezoning policies and so on brett wallace wallace it was inspiring to see the solidarity from unions neighborhood groups activists students and others it looks like our fight against hq2 may not be over given the open letter that was signed by governor cuomo and many business leaders 4 i felt as though amazon tried to move into queens one of the most diverse places in the world with a top down plan mirroring the same control and speed of their operations the solidarity amongst the opposition gained steam as more and more people caught wind of amazon s poor labor record anti union stance and their work with ice this is combined of course with the fact that they were offered 3 billion in corporate tax breaks structured as job creation incentives rail and the three billion doesn t even include hidden subsidies paid out via welfare programs to an underpaid workforce wallace yeah and who were those 25 000 jobs over 10 years for how many people in the queensbridge houses across the street from the proposed site would have access to those jobs the average wage was estimated by amazon at over 150 000 48 000 of which was tax incentives the only number i heard was 30 planned jobs for queensbridge residents there was no independent study on the implications of this deal onto rising housing costs overcrowded schools crumbling nyc subways it s also worth noting that amazon still operates in nyc with existing centers in staten island and they are expanding in the bronx rail that brings us to a point which is evident in much of your work that big tech monopolies like amazon are threading themselves into every industry one can imagine so they start out with books and then cds and dvds but now that s no longer important their sales are almost irrelevant what matters is their cloud computing their software their massive supply chain brett wallace hq2 2019 still from video courtesy the artist wallace that s right and in the advent of ai data driven companies are taking over data powers companies from the supply chain to the consumer experience rail they have an incredible amount of real estate both virtually and brick and mortar so i wonder how you first approached researching something so large wallace in the summer of 2016 i visited an amazon fulfillment center on the outskirts of baltimore these are highly secure areas so you can t just walk in and roam around but i was able to peek in i could hear the whizzing of the algorithm driven bots at the main entrance there was a security gate where workers were checking in their keys and their cell phones the walls of fulfillment centers are lined with euphemisms such as work hard have fun make history what hit me was the demonstrable dissonance between the presentation of an idealized work environment and the material realities of workers within it while that tension has been around for a long time the experience of that center resonated with my experiences growing up in a blue collar neighborhood outside boston it felt both like a look into the future and a setback to accelerated methods of fordism and taylorism a forgotten factory space that was buzzing with activity rail elsewhere you call it fordism on steroids wallace yes it s this accelerated model of human structure and repetition workers sprinting down aisles to pick hundreds of goods off the shelves per hour workers become cast as conscious linkages within a much larger machine as marx writes in the grundrisse seeing that center was a reminder that late stage capitalism is not just immaterial or digital work it s feeding off new low wage labor jobs and the fulfillment center with its drudgery is an exemplar of that so for my show at silas von morisse gallery in 2016 i launched an exploration around the fulfillment center itself coded with rules processes technologies and human labor i shipped and installed boxes in the gallery laser cut with euphemisms from amazon s corporate strategy and things i was hearing from amazon workers i used cnc machines to mirror the scientific management systems and carve pathways into material substrates the work was reviewed as occupying the gap between lived experience and digital immateriality that these workers inhabit daily 5my show at spring break art show 2018 is where i formally launched amazing industries a research based startup project to explore the business model of a mega corporation as you said amazon s model goes beyond packing and shipping goods for digital commerce but has spread into low wage labor on the mechanical turk platform and has pushed to become embedded into companies by selling cloud storage this company has gained so much wealth that it is collapsing the corporate and political nexus and using its power to influence politics they turned hq2 into a bidding war between mayors and probably gathered a lot of economic data along the way brett wallace amazing industries installation spring break art show new york 2018 courtesy the artist rail well it s not an accident that they chose nyc and d c right wallace exactly rail they chose ny for the creative capital and the attraction of influencer culture and dc because they re vying for a 10 billion defense contract jedi there was an interview a few weeks ago in which bezos said that any startup that doesn t want to get involved in the defense of the united states will be left behind or something to that effect 6 that s absolutely terrifying but to your point this notion that the concern is not just changing work but the change of the politics of working this is one dominant tendency in neoliberal post fordism based on outsourcing and subcontracting or even sub subcontracting labor eliminating benefits and worker protections but there s also the creation of this entity that s more than a company or a political structure it s so large that it checks magnifies or in some cases challenges state power there is also a foundational mythos that amazon projects there s a famous example discussed in heike geissler s seasonal associate that in every fulfillment center there s a wooden door on a sawhorse because supposedly when jeff bezos first started the company that s all he could afford wallace as jenny holzer said you live the surprise results of old plans one thing i remember from my research is that jeff bezos harps on day 1 a kind of thinking to keep things alive and moving he defines day 2 as stasis he continues followed by irrelevance followed by excruciating painful decline followed by death 7 it s a method to foster the speed determinism and mysticism in tech but it makes me want to counter the speed and paranoia and ask what is the counterpoint to a warehouse built on speed speed can create unintended consequences like hq2 rail also like cambridge analytica and facebook wallace right technology has an increasing presence in our lives so i think it s important to think critically about it this is what i think paul virilio meant when he famously wrote when you invent the ship you also invent the shipwreck when you invent the plane you also invent the plane crash and when you invent electricity you invent electrocution every technology carries its own negativity which is invented at the same time as technical progress 8 rail this gets at your research into the patents companies like amazon are securing at breakneck speed claims on future innovations that may or may not exist wallace one way to glimpse a company s strategic direction is to look at its patents amazon has thousands of them listed on the united states patent and trademark office website one of which patent us9305280b1 led me to make the piece floating factory a virtual tour through an imagined floating warehouse i think about amazon as an extension of taylorism s scientific management techniques but in an accelerated way there is a race to privatize innovations and at the same time the model is broken for working people there was a new york times article two years ago that described how a janitor at kodak fifty years ago could afford to take a vacation had great benefits and a job where you could work your way up 9 the article contrasts that story to a janitor at apple today who is an independent contractor this traces back to the rise of the nike model in the 1980s keep the marketing in house and outsource all the production labor to lower cost sectors this is precisely what i think allan sekula was referring to in the forgotten space 2010 global labor seen via the shipping container will find the lowest cost port and set up shop there a company like amazon accelerated and globalized that model in new ways we see the mechanical turk model in which labor is atomized for cents on the dollar and how many gig workers in the global south support the north rail in the two of your zines inside the automaton and futures of work it seems like you re pointing out a trend that may be exemplary of something like a post taylorism in the sense of individualized managers managing themselves it s like a very perverse form of self management which is only an illusion where workers are rather controlled by a series of algorithms and data chains this is the antithesis of organizing labor collectively and of course we know that amazon is one of the most prominent union busters around it s a self management of one s own debts brett wallace working conditions installation nurtureart gallery new york 2019 photo david riley wallace i think the dimensions of work continue to shift in the digital age under the dominant neoliberal ideology based on individualized productivity we are seeing the rise of freelance work and labor platforms like uber upwork and fiverr technology has allowed for more remote work whether you re coding or driving for uber but it has also led to increased worker surveillance on platforms and stagnating wages and at times we can apply that surveillance to ourselves as a form of self management in the case of mechanical turk most workers i talked to love the freedom to work from home but they are incredibly frustrated about the lack of voice they have hidden management decisions within the platform and the low pay rates so at times the gig economy falsely promotes freedom and the concept of do what you love can be mistaken for unpaid or underpaid labor it s important we keep educating ourselves about those pitfalls and build collective worker power rail right david graeber talks about this in his book bullshit jobs 2018 where he wonders at one point why it is that we ve all accepted the idea that people who make music and poetry naturally must struggle and be precarious just because they enjoy the work they do wallace there is a strange love affinity with certain work in the digital age the swim lanes between life and work have collapsed franco bifo berardi talks about the soul at work how the factory once ran on bodies but has now consumed the soul and runs on minds and emotions and since the whole production process is buzzing with so much speed and complexity there is widespread workforce depression and alienation 10 tech campuses are constructed to promote this energy and happiness with free lunches gyms and incentives to keep people on campus it s common for food service workers at these companies many of whom are independent contractors to be left out of the same amenities given to software engineers rail meanwhile uber drivers are working ten or eleven hours a day and six days a week to make a normal wage wallace with no benefits rail paying for their own gas and cars and repairs wallace the other point i wanted to bring up is with regards to a proposed post taylorism is that taylor s model as we know was all about management science with algorithm driven management one person can now manage thousands of uber drivers in a city one of the problems with that is that a company can distance itself from its decisions by saying well that s the outcome of the algorithm we re not responsible for that 11 rail it s like what you mention with regards to mechanical turk in inside the automaton if one does some labor for mturk even if it s just for fifty cents and you don t get paid because they ve deemed it unsatisfactory there s no way to dispute that wallace in many parts of the app economy the power is on the side of the requestor or consumer the worker can be unpaid for their work and rated mechanical turk workers describe in the interviews i ve conducted that they don t have a voice they have a worker id number they don t understand how the ratings work the system is not transparent to them rail how many workers did you survey for the zine about mturk wallace i surveyed 600 workers through a paid task for the project i also gathered 1 000 photographs submitted by workers of their home offices and about 3 hours of interviews with workers rail right with regards to amazing industries i wanted to tell you about a meme i think i first saw it posted on mckenzie wark s facebook page the form is a common and simple one the before and after schema on one side it is the 1950s and a worker can support a nuclear family on factory wages working a forty hour week which of course comes with its own very malicious problematics that we can t forget this was true only for white men for the most part and predicated upon low and un waged labor by women especially women of color 12 on the other side is a worker today who says my boss is an app and i owe it money brett wallace working conditions installation nurtureart gallery new york 2019 photo david riley it seems to me that if one brings together a protestant work ethic a false but nonetheless venerated meritocracy and these app bosses you get our hyper atomized consumer driven identities the way that you ve engaged with this is through amazing industries how would you describe this project wallace joel kuennen called it a research engine which i think was spot on 13 i refer to it as an ideological r d startup which is also an ongoing artwork rail is this meant to be a parody a form of infiltration of the codes of the business a mirroring strategy wallace i have explored several models for it and how i show up in the work as an artist or spokesperson at various times it has become a research platform and a way to amplify the voices of workers it has traces back to boris arvatov s theory of art as production which called for the fusion of art and life outside the formal gallery or studio john roberts has linked arvatov s ideas to the community based post object practices we see today 14 arvatov was critical of how formal artistic production which was built for the bourgeois commodity economy and which decorated or depicted life could benefit the working class and enable social evolution he was interested in deskilling the specialized artistic skillset so that the artist could enter production reverse alienation and combine aesthetics with practical applications such as transportation amazing industries has been a way for me to research resist infiltrate operate critique and present work in different horizontal modes both within and beyond the institutional structures of the art world for example amazing industries was invited last year to collaborate in an economic event in amsterdam called reshaping work the event was also attended by uber care com and other gig based companies so the project fit in as a company but with the sole agenda to demystify the labor platforms themselves as i was researching labor as a concept i found that the dominant questions around the future of work were not very centered on the future of workers the questions were being framed in a narrow way excluding the voices of marginalized workers what is the opposite position of that well to me it is a platform that contributes to researching working conditions amplifying workers voices building worker power with those whose working conditions are being reshaped by technology they do not own rail this is the documentarian impulse wallace yes it s a continuation of the type of work by artists and filmmakers like allan sekula agnès varda harun farocki and robert smithson i m embracing the method of critical realism that sekula coined i find this to be my preferred method for documenting and trying to grasp the speed and complexity of the digital age farocki pointed out in workers leaving the factory 1995 that the first film ever made using the cinematograph was centered on workers workers leaving the lumière factory in lyon by louis lumièrein 1895 sekula s untitled slide sequence 1972 follows the logic of this early film work by capturing workers leaving the general dynamics convair division aerospace factory rail the images of the mturk workspaces that you included in the zine are shocking in their simplicity wallace simple but filled with signifiers the range of images computers and resolutions was really interesting to me there is a huge spectrum from an expensive gaming station to an old laptop on an ironing board the videos interviews i collected reveal the facial expressions of invisible digital workers that their ai model replacements are trying to recognize many people were doing this work part time to make ends meet some people were home taking care of a sick parent and they didn t have the ability to work a full time job or they were sick themselves rail sure but we re fighting for a future in which we are freed from the need to work to survive at all especially if one is ill or caring for someone else which of course is yet another form of un or low waged precarious labor i recently saw documentary films put together by folks working with the ain t i a woman campaign which discussed care workers in nyc that work 24 hour shifts sometimes four times a week but are only being paid for just over half of their hours 15 its beyond criminal the absolutely incredible thing is that notwithstanding 96 hour work weeks withheld wages precarious working contracts and isolated work environments many of these women are organizing we have no excuses wallace no excuses on the mturk work the idea that they are able to log on and log off embodies the limits of freedom that the current system can provide in a way the technology has created a remote form of work that workers actually seem to enjoy the downsides to it are the low wages and asymmetry within the system so if we can fix the wages and asymmetry that would go a long way for the workers for now rail right if we could imagine some sort of scenario in which these gig platforms are redistributed as a series of worker owned cooperatives with all value collectively owned rather than hoarded by individuals which is not such a radical conception when you think of it automation is not going anywhere and neither it seems is the work that feeds it but there are different ways of imagining the contracts underpinning this work wallace trebor scholz talks a lot about the idea of cooperative ownership of digital platforms rail if what you want is to follow the documentarian lineage of dorothea lange and sekula and others we would have to imagine that the research startup as artwork is a parallel to the camera which uncovers to take the language of muckrakers let s say wallace the research based documentarian model works for me to expose power structures capture nuances build direct relationships with workers and to document in a way that treats workers with dignity i think smithson said it beautifully when he said i m just interested in exploring the apparatus i m being threaded through 16 the startup as artwork hinges on the fact that it s an ideological startup its goal is not to produce a commercial product while much art circulates as a commodity art does not have to operate in that function although it s important to find ways to sustain any practice i m actually just getting it trademarked right now rail congrats wallace cheers rail negri pointed out some years ago that if the post war moment gave rise to immaterial production now we may have reached a moment of biopolitical production following a foucauldian framework in which our bodies are quite literally threaded through our work in line with your reference to bifo wallace with regards to negri s ideas on biopolitics i think of an industry like trucking where companies are building ai into the cabs and bodies of the 1 8 million long haul truck drivers in the us a clear example of human machine coalescence the bodies of truck drivers have been infiltrated by technology which track both the driver and allow the truck to see and react to the road conditions furthermore there is no real proof yet that driverless trucks would be any safer than human drivers many of the driverless truck tests have been done in ideal driving environments on open roads experts like karen levy assistant professor of information science at cornell believe we are likely 30 40 years away from trucks making autonomous dock to dock runs 17 rail safety is a way to justify that sort of surveillance in effort to maximize efficiency and this profit wallace i met with dr john aiello at rutgers some weeks ago and he talked about how organizations now have the capabilities to conduct surveillance in many forms whether you are in an office or out in the field in a truck the rise in surveillance has increased stress for workers and may even result in performance losses as ai grows and jobs change it will be increasingly hard for workers to navigate both the surveillance and change in their work habits 18 brett wallace working conditions installation nurtureart gallery new york 2019 photo david riley rail there was that great piece in n 1 that we talked about last time we met code red 2018 about workers in tech organizing vertically to include outsourced labor in the mess halls the cleaning staff and so on furthermore look at fuck off google in berlin the somali amazon fulfillment center workers in minnesota who organized a walk out movements building in western europe and so on on surveillance i m reminded of eyal weizman s description of how the logics of international privacy law are used to obscure the satellite imagery that civilians have access to conveniently the threshold of detectability is such that civilians cannot see the digital representations of u s drone strikes or in the way evictions are forced by developers and landlords who claim they are either renovating the building or making it more sustainable in line with capitalist green economics once its renovated the rents have doubled or tripled that s why the success of the 83 85 bowery struggle in new york last august was such a momentous one those tenants were kicked out of their homes in the winter because the building was conveniently deemed unsafe only once market rents were skyrocketing on the topic of surveillance maybe you could speak a bit on the show you re putting up at nurtureart wallace the show is titled working conditions i have created a series of five workstations each of which includes video essays comprised of both documentary and archival footage to explore the ethics of the working conditions in the digital economy the first station is a video of home cleaners that plays on a mobile phone resting upon a cleaning bucket it encourages a closer look at the organization of labor behind cleaning services ordered online the cleaners were hired to an apartment via an app there s a narrative overlaid while these folks clean an apartment in which the app is recruiting the viewer to work while framing the work parameters the language was taken from recruiting advertisements and mirrors how this language is seductive and structured around the power of the consumer for example only top rated cleaners are kept on the app and you can know exactly what your cleaner is doing track them rate them and so on the next station explores digital labor and will include the projects i ve been doing around mechanical turk rail are you going to invite a mechanical turk worker like you did at the spring break show wallace i ve stayed in contact with that person we built a good relationship during that show for this show though i have organized a performance that will occur during the opening where two workers were given instructions to activate the five workstations drawing attention to the invisible material and immaterial human labor that drives technology and is being reshaped by it rail of course mierle laderman ukeles s works at the wadsworth 1973 and a i r gallery 1974 are an influence here is this a way of taking some of the many avenues of critique her work addresses from unwaged domestic labor to atomized gig work many autonomous feminists associated with the international wages for housework campaign weren t arguing for wages per se but rather using the wage as an abstraction to consider how unremunerated work is still subject to capitalist labor agreements i think of silvia federici s landmark wages against housework 1975 against being the operative word in fact gig apps such as those that allow one to hire workers to clean their homes are perfect examples of the pitfalls that agitating for the wage carries there is nothing liberating about the app s labor agreement only a more surveilled and alienated way of subjugating wallace we have to consider invisible affective and asymmetrical labor i am interested in how the digital sustains such labor practices and increases surveillance and alienation this work draws inspiration from works by ukeles and martha rosler in wages against housework federici writes that domestic housework is not even considered work at all preventing women from struggling against it the second station in the show includes a stand in desk for a mechanical turk worker the desk includes two monitors playing video interviews with workers and the types of tasks they are doing to train their ai replacements the third then includes a split screen video installation flanked by 80 shipping boxes the video contrasts the hq2 protest giving voice to the labor of resistance with the second public hearing between amazon and the new york city council finance committee rail the one with the spectacular banner drop wallace right brett wallace girl and alexa studying brooklyn new york february 2019 2019 archival pigment print courtesy the artist the fourth station includes a video essay playing on a trucker bed the kind you see in long haul trucks it comments on how truckers aren t in control of their leisure time nor their work time they re on the road and their time is highly regimented and increasingly surveilled for the fifth station there are photographs and a video of a ten year old girl talking to alexa the video playing through a live alexa device shows her peering into a portal in the ground in anable basin where amazon was planning to build hq2 i was thinking about smithson s land reclamation proposal in bingham copper mine the largest man made mine in the world alexa for example is built on a largely invisible supply chain of human labor and extracted materials from home cleaning to gig labor to trucking the thread in the show is the ethics around the increased surveillance and invisible labor we see in the digital economy rail i brought these questions from kathi weeks s superb book the problem with work 2011 for us to consider how might we expose the fundamental structures and dominant values of work including its temporalities socialities hierarchies and subjectivities as pressing political phenomena how might we conceive the content and parameters of our obligations to one another outside the currency of work 19 it seems to me that the show at nurtureart you re preparing attempts to respond to some of these questions via visual culture what does it mean to engage in the work of building solidarity in immaterial and material production in teaching ais how to see and so on brett wallace girl talking to alexa in anable basin long island city new york february 2019 2019 still from video courtesy the artist wallace i think it starts with redefining the idea of the future of work as a future for workers we are now living an era where technology has so much collective promise yet we see stagnant wages for working people growing income inequality and an erosion of collective bargaining power i think we need to keep rethinking artistic production to build cooperation and new models to reclaim dignity in work the art world has its own relationship to these dilemmas i am reminded of ian burn who said not only do works of art end up as commodities but there is also an overwhelming sense in which works of art start off as commodities 20 hito steyerl wrote about the forms of tax evasion and real estate speculation that sustain the art market it also runs on lots of unpaid labor i have a lot of compassion for any workers in the art world given the situation w a g e has done a great job demystifying art world fees or the lack thereof as tough as it can be it s important for artists to push back against unpaid work or low wages that helps all of us in the ecosystem rail there are new and old models here right we re sitting in the new museum it s fantastic that workers here have unionized then there are newer models among art workers like wagency which is a way of creating something resembling an artists union but that is self regulated by the artists themselves this news just broke the other day but this year every artist in the whitney biennial will receive an artist fee following wagency s metrics the fee is the minimum number they recommend the whitney pay to artists given the museum s revenue what are the benefits then of approaching the many questions we ve discussed as an artist or as an institutional structure wallace the benefit of being an artist approaching these questions is the agency to explore the issues in unconventional ways and direct my work towards building support for working people john roberts pointed out the questions arvatov wrestled with are the same that contemporary artists face today in what sense is the artist a collective worker in the same way that the labour power of workers is organized collectively how might artists contribute to a collective product or process how might artistic creativity then be directed to the transformation of social appearances and the built environment 21 in this way while my work circulates in the institutional structures of the art world i think of my work in wider economic and social structures what energizes me is meeting with workers from all walks of life and the collective possibilities they inspire notes

in 1951 the treaty of paris was signed to form the political and economic integration of 6 european countries west germany italy france and the benelux the treaty advocated stability in the continent giving birth to the european coal and steel community at the time coal and steel were the main energy sources in europe but britain refrained from signing the treaty winston churchill the uk s prime minister who had led europe to victory defeating nazi germany in 1945 had already envisioned an alternative to coal in fact churchill had settled to transform the uk s energy from coal to oil it was essential therefore to colonise the middle east a region that had recently been discovered to be rich in oil britain s political financial and sovereign interests lied in africa asia and now the middle east britain s defence security however continued to be in the heart of europe against the threat of the political ideology of communism the concept of creating a united states of europe and great britain being an ally had been heavily encouraged by churchill at the hague congress in 1948 just after world war ii ended in 1957 only 6 years later the uk is invited again to join the treaty of rome to establish the european economic community and the european atomic energy community but once again britain refused to engage with the new treaty as it still maintained the sovereignty of the commonwealth nations and although bleak trade was prevailing its sovereignty was the pride of the imperial nation and the supra nationalism that the two european treaties endorsed was a clear threat britain s supremacy during the 60 s france under the leadership of president charles de gaulle vetoed britain s entry as he expressed his concern about britain diminishing france s position in the eec and the influence of the anglo american relations in europe it would take 24 years after the inception of the eec that on january 1st 1973 uk together with denmark and the republic of ireland that finally britain joined the european block charles de gaulle had already resigned the imperial economic power had receded and for a number of decades it had been receiving loans from the imf britain was in utter turmoil and a state of emergency had been declared high unemployment with dissatisfied trade unions miner s strikes low wages banking crisis due to low credits and high inflation at 8 4 the price of oil due to the arab israeli war quadrupled and resulted in frequent power cuts only two years later in 1975 under labour party a national referendum was called to leave or to remain the eec the later won by a majority of 67 based on free trade and agricultural subsidies when margaret thatcher became britain s prime minister in 1979 her conviction to deter immigration and increase national employment was crucial to shift from a labour government that was unable to restore social and financial order to a conservative government that was ready to create jobs and stabilize the country thatcher used foreign immigration as a threat to british national employment whilst agreeing to free movement of people goods and services within the eec establishment although it was hard to see a plausible alternative to britain s economic and social crisis yielding its sovereignty to europe s supra nationalism the hard defenders of national imperialism or so called eurosceptics continued to defend churchill s idea to seek political and financial interests away from europe the only difference was that by the 70 s the british colonies in africa asia and middle east had been lost from a historical perspective eurosceptics continue to relish britain s economic status and international political dominance it is currently the 5th largest economy in the world and 2ndlargest in the eu this is a strong position to be confident about the country s future without the subjugation of a slow growing eu economy the supremacy of the european parliament influenced by usa policies and banking system which was clearly anticipated by general de gaulle in the 50 s together with germany leading the eu policies are the main factors that render the eu an anti democratic institution with britain s limited influence moreover the pound sterling has remained stronger than the dollar and the euro in the past 15 years although british banks like barclays and hsbc agreed that this year s brexit will lead to market uncertainty unemployment decreased in trade and could even trigger a drop of 11 similar to the financial collapse in 2008 nevertheless such a financial collapse seems to be more conceivable than joining the increasing debt crisis that greece italy portugal and spain have endured since joining the euro or joining the eu fiscal union official plan for 2025 at the moment the eurozone fiscal system accounts for 0 5 of gdp whereas in the uk it is nearly 8 britain will need to replace its euro trade agreements and renegotiate new ones with the commonwealth nations australia new zealand canada amongst many others bric brazil russia india china the middle east africa and usa the rebirth of imperial or rather independent britain could be on the horizon following the aspirations of churchill but ironically there are major concerns that britain could crumble internally scotland could gain its long awaited independence as well as northern ireland joining the republic of ireland to continue under the umbrella of the eu a political right that brexit has deprived these two countries from indeed brexit brings the promise of britain regaining its national sovereignty but quite possibly at the cost of losing its national regional borders cristina cabrejas artola is a member of the transcend network for peace development environment she holds a master s

use the lexology getting the deal through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions overview market describe the significance of and developments in the automotive industry in the market according to research by emirates nbd the uae is one of the largest automotive markets in the gulf second only to saudi arabia the uae relies heavily on imports with nearly all cars being imported from manufacturing facilities abroad aside from a small number of factories that assemble components for trucks and buses as well as factories that produce armoured vehicles there is no significant automotive manufacturing activity taking place within the uae the uae s strong economic growth household spending and relatively easy access to vehicle financing are likely to be the primary drivers for the automotive industry over the coming years as the uae s population continues to grow the growth outlook for the automotive sector looks positive the international monetary fund s world economic outlook estimated that the population of the uae will grow to approximately 10 8 million between 2016 and 2021 any increases in public spending on development projects and general infrastructure to support such an increase in population will generally bolster the automotive sector through demand for trucks and other commercial vehicles required for such growth however if oil prices remain depressed this may affect the level of public spending which may in turn affect automotive demand the uae is also becoming a hub and re export centre for vehicle parts and components in the gulf region abu dhabi s government initiative to develop an auto city in the mussafah area southwest of abu dhabi will potentially create a cluster of advanced workshops and service centres attracting investment in automotive manufacturing and spare part logistics regulation what is the regulatory framework for manufacture and distribution of automobiles and automobile parts such as vehicle type approval process as well as vehicle registration and insurance requirements all motor vehicles must be insured and licensed by the roads and transport authority rta before they can be driven on uae roads the process of obtaining such insurance and licensing is straightforward and can be dealt with by auto dealers or car owners directly at any rta outlet in terms of the regulatory framework all cars and buses entering the uae must abide by the safety regulations issued by the emirates authority for standardization and metrology esma and the gulf standardization organization gso these regulations are primarily comprised of a combination of european union and us federal motor safety standards by way of common examples air bags for the driver and front passenger seats are compulsory for all passenger cars and buses with a capacity of up to 22 passengers safety belts and anti lock braking systems are required in all new cars and all vehicles must have an alarm to notify the driver when the vehicle exceeds the speed of 120km hour in cars and 100km hour in buses in relation to homologation of new vehicles in the uae automotive manufacturers often conduct simulated tests at their factory facilities followed by local testing in the gulf cooperation council gcc to confirm that prototypes of new vehicles are fit for driving in gcc countries and meet the standards set by the gso and esma prior to any mass production taking place certain tests are designed in part to ensure that new vehicles are capable of functioning properly during extreme heat conditions which are the norm for gcc countries for example between april and october in each year the vehicle s durability performance and stability are tested by representatives of the manufacturer driving it off road and on highways at high speeds and engines transmission and other powertrain elements of the vehicle are tested through driving in standard city traffic with an emphasis on relatively low speeds and frequent stopping and starting the other vehicle processes such as engine lubrication electrical systems braking steering and air conditioning are all monitored during these tests to ensure that they perform to the required standards of each market if any of these systems do not perform to the required standards then the manufacturer s factory is notified in order to fix minor problems prior to mass production in the case of substantial problems with prototype vehicles the prototype will be sent back to the factory for investigation and a new prototype will be developed to undergo the same tests otherwise the prototype is left with the local distributor in order to increase its mileage and measure wear and tear conditions in relation to certification the automotive manufacturer will normally have a representative that is familiar with esma and gso standards and confirm that the vehicle or any parts meet the requirements of these organisations after such self certification process takes place the new vehicle s specifications are sent to the gso for registration of the new vehicle which is a requirement for customs clearance and further registration of the vehicle by any consumer development manufacture and supply how do automotive companies operating in your country generally structure their development manufacture and supply issues what are the usual contractual arrangements the majority of automotive manufacturers operating in the gcc have their regional head offices and logistic distribution centres located in jebel ali free zone in order to supply new cars and spare parts to their network of authorised distributors the contractual structure of automotive distributors or dealers may vary according to the policies of each manufacturer however in general terms the operations are normally governed by dealership agreements covering commercial commitments and targets in addition to legal terms and conditions in connection with the responsibility and obligations of each party the lengths of such dealer agreements may vary typically from one to five years depending on the relationship between the manufacturer and distributor and any historic performance records in achieving annual commitments and targets the automotive sector is considered by the government to be a key industry in the uae and it is therefore protected through the uae commercial agency law no 18 of 1981 an automotive manufacturer cannot have a direct customer facing branch or office in the uae meaning it cannot sell directly to customers and must instead use local emirati agents as distributors to sell its products in the region there are analogous laws in several other gcc countries distribution how are vehicles usually distributed are there any special rules for importers distributors dealers including dealer networks or other distribution partners how do automotive companies normally resolve restructuring or termination issues with their distribution partners orders for new vehicles and parts are normally processed by the regional offices of the manufacturers weekly supplies of vehicles and parts are usually shipped from logistics centres by trailer within the uae and gcc and by ship to other destinations in middle eastern and north african markets monthly stock orders may be shipped from factories abroad directly to importers and distributors in the uae the importers and distributors must have trading licences issued by the ministry of transport and renewed periodically by local authorities such as the chamber of commerce in each emirate performance and metrics in relation to customer satisfaction are normally reviewed by automotive manufacturers and their distributors through regular meetings between senior executives from both parties any restructuring of a distribution arrangement is normally preceded by a number of warning letters and potentially arbitration proceedings in accordance with the distribution agreement the federal commercial agencies law no 18 of 1981 can cause significant issues for automotive manufacturers seeking to terminate their relationship with a local distributor this was the case when a major international automotive manufacturer sought to terminate its distribution relationship in the late 1990s the manufacturer was unable to terminate the relationship due to restrictions under the agencies law the dispute that arose between the two companies proceeded before the courts of the uae and the manufacturer was unable to appoint a new distributor in the uae until the dispute was resolved the manufacturer was unable to sell its products in the uae for several years as a result of this dispute with its local distributor mergers acquisitions and joint ventures are there any particularities for m a or jv transactions that companies should consider when preparing negotiating or entering into a deal in the automotive industry as an automotive manufacturer cannot sell directly to customers in the region manufacturers do not have a significant direct presence in the uae most m a activity therefore tends to occur at the distributor level rather than the manufacturer level any m a or jv transactions that result in a significant change in the ownership of a distributor should be reported to the ministry of economy moe under moe regulations in addition distribution agreements often contain change of control provisions that will require the distributor to notify the automotive manufacturer if such a change in ownership were to occur incentives and barriers to entry are there any incentives for investment in the automotive market are there barriers to entry into the market what impact may new entrants into the market have on incumbents the main barrier to entry into the market in the uae is the requirement to use authorised distributors due to local laws an international automotive manufacturer cannot simply 0pen an office or showroom in the uae and will need to appoint a local agent that will act as its authorised distributor in the country in practice this means that any new automotive manufacturer entrants into the uae market will need to identify an appropriate distributor in the region to sell their vehicles and parts to consumers as described in question 1 abu dhabi s government initiative to develop an auto city in the mussafah area is likely to lead to the creation of new production plants for cars light vehicles and trucks as well as assembly lines for manufacturing spare parts and vehicle accessories this strategy could increase opportunities for automotive manufacturers and distributors in the uae product safety and liability safety and environmental what are the most relevant automotive related product compliance safety and environmental regulations and how are they enforced are there specific rules for product recalls there are no specific product recall rules that exclusively apply to the automotive industry in the uae we have therefore set out general principles in relation to product recalls and compliance safety below consumer safety and protection are regulated by the moe the safety and quality of products are further standardised in the uae by esma and local authorities such as the department of economic development the the dubai municipality and abu dhabi quality and conformity council together with the emirate level authorities the moe has the power to investigate and enforce the recall of defective products based on consumer complaints and reports from international markets the laws relevant to product recall are the consumer protection laws under federal law no 24 of 2006 and federal cabinet resolution no 12 of 2007 these state that a supplier of goods must promptly report any harmful defect discovered in any goods to the relevant uae authorities and consumers the cabinet resolution contains more detailed provisions regarding the notification and other procedures that must be followed by a supplier where a defect is found in goods in practice the notification is made to the uae ministry of economy consumer protection department and an advertisement of the recall is published in uae newspapers to notify consumers the notification to the consumer protection department must be made within 14 days of the commencement of any product recall it should be in arabic but can be accompanied by the home language of the supplier and it must state the name of the goods the supplier and the country of origin contain a colour photograph of the goods and the defective part contain a detailed description of the defect and its causes indicate the number of products sold and the quantity to be recalled suggest the type and nature of probable damage to consumers indicate procedures adopted by the supplier to recall the goods provide the manner of announcing the recall such as a newspaper advertisement together with the duration and timing of such announcements provide procedures to be adopted by the supplier in relation to the defective goods and estimate the time frame expected to remedy the defect the supplier has a further obligation to notify the consumer protection department with a report within 30 days from initiation of the recall which must set out the following information the quantity of the goods recalled in the uae the number of recalled goods either repaired in which case providing details of the defective parts repaired replaced or returned for a full refund and the procedures to be adopted to avoid the defect arising where possible the advertisement in local uae newspapers is also quite prescriptive in that it must not be less than 15cm by 15cm in size and must contain the following information the name and address of the supplier the name of the goods and the country of origin a description of the defect the trademark of the goods instructions which consumers should follow to avoid harm and instructions which consumers should follow to have the goods repaired or replaced or to have the price of the goods refunded the responsibility to notify the authorities and consumer will lie with both the manufacturer and the distributor but it is the distributor that will be found liable for any failure to do so penalties for non compliance in connection with product recall rules include a fine of a minimum of 1 000 dirhams with no maximum financial penalty stipulated and referral to the public prosecutor for possible prosecution for commercial fraud which may result in a prison sentence of up to two years presumably for the manager of the establishment being prosecuted product liability and recall describe the significance of product liability law and any key issues specifically relevant to the automotive industry how relevant are class actions or other consumer litigation in product liability product recall cases or other contexts relating to the automotive industry there are no specific product liability laws or regulations which exclusively apply to the automotive industry in the uae we have therefore set out below the general principles that apply in relation to consumer litigation in product liability and product recalls question 7 contains information relevant to sanctions a distributor may face for failure to comply with product recall laws a consumer can make a claim against a manufacturer or an importer under the uae civil code if any products are defective and such defects are not covered by a warranty or if the products do not fit their descriptions distributors can also be sued for misrepresentation in such cases additionally consumers can bring claims for breach of contract against distributors under the commercial transactions law no 18 of 1993 if any vehicles are not fit for purpose in cases of gross cheating the consumer can have the entire contract with the distributor invalidated as a general rule courts in the uae only award damages for direct losses class actions do not yet exist in the uae and are unlikely to be introduced in the near future when claims are brought by consumers against distributors or importers vehicle manufacturers may be required under the supply contract to indemnify such parties for the cost of remedying the defects in vehicles or spare parts disputes competition enforcement what competition and antitrust issues are specific to or particularly relevant for the automotive industry is follow on litigation significant in competition cases general principles of competition law under the uae federal competition law no 4 of 2012 are applicable to the automotive industry in the uae for example geographic division of markets and agreements between competitors to avoid soliciting each other s customers are considered to be anticompetitive it is therefore unlawful for example for automotive distributors to allocate territories between them and agree not to market products in the territories allocated to the other distributor similarly abuse of a dominant position by a distributor or manufacturer or any agreements between competitors aimed at reducing competition in the market such as collusion in bids and tenders or agreements on the terms and conditions for goods and services will likely be prohibited under the uae competition law consumers who are affected by anticompetitive agreements or conduct can complain to the moe the potential for follow on litigation is currently unclear on the basis that it is largely untested but a finding anticompetitive behaviour will have a negative impact on the business of both the manufacturer and the distributor in addition to resulting in potential criminal sanctions and fines ranging between 50 000 and 5 million dirhams for either abusing a dominant position or entering into an agreement that restricts competition in the uae notwithstanding the information above the federal competition law no 4 of 2012 is stated to be subject to further regulations some of which have not yet been published the competition law of the uae has therefore not been completely implemented and it is uncertain and unclear how the courts will enforce competition law principles in the uae dispute resolution mechanisms what kind of disputes have been experienced in the automotive industry and how are they usually resolved are there any quick solutions along the supply chain available according to an article published in august 2016 by gulf news based on statistics provided by the department of economic development the automotive sector accounted for 2 430 consumer complaints recorded in the uae during the first half of 2016 seventy three per cent of the disputes related to non compliance with the terms of sales or service agreements refunds or defective products the terms and conditions of vehicle warranty insurance and sales and service agreements constitute most of the disputes in the automotive industry several manufacturers and distributors are in the process of setting up bilingual customer care counters in their showrooms to comply with the standards set by the department of economic development to offer solutions and accelerate the customer satisfaction process and resolve disputes with customers prior to the commencement of litigation disputes between automotive manufacturers and their distributors are relatively rare in the uae because of the difficulty a manufacturer would have in terminating such a relationship as detailed in question 4 it is recommended that manufacturers ensure that they include arbitration provisions in their agreements that state that an arbitrator s award is final and binding however in practical terms due to the protected nature of uae distributors under the federal commercial agencies law no 18 of 1981 enforcement of an arbitral award in court may prove to be difficult injunctive relief is not typically available in the uae it is in the manufacturer s interests to resolve any problems with the distributor amicably rather than attempting to terminate the distribution agreement prior to the end of its term as the manufacturer will find such termination process difficult and time consuming more importantly the automotive manufacturer will be unable to sell any products in the region without having an appointed local distributor distressed suppliers what is the process for dealing with distressed suppliers in the automotive industry in practice the distributor and the automotive manufacturer may seek to reach an agreement in order to extend the supply period by offering discounts to the distributor or shipping certain products free of charge in order to reduce damage caused to the distributor and to avoid complaints from customers ultimately the parties are reliant upon each other such that neither the automotive manufacturer nor the distributor is capable of selling products in the uae without the other party s support it is therefore in each of their best interests to support the other party during periods of distress intellectual property disputes are intellectual property disputes significant in the automotive industry if so how effectively is industrial intellectual property protected are intellectual property disputes easily resolved intellectual property disputes between automotive manufacturers tend to commence in international markets and are simply reflected in the uae rather than originating in the uae disputes between distributors in the uae are rare and have not historically related to intellectual property the principal intellectual property issues for automotive manufacturers and distributors in the uae typically relate to branded counterfeit spare parts being imported or exported by non authorised distributors and sold to consumers which can potentially lead to safety concerns in addition to causing losses to the authorised distributors which sell genuine but often more expensive spare parts to resolve this issue a key consideration for automotive manufacturers and distributors will be how to efficiently implement anti counterfeiting measures in the uae such a process is likely to require extensive communication with customs authorities and the police in order to effectively implement such measures employment issues trade unions and work councils are there specific employment issues that automotive companies should be aware of such as with trade unions and works councils employment law in the uae is relatively basic compared to that in certain other jurisdictions by way of example trade unions and works councils are not permitted in the uae employees are hired under employment contracts which may be permanent or fixed to a specific period of time all employment agreements in the uae must comply with federal law no 8 of 1980 the labour law and associated regulations and ministerial decisions most employment contracts can be terminated on one month s notice unless otherwise agreed between the employer and the employee on termination of an employment contract an end of service gratuity may be payable to the employee as further detailed below under the labour law any employee who has completed at least one year of continuous service is entitled to an end of service gratuity payment that amounts to 21 days remuneration for each year of service for his or her first five years of service and 30 days remuneration for each additional year of service provided that the aggregate amount of the end of service does not exceed two years remuneration for further information on employment laws in various jurisdictions including the gulf region see hogan lovells dedicated employment law portal at new technologies legal developments what are the most important legal developments relating to automotive technological and mobility advances esma has prepared draft standards applicable to electric and hybrid vehicles being imported into the uae and these standards have been provided to the gso for consideration as the gso is also seeking to develop standards in connection with these vehicles the standards are still in draft form at the time of writing and we have not been able to review copies of them it will be important for cooperation between the gso and the local standards bodies in each gcc county such as esma in the uae to ensure that the final standards produced by each authority are aligned and automotive manufacturers are not required to make modifications to vehicles for each of the gcc countries it will also be important for these standards to be substantially similar to those used in other significant markets such as the united states in order to incentivise manufacturers to export their electric and hybrid vehicles to gcc countries in mass quantities uncertainty in the standards could potentially cause problems in the licensing of such vehicles as well as inconsistency of product quality therefore frustrating the objectives of standardisation and objective to create a sustainable electric and hybrid market in the uae the dubai green mobility initiative was established in 2015 by the supreme council of energy as a strategy to achieve sustainable development and to create a low carbon economy by promoting the use of hybrid cars and electric vehicles in dubai in addition vision 2021 was launched by his highness sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum the prime minister of the uae and the ruler of dubai one of the pillars of the vision 2021 project is to create a sustainable environment and infrastructure measured by a number of key performance indicators including a targeted air quality index of 90 per cent and an increase in clean energy contribution by 2021 regulations and standards in relation to connected and automated driving vehicles are still under development at the time of writing but it is expected that the uae will continue to be progressive with its legal framework to enable such vehicles to enter the market in the uae
